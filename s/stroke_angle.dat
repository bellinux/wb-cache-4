Experiments were performed {{with a pair}} of hinged rectangular plates that were rotated symmetrically in a static fluid, and defocusing digital particle image velocimetry was employed to measure the three-dimensional flow field. Single-plate cases were also studied to compare with clapping plate cases. As AR decreases, both circulation of the tip vortex and area enclosed by the vortex loop increase inversely. An empirical power-law relationship with a negative exponent is found between total impulse and AR for a given <b>stroke</b> <b>angle.</b> The sensitivity of the force generated by the plates to the change of AR is larger at the smaller <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> because of faster acceleration and deceleration.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{controlled}} flight of fruitflies after voluntary takeoff is studied. Wing and body kinematics of the insects after takeoff are measured using high-speed video techniques, and the aerodynamic force and moment are calculated by the {{computational fluid dynamics}} method {{based on the measured}} data.

A fruit-fly has a large pitch-up angular velocity owing to the takeoff jump and the fly controls its body attitude by producing pitching moments. It is found that the pitching moment is produced by changes in both the aerodynamic force and the moment arm. The change in the aerodynamic force is mainly due to the change in angle of attack. The change in the moment arm is mainly due to the change in the mean <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> and deviation angle, and the deviation angle plays a more important role than the mean <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> in changing the moment arm (note that change in deviation angle implies variation in the position of the aerodynamic stroke plane with respect to the anatomical stroke plane).

Swimming and flying animals have recently been shown to cruise at Strouhal numbers (St) corresponding to a regime of vortex growth and shedding in which the propulsive efficiency of flapping foils peaks (St approximately fA/U, where f is wingbeat frequency, U is cruising speed and A approximately bsin(theta/ 2) is stroke amplitude, in which b is wingspan and theta is <b>stroke</b> <b>angle).</b> We show that St is a simple and accurate predictor of wingbeat frequency in birds.

Intervention: Participants propelled on a motor-driven treadmill for 2 conditions (level and slope of 3 °) at a constant speed of 0. 9 m/s while using in turn a sling backrest fixed at 40. 6 cm (16 in) high (high backrest) and a lower height set at 50 % trunk length (low backrest). Main Outcome Measures: Cadence, <b>stroke</b> <b>angle,</b> peak shoulder extension angle, shoulder flexion/extension range of motion, and mechanical effective force. Results: Pushing with the low backrest height enabled greater range of shoulder motion (P <. 01), increased <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> (P <. 01), push time (P <. 01), and reduced cadence (P=. 01) {{regardless of whether the}} treadmill was level or sloped.

40|$|We propose an {{oscillation}} {{system to}} replicate the dynamic behavior of flapping wings, inspired by insect flight muscles. In particular, we study the flight of the fruit fly Drosophila virilis. We model the wing as a rigid body with three degree-of-freedom, described by three Euler angles: the <b>stroke</b> <b>angle,</b> the rotation angle and the deviation angle. Insect flight muscles are separated into two types: power muscles and control muscles. One actuator and one torsional spring at the <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> act as the power muscles. Two torsional springs at the rotation angle and the deviation angle mimic the control muscles. A dynamic model, using a blade-element model and a quasi-steady model to calculate aerodynamic forces and moments, is set up for analysis of the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Using non-dimensional analysis, {{we are able to}} identify the dynamic behavior of the system through four coefficients: stroke stiffness coefficient, rotation stiffness coefficient, deviation stiffness coefficient and input torque coefficient. We use the dynamic model to explore a large coefficients space of the oscillation system. We find that tuning deviation stiffness coefficient and rotation stiffness coefficient generates four different types of wing trajectories. Among them, the one with a high deviation stiffness coefficient and a mediate rotation stiffness coefficient produces high lift and high power loading. Its wing trajectory is quite similar to the wing trajectory in actual insects. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization algorithm (a genetic algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm) is implemented to find the optimal stiffness coefficients. Through these coefficients, the system minimizes power loading while still providing enough lift to maintain a time-averaged constant altitude over one stroke cycle. The results of this optimization indicate that the flapping wing with nonzero deviation achieves a better aerodynamic performance than the wing with zero deviation. The oscillatory property of this system does not only explain how insects use flight muscles to tune wing kinematics, but it also allows for design simplifications of the wing driving mechanism of flapping micro air vehicles. ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of drag-based paddling propulsion are studied {{with a simple}} mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter {{in the relationship between}} vortex formation and thrust generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden stroke motions, which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion.

Our physical model is largely based upon the model proposed by Alexander [Alexan-der, F. H.

40|$|Three-dimensional vortex {{formation}} and propulsive performance were studied experimentally to identify {{some of the}} main characteristic mechanisms of flapping locomotion. Mechanical models with thin plates were used to simulate flapping and translating motions of animal propulsors. Three-dimensional flow fields were mapped quantitatively using defocusing digital particle image velocimetry. First, vortex structures made by impulsively translating low aspect-ratio plates were studied. The investigation of translating plates with a 90 degree angle of attack is important since it is a fundamental model for a better understanding of drag-based propulsion systems. Rectangular flat-rigid, flexible, and curved-rigid thin plastic plates with the same aspect ratio were used to compare their vortex structures and hydrodynamic forces. The interaction of the tip flow and the nearby vortex is a critical flow phenomenon to distinguish vortex patterns among these three cases. In the flexible plate case, slow development of the vortex structure causes a small initial peak in hydrodynamic force during the acceleration phase. However, after the initial peak, the flexible plate generates large force magnitude comparable to that of the flat-rigid plate case. Drag-based paddling propulsion was also studied to explain some of the fundamental differences in vortex formation of lift-based and drag-based propulsions. While the temporal change of the inner area enclosed by the vortex loop {{is an important factor in}} thrust generation of lift-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength becomes more important in drag-based propulsion. Spanwise flow behind the paddling plate plays an important role in tip vortex motion and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow depends on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared to a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, the spanwise flow is not as strong as that of the high Reynolds number case. The flexible propulsor can smooth out force peaks during impulsive motions without sacrificing total impulse, which is advantageous in avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. The role of the stopping vortex was addressed in optimizing a <b>stroke</b> <b>angle</b> of paddling animals. In addition, vortex formation of clapping propulsion was investigated by varying aspect ratio and <b>stroke</b> <b>angle.</b> A low aspect-ratio propulsor produces larger total impulse than a high aspect-ratio propulsor. As the aspect ratio increases, circulation of the vortex is strengthened, and the inner area enclosed by the vortex structure tends to enlarge. Moreover, in terms of thrust, the advantage of a single plate over double clapping plates is larger for the lower aspect-ratio case. These results offer information to better understand the benefit of low aspect-ratio wings in force generation under specific locomotion modes. When a pair of plates claps, a vortex loop forms from two counter-rotating tip vortices by a reconnection process. The dynamics of wake structures are dependent on the aspect ratio and the <b>stroke</b> <b>angle.</b> Vortex {{formation and}} vorticity transport processes of translating and rotating plates with a 45 degree angle of attack were investigated as well. In both translating and rotating cases, the spanwise flow over the plate and the vorticity tilting process inside the leading-edge vortex were observed. The distribution of spanwise flow is a prominent distinction between the vortex structures of these two cases. While spanwise flow is confined inside the leading-edge vortex for the translating case, it is widely present over the plate and the wake region of the rotating case. As the Reynolds number decreases, due to the increase in viscosity, leading-edge and tip vortices tend to spread inside the area swept by the rotating plate, which results in lower lift force generation. Lastly, for translating motion, the dynamics of the vortex in corner regions was compared among three different corner shapes. For a large corner angle, the forward movement of the vortex tends to be uniform along the plate edges. However, for a small corner angle, the vortex close to the corner moves forward following the plate while the vortex away from the corner retards its forward movement...|$|E

It uses inverse kinematics since this method allows obtaining analytical calculus formulas for the movement of paddles in their two moments of motion: active and passive strokes. Movement of the paddles while following an arc-shaped trajectory outlining a sphere-like quadrilateral requires different values of amplitude of angular displacement of the paddles according both to anthropometrical values of the athlete and to his physical and technical training. The numerical application is made for several values of these angles which define the arcs of the circle for active and passive curves and for the moments between the two <b>strokes</b> (<b>angle</b> of the paddle while slicing in and out the water). These amplitudes of angular displacement are being considered, {{from the point of view}} of the horizontal component, equal to the speed of the skiff while imposing the linear speed of the paddle, and they would help determining movement frequencies of the paddle while following the sphere-like quadrilateral trajectory.

The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust <b>stroke</b> the <b>angle</b> of the connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|R
5000|$|Old-style {{faces are}} sub-divided into Venetian (or humanist) and Garalde (or Aldine), a {{division}} {{made on the}} Vox-ATypI classification system. Venetian types tend to feature an [...] "e" [...] where the cross <b>stroke</b> is <b>angled,</b> not horizontal, and a slightly more irregular design, following the work of Nicolas Jenson; they tended to be superseded by later Garaldes, which proved the foundation for all succeeding styles listed below. Nonetheless, {{some have argued that}} the difference is hard to spot except to specialists, and that in any case the subdivision makes little sense for modern typefaces such as Arno, which may fuse both styles.|$|R
