To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening {{as a part of}} the <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill</b> signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012.

5|$|In August1998, {{the station}} {{building}} was leased to Amtrak for 99years by the borough of Elizabethtown for $1 per year after ownership {{was transferred to}} the borough; ownership of the platforms and right-of-way was retained by Amtrak. Renovations began in August2009 and were funded by $9.3million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The station was cited by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn as an example of pork barrel spending in the <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill.</b> Elevators were built and the station's two platforms were raised, per the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The platforms were also lengthened to accommodate longer trains. Canopies were erected over the platforms to provide protection from the elements for waiting passengers. The station building was completely remodeled, including restoration of the original wood furnishings, replacement of broken slate roof tiles, and masonry repointing. The completed station was unveiled in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill</b> signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E

25|$|On June 18, 2009, Miller {{requested}} {{federal funding}} from the Harper government's $12-billion stimulus spending, for new streetcars in the Transit City initiative. The city faced a deadline of June 27, 2009 to commit to the $1.2-billion deal signed with Bombardier for the 204 streetcars. To {{put pressure on the}} Harper government to come up with its one-third share of the cost, Miller and Premier Dalton McGuinty made an announcement in Thunder Bay to fund the new streetcars. However, federal Transport Minister John Baird rejected the request outright. Baird stated that streetcar funding clearly failed to meet the <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill's</b> requirement that the funds would have to be spent in 2 years, as that was meant to put money into the economy quickly to buoy demand and staving off deflation, while Transit City would have been a long-term project. Also the stimulus required funds to be spent on infrastructure in the municipality where the application is granted to create local employment, whereas the jobs created by building streetcars would be in Thunder Bay and not Toronto. Baird noted that Toronto was the only one out of 2,700 applicants that didn't meet the eligibility criteria.|$|R

2500|$|In January 2009, as the Obama Administration {{tried to}} pass an {{economic}} <b>stimulus</b> spending <b>bill,</b> Representative Peter DeFazio (D-OR.) criticized Summers, saying {{that he thought that}} President Barack Obama is [...] "ill-advised by Larry Summers. Larry Summers hates infrastructure." [...] DeFazio, along with liberal economists including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, had argued that more of the stimulus should be spent on infrastructure, while Summers had supported tax cuts. In late 2008, Summers and economic advisors for then-President-elect Obama presented a memo with options for an economic stimulus package ranging from $550 billion to $900 billion. According to The New Republic, economic advisor Christina Romer initially recommended a $1.8-trillion package, which proposal Summers quickly rejected, believing any stimulus approaching $1 trillion would not pass through Congress. Romer revised her recommendation to $1.2 trillion, which Summers agreed to include in the memo, but Summers struck the figure at the last minute.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the thoughts on current economic crisis in works of Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz. It starts with an overview of their current criticisms and comments on the deregulatory policies {{that took place in}} the U.

Thesis continues with identification of these issues in works of both economists and links them to their previous works. I argue, that many of these issues have been identified long before the crisis and could be dealt with in time by proper regulatory measures. The last chapter contains several thoughts on issues I believe represent a more general layer of what lead to the current economic crisis...|$|R

25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill,</b> the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of Title V of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts on Americans living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its unconstitutionality, particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high implementation costs and lack of revenue generation.

The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second <b>stimulus</b> <b>bill</b> passed.

For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgage due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013.

In contrast to Bill Clinton's 1993 plan to reform health care, Obama adopted a strategy of letting Congress drive the process, with the House and Senate writing their own bills. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of Senators on the Finance Committee known as the Gang of Six began meeting {{with the hope of}} creating a bipartisan healthcare reform bill, though the Republican Senators involved with the crafting of the bill ultimately came to oppose it. In November 2009, the House passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act on a 220-215 vote, with only one Republican voting for the bill. In December 2009, the Senate passed its own health care reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA), on a party-line, 60-39 vote. Both bills expanded Medicaid and provided health care subsidies, while establishing an individual mandate, health insurance exchanges, and a ban on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. However, the House bill included a tax increase on families making more than $1 million per year and a public health insurance option, while the Senate plan included an excise tax on high-cost health plans.|$|E
