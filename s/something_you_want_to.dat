I borrowed 400 bucks from my parents {{in order to make the}} thing happen". The songs were [...] "mixed gutsy guitar riffs, breakneck tempos, punk attitude and youthful exuberance in equal measure," [...] according to Ian McFarlane. McFarlane also claimed that, [...] "The Fun Things issued what has emerged as one of the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk rock era, the Fun Things EP which came in a pressing of only 500 copies." [...] In 2000 the EP was re-released on Pennimann Records from Spain. Some of the tracks in the past had been subject to bootlegging from outside Australia.|$|R

It is thematically divided into two sides: the rock music of Saturday Nights and the more country-influenced Sunday Mornings. Vocalist and lyricist Adam Duritz states that the album [...] "is about really wanting to mean something and failing to do it.

We wanted to capture real acoustics rather than have everything computer simulated. A lot of keyboards can sound very bland so {{you have to look at}} recording them in a different way. We wanted to have a gritty edge to it. We got a PA and set it up in a church, a really huge church in Stratford, east London, just beside a huge traffic island, so we had to do it late at night when there was no traffic! We had the keyboards coming out of the PA and the microphones at the other end of the church. It created a very interesting atmosphere..." ...|$|E

It's that pop culture thing again, where people don't care about {{anything}} but the superficial, and I think there's something so tragic about that. I also thought there was something so ironically anthemic about the chorus, where it's not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sing along to, because it's vacuous and empty. So I wanted something really anthemic underneath it, like something you'd hear at sports games or whatever, because I wanted people to hear it and be confronted with how empty that is. I didn't want anything to be superficial on this record unless the point was to point out superficiality."

5000|$|Bonet is {{believed}} to have had a tense relationship with both Cosby and the shows producers throughout most of her time on the series; their dispute first became public in 1987. According to Kara Kovalchik of Mental Floss, Bonets alleged unprofessionalism consistently aggravated Cosby, reportedly being constantly argumentative on set, late for tapings and sometimes neglecting to attend tapings altogether. Bonet first expressed interest in pursuing a career as a dramatic film actress midway through the shows first season, originally intending to leave the series after only two years. Aged 19 at the time, she decided to make her film debut as Epiphany Proudfoot in the controversial horror film Angel Heart (1987), a role that required Bonet to film a sex scene with actor Mickey Rorke. By this time, Denise had already become the shows most popular character, while Bonets fame increased exponentially when the film was initially assigned an X rating for its graphic content. Although her role shocked several of Bonets fans and Cosby himself, Cosby claims that he did not mind the actress decision to appear in the film, explaining to her [...] "Listen, if this is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, fine. You have my blessings", and maintaining that he and Bonet have a good relationship in which he would have voiced his disapproval if he had felt otherwise. Bonet confirmed that she sought Cosbys advice when she was first offered the role because [...] "hes a generous enough man to see beyond The Cosby Show and to see my career as what it is and what it could be". Despite granting her his approval, Cosby refused to see the film. The shows producers and NBC executives declined to comment on Bonets decision, citing [...] "what Bonet did off the Cosby set was her business."Tensions increased between Bonet and Cosby when the actress posed nude for Interview and Rolling Stone magazines to promote Angel Heart. Bonet insisted [...] "I was not concerned with how Denise was going to feel ... Nor was I looking to destroy her reputation. Instead, I felt obligated to my career and my (freedom of) artistic choice." [...] After hearing that the photograph was generating a lot of negative feedback and press, Cosby purchased a copy of Interview himself and claims that, upon seeing Bonets photographs for the first time, he felt [...] "Theres nothing wrong with it ... Lisa has matured due to the immediacy of her responsibilities ... I think that she is doing magnificently well for someone her age doing and making decisions on her own, and she is deeply loved in my heart". The media continued to circulate Bonets photographs heavily, which {{is believed}} to have instigated a highly publicized dispute between the actress and Cosby {{towards the end of the}} 1980s. Cosby expressed concern over how the photographs would affect The Cosby Shows younger audience and Bonets younger cast mates. After Bonet threatened to sue The Cosby Show, a compromise was reached when Cosby decided to provide Bonet with her own television series, a spin-off of The Cosby Show entitled A Different World. The network agreed that Bonet was ready to star in her own series, a revelation by which she was surprised.|$|E
