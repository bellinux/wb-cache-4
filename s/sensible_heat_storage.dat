50|$|Initially, solid-liquid PCMs {{behave like}} <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> (SHS) materials; their {{temperature}} rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature {{at which they}} change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat. A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190 °C. Within the human comfort range between 20-30 °C, some PCMs are very effective. They store 5 to 14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water, masonry or rock.|$|E

The working temperature range of these materials is limited below 500 °C. There {{is not yet a}} solution for <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> at high temperature. This paper aimed to investigate alkali polyphosphates ((MPO 3) n, with M = Li, Na or K) as new promising materials for <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> at high temperature. Alkali polyphosphates could be formed by dehydration of monoalkali dihydrogenphosphates (MH 2 PO 4, with M = Li, Na or K), which occurs below 400 °C. Alkali polyphosphates resulted from this dehydration melted at 628, 657 and 812 °C for sodium, lithium and potassium polyphosphate, respectively. All these liquids evaporated above 900 °C but no destruction of their chemical structure was recorded. Sodium polyphosphate seemed to be the most promising material for <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> at high temperature because of its large potential working temperature (628 – 900 °C), its availability and its low cost compared to lithium and potassium polyphosphates.

The suitability of 1400 high-rise public housing blocks in Hong Kong for rooftop greening was assessed by remote sensing images.

Roof greening prevented a huge amount of solar energy at 43. 9 TJ in one summer from penetrating the buildings to bring significant energy saving. Thermal performance of humid-tropical green roofs, with greater latent heat dissipation, is twice more effective than the temperate ones. The energy balance model shows that solar energy absorption by bare and green roofs depends on shortwave rather than longwave radiation. Heat flux into a building indicates a one-day time lag after a sunshine day.

40|$|Storage systems {{based on}} Phase Change Materials (PCMs) with solid-liquid phase {{transition}} {{are considered to}} be an efficient alternative to sensible thermal storage systems. From an energy efficiency point of view, PCM storage systems have the advantage that they operate with a small temperature difference between charging and discharging. Furthermore, these storages have high energy densities compared to <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> assuming such energy efficient operation. However, there are heat transfer limitations on the storage design due to the low thermal conductivity of PCMs. These limitations lead to a low charging and discharging power of the storage. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the heat transfer of the poorly conducting PCMs, such as additional fin structures or dispersed particles with a high thermal conductivity, as well as microencapsulated PCMs [Zalba 2003]. Another major approach is the use of composite latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> materials (CLHSM).

From an energy efficiency point of view, PCM storage systems have the advantage that they operate with a small temperature difference between charging and discharging of the storage. Also, these storage systems have high energy densities compared to <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storages</b> assuming such energy efficient operation. PCMs considered for temperatures between 100 and 300 °C are mainly anhydrous salts. Applications include industrial process heat utilisation and solar power generation using direct steam technology. However, there are heat transfer limitations on the storage design due to the low thermal conductivity of the salts. Major approaches to overcome this inadequate heat transfer are the enlargement of the heat exchanger surface {{or the use of}} composite latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> materials (CLHSM). This work selects the latter, where the properties of the high latent heat of the PCM and the good thermal conductivity of graphite are combined. As a PCM, this work uses the equimolar composition of potassium nitrate (KNO 3) and sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) with a melting temperature of about 220 °C. There is a variety of potential preparation routes for CLHSM and these processes have a decisive impact on the interconnectivity of the graphite. Generally a highly interconnected graphite matrix is desirable in order to achieve a high effective thermal conductivity. We present in this paper the preparation of CLHSM from graphite and the eutectic KNO 3 -NaNO 3 by the compression and the infiltration route using natural graphite flakes, ground expanded graphite particles and compressed expanded graphite plates. This results in composites with a different level of interconnectivity of the graphite. The composites are characterized in terms of their effective thermal conductivity as a function of temperature using the laser-flash method.

Thermochemical energy storage has been shown to have higher storage capacities than sensible and latent storage for dehumidifying applications and does not require insulation like <b>sensible</b> and latent <b>heating</b> do. <b>Sensible</b> <b>heating</b> is focused on maintaining an increased temperature of a storage medium while latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is focused on maintaining a phase of the storage material. Both <b>sensible</b> and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> have been shown to have lower storage capacities for the purposes of air cooling when compared to thermochemical energy storage, which allows for the conversion of heat energy to thermochemical energy. Liquid desiccants utilize heat in an endothermic reaction to concentrate the solution and create chemical bonds, resulting in a chemical potential that can later be released as heat with the addition of water or used to absorb water vapor with heat as the by product. Due {{to the fact that the}} energy is stored as a chemical potential, heat loss is minimal and insulation is not needed to store the majority of invested energy as much as other energy storage methods. However, current liquid desiccant energy storage systems focus on the dehumidification and cooling properties of desiccant materials and such systems face problems with desiccant carryover, corrosion, and are often expensive. This paper looks at using calcium chloride as a desiccant material to reduce costs, and examines the use of liquid desiccants for heating rather than cooling purposes. A test heat exchanger was built to evaluate the feasibility of heat extraction upon water addition and compare it to the theoretical prediction. A basic shell and tube heat exchanger was constructed, using copper piping, a plastic bin, a peristaltic pump and flexible hosing.

A one-dimensional unsteady model is developed using the modified lumped capacitance method for a solid cylindrical heat storage unit. A modular charging/discharging control strategy is proposed to improve utilization of the solid storage material. The control strategy of modular charging/discharging using two modules could increase the storage material utilization from 33. 4 % to 38 %...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{is a key}} {{technology}} for reduced cost solar thermal power generation. This high-temperature application requires storage operation above 100 °C. Possible options are sensible, latent and t hermochemical heat storages. A combination of sensible and latent heat storage seems a promising option for thermal energy storage with an increased specific heat capacity. Salt mixtures with a melting range {{as opposed to a}} melting point combine the effects of both latent and <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> These provide the possibility of utilising not only latent but in addition sensible heat during the melting and solidification process. The present paper focuses on a binary mixture of 30 wt. -...|$|E
40|$|The {{heat storage}} unit is an {{important}} factor in determining the technical performance specific to a solar installation used in warm water producing on in space heating. The practical solutions used at present are economically based on short-time storage unit. Most installations have water <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> For most small and mean installations, the calculus is based on two operational hypotheses of the heat storage unit: with perfect temperature stratification and with water uniform temperature. Both calculus models are limit cases, so they are not realistic. This paper introduces a calculus method based on the thermal response of the heat storage unit at impulsional excitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the physical processes of energy exchange between the water surface and atmosphere of Lake Huron in order to explain the processes behind such changes in long-term water levels and to monitor their spatial and temporal fluctuations. The lake surface water temperature and the four components of surface energy balance, including net radiation, latent <b>heat,</b> <b>sensible</b> <b>heat,</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>storage,</b> as well as evaporation rate, were estimated using the daily remotely sensed data from eleven years (2002 - 2012) with a multi-spatial resolution of 1 km to 5 km using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra satellite, together with in-situ measurements. The regression analysis of the entire lake daily mean water surface temperature revealed a positive trend of 0. 1 °C per year, indicating that the lake surface temperature increased by 1. 1 °C during the period 2002 - 2012. The warming rate was found to be greatest in the deepest areas of the lake, with a statistically-significant correlation between warming rate and depth. The four components of surface energy balance showed temporal and spatial heterogeneities. There were strong seasonal patterns for all of the components, which were very high in summer and low in winter for net radiation and <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> In contrast, the latent <b>heat</b> and <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> were very high in the winter and very low in the summer. Approximately 70 % of the annual mean 30 min evaporation occurred during the fall and winter seasons, whereas the lowest evaporation rate occurred in March, which was only 3 % of the annual mean of 30 min evaporation. There was an increase in the evaporation rate of approximately 1. 4 mm m- 2 over the 2005 - 2012 observation period, the water level decreased by 0. 04 m during the period 2002 - 2012, and there was a decrease in total water storage by 1. 18 cm during the entire study period (2004 - 2012). There was obviously a negative correlation between lake evaporation and lake water level and also total lake water storage. If the current evaporation trend continues, it can be assumed that the negative water level and total water storage trend will also continue...|$|R
40|$|Li-ion {{batteries}} are crucial components for progress in mobile communications and transport technologies. However, Li-ion batteries suffer from strong self-heating, which limits their life-time and creates reliability and environmental problems. Here {{we show that}} thermal management and the reliability of Li-ion batteries can be drastically improved using hybrid phase change material with graphene fillers. Conventional thermal management of batteries relies on the latent heat stored in the phase change material as its phase changes over a small temperature range, thereby reducing the temperature rise inside the battery. Incorporation of graphene to the hydrocarbon-based phase change material allows one to increase its thermal conductivity by more than two orders of magnitude while preserving its latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> ability. A combination of the <b>sensible</b> and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> together with the improved heat conduction outside of the battery pack leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the temperature rise inside a typical Li-ion battery pack. The described combined <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> - <b>heat</b> conduction approach can lead to a transformative change in thermal management of Li-ion and other types of batteries.

40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} systems (TES) have {{attracted}} increasing interest for thermal {{applications such as}} hot water, space heating and cooling. These systems are useful to correct the mismatch between the supply and demand of energy. There are mainly two types of thermal energy storage systems, <b>sensible</b> and latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage.</b> Latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> is particularly attractive due to its ability to provide a high energy storage density and its characteristics to store heat at a constant temperature corresponding to the phase transition temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> substance. Inorganic salt hydrates as latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> materials have certain advantages over organic materials. However, some problems occur when salt hydrates are used as phase change material (PCM) in the latent <b>heat</b> <b>storage</b> applications. These are supercooling of salt hydrates when they freeze because of their weak nucleation properties and phase separation occurring because of incongruent melting. In this study, Glauber’s salt (Na 2 SO 4. 10 H 2 O) is stabilized with different concentrations of polyacrylamide and gelatin gels to prevent incongruent melting. A nucleating agent, which resembles crystal structure of Glauber’s salt, was used to prevent supercooling. Thermal storage capacities of PCM samples which are stabilized with different concentrations of polymeric gels were determined both by DSC and temperature-history methods...|$|R
