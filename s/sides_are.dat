The plates themselves are broad. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The rotor of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperature}} of the asteroid belt varies with {{the distance from the}} Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface {{temperature of}} an asteroid can vary considerably as the <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs have rarely {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the two <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E

5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the battle, each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine. Both <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> known to have suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, {{no more than a}} few thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|E

Around the edge at the top, bottom and <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Patio F is on {{a terrace}} {{at the same}} level as Patios D and E. The patio is a closed {{courtyard}} formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure {{on the south side of}} the patio. A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E

5|$|Relatives of the Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{arise in}} the problem of finding the minimum perimeter shape that encloses a fixed amount of area and includes three specified points in the plane. For {{a wide range of}} choices of the area parameter, the optimal solution to this problem will be a curved triangle whose three <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> circular arcs with equal radii. In particular, when the three points are equidistant from each other and the area is that of the Reuleaux triangle, the Reuleaux triangle is the optimal enclosure.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders and Chiefs rivalry {{has only}} existed recently. In 2012 and 2013 the Chiefs {{defeated}} the Crusaders in the semi-final, 20-17 and 20-19 respectively. All matches {{between the two}} <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> characterised by high intensity matches and altercations throughout. The Chiefs have identified and recruited large amounts of talent from traditional Crusaders territory, causing more friction between the fan bases. In the 2017 semi-final, the Crusaders repaid the Chiefs in kind, defeating the Chiefs 27-13.|$|E

The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
