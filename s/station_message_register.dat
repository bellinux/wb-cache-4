50|$|In some {{corporate}} Private {{branch exchange}} (PBX) systems, a {{call detail record}} is termed a <b>station</b> <b>messaging</b> detail record (SMDR).|$|R
50|$|Automatic message {{accounting}} (AMA) provides detailed {{accounting for}} telephone calls. When {{direct distance dialing}} (DDD) {{was introduced in the}} US, <b>message</b> <b>registers</b> no longer sufficed for dialed telephone calls. The need to record the time and phone number of each long distance call was met by electromechanical data processing equipment.|$|R
50|$|A {{data record}} from a PBX or other {{telecommunication}} system {{that provides the}} statistics for a telephone call is usually termed a call detail record (CDR) or a <b>Station</b> <b>Messaging</b> Detail Record (SMDR).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{terms for}} call records include CDR (call detail records) or SMDR (<b>station</b> <b>message</b> detail recordings). These terms {{normally}} apply to [...] "raw call records" [...] {{before they have}} been processed to apply locations and rates.|$|R
50|$|In local AMA (LAMA) {{all this}} {{equipment}} was {{located at the}} Class 5 office. In this case, it also recorded the completion of local calls, thus obviating <b>message</b> <b>registers.</b> For detail billed calls, the punch recorded both calling and called numbers, as well as time of day. For message rate calls, only the calling number and time of day.|$|R
50|$|Subpart C details {{rules and}} {{regulations}} pertaining specifically {{to a number of}} special operating procedures, including auxiliary and repeater <b>stations,</b> <b>message</b> forwarding, communications between earth and space stations, telecommand and the transmission of coded telemetry data, and automatic station control.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the first}} two or three digits of the call were registered, the sender called in a decoder, which took the digits as input, and {{returned}} the District and Office brush and group locations for the sender. The decoder also determined the proper rate at which to operate the <b>message</b> <b>register</b> and gave this information to the sender, which set this rate for the call.|$|R
50|$|Register.com {{began to}} receive {{complaints}} from its customers regarding the advertisements. Register.com in turn complained to Verio, {{saying that the}} confusion was tarnishing its image with its customers. Verio continued to solicit the customers but stopped using Register’s name in the <b>messages.</b> <b>Register</b> reacted by changing the statement affixed to the WHOIS data to prohibit {{the use of the}} data for solicitation by direct mail, email, or phone.|$|R
50|$|American {{message unit}} {{counters}} generally had four digits, which sufficed {{because they were}} only used on local calls and most residential lines did not pay for local calls. Despite the arrival of subscriber trunk dialling (automatic long-distance dialing) in Europe, central offices there continued making and using <b>message</b> <b>registers</b> in the 1970s, designing ones that could register more than one click per second on a trunk call and display five or six digits.|$|R
30|$|The base <b>station</b> exchanges <b>messages</b> with L-sensors through H-sensors {{and vice}} versa.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the urban}} and {{commercial}} areas where Panel was first used had message rate service rather than flat rate calling. For this reason the line finder had, besides the tip and ring leads for talking and the sleeve lead for control, a fourth wire for the District circuit to send metering pulses to control the <b>message</b> <b>register.</b> The introduction of direct distance dialing (DDD) in the 1950s required the addition of automatic number identification equipment for centralized automatic message accounting.|$|R
5000|$|The first radio {{communications}} were {{started by the}} Italians in Mogadishu in 1911: the same Guglielmo Marconi supervised the radio <b>station</b> <b>messages</b> {{in the capital of}} Italian Somalia, that were the first in all Africa. Successively a public [...] "radio service" [...] was started (in Italian language) in 1938, but was limited to broadcast only in the area of Mogadishu-Genale-Villabbruzzi.|$|R
50|$|First, the Act {{establishes}} the Do Not Call Registers, on which telephone numbers may be registered. As of 30 April 2017, {{there are three}} Do Not Call Registers: (i) the No Fax Message Register; (ii) the No Text Message Register; and (iii) the No Voice Call Register. Generally, if a telephone number is listed on a Do Not Call Register (e.g. the No Text <b>Message</b> <b>Register),</b> then it is not permitted to send a marketing message of the relevant kind (e.g. text message) to that telephone number.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "heart" [...] of most Win32 {{applications}} is the WinMain (...) function, {{which calls}} GetMessage (...) in a loop. GetMessage (...) blocks until a message, or [...] "event", is received (with function PeekMessage (...) as a non-blocking alternative). After some optional processing, it will call DispatchMessage (...) , which dispatches {{the message to}} the relevant handler, also known as WindowProc. Normally, messages that have no special WindowProc (...) are dispatched to DefWindowProc, the default one. DispatchMessage (...) calls the WindowProc of the HWND handle of the <b>message</b> (<b>registered</b> with the RegisterClass (...) function).|$|R
40|$|TriVium CallAnalyst is an {{application}} that facilitates reporting, costing, and analyzing a customer’s phone system. It collects call {{records from the}} IP Office server via the SMDR (<b>Station</b> <b>Message</b> Detailed Record) log file. These Application Notes provide instructions for a configuration of TriVium CallAnalyst R 5. 51 and Avaya ™ IP Office server.

50|$|The {{criminal}} complaints later {{filed in}} various federal district courts allege that the Russian {{agents in the}} US passed information back to the SVR by messages hidden inside digital photographs, written in disappearing ink, ad hoc wireless networks, and shortwave radio transmissions, {{as well as by}} agents swapping identical bags while passing each other in the stairwell of a train <b>station.</b> <b>Messages</b> and materials were passed in such places as Grand Central Terminal and Central Park.|$|R

40|$|The D Machine is {{described}} as a small user microprogrammable computer designed to be a versatile building block for such diverse functions as: disk file controllers, I/O controllers, and emulators. TRANSLANG is an ALGOL-like language, which allows D Machine users to write microprograms in an English-like format as opposed to creating binary bit pattern maps. The TRANSLANG translator parses TRANSLANG programs into D Machine microinstruction bit patterns which can be executed on the D Machine simulator. In addition to simulation and translation, the two programs also offer several debugging tools, such as: a full set of diagnostic error <b>messages,</b> <b>register</b> dumps, simulated memory dumps, traces on instructions and groups of instructions, and breakpoints...|$|R

50|$|The name Cable Bay {{arose from}} New Zealand's first {{overseas}} cable link, to Australia, which was opened on 21 February 1876. The international telegraph cable established {{a connection with}} the world-wide telegraph network via Sydney. The cable came ashore into a timber building, continuing through a cedar-topped cable, a stone-cemented passage and underground to the cable house. From the cable <b>station,</b> <b>messages</b> were sent to Nelson via telegraph wire. This new service meant communications to Europe only took four days instead of {{up to six months}} for letters. With a population of about 30, the cable station was a self-contained village.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Regional AIS Application Specific <b>Message</b> <b>Register</b> is {{to provide}} {{awareness}} of what applications exist, facilitate harmonization, and promote proper binary messaging for regional applications. To be hosted on the IALA website, establishing the Register will be a 3 -step process: 1) Compile all existing AIS binaries into a Jcollection. K 2) Convert the JcollectionK into a Register. 3) Develop IALA guidance on best practices for creating and using AIS Binary Messages. Recommendations are provided in regard to: - Benefit of a web-based HTML user interface for input/output. - Use of XML to organize/format register applications in a consistent manner. - Having the collection/registration become a JloopK process. - Conforming to ISO standards to organize and manage the Register. - Benefit of a joint IMO-IALA register for both international and regional applications...|$|R

5000|$|Further, a {{consumer}} {{who does not}} wish to receive further prerecorded telemarketing calls can [...] "opt out" [...] of receiving such calls by dialing a telephone number (required to be provided in the prerecorded <b>message)</b> to <b>register</b> his or her do-not-call request. The provisions do not cover calls from political organizations or charities.|$|R
