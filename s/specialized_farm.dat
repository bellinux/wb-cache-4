Using around 9000 farm surveys across Africa, we explore how farmers choose one of the farm types and how the net revenue of each type varies across the range of climate in Africa. The results indicate that an integrated farm increases in number while a <b>specialized</b> <b>farm</b> decreases across Africa under climate predictions for 2060. The relative profitability of each system against each other also changes. An integrated farm becomes relatively more profitable over specialized farms half a century from now. The impacts of climate change on integrated farms range from 9 % loss to 27 % gain depending on climate scenarios.

40|$|Mixed farming {{systems have}} {{potential}} agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over <b>specialized</b> <b>farming</b> systems. This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. A mixed farming system at regional level {{is characterized by}} intensive cooperation between two or more <b>specialized</b> <b>farms,</b> each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such a mixed farming system might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a <b>specialized</b> arable <b>farm,</b> a <b>specialized</b> dairy <b>farm</b> and both combined into a mixed farming system, exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system was assessed in a qualitative way. In the mixed farming system, labour income per ha was 25 % higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The remaining 30 % resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both <b>specialized</b> <b>farms</b> {{and that of the}} mixed farming system were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system could not be found. It was concluded that in a mixed farming system, it is possible to realize a higher income without increasing environmental pollution.

40|$|Modern {{production}} agriculture {{is beginning to}} advance beyond deterministic, scheduled operations between relatively few people to larger scale, information-driven efficiency in order {{to respond to the}} challenges of field variability and meet the needs of a growing population. Since no two farms are the same with respect to information and management structure, a <b>specialized</b> <b>farm</b> management information system (FMIS) which is tailored to the realities on the ground of individual farms is likely to be more effective than generalized FMIS available today. ^ This thesis presents the design of a FMIS using proven user-centered design principles. This approach resulted {{in the creation of the}} OpenAgToolkit (OpenATK), and a suite of task-specific, collaborative Android apps. The OpenATK system architecture enabled apps to share data between apps on a device with shared local databases, and across devices on the farm using Trello application programming interface (API). Five Android apps, Rock App, Tillage App, Trello Sync App, Field Notebook App, and Planting App, were developed in the proposed architecture. Other apps such as the Anhydrous App, and Spraying App were discussed with respect to their role in the OpenATK FMIS. The OpenATK approach proved to be technically viable with current, consumer-grade technologies including free cloud storage, Wi-Fi, and task-specific, collaborative Android apps running on tablet devices. The Tillage and Trello Sync Apps were used to generate artificial records for one year on a 404 ha (1, 000 acre) farm to evaluate data storage needs. The total amount of data generated for the six field operations on the 13 fields was 260 kilobytes. ^ Four OpenATK Apps were evaluated individually by four evaluators using the personal interview procedure for interface usability. The heuristic evaluation method was an appropriate evaluation method for the goals of this project as it enabled the observer to easily identify two critical interface usability problems: the long-hold method to move rock marker icons on the map and the method to draw field boundaries. Solutions to improve the usability problems were proposed, and recommendations were given for future research. ...|$|E

Consideration was also given to the improvement of living conditions in the settlements. The objectives were to be achieved by introducing a number of original and adapted technologies and income-generating activities to the settlers, providing support services such as credit and marketing facilities and orienting the settlers and their families to their new agricultural and socio-economic conditions. The project succeeded in creating a self-sustained and dynamic agricultural extension approach throughout the Nobaria land reclamation scheme, consisting of group-action oriented training activities carried out by organized volunteer extension agents (VEAs). Fifty agricultural college graduate-settlers were trained in extension methodologies to conduct voluntary advisory activities; for example, 7 000 extension pamphlets were prepared, printed and distributed to the settlers. This success {{is based on the}} project's national workshop on the institutional and functional validity of the created extension system, in which agricultural extension leaders from various specialized institutions participated. The recommendations, of this workshop, which are the basis for the development and strengthening of extension in the settlement scheme, were submitted to the Deputy Prime Minister for agriculture and land reclamation. Furthermore, the project succeeded in establishing three `on-farm irrigation training/extension stations', equipping these stations with modern irrigation systems suitable for small farmers under desert conditions, introducing fertigation technologies and the required equipment, and training graduate settlers in the use of this equipment. Integrated plant and animal production was successfully demonstrated in the above-mentioned irrigation training/extension stations through orchard, vegetable and food and forage crop demonstration plots and livestock activities. It is recommended that the Government define national policies and strategies for the strengthening and monitoring and evaluation of the emerging voluntary and group-oriented agricultural extension system in the land settlement areas.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{fundamental}} challenge for which agriculture is sensitive and   vulnerable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified relevant information as key to enabling appropriate climate adaptation and mitigation action. Information specifically directed to farmers can be found, for example, in <b>specialized</b> <b>farming</b> magazines. While recent studies examine how national news media frame climate change, less —if any —studies have addressed climate framings and coverage in specialized media. Media framings are storylines that provide meaning by communicating how and why an issue {{should be seen as}} a problem, how it should be handled, and who is responsible for it. This paper analyses the framings and coverage of climate change in two Swedish <b>specialized</b> <b>farming</b> magazines from 2000 to 2009. It examines the extent of the climate change coverage, the content of the media items, and the dominant framings underlying their climate change coverage. The study identifies: increased coverage of climate change starting in 2007; frequent coverage of agriculture 's contribution to climate change, climate change impacts on agriculture, and consequences of climate politics for agriculture; and four prominent frames: conflict, scientific certainty, economic burden, and action. The paper concludes that climate change communicators addressing farmers and agricultural extension officers should pay attention to how these frames may be interpreted by different target audiences. Research is needed on how specialized media reports on climate-related issues and how science-based climate information is understood  by different groups of farmers and which other factors influence farmers’ engagement in climate mitigation and adaptation.
