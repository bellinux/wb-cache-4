5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General <b>Strike</b> <b>of</b> 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime <b>Strike</b> <b>of</b> 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia.

After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

5|$|Late in the afternoon, a Yorktown scout {{aircraft}} located Hiryū, prompting Enterprise {{to launch}} a final <b>strike</b> <b>of</b> 24 dive bombers (including 6 SBDs from VS-6, 4 SBDs from VB-6, and 14 SBDs from Yorktowns VB-3). Despite Hiryū being defended by a strong cover {{of more than a}} dozen Zero fighters, the attack by Enterprise and orphaned Yorktown aircraft launched from Enterprise was successful: four bombs (possibly five) hit Hiryū, leaving her ablaze and unable to operate aircraft. Hornets strike, launched late because of a communications error, concentrated on the remaining escort ships, but failed to score any hits.|$|E

Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
