5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> he wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> he regretted doing this by hijacking. He <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> {{all he wanted}} was {{to send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

County politicians in Akershus <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E

When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> it had fallen under a hard wind. The head of the Semarang Regency Council, Bambang Kusriyanto, <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> he had confirmed Kampoeng Rawa's management had applied for permission and called for the government to process the request expediently. In February 2015, President Joko Widodo called for the issuance of permits to be expedited, citing the site's potential to promote social empowerment.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 2004, NSB and SJ <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> {{they would}} {{discontinue}} Linx, and would operate the last train on 31 December 2004. The company {{had never made}} a profit, and the new low-cost airlines had reduced ridership by up to 40%. The {{only part of the}} service which was profitable was the service from Stockholm to Karlstad, which SJ intended to continue. NSB <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> if a new Oslo–Stockholm service was to be introduced, it would require state grants. In September, SJ's CEO Jan Forsberg <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> the problems lay with the infrastructure in Norway. While the speeds were high enough to operate with a profit in Sweden and to Copenhagen, the slow lines in Norway made services to Norway unprofitable. Linx had by then transported 1.3 million passengers, and Forsberg <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> had the company transported 1.7 million people, it would have been profitable.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Quale <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> the inspectorate {{should never}} have {{approved}} the trains. He <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> the Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology, a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} near a bankruptcy, {{and that they}} {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E

Fourth, he <b>states</b> <b>that</b> Iran is not an implacable enemy of the U.S. and should be engaged with. Fifth, he <b>states</b> <b>that</b> coalition forces in Iraq should undergo a careful, deliberate military disengagement rather than an immediate withdrawal or an extended military presence.|$|R

In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they would not consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they did not care. 25% <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E
