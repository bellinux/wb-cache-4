Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo <b>surface</b> <b>erosion</b> from wind or water.

Alfred Wainwright in his guidebook The Western Fells comments that the Wasdale Red Pike might be higher but is less suited to the name. Red Pike in Buttermere is given its rich red colouring by the presence of syenite in the rock and subsoil of the fell. This is particularly marked in places where <b>surface</b> <b>erosion</b> has occurred (notably the stony track by the side of Scale Force and the path from Bleaberry Tarn to the summit) and the red colouring of the paths can be seen from some distance.|$|E
500|$|The rapid thinning, {{acceleration}} and retreat of Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland, all in close association with one another, suggests a common triggering mechanism, such as enhanced surface melting due to regional climate warming or {{a change in}} forces at the glacier front. The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase {{and the release of}} meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations. The significant accelerations noted on the three largest glaciers began at the calving front and propagated inland and are not seasonal in nature. Thus, the primary source of outlet glacier acceleration widely observed on small and large calving glaciers in Greenland is driven by changes in dynamic forces at the glacier front, not enhanced meltwater lubrication. [...] This was termed the Jakobshavns Effect by Terence Hughes at the University of Maine in 1986. Indeed, a study published in 2015 on glacial underwater topography at 3 sites found cavities, due to warm subglacial water intrusion, which has been identified as a possible dominant force for ablation (<b>surface</b> <b>erosion).</b> Thus, suggests ocean temperature controls ice sheet surface runoff at specific sites. These findings also show that models underestimate the sensitivity of Greenland glaciers to ocean warming and resulting ice sheet runoff. Hence, without better modelling, new observations suggest that past projections of sea level rise attribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet require upward revision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next stage}} of the {{recovery}} work focused on high and moderate severity burn areas where there was {{an increased risk of}} runoff damage. [...] Special attention was given to preventing water pollution and soil degradation in the Metolius River watershed. [...] Forest Service crews removed fire debris from the banks of Abbot Creek, Bear Valley Creek, Bush Creek, Canyon Creek, Davis Creek, First Creek, Link Creek, and Jack Creek. [...] They also replaced a number of small culverts with larger ones. [...] This helped minimize drainage onto roads and ensured streams were able to accommodate increases flow from surface runoff. [...] This was especially critical in streams with native bull trout, which are a threatened species. [...] Crews also cleared forest recreation sites and hiking trails. [...] This included a project that improved drainage along [...] of the Pacific Crest Trail in order to reduce <b>surface</b> <b>erosion.</b> [...] Finally, the Forest Service posted 40 new signs warning visitors of post-fire hazards.|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>surface</b> <b>erosion</b> {{is easier}} to control than bulk erosion, <b>surface</b> <b>erosion</b> is {{preferred}} in drug delivery where {{the release of the}} drug must be constant or be controlled by changing the dimensions of the material. [...] A zero order release of a drug can be possible with <b>surface</b> <b>erosion</b> if a very thin material is used or if surface area is kept constant. <b>Surface</b> <b>erosion</b> is also useful for protecting water-soluble drugs until the time of desired drug release, because water will not penetrate through the polymer matrix and reach the drug until all the surrounding polymer has degraded. [...] However, bulk erosion can be useful in situations that do not require controlled release, such as plastic degradation.|$|E

METHODS:: Both hands of 167 SSc patients and 168 hands (82 right and 86 left) of age- and gender-matched controls were imaged by conventional radiograph. Two musculoskeletal radiologists semiquantitatively scored the following lesions: tuft acro-osteolysis, tuft calcinosis, joint space narrowings, marginal <b>erosions,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>erosions,</b> collapse arthropathies, periarticular calcifications, and juxta-articular osteoporosis, at the following areas: tufts, distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, carpal, and first carpometacarpal joints. Clinical and functional characteristics of the 167 SSc patients {{were obtained from the}} Belgian Systemic Sclerosis Cohort database. RESULTS:: Tuft acro-osteolysis and calcinosis were the most common findings observed in SSc patients and were almost absent in controls. SSc patients displaying tuft acro-osteolysis/calcinosis suffered from more severe disease. Arthropathies were infrequently detected and mainly consisted of a mixture of osteoarthritis-related changes (joint space narrowing and <b>surface</b> <b>erosions)</b> -also observed in controls-and of 2 types of rare SSc-associated arthropathies: a rheumatoid arthritis-like pattern, characterized by marginal erosions (n = 7 patients), and a collapse arthropathy (n = 6 patients), characterized by pressure erosions and joint subluxation.
