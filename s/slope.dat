5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several skiing competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The <b>slope</b> was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup participated in a competition that July after the <b>slope</b> was coated with borax. Skiing stopped until the 1960s, when a new <b>slope</b> was built, and competitions were held until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is flat, with a <b>slope</b> of 0 to 3 percent. There are {{two major}} lines of hills in the watershed, {{one of which is}} in the northern part and the other of which is in {{the central part of the}} watershed. These lines of hills have a <b>slope</b> of 3 to 8 percent. In both of the lines of hills, there are patches where the <b>slope</b> is 8 to 15 percent and in the northern line of hills, there is an area with a <b>slope</b> of over 15 percent.|$|E

The volcano is relatively unaffected by water erosion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several ski jumping competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The original <b>slope</b> was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the <b>slope</b> was coated with borax for a summer competition. Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new <b>slope</b> {{was built on the}} mountain, and the revived competitions continued until 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the dry ski <b>slope</b> near Park Road and the Uxbridge Lido {{was closed}} and the {{remaining}} buildings and structures removed. The Hillingdon Ski Centre had been subject to several arson attacks during 2001 and the company operating it became insolvent. The <b>slope,</b> which had been built in 1977, was left to return to nature.|$|E

5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, {{but there are}} areas in the county with <b>slopes</b> of 25% or greater.

Many of the county's steepest <b>slopes,</b> with grades of 25% of more, are located {{on the edges of}} the county. These <b>slopes</b> are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep <b>slopes</b> {{in the middle of the}} county. All four boroughs in the county have <b>slopes</b> with a grade of 25% or more near them. <b>Slopes</b> of 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|R

5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The <b>slope</b> for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in <b>slope</b> at 110 km. The <b>slope</b> for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in <b>slope</b> at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.|$|E

50|$|Weather on the {{mountain}} mostly comes from the Indian Ocean, {{to the east and}} south-east. Consequently, these <b>slopes</b> are wettest.

5|$|The South Island's southernmost point, <b>Slope</b> Point, {{projects}} {{near the}} southwestern {{corner of the}} Catlins. To the west of this lies Waipapa Point, often considered the boundary of the Catlins region, beyond which lies the swampy land around {{the mouth of the}} Mataura River at the eastern end of Toetoes Bay. But various people place the western boundary of the Catlins region in different places, and some more stringent definitions exclude even <b>Slope</b> Point. A proposed boundary circulated in 2009 by the New Zealand Geographic Board ran roughly north from <b>Slope</b> Point, then inland around the Catlins Ranges and east to Nugget Point. Tourist organisations objected, asking that the boundary be moved further west to include Fortrose.|$|E
