5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, <b>selective</b> <b>logging,</b> and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E

Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with <b>selective</b> <b>logging</b> resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

These forest areas are in the focus of REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, {{and the role of}} conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) projects, which require an accurate monitoring of their carbon stocks or aboveground biomass (AGB). Our study objective was to evaluate multi-temporal LiDAR measurements of a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo. Canopy height and AGB dynamics were quantified with a special focus on unaffected, <b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> and burned forests. More than 11, 000 ha were surveyed with airborne LiDAR in 2007 and 2011. In a first step, the comparability of these datasets was examined and canopy height models were created.

It was analyzed a set of nine scenes obtained as part of the mission conducted by CENSIPAM and identified as the Mission of Terra do Meio in 2006. This mission was realized in three parts, in different moments. Promising results were showed by SAR data for discriminating between natural and antropogenetic vegetation covers as well as between natural vegetation of Amazonia biome from phytophysiognomies of other biomes. It was not possible to discriminate primary and secondary vegetation covers or among the forest covers located in riverstreams, lowlands and highlands. The radar imagery also showed poor results in terms of identification of <b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> areas, mainly because of 3 -year time lag between field logging activities and airplane data acquisition.

In this research frequency and characteristics of large diameter trees (normal, rotten, and dead trees) with diameter at breast height greater than 60 cm were studied in two compartments (<b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> and protected) in Asalem-Nav forest. Random systematic sampling method with grid of 100 × 100 m and plot area of 0. 2 ha was used for data collection.

The height of rotten trees and dead trees in the protected compartment were greater than logged compartment (P < 0. 01). Thick trees of all three groups in the protected compartment were compounded from more species than logged compartment as well.

40|$|Aim of study: Quercus variabilis (Chinese cork oak) reproduces asexually and sexually. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the status and growth of asexual and sexual recruits of Q. variabilis in different forest recovery stages. Area of study: Three <b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> stands and one unlogged stand in Q. variabilis forest, Shaanxi Province, China. Material and Methods: Origin, number, basal diameter, height and size structure of Q. variabilis shoots (height ≤ 200 cm) were investigated in the plots of 5, 10, and 20 -years post-logging stands and unlogged stand. Effects of recovery stage on the density and growth of the three original recruits (stump sprouts, stem base sprouts and true seedlings) were analysis by One-way ANOVA. Main results: Sprouts dominated logged stands, whereas true seedlings dominated unlogged stand, stem base sprouts only existed in 20 -years post-logging and unlogged stands. Stump sprout density and sprout number per stump both declined with extended post-logging time. True seedlings density increased from 7 to 20 shoots/ 100 m 2 as the postlogging time extended, and peaked in unlogged stand (94 shoots/ 100 m 2). An ongoing size structure was observed in true seedlings in all stands. Stump sprouts were taller and greater than true seedlings. Research highlights: Stump sprouts contributed more to Q. variabilis forest recovery in the early stage after disturbance. The contribution of true seedlings was limited in the same stage, but they were beneficial for population long-term development. Stem base sprouts {{were most likely to}} be a survival strategy rather than a reproductive strategy. Key words: asexual reproduction; true seedling; post-logging time; Chinese cork oak. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} among the most species-diverse {{ecosystems}} on Earth. Their structures and ecological functions are complex to understand. Functional group is defined as a group of species that play similar roles in an ecosystem. The functional group approach has been regarded as an effective way of linking the compositions of complex ecosystems with their ecological functions. To understand the variation of functional groups in species-rich ecosystems after disturbance, the present study investigated the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of woody plants in a typically fragmented natural forest landscape of Hainan Island in South China. The study area was classified into eight landscape types based on vegetation type, disturbance manner and the time of recovery. The woody plant species were aggregated into seven functional groups based on the growth form, successional status and plant size. The results gained from the present study showed that all functional groups, except for the emergent and canopy tree species, were present in all eight landscape types. Each landscape type had different numbers of dominant functional groups. There are similar species richness and stem abundance structure among functional groups between mid-successional clear cut lowland rainforest and old growth tropical coniferous forest. This similarity exists in <b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> lowland rainforest and old-growth lowland rainforest, as well as among landscape types of montane rainforest. The functional groups with the same successional status had similar patterns of species richness and stem abundance ratios among different landscape types. The variation patterns of functional groups along the successional stages in terms of species richness and stem abundance among the tropical lowland rainforest landscape types were more similar to each other than those in the tropical montane rainforest landscape types. This study provides further support for the competition-colonization tradeoff and successional niche theory as opposed to models of neutrality and ecological equivalence...|$|R

25|$|The inverse {{situation}} existed {{with regard}} to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, {{and part of the}} remainder had been disturbed by <b>selective</b> <b>logging.</b> Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per hectare, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as mahogany and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of forest fires, which are otherwise rare in rainforests. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of Pará State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of plywood have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a simple and efficient approach for check pointing and recovery in cluster computing environment. The recovery scheme deals with both orphan and lost intra and inter cluster messages. This check pointing scheme ensures that after the system recovers from failures, all processes in different clusters can restart from their respective recent checkpoints; thus avoiding any domino effect. That is, the recent check points always form a consistent recovery line of the cluster federation. The main features of our work are: it uses <b>selective</b> message <b>logging</b> which enables the initiator process in each cluster to log the minimum number of messages, the recovery scheme is domino effect free and is executed simultaneously by all clusters in the cluster federation, it considers concurrent failures, message complexities in each cluster for both check pointing and recovery schemes are just O(n), where n {{is the number of}} processes in a cluster. These features make our algorithm superior to the existing works. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{intensive}} field campaigns {{were held}} in Malaysian Borneo {{during the first half}} of 2008 by a NERC-funded consortium of 8 UK institutions aiming at investigating Oxidant and Particle Photochemical Processes (OP 3). Fluxes of heat and CO 2 were measured during two periods (April and June/July 2008) at the Bukit Atur Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) tower located in the Danum Valley conservation area, Sabah; this tower stands 100 m tall and is situated on a hill leading to an effective measurement height of 200 m above the rainforest canopy. The forest directly surrounding the GAW tower can be described as a <b>selective</b> <b>logged</b> diptocarp forest, with primary forest in the Danum Valley Conservation Area 10 km S of the tower. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, latent and sensible heat were measured by eddy-covariance at a height of 75 m atop the GAW tower. Similar measurements were taken at the Sabahmas oil palm plantation, located 70 km NE east of the GAW site, during an intermediary campaign in May 2008, from a 15 m tower over the 12 m plantation. In addition to the measurements of day-time CO 2 exchange, soil emissions of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) were measured in different forest plots and at the plantation using a manual static chamber technique. Because the experimental setup was not suited to quantifying night-time respiration at the very low wind speeds encountered, the analysis of the CO 2 fluxes focuses on the daytime fluxes. At the GAW site, daytime CO 2 fluxes (Fc) were found to be highly correlated to photosynthetic activity whilst night time fluxes did not exhibit any dependence on air temperature confirming that dark respiration could not be observed, except for a peak of upward fluxes in the early morning (ca. 8 : 00 – 9 : 00 am) which were attributed to the growth of the mixing layer after sun rise. CO 2 concentrations ranged from 355 to 395 ppmv; the highest values were observed in the morning and coincided with surges in Fc caused by the flushing out of the nocturnal boundary layer, whilst the lowest concentrations were generally recorded during the afternoon, at the height of photosynthetic activity. Day time CO 2 emissions ranged from ca. - 10 to - 50 μmol m- 2 s- 1; maximum emission rates were comparable to peak day time fluxes recorded at the Sabahmas plantation. The forest site was found to be a sink of CH 4 (ca. 0. 2 kg. ha- 1. yr- 1), and the plantation a net source (0. 4 kg. ha- 1. yr- 1). Both forest and plantation were however net sources of nitrous oxide (3. 2 and 4. 4 kg. ha- 1. yr- 1, respectively). ...|$|R

Work was conducted in an area of buffer zone in the Tambopata-Candamo National Reserve, Peru. All logging was conducted within the 25 month period prior to the study, and the majority of trees were immediately processed on-site into planks and then removed. The logging sites were left in a degraded state, with a considerable amount of sawdust remaining fi-om the processing stage. Some trees are felled and left, due to their having imperfections. This provided an opportunity to compare the differences between transects across sites where trees were felled and processed, and felled only. Transects done close to standing, living C. cateniformis were also conducted. Results indicate that the regeneration of C. cateniformis within the felled and processed and felled only areas is very poor, but several young seedlings were found in the transects surveyed in near to standing specimens of C. cateniformis.

40|$|Determining how {{tropical}} tree populations {{subject to}} <b>selective</b> felling (<b>logging)</b> pressure may be conserved {{is a crucial}} issue for forest management and studying this issue requires a comprehensive understanding {{of the relationships between}} population demography and gene flow. We used a simulation model, SELVA, to study (1) the relative impact of demographic factors (juvenile mortality, felling regime) and genetic factors (selfing, number and location of fathers, mating success) on long-term genetic diversity; and (2) the impact of different felling regimes on population size versus genetic diversity. Impact was measured by means of model sensitivity analyses. Juvenile mortality had the highest impact on the number of alleles and genotypes, and on the genetic distance between the original and final populations. Selfing had the greatest impact on observed heterozygote frequency and fixation index. Other factors and interactions had only minor effects. Overall, felling had a greater impact on population size than on genetic diversity. Interestingly, populations under relatively low felling pressure even had a somewhat lower fixation index than undisturbed populations (no felling). We conclude that demographic processes such as juvenile mortality should be modelled thoroughly to obtain reliable long-term predictions of genetic diversity. Mortality in selfed and outcrossed progenies should be modelled explicitly by taking inbreeding depression into account. The modelling of selfing based on population rate appeared to be oversimplifying and should account for inter-tree variation. Forest management should pay particular attention to the regeneration capacities of felled species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of <b>selective</b> timber <b>logging</b> carried out by local indigenous people in remote areas within indigenous territories on the mammal populations of the Yavari-Mirin River basin on the Peru-Brazil border. Recent findings show that habitat change in the study area is minimal, and any effect of logging activities on large mammal populations is highly likely {{to be the result of}} hunting associated with logging operations. We used hunting registers to estimate the monthly and yearly biomass extracted during timber operations and to calculate the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in subsistence hunting in the community of Esperanza 2 to 5 years before logging activities started and 4 to 7 years after logging began. We also used line transects and the distance method to estimate animal densities before and after logging. We found that 1389 hunted animals and 27, 459 kg of mammal biomass were extracted per year from logging concessions. CPUE for ungulates declined; however, it increased for other mammal orders, such as rodents and primates, indicating a shift to alternative prey items. Although collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) may also have declined in numbers, this shift may have been caused by a possibly natural population crash in white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) that coincided with the logging periods. We found no evidence that populations of primates were reduced by the logging activities. Because primates are sensitive to hunting, and their populations were of principal concern as logging commenced, this indicates that these forests remain of high conservation value.

We compared a high-intensity land-use area, where the forest that had been cleared, and used for subsistence agriculture before being abandoned in 1934 then regrew to a low-intensity land-use area, in which there had been only some <b>selective</b> experimental <b>logging</b> by the USDA Forest Service in the 1940 s. Prior to our study, both areas were strongly affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and again damaged {{to a lesser degree}} by Hurricane Georges in 1998, increasing canopy openness and subsequently increasing tree stem densities. Between 2001 and 2015, changes in the light environment and the recovery of forest structure resulted in roughly a 50 % reduction in tree stem densities in the high-intensity land-use area, as recruited saplings naturally thinned. In this area, liana abundance increased by 103 %, liana biomass tripled, and occupancy of trees by lianas grew by nearly 50 %. In the low-intensity land-use area, juvenile stem densities were stable, and resultantly liana abundance only increased by 33 %, liana biomass rose 39 %, and the occupancy of trees was constant. Liana flower and fruit production increased over the 14 -year interval, and these increases were much greater in the high-intensity land-use quadrats. Results of this study do show how rapid forest tree successional dynamics coincide with liana increases, but the confounding of hurricane effects of disturbance at our site, prevent us from asserting that the increases in liana density and biomass {{can be attributed to the}} same causes as those in forests elsewhere in the Neotropics...|$|R
40|$|Comparatively little {{attention}} has been given in the literature to the economics of <b>selective</b> (reduced impact) <b>logging</b> as a means to conserve forest-dependent wildlife species and maintain other ecological services. However, the subject of the spatial optimization of the use of ecosystems has received much attention by ecologists. Although, Hof and Bevers (1998; 2002), for example, analyse in detail the ecological and environmental consequences of the spatial use of forest ecosystems and the effects of logging regimes on their ecological services, economic considerations are not central to their expositions. Their aim is to examine ‘the use of optimisation in the management of an ecosystem with the objective of directly capturing spatial ecosystem relationships and processes’ (Hof and Bevers, 1998, p. 1). Because the problems posed by these authors are complex, they cannot always be solved by mathematical optimization methods but must rely on simulation approaches and approximations for solutions. Often linear approximations are needed to solve these problems and linear programming is a useful tool for obtaining solutions (see, for example, Hof and Bevers, 2002, Ch. 5). The model presented in this chapter for considering the spatial use of a forest is simple and also involves linearity but it is able to identify circumstances in which multiple use of a part of the forest is optimal and others in which the forest should be partitioned into dominant uses...|$|R
