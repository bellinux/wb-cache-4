5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met Mölders again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match Mölders' sharp eyesight; the <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> {{in his eyes}} denied him that capacity. However, Mölders, by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. Mölders was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned Mölders' tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as an early warning system. Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, Springer intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's life at all times. Later, Springer pled guilty to reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E

25|$|The Stooges soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for their wild, primitive live performances. Pop, especially, became known for his outrageous onstage behavioursmearing his bare chest with hamburger meat and peanut butter, cutting himself with <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> and flashing his genitalia to the audience. Pop is sometimes credited with the invention or popularization of stage diving.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the filming}} of the music video for [...] "So Tired", a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> from an {{exploding}} mirror became lodged in Osbourne's face and throat. Though some scheduled concert dates had to be cancelled, Osbourne made a full recovery.|$|R
50|$|The trial {{commenced}} on 24 January 2006. In {{the trial}} Alastair Wilson, associate clinical {{director at the}} Royal London Hospital and one of Britain's top trauma experts, testified {{that he thought that}} Taylor had died after falling on a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA {{exploded}} a {{car bomb}} in the street outside the courts, killing one and injuring 200 people. A <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> is preserved as a reminder, embedded in the wall {{at the top of}} the main stairs.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{drinking}} bird's appearance and classification as a toy {{there is a}} potential danger of thin <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.|$|E
25|$|They were {{followed}} by Henry C. Lee on April 9, 2004. After examining the Jeep, he deduced that the shots were fired from the outside because there were <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> on the Jeep's floor. But due to the incompleteness of evidence preservation, {{and the lack of}} an accurate record on the Jeep's speed at the day of procession, he pointed out that it might be impossible to determine from which direction the bullets entered the Jeep.|$|E
25|$|Although the perspex screen {{mullions}} and transoms impaired {{the live}} audiences' view {{as well as}} external views of the arena on television, on numerous occasions {{it proved to be}} necessary. The floor flipper would send lighter robots (such as featherweights) out of the arena and straight into the perspex box. Furthermore, items from the drop zone were often unpredictable, most notably when Matilda obliterated a television screen with her flywheel sending <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> strewn across the arena.|$|E
50|$|Joan barely {{makes it}} {{back by the}} gang's {{deadline}} in time to prevent her husband's death.

50|$|During the Dark Reign storyline, Solo {{was hired}} by a man later {{revealed}} to be Bullseye's father to capture Bullseye. Bullseye threw a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> into Solo's left eye, but Solo survived and managed to capture Bullseye after tasering him. The assassins chasing Elektra attempt to hire Solo to assist but fail.|$|R
25|$|Police had {{established}} a command post {{two blocks from the}} restaurant. They initially did not know how many shooters were inside, since Huberty was using firearms of several different types, and rapidly firing numerous shots. Because most of the restaurant's windows had been shattered by gunfire, reflections from <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> made it difficult for police to see inside. A police sniper who was part of the SWAT team was positioned {{on the roof of the}} post office next door to the McDonald's. He was authorized to kill Huberty should he have a clear shot.|$|E
25|$|A {{practice}} alert {{had been}} carried out {{earlier in the day}} within the town, and when the aircraft were finally spotted and an alert sounded, many people ignored the warning believing it to be another practice drill. 46 bombs were dropped over Gillingham and Chatham causing much damage. The Drill Hall suffered a direct hit. The bomb shattered the glass roof, sending dangerous <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> flying through the drill hall before exploding when they hit the floor. The clock upon the drill hall tower stopped at 11.12, giving the exact time the bomb exploded. The men asleep or resting inside had little chance of survival, those that were not injured from the explosion were cut to pieces by the falling pieces of glass from the roof.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E

She gazes at Mr. Bennet, who is in another room.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} {{blew out}} all {{the windows in the}} vicinity, sending <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> into people's faces and bodies as they were hit by falling masonry and timber; severed limbs were hurled into the road and into the mangled front of an office building. The ground floor of the News Letter offices and all buildings in the area suffered heavy damage. The News Letter library in particular sustained considerable damage with many priceless photographs and old documents destroyed. Around the blast's epicentre, the street resembled a battlefield. About one hundred schoolgirls lay wounded on the rubble-strewn, bloody pavement covered in glass and debris, and screaming in pain and fright. A total of 148 people were injured in the explosion, 19 of them seriously, including people who had lost eyes and were badly maimed. Among the injured were many News Letter staff.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Aunt Lily unintentionally burns {{down the}} de Lutrelle's barn. Gervaise decides {{that he has}} to sell the crown to pay for the repairs. In 1997 Daniel and Fergus are arguing because Daniel has his real dad with him and Fergus doesn't. Fergus throws a {{baseball}} at Daniel, he ducks and goes through the mirror, at the same time Constance argues with her father not to sell the crown and grabbed it from his hands and races through the mirror. As Constance and Daniel are travelling through the mirror, the baseball hits it and it shatters into thousands of pieces. In the past Gervaise saw his daughter travel through the mirror and ducks from the <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> as they shoots from the frame. Daniel and Constance are still in Limerick House, but they are in a different dimension.|$|E
500|$|Miscellaneous finds {{included}} a brass buckle, <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and olive pits.

Personal possessions {{included a}} gold crucifix, pins, silver thimbles and silver reale coins. The salvage team also found silver and gold bullion.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, 24-year-old Philip Quinn from Kent, Washington {{was killed}} by a lava lamp on a kitchen stove while closely observing it from only a few feet away. Heat from the stove built up {{pressure}} in the lamp until it exploded and a <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> pierced his heart, causing fatal injuries. Quinn was found dead in his home.|$|R
5000|$|Jason Gage, an {{openly gay}} man, was murdered on March 11, 2005, in his Waterloo, Iowa {{apartment}} by an assailant, Joseph Lawrence, who claimed Gage had made sexual advance to him.

40|$|The paper argues on two {{contemporary}} questions {{around the}} signification of coloured and photorealistic representation: 1. digitally fabricated or captured {{from the real}} colours: which are the fakest? 2. colour is still synonymous of advertising (as thought till the first 70 ’s) ? Thereby, the paper includes the investigations connected with a photographic project, which reflects how landscape can be re-drawn by the positioning of a landmark and which wants to go far from the dazzling colours of a “celebrity” under the spot lights: The <b>Shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> London...|$|R

Captive emus have been known to eat <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> marbles, car keys, jewellery, and nuts and bolts.|$|E
500|$|There were {{originally}} {{to be about}} 500 effect shots, but it increased to 800. The post-production conflict between Gilliam and the Weinsteins also gave enough time for Peerless to work on another film, The Legend of Zorro. Four different creatures were required for computer animation: a Wolfman, a mud creature, the Mirror Queen, and a living tree. John Paul Docherty, who headed the digital visual effects unit, studied the animation of the computer-generated Morlocks in The Time Machine for the Wolfman. Docherty depicted the Morlocks [...] "as a nice mix between human and animal behaviors". The death of The Mirror Queen was the most complex effect of the film. In the sequence, the Queen turns into hundreds of <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and shatters. With computerized rendering, this could not happen, as the 3D volume of the body suddenly turns into 2D pieces of glass. The problem was eventually solved due to sudden advances that occurred with Softimage XSI software.|$|E
500|$|The {{black vulture}} lays its eggs {{on the ground}} in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than [...] above the ground. While it {{generally}} does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic, <b>shards</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> or metal items such as bottle caps. Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures [...] The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the ornate hawk-eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.|$|E
50|$|Reinerite is most {{commonly}} found as a sky blue colored mineral, however, {{it may also}} be a light yellowish green color. Reinerite has a relative hardness of 5 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale which is equivalent to that of a knife blade and or <b>shard</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> It has a density of 4.27 g/cm3, and it exhibits a nonmetallic luster that may be described as glassy or vitreous.|$|R
