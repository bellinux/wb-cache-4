5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a <b>strategic</b> <b>approach.</b> To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

30|$|In these aspects, {{legitimacy}} {{has emerged}} as one of the critical issues in companies that operate globally, and the importance of perceived moral legitimacy is growing [8]. How can companies manage legitimacy? Existing theories suggest two strategies: <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> and institutional <b>approaches.</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> assume that legitimacy serves as an operational resource [5] that business organizations can directly manage and influence [73]. <b>Strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> focus on pragmatic legitimacy and indicate the possibility that corporations can manipulate social contexts or the process of legitimacy ascriptions [8].|$|R

25|$|Decisions about {{distribution}} need to {{be taken}} in line with a company's overall strategic vision and mission. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of strategic planning. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the <b>strategic</b> <b>approach.</b> The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.|$|E
25|$|When {{decision-makers}} {{have determined}} the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they {{turn their attention}} to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed {{in the course of a}} single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall <b>strategic</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{those early}} days, Bavarian {{football}} {{was dominated by}} teams from Franconia, {{in the north of}} the state, notably 1. FC Nürnberg and their twin town neighbours SpVgg Fürth. In 1914, Fürth became the first team from the state to become national champions and by 1930 these two sides had accumulated eight titles between them. Bayern President Kurt Landauer held the office on-and-off from 1913 until 1933 and from 1947 well into the 1950s, adopted a <b>strategic</b> <b>approach</b> to building up the team and challenging this dominance. He hired William Townley as the side's first professional coach. The Englishman was the best coach on the market in Germany and had a championship with Karlsruher FV, in 1910, to his credit.|$|E

40|$|To respond {{effectively}} and efficiently to the environmental sustainability challenge, an important role can be played by companies, through appropriate strategies and operations, such as green processes and product development. In this paper, we investigate whether the development of green products {{is supported by the}} environmental <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> adopted by sustainability-driven companies, and whether there are economic sector or geographical area specificities. To this purpose, first we develop a taxonomy of environmental strategies and we define measurable proxies for both the environmental <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> identified and the green product development. Then, we study a sample represented by the companies included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSWI). The methodology used is based on the content analysis of companies' websites and relevant documents, such as environmental and sustainability reports. The main result is that the levels of adoption of different environmental <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> are higher for green product developers than for green product non-developers. Moreover, the most implemented <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> for green product developers vary depending on the economic sector, while a more homogeneous behaviour is found from the geographical perspective.

500|$|Other passes were {{available}} through the hills near Hulao, but they were smaller and equally defensible; given {{the size of the}} Xia army, the only other alternatives for Dou would have been to bypass the Tang position entirely, either by crossing the Yellow River to the north or by venturing further south to the Huanyuan Pass. Indeed, one of Dou's civil officials, Ling Jing, suggested a different <b>strategic</b> <b>approach,</b> namely to avoid any engagement with Li Shimin, cross to the northern bank of the Yellow River and strike at the Tang heartland in Shanxi, thereby both weakening the Tang and forcing them to abandon the siege of Luoyang without the Xia incurring any casualties. The plan was supported by Dou's wife, but was not adopted due to the vehement opposition of the Xia generals. Aside from the natural disregard of the military professionals towards a suggestion from someone whom they regarded as an [...] "armchair general", however, this opposition is attributed by some sources to bribery of some Xia generals by Wang Shichong's agents, to ensure that Dou remained committed to the relief of Luoyang.|$|E

30|$|Drawing {{upon the}} {{complexity}} theory of complexity absorption and Chinese processual philosophy, this paper proposes a new theoretical model of processual entrepreneurial <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches.</b> The empirical {{findings from the}} study of Chinese entrepreneurial organizations support the notion that timing, context and efficacy as key elements in a complexity absorption approach are strongly evidenced in entrepreneurial strategic practices, which contribute to the success of their businesses in the Chinese market. The paper has both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, the paper extends the scope of the literature of entrepreneurial strategy by developing a new model of entrepreneurial <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> with a processual perspective through building up its link to complexity theory and processual philosophy. Practically, the insight gained from this research contributes to enhancing the understanding of entrepreneurial <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> in a complex market like China and helps businesses prepare their mindsets and strategies when they enter or engage in such markets.|$|R

2500|$|Aer Lingus {{adopted a}} [...] "small frills" [...] <b>strategic</b> <b>approach</b> – a hybrid between a {{traditional}} legacy airline {{and a low}} cost carrier. The difference lies in the services offered on short-haul and long-haul flights with meals offered free on the latter only. The new strategy required considerable negotiation with the unions and a consensus was reached that lower costs and a reinvention of the airline was necessary for its survival. The union concessions that arose from the negotiations were detrimental to the airline's image however; by 2003 the wage freeze had been lifted and there were 3800 voluntary redundancies with no forced layoffs. These factors contributed to the airline's reported profits in 2002, 2003 and 2005, with only a small loss recorded in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Research {{has so far}} not {{approached}} the contents of corporate code of ethics from a strategic classification point of view. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to introduce and describe a framework of classification and empirical illustration to provide insights into the <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> of corporate code of ethics content within and across contextual business environments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarizes the content analysis of code prescription and the intensity of codification in the contents of 78 corporate codes of ethics in Australia. Findings - The paper finds that, generally, the studied corporate codes of ethics in Australia are of standardized and replicated <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches.</b> In particular, customized and individualized <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> are far from penetrating the ethos of corporate codes of ethics content. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to Australian codes of ethics. Suggestions for further research are provided in terms of the search for best practice of customized and individualized corporate codes of ethics content across countries. Practical implications - The framework contributes to an identification of four <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> of corporate codes of ethics content, namely standardized, replicated, individualized and customized. Originality/value - The principal contribution of this paper is a generic framework to identify <b>strategic</b> <b>approaches</b> of corporate codes of ethics content. The framework is derived from two generic dimensions: the context of application and the application of content. The timing of application is also a crucial generic dimension to the success or failure of codes of ethics content.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer {{not to think about}} them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How can these characters have any concrete agenda or <b>strategic</b> <b>approach</b> or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way.
