5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> what this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Evans became {{addicted}} to cocaine. He started with one gram per weekend, but later started taking several grams daily. His friends, Chicago pianists Sam Distefano and Larry Novak, repeatedly tried lecturing {{him in an}} effort to get him to quit, fearing for Bill's health. His brother Harry's suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979. His sister-in-law Pat Evans has stated that she knew Bill wouldn't last long after Harry's death and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if that's what prompted her to buy three plots in a Baton Rouge Cemetery, where Harry was interred. It has been documented that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis. Laurie Verchomin has claimed that Evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short time.|$|E

[...] In the introduction of The Rape of Nanking, she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre [...] "remained buried in the back of [...] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil."

Also in 2012, Joyner told Jeff Probst that when she and Cryer started dating, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if he might be gay because [...] "he never kissed me."

500|$|Miss Manners {{wrote in}} her 1990book Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium that {{although}} the phrase was trite, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether there was [...] "so much deeply felt good will" [...] permeating through the world that shallow friendliness ought to desist. She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but {{now that you mention}} it, I think I'll have a nice one."

500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> {{if she had}} focused the novel too much on her own {{personal}} life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked {{as an antidote to}} Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E

500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) she sensed a [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if it should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, she wanted him to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise. Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "jazzy, uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing", and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010, [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside". While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> at the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't do too much for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed to drag {{on and on and on}} with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|The other {{performance}} by Criss and Bomer, the Duran Duran mashup of [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] and [...] "Rio", {{was given a}} modestly positive reception. Strecker gave it an [...] and called it a [...] "real treat" [...] with [...] "some truly fun choreography". Slezak, on the other hand, described the choreography as [...] "peculiar", and graded the song a [...] "B". Sullivan wrote, [...] "On paper {{it may not have}} seemed like the best idea, but honestly, it kind of rocked." [...] Chaney noted that [...] "they were fun to watch", but gave the performance a [...] "C"; she said that [...] "something about this cover sucked all the cherry ice cream smile out of the originals", though <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether she was biased by her [...] "lifelong appreciation of Duran Duran". The solo by Criss on [...] "Fighter" [...] received a wider range of opinions. Both Chaney and Slezak gave the song a [...] Chaney said he sang the song [...] "with conviction" [...] and complimented the [...] "visually alluring" [...] boxing and shower scenes, as did Slezak. Strecker wrote that [...] "the energy and emotional punch totally resonated" [...] and gave the song an [...] though she also stated that [...] "the talk-singing at the beginning was a little weird". Votta said that [...] "vocally, Darren Criss embodies the song", but she characterized the staging as [...] "too jagged and haphazard to make an impact", and the transitions not [...] "as smooth as they could be". Flandez called the song choice [...] "unsuitable" [...] and [...] "puzzling", and VanDerWerff said the performance was [...] "completely ridiculous".|$|E
