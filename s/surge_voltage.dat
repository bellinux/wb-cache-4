40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} lightning surges induced in buildings with the FDTD method. When down conductors (DCs) in a building discharge a lightning current, induced surges are observed in adjacent distribution circuits due to electric and magnetic coupling. The induced voltage in an open circuit and the induced current in a close circuit are, respectively, determined by the current <b>surge</b> and <b>voltage</b> <b>surge</b> on the DC. It is found that connected capacitors can reduce the induced <b>surge</b> <b>voltages,</b> but may not be effective. SPDs are then recommended installing at two far ends of a distribution circuit. They {{are not required to}} dissipate substantial lightning surge energy observed in the down conductors. The surge currents in SPDs can be estimated using the closed-form formula.

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, <b>surge</b> <b>voltage</b> and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} transients generated {{during the}} switching of a breaker placed near the transformer {{in a system}} with {{a substantial amount of}} cables can have a very short rise time and can reach very high magnitudes. In practice, the magnitude of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> is usually limited using the surge arresters while the rise time of the surge to which the apparatus is exposed, remains unchanged. In this paper, the characteristic of the switching transients generated in the MV cable grids are analyzed. For this purpose, cases with both dry-type and oil insulated transformers are studied. These cases are typical for a MV industrial grid and a wind park (WP) collection grid. Furthermore, the case with and without surge arrester protection is analyzed in order to observe the impact of the surge arresters on the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges.</b> Simulations show that the magnitude of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> exceeds the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Furthermore, the rise time of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> is much shorter compared to the rise time of the lightning impulse {{especially in the case of}} the dry-type transformers and the WP collection grid. When surge arresters are used, the magnitude of the surges is limited to the BIL but the rise times of the surges can be twenty five times shorter compared to the BIL. Only when surge arresters are used with other fast transient mitigation equipment such as RC protection or surge capacitor protection, the magnitude of very fast <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> are brought down...|$|R
