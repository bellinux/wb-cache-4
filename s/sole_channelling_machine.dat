In this paper we focus on <b>channel</b> <b>machines</b> with insertion errors, i. e., <b>machines</b> in whose <b>channels</b> messages can spontaneously appear.

Finally, using the previous result, we show that the satisfiability problem for the safety fragment of Metric Temporal Logic is non-elementary. © 2012 BCS...|$|R

This fragmentation avoids the movement of large continuations between locations, and leads to a more e#cient implementation model...|$|R

If FDI is the <b>sole</b> <b>channel</b> of ITT, a faster flow of FDI to the South increases the rates of innovation, imitation, and ITT, so FDI generates dynamic benefits. If FDI and imitation coexist as channels of ITT, however, then FDI merely substitutes for imitation targeting Northern firms. A faster flow of FDI to the South then leaves the rates of innovation, imitation, and ITT essentially unaffected, so FDI generates mostly static benefits. ...|$|R
