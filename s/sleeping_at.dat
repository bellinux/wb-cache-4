5|$|By 1952, Kulikovsky {{had shrunk}} more than 4inches (10cm) from his peak height of 6ft 2inches (188cm). He distrusted {{conventional}} medicine and tried homeopathy instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty <b>sleeping.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of the}} Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.|$|E

5|$|Mara {{replaced}} Gibson as the team's president {{before the}} 1927 season. He told March to spend whatever he felt necessary {{to build a}} championship caliber team. March overhauled the roster and the team finished 11–1–1, while winning its first NFL championship. They barely broke even financially however, and the team was still giving away as many as 4,000 tickets a game. Mara decided to reduce costs the following season, and instead of traveling first class, the Giants drove to games in a used bus, and stayed at local YMCAs instead of hotels. The team had to push the bus once for several miles when it broke down, and players had trouble <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> the Y. They won only four games, and Mara lost $40,000.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling {{chloroform}} on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the 716th Infantry Division, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, was informed at 01:20 of the parachute landings and that the bridges had been captured intact. One of his first actions was to contact Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division. Richter ordered the division to attack the landing areas. While Feuchtinger's tanks were delegated to support the 716th, it was {{also part of the}} German armoured reserve that could not move without orders from the German High Command. All German panzer formations could only be moved on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler, who was <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> the time and his staff refused to wake him. When the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment received news of the airborne landings at 01:30, Luck ordered the regiment to their assembly areas north and east of Caen and to wait for further orders.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{benefit from}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> a 30-degree {{elevation}} of the upper body or higher, {{as if in a}} recliner. Doing so helps prevent the gravitational collapse of the airway. Sleeping on a side as opposed to sleeping on the back is also recommended.|$|E

25|$|The many {{settlements}} on {{the coast}} and in the hinterland vary between large all-year-round settlements and smaller seasonal settlements. A settlement consisted of huts, probably brush supported by posts. The huts were in no special order. Fire pits located outside the huts indicate that most village functions were performed outdoors, with the dwellings used perhaps for storage and <b>sleeping.</b> <b>At</b> the time winters were mild.|$|E

When Welsh was mugged while <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> a cheap hotel, {{he was given a}} job as a porter by the sympathetic hotel manager.|$|E
25|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{version of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was made into}} an animated short (with the same title) by Walt Disney Television Animation in 1999 {{as part of the}} Mouse Tales series. It was featured in a 2002 episode of Disney's House of Mouse ("House of Scrooge", Season 3, Episode 34). The star-crossed lovers are played by Mickey Mouse (Lysander), Minnie Mouse (Hermia), Donald Duck (Demetrius), and Daisy Duck (Helena). The character based on Theseus is played by Ludwig Von Drake, and the character based on Egeus by Scrooge McDuck. Goofy appears as an accident-prone Puck. The story ends with the revelation that it was a dream experienced by Mickey Mouse while <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> a picnic hosted by Minnie.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would climb into the house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E
25|$|Ant {{saw little}} action during the {{remainder}} of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> the foot of his bed in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were huddled in a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters. The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the FBI {{believed}} that Coppola {{was going to}} turn state's evidence against the Genovese family and cooperate with the FBI. The FBI was willing to give him immunity from prosecution and enter him in the Witness Protection Program if he cooperated. The FBI believed he was involved in the killing of Lawrence Ricci (along with his son and stepson) on orders of Tino Fiumara, one of the men the FBI was hoping to prosecute with Coppola's cooperation. Coppola waived a speedy arraignment and spent the next two nights <b>sleeping</b> <b>at</b> FBI headquarters in lower Manhattan at an undisclosed hotel. He also met with a government arranged lawyer known as a shadow counsel. On the third day, however, Coppola refused to cooperate. His defense lawyer Henry Mazurek said that Coppola only dragged out the process out of concern for his wife, who he feared would also be arrested and charged.|$|E
