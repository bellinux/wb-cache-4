A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a <b>sports</b> <b>pool.</b> The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
