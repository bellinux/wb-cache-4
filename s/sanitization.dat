5|$|Nellie Forbush, in {{her journey}} from Little Rock, Arkansas, to {{serving as a}} Navy nurse {{and on to the}} domesticity of the final scene of South Pacific, {{parallels}} the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the <b>sanitization</b> of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work– that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.|$|E
5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of <b>sanitization</b> impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E
25|$|Pit latrines {{could be}} {{modified}} to be soil-composting latrines (Arborloos), thus requiring some wall reinforcement, made shallow (max 1-1.5 m) and maintained using daily soil additions: the pits would be periodically closed and covered with soil {{in order to allow}} for <b>sanitization</b> and composting prior to emptying and reuse in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Baum's avowed {{intentions}} {{with the}} Oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as {{are found in}} the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. The first books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased with the series; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objected to doing violence even to the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the <b>sanitization</b> of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{degree of}} treatment for the collected dried feces depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only buried, then no further treatment is required. The dried feces are in almost all cases not entirely sanitized when removed from a vault of the UDDT, so careful handling is obligatory. In scenarios wherein excreta is to be reused in agriculture, a secondary treatment of fecal matter and storage of urine is advisable to ensure adequate <b>sanitization.</b> Fecal material from single vault UDDTs must always be post-treated, even if just via prolonged storage. Fecal material from double vaults has typically passed a certain storage time and is therefore already more sanitized. However, a secondary form of treatment is optional but recommended for household systems and required for large-scale systems.|$|E
25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist <b>sanitization</b> and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} decline {{occurred}} {{as the result}} of a fatal outbreak of [...] in 1996 that was caused by using bruised fruit that had been contaminated. Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices, claiming that the process of pasteurization altered the flavor of the juice. Following the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other <b>sanitization</b> procedures. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a 90% reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered and the following year became profitable again.|$|E
500|$|Alison Halsall said [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is {{the strongest}} example {{of a history of}} scatology, the study of excrement, {{throughout}} the South Park series. Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, directly confronts the viewer with [...] "the inherent dirtiness of the human body, no matter how much we try to aestheticize it, Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order. [...] South Park refuses <b>sanitization</b> through the gross-out factor." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Perl 6 FAQ, Perl 6 was {{designed}} to mitigate [...] "the usual suspects" [...] that elicit the [...] "line noise" [...] claim from Perl 5 critics, including the removal of [...] "the majority of the punctuation variables" [...] and the <b>sanitization</b> of the regex syntax. The Perl 6 FAQ also states that what is {{sometimes referred to as}} Perl's line noise is [...] "the actual syntax of the language" [...] just as gerunds and prepositions {{are a part of the}} English language. In a December 2012 blog posting, despite claiming that [...] "Rakudo Perl 6 has failed and will continue to fail unless it gets some adult supervision", chromatic stated that the design of Perl 6 has a [...] "well-defined grammar" [...] as well as an [...] "improved type system, a unified object system with an intelligent metamodel, metaoperators, and a clearer system of context that provides for such niceties as pervasive laziness". He also stated that [...] "Perl 6 has a coherence and a consistency that Perl 5 lacks." ...|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} {{also received}} mixed reviews. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News gave [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] a grade of [...] "A"; {{he noted that}} ordinarily he would have declined to review it due to its short length, but said [...] "what a glorious ten seconds it is". Benigno and Poniewozik criticized the <b>sanitization</b> of [...] "Forget You", but while the latter found it inferior to the original version, the former preferred Paltrow's deeper voice and graded the song [...] "A". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman felt the censorship of the song did not adversely affect its success, and deemed Paltrow's rendition [...] "charming and sassy". Megan Vick of Billboard called it [...] "the most exciting number" [...] of the episode, and Stack went further in his praise: he bestowed a grade of [...] "A+" [...] and lauded it as [...] "one {{of the most memorable}} and energetic Glee performances ever, thanks in no small part to Paltrow". Green told MTV that he was flattered by the cover, particularly as he was not aware Paltrow would perform it when granting Glee clearance. He called her performance [...] "great", and commented that he had not been aware she was such an accomplished vocalist.|$|E
500|$|Rocky Horror creator Richard O'Brien was {{disappointed}} that the episode diluted the themes of the musical, and was puzzled that the word [...] "transsexual" [...] was censored. Matt Kane, entertainment media manager for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, criticized {{the use of the}} pejorative term [...] "tranny" [...] in its place, and found it [...] "particularly alarming" [...] given that the season one episode [...] "Theatricality" [...] presented a negative reaction to the use of a homophobic slur." [...] Critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded it an [...] "F" [...] and said it was [...] "the worst hour this show has ever produced". He felt that it was overly ambitious, and that in attempting to skirt humorously around the issue of transsexuals, the end result was [...] "more offensive than if the show had simply ignored the whole thing to begin with." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine called it a [...] "travesty" [...] and criticized [...] "the arms-length treatment of the Frank N. Furter character", and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times deemed the episode flawed through its <b>sanitization,</b> despite initially having found the two shows [...] "a particularly promising match".|$|E
2500|$|Sterilization (or sterilisation) {{refers to}} any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates {{all forms of}} life and other {{biological}} agents (such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spore forms, prions, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium, etc.) present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume of fluid, medication, or in a compound such as biological culture media. [...] Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is distinct from disinfection, <b>sanitization,</b> and pasteurization in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{operators}} of particular web applications (e.g. forums and webmail) allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, <b>very</b> large), output encoding (such as &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large) will not suffice since the user input {{needs to be}} rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as [...] "very large", instead of [...] "<b>very</b> large"). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an HTML <b>sanitization</b> engine {{to ensure that it}} does not contain XSS code.|$|E
2500|$|An essay {{appearing}} in the Arts section of the New York Times in April 2006 quoted several filmmakers, including Sidney Lumet and Paul Mazursky, describing how modern cinema shows the city as far more [...] "teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving" [...] than contemporary New York actually is, and the consequential challenge this poses for filmmakers. The article quotes Robert Greenhut, Woody Allen's producer, as saying that despite the increased <b>sanitization</b> of modern New York, [...] "New Yorkers' personalities are different to Chicago. There's {{a certain kind of}} vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere. The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere — the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Server-side code {{can do a}} vast {{assortment}} of tasks to create dynamic web sites that, for technical or security reasons, client-side code cannot [...] from authenticating a login, to retrieving and storing data in a database, to spell checking, to sending e-mail. A significant advantage to server-side over client-side execution is the concentration of functionality onto the server {{rather than relying on}} different web browsers to implement various functions in consistent, standardized ways. In addition, processing forms on a server often results in increased security if server-side execution is designed not to trust the data supplied by the client and includes such techniques as HTML <b>sanitization.</b> One disadvantage to server side code is scalabilityserver side processing for all users occurs on the server, while client side processing occurs on individual client computers.|$|E

5000|$|Although the NISPOM text itself never {{described}} {{any specific}} methods for <b>sanitization,</b> past editions (1995 and 1997) did contain explicit <b>sanitization</b> methods within the Defense Security Service (DSS) Clearing and <b>Sanitization</b> Matrix inserted after Section 8-306. The DSS still provides this matrix {{and it continues}} to specify methods. As of the Nov 2007 edition of the matrix, overwriting is no longer acceptable for <b>sanitization</b> of magnetic media.

The NISPOM actually covers the entire field of government-industrial security, of which data <b>sanitization</b> {{is a very small}} part (about two paragraphs in a 141-page document). Furthermore, the NISPOM does not actually specify any particular method. Standards for <b>sanitization</b> are left up to the Cognizant Security Authority. The Defense Security Service provides a Clearing and <b>Sanitization</b> Matrix (C&SM) which does specify methods.

50|$|<b>Sanitization</b> {{can take}} many forms {{depending}} on both {{the sensitivity of the}} information and the level of effort a likely adversary would invest in attempting to recover the information. Methods used in <b>sanitization</b> range from simple overwrites to destruction of the cryptographic keys for encrypted data (the technique is known as cryptographic erasure) to physical destruction of the storage media. This standard provides guidance to help organizations select the proper <b>sanitization</b> methods for their data.|$|E

5000|$|HTML <b>sanitization</b> is {{the process}} of {{examining}} an HTML document and producing a new HTML document that preserves only whatever tags are designated [...] "safe" [...] and desired. HTML <b>sanitization</b> can be used to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing any HTML code submitted by a user.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sanitization</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} sensitive information from a document or other message (or sometimes encrypting it), so that the document may be distributed to a broader audience. When the intent is secrecy protection, such as in dealing with classified information, <b>sanitization</b> attempts to reduce the document's classification level, possibly yielding an unclassified document. When the intent is privacy protection, it is often called data anonymization. Originally, the term <b>sanitization</b> was applied to printed documents; it has since been extended to apply to computer media and the problem of data remanence as well.|$|E
