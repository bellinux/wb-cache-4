40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) signalling {{has emerged}} as a fundamental pathway in endothelial cell biology and deregulation of this pathway is implicated in several vascular disorders. BMP <b>signalling</b> <b>output</b> in endothelial cells is highly context- and dose-dependent. Phosphorylation of the BMP intracellular effectors, SMAD 1 / 5 / 9, is routinely used to monitor BMP signalling activity. To better understand the in vivo context-dependency of BMP-SMAD signalling, we investigated differences in BMP-SMAD transcriptional activity in different vascular beds during mouse embryonic and postnatal stages. For this, we used the BRE::gfp BMP signalling reporter mouse in which the BMP response element (BRE) from the ID 1 -promotor, a SMAD 1 / 5 / 9 target gene, drives the expression of GFP. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) are {{of central}} importance for dorsal–ventral (DV) axis specification. They are core {{components of a}} signalling cascade that includes the BMP ligand decapentaplegic (DPP) and its antagonist short gastrulation (SOG) in Drosophila melanogaster. These components are very ancient, with orthologs involved in DV patterning in both protostomes and deuterostomes. Despite such strong conservation, recent comparative work in insects has revealed interesting differences {{in the way the}} patterning function of the DV system is achieved in different species. Results In this paper, we characterise the expression patterns of the principal components of the BMP DV patterning system, as well as its signalling outputs and downstream targets, in the non-cyclorrhaphan moth midge Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodidae). We previously reported ventral expression patterns of dpp in the pole regions of C. albipunctata blastoderm embryos. Strikingly, we also find ventral sog and posteriorly restricted tkv expression, as well as expanded polar activity of pMad. We use our results from gene knock-down by embryonic RNA interference to propose a mechanism of polar morphogen shuttling in C. albipunctata. We compare these results to available data from other species and discuss scenarios for the evolution of DV signalling in the holometabolan insects. Conclusions A comparison of gene expression patterns across hemipteran and holometabolan insects reveals that expression of upstream signalling factors in the DV system is very variable, while <b>signalling</b> <b>output</b> is highly conserved. This has two major implications: first, as long as ligand shuttling and other upstream regulatory mechanisms lead to an appropriately localised activation of BMP signalling at the dorsal midline, it is of less importance exactly where the upstream components of the DV system are expressed. This, in turn, explains why the early-acting components of the DV patterning system in insects exhibit extensive amounts of developmental systems drift constrained by highly conserved downstream <b>signalling</b> <b>output...</b>|$|E

The cytoplasmic region comprises a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a RhoGTPase binding domain.

40|$|In Drosophila, the {{maternal}} terminal system specifies cell fates at the embryonic poles via the localised {{stimulation of the}} Torso receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Signalling by the Torso pathway relieves repression mediated by the Capicua and Groucho repressors, allowing the restricted expression of the zygotic terminal gap genes tailless and huckebein. Here we report a novel positive input into tailless and huckebein transcription by maternal posterior group genes, previously implicated in abdomen and pole cell formation. We show that absence of a subset of posterior group genes, or their overactivation, leads to the spatial reduction or expansion of the tailless and huckebein posterior expression domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the terminal and posterior systems converge, and that exclusion of Capicua from the termini of posterior group mutants is ineffective, accounting for reduced terminal gap gene expression in these embryos. We propose that the terminal and posterior systems function coordinately to alleviate transcriptional silencing by Capicua, and that the posterior system fine-tunes Torso RTK <b>signalling</b> <b>output,</b> ensuring precise spatial domains of tailless and huckebein expression...|$|E

So far, only auxin perception {{has been}} described to trigger the release of transcription factors termed AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs) from their AUXIN/INDOLE- 3 -ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) repressor proteins.

Signalling by RhoGTPases is tightly coordinated and requires a series of regulatory proteins, including guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). GEFs and GAPs regulate GTPase cycling between the active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states, whereas GDI is a cytosolic chaperone that binds inactive RhoGTPases. Like many other proteins, RhoGTPases are subject to degradation following the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin.
