50|$|Master of the Housebook and Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet are {{two names}} used for an {{engraver}} and painter working in South Germany {{in the last}} quarter of the 15th century. He is apparently the first artist to use drypoint, a form of engraving, for all of his prints (other than woodcuts he may have designed). The first name derives from his book of drawings with watercolour, called the Housebook, which belonged to the German noble family of Waldburg-Wolfegg from the 17th century until 2008, when they were reported to have sold it for €20 million to a Swiss buyer; however, the legality of its <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> <b>export</b> has been challenged and, for the moment, it remains with the family. In 1999, the book was lent to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., for an exhibition. http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/hsb_intro.shtm The majority of his surviving prints are in the print room at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, hence his second name. Most, but not all, art historians still agree that the Housebook and the prints are by the same artist.|$|E

Several features {{of the distribution of}} investment rates and export participation patterns observed in firm-level data are closely matched in a calibration exercise.

Using an open economy balance sheet channel model with firm heterogeneity, we explore predictors that firms will engage in global markets. Our results based on a detailed firm-level panel of data for Brazilian 10, 573 firms for the period 1996 – 2007, show that the decision to export and overall growth of <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>exporting</b> firms is driven by size, the debt ratio, the current ratio and operating costs as well as the direct impact of the crisis itself. The findings suggest that the mechanism is driven by the response of the credit market to the creditworthiness of firms as it is by changing terms of trade...|$|R

40|$|This {{report shows}} that the state's food and {{agricultural}} industry is still a significant component of the economy, although probably less so than in earlier years due mainly to agricultural commodity price declines. Agricultural output amounted to 8 percent of the state's total output in 1999, while employment in the industry represented 5 percent of total employment and 3 percent of the labor income generated in the state. Agricultural exports {{out of the state}} were 19 percent of the state's total exports. These agricultural exports generate additional indirect sales such as feedgrains sold to pork producers and farm machinery sales to crop farms. The indirect impact measures are derived using the IMPLAN input-output software package. The food and agricultural industry accounts for 213, 000 jobs, or 6 percent of the state total, when these secondary impacts of exports are considered. When all food and agricultural industry final <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>export</b> and in-state use are used as the direct measure rather than just exports, the total number of jobs directly or indirectly generated comes to 350, 000, or 11 percent of the state total. The importance of agriculture is greater on a percentage basis for the western and southeastern portions of the state. Another measure of the food and agricultural industry's contribution to the state economy is the state's strong $ 8 billion "trade surplus" in food and agricultural products. Agribusiness,...|$|R

5000|$|In 1934, {{the company}} {{created the first}} {{prototype}} inflatable boats, ancestors of the renowned [...] "Zodiac", which would {{contribute to the development}} of the civil and military inflatable boat industry. The company then benefited from the boom in leisure activities after the Second World War, as well as the French infatuation with recreational boating in the 1960s: Zodiac therefore developed inflatable boats for the civil market and gradually gave up the airship market for the more promising water sports market. Zodiac would nevertheless honor a contract in 1966 with CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales - National Centre for Space Studies) for the production of a meteorological balloon, in the scope of the EOLE project.

5000|$|The PA-15 was {{designed}} <b>for</b> commercial <b>sale,</b> primarily <b>for</b> <b>export</b> as French laws severely restricted {{the possession of}} [...] "military-caliber" [...] arms (which included the ubiquitous 9mm). The pistols were proofed at the St Etienne proof house and many were exported to the US. Early pistols are blued, later ones Parkerized. There was a competition version called the P-15 F1. This version had a longer slide and barrel (150mm), and an adjustable rear sight. While the French armed forces did not adopt the PA-15, the Army, Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and the Gendarmerie bought limited quantities of the competition model under the designation Pistolet Automatique de Précision (PAP) Modèle F1. When the French Gendarmerie {{was looking for a}} double-action pistol with a high magazine capacity to replace their aging PA 1950s, MAB produced an experimental model of the PA-15 with double-action lockwork. However, the Gendarmerie instead procured a license to manufacture the Beretta 92F as the MAS G-1, and the double-action PA-15 was not commercially produced. Outside France, in the 1970s the Finnish military and some police forces adopted the PA-15.|$|R

40|$|This project {{evaluates the}} costs and {{benefits}} of the Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC) forest certification for a large timber management organization (TIMO). FSC certification is a voluntary, market-based program that promotes sustainable forest management through third-party certification. The TIMO in this case study manages 3. 3 million acres of land certified under FSC, and this project evaluated both the direct and indirect costs and benefits of certification. This project was able to quantify the direct and indirect costs and benefits of forest certification through surveys, financial analyses and regression analyses. On average, forest certification is a net-positive program for the client, earning an estimated $ 771, 000 of additional annual revenue. Certification premiums paid for finished wood products are significantly higher than certification premiums for certified stumpage. Certified wood products receive an overall price premium of 10. 5 % while the premium for certified stumpage ranges from 1. 6 - 4. 3 %. Price premiums for finished wood products are considerably higher <b>for</b> domestic <b>sales</b> than <b>for</b> <b>export</b> <b>sales.</b> The domestic sale of finished wood products generates a statistically significant price premium of 30. 0 % as compared to the statistically significant but much lower premium <b>for</b> <b>exported</b> wood products of 3. 4 %. This project provides evidence that there are financial incentives for forestland owners to maintain forest certification. FSC has marketed both the ecological and financial benefits of maintaining forest certification. Previous studies of forest certification have generally concluded that the ecological benefits of forest certification are clear but that the desired financial benefits have not yet materialized. This project demonstrates that a large timberland owner can receive meaningful financial benefits from its forest certification program...|$|R
