25|$|Washington's state base {{sales tax}} is 6.5 percent which is {{combined}} with a local sales tax which varies by locality. As of March 2017, the combined sales tax rate in Seattle and Tacoma was 10.1 percent. The cities of Lynwood and Mill Creek have the highest <b>sale</b> <b>tax</b> rate in the state at 10.4 percent. These taxes apply to services as well as products. Most foods are exempt from sales tax; however, prepared foods, dietary supplements and soft drinks remain taxable. The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local sales tax rates, generally between 8 and 9 percent.|$|E
