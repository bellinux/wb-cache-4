Additionally, it significantly improves the interoperability between LRUs of different vendors and allows the monitoring of CANaerospace networks concerning the status of the LRUs attached to it. For further interoperability, CANaerospace defines aerospace specific axis systems with the corresponding sign conventions and physical units. Together with the predefined identifier assignment list, these definitions describe the traffic in a CANaerospace network unambiguously. The CANaerospace <b>Standard</b> <b>Identifier</b> Assignment List reserves the CAN identifiers between 300 and 1799 and assigns parameters to them as shown in the excerpt of this list (Figure 4).|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a <b>standard</b> <b>identifier</b> is analyzed for the {{case in which the}} plant contains additional dynamics, called unmodeled dynamics, which invalidate the known order assumption. An input richness condition is obtained that does not depend on the order of the unmmodeled dynamics to guarantee persistency of excitation (PE) of the regressor. It is shown that the PE condition leads to a BIBO stability property for the identifier. The method of averaging is used to define formally the notion of tuned parameters as the equilibrium of the identifier-averaged system. It is shown that the tuned parameters always exist and that the actual parameters converge to some neighborhood of the tuned parameters. An explicit expression is derived to calculate and interpret them as the fixed parameter values that minimize the mean-squared output error...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{formulae}} {{are essential}} in science, but face challenges of ambiguity, {{due to the}} use of a small number of identifiers to represent an immense number of concepts. Corresponding to word sense disambiguation in Natural Language Processing, we disambiguate mathematical identifiers. By regarding formulae and natural text as one monolithic information source, we are able to extract the semantics of identifiers in a process we term Mathematical Language Processing (MLP). As scientific communities tend to establish <b>standard</b> (<b>identifier)</b> notations, we use the document domain to infer the actual meaning of an identifier. Therefore, we adapt the software development concept of namespaces to mathematical notation. Thus, we learn namespace definitions by clustering the MLP results and mapping those clusters to subject classification schemata. In addition, this gives fundamental insights into the usage of mathematical notations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Our gold standard based evaluation shows that MLP extracts relevant identifier-definitions. Moreover, we discover that identifier namespaces improve the performance of automated identifier-definition extraction, and elevate it to a level that cannot be achieved within the document context alone...|$|E

40|$|The {{biodiversity}} informatics {{community has}} discussed aspirations and approaches for assigning globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) to biocollections {{for nearly a}} decade. During that time, and despite misgivings, the de facto <b>standard</b> <b>identifier</b> has become the "Darwin Core Triplet", which is a concatenation of values for institution code, collection code, and catalog number associated with biocollections material. Our aim is not to rehash the challenging discussions regarding which GUID system in theory best supports the biodiversity informatics use case of discovering and linking digital data across the Internet, but how well we can link those data together at this moment, utilizing the current identifier schemes {{that have already been}} deployed. We gathered Darwin Core Triplets from a subset of VertNet records, along with vertebrate records from GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data System, in order to determine how Darwin Core Triplets are deployed "in the wild". We asked if those triplets follow the recommended structure and whether they provide an easy and unambiguous means to track from specimen records to genetic sequence records. We show that Darwin Core Triplets are often riddled with semantic and syntactic errors when deployed and curated in practice, despite specifications about how to construct them. Our results strongly suggest that Darwin Core Triplets that have not been carefully curated are not currently serving a useful role for relinking data. We briefly consider needed next steps to overcome current limitations...|$|E
40|$|Copyright {{legislation}} was prompted exactly 300 {{years ago by}} a desire to protect authors against exploitation of their work by others. With regard to modern content owners, Digital Rights Management (DRM) issues have become very important since the advent of the Internet. Piracy, or illegal copying, costs content owners billions of dollars every year. DRM is just one tool that can assist content owners in exercising their rights. Two categories of DRM technologies have evolved in digital signal processing recently, namely digital fingerprinting and digital watermarking. One area of Copyright that is consistently overlooked in DRM developments is 2 ̆ 7 Public Performance 2 ̆ 7. The research described in this thesis analysed the administration of public performance rights within the music industry in general, with specific focus on the collective rights and broadcasting sectors in Ireland. Limitations in the administration of artists 2 ̆ 7 rights were identified. The impact of these limitations on the careers of developing artists was evaluated. A digital audio watermarking scheme is proposed that would meet the requirements of both the broadcast and collective rights sectors. The goal of the scheme is to embed a <b>standard</b> <b>identifier</b> within an audio signal via modification of its spectral properties {{in such a way that}} it would be robust and perceptually transparent. Modification of the audio signal spectrum was attempted in a variety of ways. A method based on a super-resolution frequency identification technique was found to be most effective. The watermarking scheme was evaluated for robustness and found to be extremely effective in recovering embedded watermarks in music signals using a semi-blind decoding process. The final digital audio watermarking algorithm proposed facilitates the development of other applications in the domain of broadcast monitoring for the purposes of equitable royalty distribution along with additional applications and extension to other domains...|$|E
