25|$|As {{a result}} of the blocked static ports, the basic flight {{instruments}} relayed false airspeed, altitude and vertical speed data. Because the failure was not in any of the instruments, but rather in a common <b>supporting</b> <b>system,</b> thereby defeating redundancy, the erroneous altimeter data was also broadcast to Air Traffic Control, who was attempting to provide the pilots with basic flight data. This led to extreme confusion in the cockpit as the pilots were provided with some data (altitude) which seemed to correlate correctly with instrument data (altimeter) while the other data provided by ATC (approximate airspeed) did not agree. Although the pilots were quite cognizant of the possibility that all of the flight instruments were providing inaccurate data, the correlation between the altitude data given by ATC and that on the altimeter likely further compounded the confusion. Also contributing to their difficulty were the numerous cockpit alarms that the computer system generated, which conflicted both {{with each other and with}} the instruments. This lack of situational awareness was revealed by the cockpit voice recorder transcript. The fact that the flight took place at night and over water, thus not giving the pilots any visual references, was also identified as a major factor.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the vacuum vessel {{is to provide a}} hermetically sealed plasma container. Its main components are the main vessel, the port structures and the <b>supporting</b> <b>system.</b> The main vessel is a double walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between [...] shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} bottlenecks to the wider adoption of planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a lack of}} evidence about whether they improve planning processes.

This paper fills this gap in the literature by reporting the results from a field study evaluating the performance of a planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> used for sketch planning as part of a land use planning project in metropolitan Austin, Texas, USA. Participants reported high levels of learning and dialog quality, the two chosen planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance measures.

In addition, as suggested by learning theory, the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance outcomes are significantly related to participantsâ€™ identity as a planner and meeting attendance, but are not related to gender or educational attainment.

Traditionally, such selection is {{on the basis of the}} experience of the design engineer. Nevertheless, the validity of such selection is questionable. A new approach for selecting the optimum tunnel <b>support</b> <b>system</b> based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed. In this new approach, {{the selection of}} the tunnel <b>support</b> <b>system</b> is considered as a multi criteria decision-making problem. Firstly, by using the numerical Finite Difference Method (FDM), based on technical and stability parameters of the tunnel, different <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> are specified.
