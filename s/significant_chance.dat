5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first <b>significant</b> <b>chance</b> came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen on the {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width {{on the right-hand side}} of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{quantity}} of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always measured by volume, especially in larger scale operations. A powder scale {{is needed to}} determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a powder trickler to add few s of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large capacity cases with fast burning, low volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a <b>significant</b> <b>chance</b> of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. [...] Some powders meter (measure by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. [...] When using volume to meter each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculus}} of pseudodifferential operators that contains both usual parameter-dependent operators [...] where a real parameter τ enters {{as an additional}} covariable [...] as well as operators not depending on τ. Parameter-ellipticity {{is characterized by the}} invertibility of three associated principal symbols. The homogeneous principal symbol is not smooth on the whole co-sphere bundle but only admits directional limits at the north-poles, encoded by a principal angular symbol. Furthermore there is a limit-family for τ→+∞. Ellipticity permits to construct parametrices that are inverses for large values of the parameter. We then obtain sub-calculi of Toeplitz type with a corresponding symbol structure. In particular, we discuss invertibility of operators of the form P_ 1 A(τ) P_ 0 where both P_ 0 and P_ 1 are zero-order projections and A(τ) is a usual parameter-dependent operator of arbitrary order or A(τ) =τ^μ-A with a pseudodifferential operator A of positive integer order μ.

2500|$|Also under NFHS rules only, all runners are {{required}} to attempt to avoid collisions. If a runner fails to do so, he is guilty of malicious contact, which is one kind of offensive interference. [...] Malicious contact carries the additional penalty of ejection from the game. [...] In contrast, in professional and higher amateur baseball, violent collisions can occur without any interference (or obstruction), especially when a fielder is receiving a thrown ball near a base where a runner is trying to reach. [...] Any collision that occurs in this situation is not interference, because the fielder's action is in regard to a thrown ball. [...] As long as such a runner's actions are related to his attempt to reach the base, he cannot be called for interference. [...] The most common case of this is when a runner is attempting to score and the catcher has control of the ball. [...] If the catcher is in the path between third base and home plate, the baserunner may strike the catcher with his body {{in an attempt to}} dislodge the ball from the catcher's hand and then reach home plate. [...] This is usually attempted only when the play is close. [...] When the catcher is set up and ready, the runner has little chance of knocking the ball away.

30|$|We model an {{election}} between two Downsian mainstream candidates {{and a third}} inflexible politician. There is uncertainty {{about the state of}} the world. Candidates receive signals on the state and propose a policy to implement. There are two classes of voters: ideological, who are biased towards the policy proposed by the third candidate; and non-ideological, who want the policy implemented to correspond to the state of the world. We study two cases: (1) one in which the third candidate supports the most popular policy (in terms of the electorate’s prior); (2) another one in which he supports the less popular policy. We obtain that the presence of a third candidate facilitates equilibria in which the two mainstream politicians make informative announcements, specially when the third candidate is biased towards the most popular policy. We also obtain that many of the informative equilibria are sustained by a coalition government, however the coalition is never between the two mainstream candidates. Last, we observe that in equilibrium, the third inflexible candidate has <b>significant</b> <b>chances</b> of winning office.|$|R

For example the word intuition agreement of the transparent compound jiāngshuǐ is 0.99 (141 / 142) and that of the opaque compound lóngyǎn is 0.97 (129 / 133); there is no significant difference. Based on our data, we cannot say that semantic transparency plays no role in word intuition of Chinese speakers, but even if semantic transparency affects the word intuition of Chinese speakers, its role is rather restricted. We also found some special forms, for example monosyllabic verb + disyllabic noun (没冷水 méi lěngshuǐ 'no cold water', 拿借款 ná jièkuǎn 'fetch borrowed money', 喝开水 hē kāishuǐ 'drink boiled water', 抽大麻 chōu dàmá 'smoke marijuana'), disyllabic noun + monosyllabic localizer (草地上 cǎodì shàng 'on the grassland', 天桥上 tiānqiáo shàng 'on the overpass'), and some other forms (脾气大 píqi dà 'violent-tempered', 天王地位 tiānwáng dìwèi 'super star status', and 幕后黑手 mùhòu hēishǒu 'black hand behind the scenes').

40|$|Abstract: The {{anticipated}} {{regime of}} ITER is the H-mode {{in which the}} ELMs can significantly deteriorate the operation. The lost plasma is dumped into the SOL and then impacts on the target producing sputtering and vaporization erosion. The following contamination of core plasma by eroded atoms can interrupt the confinement. For tokamak modelling with account for the transients, the tokamak geometry MHD codes FOREV and TOKES have been developed. The FOREV models the processes on the time scale of 1 ms with the CFC wall. The modelling for ITER plasma evolution following the carbon influxes revealed that significant impurity contamination of the edge plasma can occur, which can cause large radiation losses and eventually lead {{to the collapse of}} the confinement at lesser ELM sizes than that determined by armour lifetime limitations. The TOKES is developed for the integrated simulation on the discharge scale (10 3 s), however permitting multiple ELMs. Multi-fluid plasma and corona radiation transport are implemented. In the modelling for ITER with B-C-W wall, the scattered atoms have <b>significant</b> <b>chances</b> to strike secondarily the dome and thus produce sputtered W-atoms even with the CFC wall at the separatrix strike point. The ELMs cause untimely discharge interruption if the ELM energy exceeds the vaporization onset. To validate the codes, dedicated experiments have been carried out. CFC targets manufactured for ITER have been exposed at the plasma gun MK- 200 UG in TRINITI. On the basis of these experiments, significant plasma contamination is expected for ITER transients at the target heat deposition above 0. 5 MJ/m 2, which corresponds to the vapour shield threshold and agrees with the FOREV and TOKES simulations. 1...|$|R
