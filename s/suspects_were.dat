5|$|On September 3, 2005, {{the four}} {{detained}} <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> released {{by a judge}} despite the attempts of the prosecution {{to keep them in}} custody. The <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> released on the condition that they remain available to police. On September 14, all restrictions on them were removed by the Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.|$|E
5|$|Two bomber <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{arrested in}} a hotel in Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province, China on 15 April and repatriated to Taiwan on 17 April 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} Till arrived in Mississippi, a black activist named Lamar Smith {{was shot and}} killed in front of the county {{courthouse}} in Brookhaven for political organizing. Three white <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> arrested, but they were soon released.|$|E
3000|$|... {{otherwise}} <b>Suspect</b> i will <b>be</b> charged {{more severely}} for crimes B and/or C. The sentences {{for the two}} <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> equitably calculated, therefore, the utility functions of the two <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> symmetric.|$|R

50|$|In Antalya, two <b>suspects</b> {{thought to}} <b>be</b> {{members of the}} PKK were arrested. Since one of the <b>suspects</b> <b>was</b> {{under the age of}} 18, the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to give their witness statement to the Children's Department of the Directorate of Security.|$|R
5|$|According to {{testimony}} {{given by}} Wyatt and Virgil, both Frank McLaury and Ike Clanton {{agreed to provide}} information to assist in capturing Leonard, Head, and Crain, but they {{never had a chance}} to fulfill the agreement. All three <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> killed when attempting other robberies.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{presented the}} charges to Pre-Trial Chamber II as two separate cases, one {{case was the}} prosecution of Ali, Kenyatta, and Mathaura, and the second case is the prosecution of Kosgey, Ruto, and Sang. All six <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> accused of crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{arrested by the}} RUC in early August 1975. One of these men, Lance-Corporal Thomas Raymond Crozier (aged 25, a {{painting}} contractor from Lurgan) of C Company, 11th Battalion UDR was charged with the Miami killings. It was believed he had been betrayed to the RUC {{by a member of}} the gang.|$|E
50|$|Birgenair Flight 301 had a fatal {{pitot tube}} failure which {{investigators}} <b>suspected</b> <b>was</b> due to insects creating a nest inside the pitot tube; the prime <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> the Black and yellow mud dauber wasp.|$|R
40|$|Most of time, the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed {{innocent}} in {{the beginning}} of the penal proceeding. But this presumption of innocence is created for saving individual freedoms and reputation. The truth <b>is</b> that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty after his arrest. And the judicial authorities will check if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent or confirmed guilty. This situation can threaten individual freedoms and reputation. That is why we want to size the meaning of presumption of innocence in other to protect it, at first. Secondly, we are going to study the presumption of culpability. What is more, the fact that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty justifies the office of a barrister at any stage of the penal proceeding. In fact, before the arrest of the <b>suspect,</b> he <b>is</b> presumed innocent. After his arrest he is presumed guilty...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the title is that it refers to Rawls's demand that Santangelo close at least one case; for a homicide case to be considered [...] "closed" [...] only requires that a <b>suspect</b> <b>be</b> arrested and charged. After the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> charged, the murder is considered closed/solved even if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> not convicted; this is why, earlier in the season, Rawls pushes for arrests on murders {{in order to help}} the statistics, even though the cases are weak.|$|R
5|$|Another {{element in}} the {{ideology}} of the party was a populist fight against the political establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E
5|$|Following the assassination, Booth fled {{on horseback}} to {{southern}} Maryland, eventually {{making his way}} to a farm in rural northern Virginia 12 days later, where he was tracked down. Booth's companion gave himself up, but Booth refused and was shot by Boston Corbett, a Union soldier, after the barn in which he was hiding was set ablaze. Eight other conspirators or <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> tried and convicted, and four were hanged shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mission of}} 1946 was Operation Hebron on 8January. This time the {{objective}} was the cordon and {{search of the}} town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police, during which fifty-five <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> taken into custody. For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30January, they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv.|$|E
50|$|Samples {{collected}} by the Isle of Man Constabulary's Scientific Support Department from crime scenes are sent to the UK for testing against the database. Samples from <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> also added to the database, but are removed if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> not convicted of the crime.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the crime}} drama Numb3rs, <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> often {{mentioned}} {{to have done}} time at Chino and met criminal associates there. In season 5 episode 14, a <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> threatened with incarceration in his home country, which [...] "makes Chino look like Chuck E. Cheese".|$|R
50|$|Search {{incident}} to arrest: A suspect and the <b>suspect's</b> immediate surroundings <b>are</b> searched {{at the time}} the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> arrested.|$|R
5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the cause of the explosion. Primary <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> Litoral Gas (the natural-gas provider for Rosario) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day. Several public figures sent condolences, and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Cornfoot's {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by members of}} the aristocracy appointed by the Privy Council two weeks after the killing. Subsequently four men were held in custody and charges were to be brought against the burgh bailie. The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick Cowper, the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the Privy Council that another committee should look into the events, no <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> ever prosecuted for the murder.|$|E
5|$|In March 1826, a French-Canadian {{man named}} Methode, his Native American wife, and their {{children}} were gathering maple syrup in present-day Iowa, about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien, when they were murdered, apparently by a Ho-Chunk raiding party that had been passing through. The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims, who were targets of opportunity. Two Ho-Chunk <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe turn over the murderers.|$|E
50|$|An inquest uses witnesses, but <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> not {{permitted}} to defend themselves. The verdict can be, for example, natural death, accidental death, misadventure, suicide, or murder. If the verdict is murder or culpable accident, criminal prosecution may follow, and <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> able to defend themselves there.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> an Algerian {{national}} {{living in}} the Paris suburb of Bezons. He had no previous convictions by a French court. [...] As of 20 August <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> being held in hospital and {{is not expected to}} to recover sufficiently to be questioned for several weeks.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> {{immediately}} {{identified in}} an assault case, {{the victim is}} sure to live. When no <b>suspect</b> has <b>been</b> identified, the victim will surely die.|$|R
5|$|In {{autumn of}} 1991, Croatian {{intelligence}} services launched Operation Janissary (Operacija Janjičar) aimed at dismantling the remaining KOS network in Croatia. The operation was a joint operation of all Croatian intelligence services. It was authorized by Ivan Vekić and Gojko Šušak, then interior and defence ministers, and initially headed by Josip Perković. Fifteen <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{arrested by the}} end of 1991; they were subsequently exchanged for Anton Kikaš, who was captured by the JNA while smuggling a plane-load of weapons to Croatia. The operation also produced a list of suspected KOS operatives in Croatia containing 1,789 names and pseudonyms.|$|E
5|$|Not all, one <b>suspects,</b> <b>were</b> yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold obviously {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of spiritual power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{deliberate}} attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was not enough for {{some members of the}} division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.|$|E
50|$|An {{unidentified}} <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> {{arrested in}} December 2010.|$|R
50|$|On 15 March, police {{carried out}} a raid on a house in Forest, a suburb of Brussels, in {{relation}} to the November 2015 Paris attacks. Four police officers were wounded in the raid, while one <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> killed. The dead <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> identified as Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} of the five <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> separated into four cases; Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui are being tried together {{and the other three}} <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> being tried individually. The trial of Bosco Ntaganda started in September 2015. At this moment, Sylvestre Mudacumura was still not arrested.|$|R
5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 2004, two {{suspected}} attackers {{were captured}} after an hour-long siege {{of a building}} in The Hague. They were in possession of three grenades and were accused of planning to murder Wilders {{as well as a}} fellow MP, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> presumed to be members of what the Dutch intelligence agency, the General Intelligence and Security Service, has termed the Hofstad Network (Hofstadgroep). Since this incident Wilders has been under constant security protection because of frequent threats to his life. In September 2007, a Dutch woman was sentenced to a one-year prison term for sending more than 100 threatening emails to Wilders. In 2009, a rapper from Rotterdam was sentenced to 80 hours community service and a two-month suspended jail term for threatening Wilders in a rap song. Wilders was listed as the most threatened politician in the Netherlands in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
50|$|The broom test {{uses the}} laws of physics to put the accused at a {{distinct}} disadvantage. The <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> seated upon a small seat which provides very little support or balance. After some ritual actions, the bristle ends of two brooms are pushed against the front of the suspect's neck. If the brooms separate, or rather if the potential witch is able to remain upright, then the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent. If the brooms do not separate, and the accused is pushed from the seat, the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> guilty.|$|R
