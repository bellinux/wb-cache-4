5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
50|$|David tells Lila {{that all}} the bodies they have {{accumulated}} are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> {{and that they will}} have to leave the house soon. As they prepare to leave, David packs a suitcase filled with his belongings and some clothes for Alice. When Lila discovers the suitcase, she marches to the garage and checks all the coolers where David has stored the bodies, looking for Alice. Not seeing her corpse, Lila looks for Alice. When she puts her eye up to a hole in the crawlspace door, Alice stabs Lila with her knife. The two struggle, but the Alice overpower the severely wounded Lila.|$|E
5000|$|What was {{supposed}} to be $12,000 quickly climbed to almost $40,000 in renovations. The work is being paid for by the City of Elmira, owner of the 73 year old stadium, and will go from the entrance way all the way to some of the seating being done and repainted. Bathrooms without tile will be a thing of the past. Most notable is a section of stadium seating ripped out.Don Lewis is the new co-owner of the Elmira Pioneers, along with Nellie Franco-Nichols. [...] "The structure where the seating is actually attached to was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> away and deteriorate from old age,” Lewis said. Workers are now working to fill in that hole with new steel. Other sections of the stadium will also need the same repair.|$|E

50|$|After its {{completion}} in 1862 the bridge gradually <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> and was finally proposed {{to be replaced}} by a concrete construction.

50|$|The team reviews {{what they}} know. The cause is not {{aspergillus}} nor rat bite fever. Alfredo tested negative for moraxella, nocardia and cryptococcus. Chase mentions that Alfredo {{has a low}} titer for Chlamydia antibodies, but this is dismissed by Foreman because the chest X-rays do not match a Chlamydial pneumonia. Chase persists but Cameron says the titer is probably caused by a STD Alfredo had last year. DIC would not cause a fever this high. House takes Alfredo's temperature and sees that the patient's right hand is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot.</b> House wants to amputate the hand but Cuddy refuses to let that happen. She blames it on the medicine they gave him. If Alfredo loses that hand, he loses his job. House comments {{that this is not}} medical thinking. House tells Stacy that Cuddy now agrees to the amputation and he begs for legal clearance. Cuddy tells Alfredo that it is necessary, and he tearfully agrees to the procedure.|$|E

50|$|Cassava is {{primarily}} grown and eaten in rural areas. Its perishability is a constraint to breeding and innovation because {{it when the}} crop <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> within days, it cannot be analyzed in a lab for any long periods of time.

The fruit is edible, though {{not as good as}} the European Pear, mostly because of hard, stone like objects found in the skin.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} built by Henry Wolf on the Plank Road, {{that had been}} constructed between Rockville and Bellmore around 1850. The Plank Road was a toll road that would stretch from Indianapolis, in the east, to the Wabash River, in the west. However, the planking didn't hold up and they soon <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot.</b> The boards were removed and the road was graveled. In 1867 or 1877 the Parke County Commissioners bought the companies stock and opened the road as a free road.|$|R
50|$|The flavor will {{strongly}} {{depend on}} the quality of the fruit, therefore it is advisable to use only hand picked, healthy, well ripened, fresh fruit, if possible from an ecologic culture, and avoid getting leaves, peduncles or pieces of branches into the jar.

50|$|While P. longisetula is {{best known}} for infecting {{strawberry}} crops, it can also infect other plants, including apricots, peaches, guava, and tomato fruits. Some plants such as beans are immune to the disease. It takes on average about two weeks for mature plants to be fully infected, while plants at an earlier stage of growth spread infection more slowly. Infected areas become covered with white mycelia growth and the host plant <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> from the skin to the core of the plant. The plant as a whole suffers as the leaves develop lesions with spores to spread the disease.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{firewood}} is {{harvested in}} [...] "woodlots" [...] managed for that purpose, but in heavily wooded areas {{it is more}} usually harvested as a byproduct of natural forests.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} {{in the form of}} a runestone (rune inscription U 358) that there have been Christian people in the area since at least the early 11th century.

50|$|The {{uprights}} of {{the ranks}} were generally made of green larch or green elm, some 15 ft long and from 8 to 9 in {{in diameter and}} sunk into the foreshore by between 6 and 8 ft.

Some poles at Goldcliff, probably those at the seaward ends of the ranks, were reported to have lasted for forty years.

The uprights were then beaten into the ground, in pairs, five feet apart, using an iron lined yew beetle.|$|R

30|$|Post-harvest biodeterioration of ware yam largely {{starts from}} the field, {{resulting}} from the injuries on yam tubers before storage. The invading fungal pathogens are subsequently carried from the field to the yam barn. In most cases, these infections are latent and only become noticed after incubation and the infected tubers <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot.</b> However, besides human activities, insects pests, rodents and nematodes that predispose yam tubers <b>to</b> <b>rot,</b> other factors such as sprouting, tuber respiration, temperature {{and the degree of}} resistance or susceptibility of yam genotypes to invading pathogens also influence yam storage. Cultural practices such as continuous cropping also encourage the persistence of yam pathogens and enhance their transition from the previous cropping season to the next season. Temperature influences yam storability. Yams store best at 28 [*]±[*] 2 °C in Nigeria. Although storage at lower temperaturs reduces microbial rotting, it causes chilling damage to yam tubers. Storage at temperatures higher than 30 °C increases the incidence of xerophilic fungi like Aspergillus niger and Penillium oxalicum. Therefore, correct manipulation of temperature during storage can also prolong the shelf life of ware yam.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>rot</b> when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|R
