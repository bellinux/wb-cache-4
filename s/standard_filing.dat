5000|$|Meek was {{the first}} major {{candidate}} of either party to declare his candidacy, on January 13, 2009. After [...] "serious and careful thought", three days later, Sink reiterated her decision to run for re-election. Following her decision, Dan Gelber said that he [...] "had been really waiting for her" [...] and had been [...] "prepared to fully support her." [...] He also said that [...] "I expect I'll be entering the race in the coming weeks." [...] On January 27, he declared his candidacy. The following day, Allen Boyd also declined to run. In March, it was reported that while Gelber was [...] "consumed" [...] with the legislative session, Meek was raising money and collecting endorsements, including from former President Bill Clinton. Gelber replied, [...] "Frankly the practicality is, it's just hard to find hours in the day to make phone calls right now." [...] At {{the end of the first}} fundraising quarter, Meek reported raising $1.5 million. He also decided to gain ballot access via petitions, rather than paying the <b>standard</b> <b>filing</b> fee. He said that collecting the required 100,000 petitions would [...] "keep me engaged with the people of Florida".|$|E

40|$|Public {{institutions}} and organizations organize documents, which result from their services, communications and procedures, according to predetermined classification systems {{in order to}} find them rapidly and easily when they are needed. The purpose of this study called "Standardization in the Filing Systems of Public Institutions and Organizations" is, in general, to find out that standardization in the filing systems of public {{institutions and}} organizations is unavoidable in order to have an organized, effective, rapid and productive system for records, files, communication and archives. Regarding private organizations, the purpose is to prove that standardization of file numbering is possible in advising, supervising and supplementary services and to bring forward suggestions on this topic. In this study, the methods of ""description and survey"" are used. Firstly, filing and classification systems and the importance of filing {{from the point of view}} of archives and administrations are examined. The filing plans taken as examples are introduced and by making comparisons, their similarities and differences are explained. After these comparisons it is shown that standardization of subject numbers, used in filing plans of advising, supervising and supplementary services, is possible. Then advising, supervising and supplementary services for which standardization will be provided are examined and it is explained how standardization is to be carried out. The advantages arising from standardization are explained by preparing a <b>standard</b> <b>filing</b> plan. To profit from the advantages arising from standardization, it is suggested to; a- Develop and prepare a <b>standard</b> <b>filing</b> plan covering all Turkey, b- From a commission among institutions and organizazions to realize this, c- Appoint the Turkish Standardization Institute, The Institute of Turkey and Middle East Public Administration or the Head of Department of Administrative Development of the Prime Ministry as the Secretariat of the commission...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS An {{inexpensive}} feature card {{retrieval system}} has been combined with the Systematised Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) to provide simple but efficient means of indexing and filing 2 in. x 2 in. transparencies within a department of pathology. Using this system 2400 transparencies and the associated index cards can be conveniently stored in one drawer of a <b>standard</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet. The preparation of photographic transparencies of pathological specimens requires expertise and the expenditure of considerable time and money. This effort is largely wasted if the transparencies cannot readily be retrieved from storage. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe an efficient and inexpensive filing and retrieval system for 2 in. x 2 in. trans-parencies which have been coded with the System-atised Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) (1965). These codes are then regarded as features that can be retrieved with punched feature cards. The syste...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of records management in secondary health care delivery system. The {{purpose of the study}} is to appraise the records and archive management in all the recorded information generated in the state hospitals under the secondary health care delivery system, through the process of creation, preparation, disposal distribution, use, storage, retention and disposition of records, determining the validity of documents and its existence in the hospital. A descriptive survey was adopted with simple percentage analysis. 50 respondents were selected from two state hospitals in Osun State Nigeria. 50 copies of questionnaire was administered and 46 copies of questionnaire were returned with a response rate of 92 %. The findings revealed that lack of uniform retention policy, absence of legal authority on disposal records and document, lack of funds to purchase <b>standard</b> <b>filing</b> shelves and cabinets, and lack of attention by the hospital managements was responsible for misfiling, mislaying, overcrowding and reduced storage space in the state hospitals. It was recommended that legal authority should be instituted nationwide to support records retention and disposal schedules and archive documents for effective and efficient record management in secondary health care delivery system in Nigeria. 1...|$|E
