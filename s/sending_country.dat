In 2009 Egypt was the biggest recipient of remittances in the Middle East; {{an estimated}} US$7.8 bn was received in 2009, representing approximately 5% of national GDP, with a decline of 10% from 2008, due mostly to the effect of the financial crisis. According to data from Egypt's Central Bank, the United States was the top <b>sending</b> <b>country</b> of remittances (23%), followed by Kuwait (15%), the United Arab Emirates (14%) and Saudi Arabia (9%).|$|E
25|$|Employment {{conditions}} abroad {{are relevant}} to the individual worker and their families {{as well as for the}} <b>sending</b> <b>country</b> and its economic growth and well being. Poor working conditions for Filipinos hired abroad include long hours, low wages and few chances to visit family. Women often face disadvantages in their employment conditions as they tend to work in the elder/child care and domestic. These occupations are considered low skilled and require little education and training, thereby regularly facing poor working conditions. Women facing just working conditions are more likely to provide their children with adequate nutrition, better education and sufficient health. There is a strong correlation between women's rights and the overall well being of children. It is therefore a central question to promote women's rights in order to promote children's capabilities.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel has {{continued}} to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions which help potential immigrants to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews consider leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to “preserve their Judaism,” while 12.4 percent said they were attracted by other countries. “Economic considerations” was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community will have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France’s economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. During the Hebrew year 5774 (September 2013 - September 2014) for the first time ever, more Jews made Aliyah from France than any other country, with approximately 6,000 French Jews making aliyah, mainly fleeing rampant antisemitism, pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist violence and economic malaise with France becoming the top <b>sending</b> <b>country</b> for aliyah as of late September 2014.|$|E

50|$|Brain Drain {{literature}} focuses {{mainly on}} {{the high cost of}} skilled migration for the homeland or <b>sending</b> <b>country.</b> This loss can be partly offset if the migration is only temporary. Developing countries invest heavily in education. However, temporary migration can generate a substantial remittance of capital flow to the homeland. This flow of capital plus the additional knowledge gained would do more than compensate the homeland for the investment made originally in educating the skilled worker. The key to temporary migration is a change in the trade and immigration policies of the receiving country and a stepping-up of the demands of the <b>sending</b> <b>country</b> for the return migration of skilled workers.|$|E

30|$|Among the {{economic}} variables introduced {{to account for}} the standard pull and push factors of migration in the host and the <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> respectively, almost all of them have a highly significant impact on migration, with the estimated coefficients showing the expected signs. Fluctuations in the unemployment rates in the destination countries are apparently very relevant for the decision to emigrate, since an increase in unemployment by one percentage point decreases the inflow of migrants by seven percent. Notably, the effect of increasing GDP per capita in the <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> by $ 1, 000 has about the same magnitude. Further, our quadratic specification reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita income in the <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> and emigration, but the estimated turning point of the hitherto negative relationship far exceeds the sample mean of income in the countries of origin.|$|R
50|$|Some consuls are not career {{officials}} of the represented state at all; some are locally engaged staff with the nationality of the <b>sending</b> <b>country,</b> and in smaller cities, or in cities that are very distant from full-time diplomatic missions, a foreign government which feels {{that some form of}} representation is nevertheless desirable may appoint a person who has not hitherto been part of their diplomatic service to fulfill this role.

30|$|Figure  3 A shows illustrative {{selected}} enclaves {{patterns for}} the period 2001 – 2011.

The case of India and Pakistan, which are traditional <b>sending</b> <b>countries,</b> shows a positive correlation, suggesting that there are established enclaves which are attractors for future migration inflows. On the contrary, the right column for A 8 countries shows a negative or null correlation between the variables. This illustrates the fact that the A 8 <b>countries</b> are new <b>sending</b> <b>countries,</b> and as such there were almost no established enclaves in 2001 (the only exception is the London borough of Ealing which had a large Polish concentration).

40|$|Recently, the European Commission has {{proposed}} {{to introduce a}} new mi- gration policy instrument - Blue Cards - to attract highly skilled workers from abroad by lifting labour market restrictions, offering financial and housing ben- efits. The excludability character of human capital suggests that what is benefi- cial for receiving countries might be hfirmful for <b>sending</b> <b>countries.</b> This article investigates if and why high-skill migration in general and Blue Card scheme in particular might be hfirmful for <b>sending</b> <b>countries.</b> We find that the proposed Blue Card scheme makes the developing country growth prospects indeed blue. However, compared to other firms of labour migration, the upcoming Blue Card scheme is known well in advance. Analysing alternative policy options we show that, taking advantage of this ex-ante infirmation, targeted and timed policy interventions can minimise the adverse impacts of high-skill emigration. Thus, compared to other migration regimes Blue Cards are worse for <b>sending</b> <b>countries,</b> but they offer better opportunities for them to avoid the adverse impacts...|$|R

50|$|Social {{remittances}} in {{the forms}} of social capital, ideas, and behaviors move both out {{of the community and}} into it, prompting the transmigrant as well as the <b>sending</b> <b>country</b> to experiment with ideas about politics, practices, and even gender relations.

However, <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> run the risk of skill shortages in certain occupations or sectors, as well as instability of public finances. On the other hand, Elsner (2013 a, 2013 b) identifies positive effects of out-migration on wages in Lithuania; additionally, outmigration might uncover potential benefits through brain circulation.|$|R

30|$|The {{resurgence}} of large-scale immigration motivated {{the development of}} a large literature that examines how labor markets in both receiving and <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> react to the immigration-induced change in supply. The textbook model of a competitive labor market suggests that higher levels of immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers, {{at least in the short}} run. Despite the common-sense intuition behind these predictions, the empirical literature seems full of contradictory results. Some studies claim that immigration has a substantial impact on wages in receiving and <b>sending</b> <b>countries</b> (e.g., Borjas 2003; Mishra 2007), while other studies claim the impact is negligible (Card 2005; Ottaviano and Peri 2012).|$|R
