5|$|Administration of alprazolam, as {{compared}} to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the <b>striatum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the <b>striatum</b> are a number of basal {{forebrain}} structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the <b>striatum</b> and neocortex.|$|E

5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the <b>striatum,</b> others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal <b>striatum,</b> the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the <b>striatum,</b> but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the <b>striatum</b> and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|The Reginae strain hybrids were {{produced}} by Jan de Graaff {{and his two}} sons in the Netherlands in the mid 19th century by crossing Hippeastrum vitatum and Hippeastrum <b>striatum</b> with Hippeastrum psittacinum {{and some of the}} better hybrids available in Europe at the time. Some of the most successful hybrids were Graveana and Empress of India.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the <b>striatum</b> and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Neurotoxic {{effect of}} {{mephedrone}} on serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the <b>striatum</b> and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Vascular {{cells are}} known to play a {{prominent}} role in regulating proliferation of adult neural precursors. In the adult subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the vasculature, especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny. The vasculature also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury in the adult <b>striatum.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{analysis}} shows {{that rather than}} fruit body structure, spore size is generally a more reliable character for segregating species groups in Cyathus. For example, species in the ollum clade all have spore lengths less than 15µm, while {{all members of the}} pallidum group have lengths greater than 15µm; the <b>striatum</b> group, however, cannot be distinguished from the pallidum group by spore size alone. Two characteristics are most suited for distinguishing members of the ollum group from the pallidum group: the thickness of the hair layer on the peridium surface, and the outline of the fruit bodies. The tomentum of Pallidum species is thick, like felt, and typically aggregates into clumps of shaggy or woolly hair. Their crucible-shaped fruit bodies do not have a clearly differentiated stipe. The exoperidium of Ollum species, in comparison, has a thin tomentum of fine hairs; fruit bodies are funnel-shaped and have either a constricted base or a distinct stipe.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the <b>striatum)</b> in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>striatum</b> is a {{subcortical}} structure generally divided into the dorsal <b>striatum</b> and ventral <b>striatum,</b> although a medial lateral classification {{has been suggested}} to be more relevant behaviorally and is being more widely used.|$|E
25|$|Increase in the Volume of the <b>Striatum.</b> A {{study in}} 2010 found that psychopathic {{individuals}} showed a 10 {{percent increase in}} the volume of the <b>striatum.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, Andreas Vesalius and Francesco Piccolomini {{were the}} first to {{distinguish}} between white matter, the cortex, and the subcortical nuclei in the brain. About a century later, Thomas Willis noticed that the corpus <b>striatum</b> was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus <b>striatum</b> played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 19th century when electrophysiologic stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while David Ferrier performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, John Hughlings Jackson posited that the motor cortex was more relevant to motor function than the corpus <b>striatum</b> after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus <b>striatum</b> would not be completely incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Some other {{research}} shows an abnormality in dopamine transporter density in the <b>striatum</b> of social anxiety sufferers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{research}} shows that the binding affinity of dopamine D2 receptors in the <b>striatum</b> of social anxiety sufferers is lower than in controls.|$|E
25|$|Primary reward {{processing}} {{has also}} {{been associated with the}} orbitofrontal cortex and the grey matter density in the ventral <b>striatum,</b> whereas higher RD scores were associated with the interactions between dopamine projections, neuropeptides and opiates in the ventral <b>striatum.</b> It is demonstrated here, then, that there is evidence for a structural disposition of the brain towards social interactions, and that both sensitivity to salient social reward cues and primary reward processing share the same brain systems.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine also {{causes the}} release of {{dopamine}} in the dorsal <b>striatum</b> and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral <b>striatum),</b> but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1–A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of 1 adenosine A1 receptor and 1 adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to drug tolerance.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Vogt-Mugnier rediscovered the {{so-called}} ‘status marmoratus’ of the corpus <b>striatum,</b> characterized by slow, writhing, purposeless movements mainly affecting {{the hands and}} face. This syndrome had already been described by Gabriel Anton in 1896, however his paper attracted little attention whereas Vogt-Mugnier's report {{brought it to the}} forefront of research in basal ganglia pathology. Vogt-Mugnier continued to lead the pioneering work on the neuroanatomy of the thalamus and together with Hermann Oppenheim published their findings on hereditary palsy and double athetosis, in which she noted the mottled appearance of the <b>striatum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spines {{are found}} on the {{dendrites}} of most principal neurons in the brain, including the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex, the medium spiny neurons of the <b>striatum,</b> and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|High reward {{dependence}} {{is characterized}} by learning from reward signals, persisting repetition of actions {{that are associated with}} rewards, increased sociability and a need for social approval. The <b>striatum,</b> especially the dorsal regions, is necessary to carry out these functions.|$|E
25|$|The names {{given to}} the various nuclei of the basal ganglia are {{different}} in different species. In cats and rodents the internal globus pallidus {{is known as the}} entopeduncular nucleus. In birds the <b>striatum</b> is called the paleostriatum augmentatum and the external globus pallidus is called the paleostriatum primitivum.|$|E
25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the <b>striatum.</b> Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as no surprise that chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|Though {{invasive}} tracer {{studies are}} largely not possible in humans, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography {{studies have also}} been used to map the connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex to cortical and subcortical brain structures. Connections in the human orbitofrontal cortex follow a conserved pattern, similar to what is shown in tracer studies in rhesus macaques, but with a distinct pattern of connectivity with regions of the <b>striatum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The International Basal Ganglia Society (IBAGS) informally {{considers}} the basal ganglia {{to be made}} up of the <b>striatum,</b> the pallidum (with two nuclei), the substantia nigra (with its two distinct parts), and the subthalamic nucleus, whereas Terminologia anatomica excludes the last two. Some neurologists have included the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus as part of the basal ganglia, and some have also included the pedunculopontine nucleus.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 {{research}} conducted by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, {{it was found that}} self-esteem is related to the connectivity of the frontostriatal circuit. The frontostriatal pathway connects the medial prefrontal cortex, which deals with self-knowledge, to the ventral <b>striatum,</b> which deals with feelings of motivation and reward. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|In a murine {{model of}} JE, {{it was found}} that in the {{hippocampus}} and the <b>striatum,</b> the number of activated microglia was more {{than anywhere else in the}} brain closely followed by that in the thalamus. In the cortex, the number of activated microglia was significantly less when compared with other regions of the mouse brain. An overall induction of differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from different brain regions during a progressive Japanese Encephalitis infection was also observed.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{subcortical}} projections {{are shared}} between the <b>striatum,</b> particularly ventral reward-related areas,. Connectivity with thalamic and periaqueductal grey areas further suggests {{a role for}} the orbitofrontal cortex in both inhibitory and excitatory regulation of autonomic function. Parallel processing loops in connectivity between cortico-striatal networks seem {{to be involved in}} the processing of goal-directed and habitual action, whereas cortico-limbic connectivity seems to be of prime importance for action selection, implicating the basolateral amygdala, and the integration of information into behavioral output.|$|E
25|$|In rats, subcutaneously {{administered}} bufotenin (1–100 μg/kg) distributes {{mainly to}} the lungs, heart, and blood, and to a much lesser extent, the brain (hypothalamus, brain stem, <b>striatum,</b> and cerebral cortex) and liver. It reaches peak concentrations at 1 hour and is nearly completely eliminated within 8 hours. In humans, intravenous administration of bufotenin results in excretion of (70%) of injected drug {{in the form of}} 5-HIAA, an endogenous metabolite of serotonin, while roughly 4% is eliminated unmetabolized in the urine. Orally administered bufotenine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase.|$|E
25|$|As an {{application}} of the free-choice paradigm, the study How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the <b>striatum</b> changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) and How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine {{inhibits}} the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET), {{preventing the}} reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain along with inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine in specific brain regions {{such as the}} prefrontal cortex, where dopamine transporter (DAT) expression is minimal. In rats, atomoxetine increased prefrontal cortex catecholamine concentrations without altering dopamine levels in the <b>striatum</b> or nucleus accumbens; in contrast, methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was found to increase prefrontal, striatal, and accumbal dopamine levels to the same degree. In mice, atomoxetine was also found to increase prefrontal catecholamine levels without affecting striatal or accumbal levels.|$|E
25|$|Social Reward Dependence {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the temporal lobes, the caudate Grey Matter Density (GMD) in the orbitofrontal cortex and the basal ganglia of the ventral <b>striatum.</b> These structures, which are rich in dopamine receptors, are known to {{play a crucial role in}} reward receipt, Incentive anticipation and simple and discrete primary and secondary rewards prediction errors. These significant findings show a correlation between primary reward processing circuits and reward dependence, keeping with the fMRI research studies that demonstrated that, following the experience of complex rewards the activation of the striatal circuits occur.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{triazine}} derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, {{leading to}} stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and has weak 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor inhibition. These actions {{are thought to}} inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral <b>striatum</b> limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala, suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved, although this concept is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{has also}} been found in HAND {{patients}}’ brains. In fact, the amount of quinolinic acid found in the brain of HAND patients can be up to 300 times greater than that found in the CSF. Neurons exposed to quinolinic acid {{for long periods of}} time can develop cytoskeletal abnormalities, vacuolization, and cell death. HAND patients’ brains contain many of these defects. Furthermore, studies in rats have demonstrated that quinolinic acid can lead to neuronal death in brains structures that are affected by HAND, including the <b>striatum,</b> hippocampus, the substantia nigra, and non-limbic cortex.|$|E
25|$|Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) {{researchers}} {{have shown that}} reward dependence is linked to opiate receptor binding (the endorphine system) in the bilateral ventral striatum: a core substrate of the reward circuit which is strongly implicated in addictive behavior development. These findings demonstrate that people with high reward dependence (who feel a greater need for social rewards and verbal approval) have more opiate receptors found in the ventral <b>striatum,</b> whereas people with low reward dependence have a lower concentration of receptors. It is then suggested that increased ventral striatal opiate receptors could provide the biological link between personality traits and substance abuse risk.|$|E
