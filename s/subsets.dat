5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} <b>subsets</b> of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two <b>subsets</b> consists of the cells in even positions at even time steps and the cells in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of the cells in even positions at odd time steps and the cells in odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two <b>subsets</b> {{can be viewed as}} a cellular automaton with only its half of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Cellular {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating <b>subsets,</b> and perform updates {{on one of the}} two <b>subsets</b> at a time. In each update, every cell that can flip does so. This defines a reversible cellular automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Rule 90 and Rule 102 {{are called}} {{additive}} cellular automata. This means that, if two initial states are combined by computing the exclusive or of each their states, then their subsequent configurations will be combined {{in the same}} way. More generally, one can partition any configuration of Rule 90 into two <b>subsets</b> with disjoint nonzero cells, evolve the two <b>subsets</b> separately, and compute each successive configuration of the original automaton as the exclusive or of the configurations on the same time steps of the two <b>subsets.</b>|$|E

A developer can use SWSDL to access <b>Subset</b> Service, thus handle <b>subset</b> of web service code. A <b>Subset</b> WSDL {{can be used}} to perform web service testing and top down development. Slicing of a web service can be done using a <b>Subset</b> WSDL to access <b>Subset</b> Service. <b>Subset</b> Service can be categorized into layers using SWSDL.

5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating <b>subsets,</b> then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two <b>subsets</b> is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E

5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell <b>subsets</b> bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various <b>subsets</b> {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Specialised <b>subsets</b> of English arise spontaneously in {{international}} communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language.

5|$|The three {{variants}} of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some <b>subsets</b> from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings.
