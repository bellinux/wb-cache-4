40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the historical development of}} Friedrich Nietzsches physiological relativism through {{a reading of}} his private and published works as well as several of the periodicals and <b>scientific</b> <b>popularizations</b> with which he was familiar. Nietzsches early interest in the relationship between genius and physiology was influenced by Arthur Schopenhauers insistence that geniuses were able to intuitively understand the objective world because of their unique physiological organization. However, the more physiology Nietzsche encountered the more doubts he had about Schopenhauers philosophical claims and Richard Wagners re-articulation of them. Nietzsches rejection of Schopenhauer and Wagner can be seen in his changing assessment of the limits of knowledge and the meaning of genius, of physiological, moral, and psychological vivisection, and how he came to see a close relationship between cruelty, necessity, and knowledge. Nietzsches understanding of life as a process of dynamic self-regulation featured many similarities with other physiological thinkers of his age including Claude Bernard and his idea of the milieu intrieur and Hermann von Helmholtzs account of the active nature of perception. Nietzsches interest in educational reform, experimentation, and self-fashioning was a further development of his exploration of how organisms and individuals achieved a state of relative freedom and independence through their interdependence from their physical and cultural environments. His interest in the intersection of physiology, aesthetics, and epistemology led him to define meaningful freedom and creativity in terms of how individuals related to their own limitations and crafted new limitations for themselves. Even basic physiological perceptions were creative, for just as perceptions shaped ideas and experiences, ideas and experiences shaped perceptions. Nietzsches understanding of creativity within limits was the compliment of his idea of how an individuals independence was achieved through more refined forms of interdependence with their physical, perceptual, cultural, and cosmic environments. The bermensch was the culmination of this process. Just as organisms and individuals achieved states of relative independence through interdependence with their environments, the bermenschs independence was achieved through how they tamed contingency by assimilating the cosmos in its entirety by willing the eternal return of the same...|$|R

40|$|Bioartists {{appropriate}} and interpret scientific concepts to create artworks related to activities of life. How {{and if the}} biosciences can become art will be assessed by examining the impact of genetic studies on contemporary artistic conceptualizations and representations of human, animal, and vegetal organisms. Transpositions of science into art are not a peculiarity of contemporary age, as {{the history of western}} culture has been shaped by hypotheses, theories, and discoveries travelling from the sciences to the arts. It is thus the specificity of artistic responses to specific scientific stimuli that calls for attention. Since the 1990 s genomics has excited our imagination and what humans are made of has been explored from the perspective of scientifically oriented art. Systematic study of the genes has generated artistic responses involving both the construction and commodification of a symbolic imagery. The impact of genetics on artistic creativity can be comprehended by examining new forms of representation, cultural icons, and symbols, but also by assessing the commercialization of genetics research material. Extending its scope of intervention well beyond health research, medical practice, or pharmaceutical industry, the work of bioscientists resonates outside the <b>scientific</b> community. <b>Popularization</b> of genomic research has aroused strongly polarized responses, ranging from deep anxiety to unwavering optimism for the scientists’ capacity to gain deeper and deeper knowledge of the structure and function of genes and exert greater control over the course of human life. Bioscientific experiments and results obtained in the laboratories, hypotheses and theories are constantly transfused into artworks and displayed in exhibitions. Art which incorporates material from genetic research has assumed different shapes and gained public recognition as Ars Genetica, Ars Chimaera, Tissue Culture and Art, Wet Biology Art Practice: the variety of definitions shows that a new critical vocabulary is required to investigate contemporary intersections between the arts and the biosciences. Interrogated and interpreted by artists, bioscientific knowledge is used to create items which are claimed to possess aesthetic quality and generate aesthetic experience. Owing to the union of organic matter, artistic creativity, and technological processes, bioart has an enormous resonance in the social sphere. In order to understand its protean nature, the theoretical frameworks and critical tools traditionally provided by aesthetics and sociology of art need to be remoulded, and ideological components must be examined...|$|R
40|$|Do animals work? Such is the {{question}} raised by the ANR COW program (2012 - 2017). Breaking {{with the idea that}} work is a unique feature of humans, we made the hypothesis that animals also are actors of work and that their contributions to work may be investigated using the theories and methods of social sciences, especially the psychodynamics of work. We explored the animal's relationship towards work in different professional fields, including animal husbandry. Regarding this topic we discuss the slaughtering of animals and its legitimacy. Our results in this particular area show that, especially for moral reasons, animal farmers urgently need alternatives to industrial slaughterhouses. Our results on {{the question}} of animal work show that animals also have their own way of working. They engage their subjectivity, their intelligence and their affectivity in work. Their agentivity goes much further than the prescribed work procedures. This means that animals have a precise idea of the work objectives: they are not conditioned or mechanized, they take initiatives, they can manoeuvre to avoid work rules or avert them. Our results show that trust and affectivity are key elements in the animal's involvement in work. These results have been publicized through two important colloquiums, the publication of <b>scientific</b> and <b>popularization</b> articles as well as a book and a film. This output serves as a base to discuss our results concerning animals within the field of social and human sciences both in France and in other countries. Les animaux travaillent-ils[*]? C'est la question qu'a posée le programme ANR COW (2012 - 2016).
