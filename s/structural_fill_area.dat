40|$|Today, fly ash {{is being}} used as a <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> {{material}} in highway and railway embankments, for ash pond bunds, levees, <b>filling</b> low-laying <b>areas</b> etc. Seepage induced failures in the form of piping can weaken and affect the performance of an embankment constructed with fly ash as a <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> material. This paper presents a study to examine the effect of randomly distributed geofibers on the piping behaviour of fly ash. in this study, a number of experiments were carried out for determining the seepage velocity and piping resistance of fly ash, mixed randomly with flexible polyester fibers having various dosages and lengths. Seepage velocity of flow of water through fly ash is calculated for each case and compared with an unreinforced fly ash. It was observed that fibers reduced the seepage velocity, increased the piping resistance of fly ash and delays the attenuation of piping phenomena considerably. Finally the mechanism by which discrete and randomly distributed fibers restrain piping of fly ash is explained with the fly ash fiber interaction. (C) 200...|$|R

Their effective reuse and recycling through large-scale geotechnical projects, such as port reclamation, is economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable. In this study, CW and BOS were blended in order to explore the possibility to obtain synthetic fills having geotechnical properties similar or superior to conventional fills, therefore suitable as a <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> for the Port Kembla Outer Harbour reclamation near Wollongong City, Australia. A framework with four levels of acceptance is proposed in this paper to select granular waste as <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> materials. This framework was used for optimising the CW-BOS blend. It was found that for the Port Kembla Outer Harbour reclamation, a CW-BOS blend with a BOS content between 30 and 45 % can meet most geotechnical specifications (i. e. high shear strength and bearing capacity, low swelling and particle breakage levels, and adequate permeability) required for a suitable <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> above the high tidal level...|$|R

The results indicate that particle breakage has a strong influence on the geomechanical behaviour of coalwash. Furthermore, the influence of particle breakage on the critical state behaviour was also analysed.

40|$|Coal wash (CW) {{and steel}} furnace slag (SFS) are {{granular}} waste by-products {{that result from}} {{the operation of the}} coal mining and the steel industries, respectively. Their effective reuse and recycling as fill materials for earthwork construction, embankments and/or <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> materials in port expansion projects, is economically attractive and environmentally sustainable because it lessens the need for disposal and sourcing of materials from local quarries. As the need for blending these materials arises from their individual adverse geotechnical characteristics, i. e. swelling and breakage behaviour in SFS and CW, it is important to evaluate the suitability of different mixtures ratios particularly in terms of shear strength and swelling potential to meet various performance criteria for <b>structural</b> <b>fills.</b> This paper presents an experimental study on the compacted SFS and CW source materials and SFS-CW blends prepared on a dry weight basis. First the basic index properties of the mixtures are described and the shear strength and swelling behaviour were examined through drained triaxial compression and free swelling tests according to the expected performance criteria of <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> materials for port reclamation. The experimental data suggests that while different blends exhibited different stress strain behaviour, they showed some degree of similarity in terms of the stress-strain relationships. Furthermore, the results confirm that the addition of CW reduces the swelling potential of the mixture...|$|R

Through experimental work, a pilot study was launched to probe mixture designs and engineering behaviors of <b>structural</b> flowable <b>fills</b> incorporating WFS from multiple foundry facilities with diverse casting backgrounds.

The relative density of the tailings was varied as Dr = 50 %, 70 % and 90 %. An incremental load was applied on the footing while observing the settlement until the failure took place. The results obtained for tailings were compared with those for the sandy soil. It is observed that the load-bearing capacity and stiffness increase {{with an increase in}} footing embedment depth and relative density. Compared to load-settlement behaviour of Perth sandy soil, the tailings fill could have as high as 22 times and 13. 5 times the load-bearing capacity and stiffness, respectively. Therefore, the replacement of sandy soil with iron ore tailings for <b>structural</b> <b>fills</b> is cost-effective, and moreover, this application contributes to environmental sustainability in construction...|$|R

While its potential use as fill material for port reclamation has been recognised, the effect of particle breakage on its geomechanical performance has not been investigated. This paper presents an experimental study of the stress-strain behaviour and associated breakage of compacted coalwash. The characterization of basic index properties is first presented and stress-strain response is investigated using standard undrained triaxial tests {{over a wide range}} of effective confining stresses in line with the expected performance criteria of <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> materials for port reclamation. Furthermore, to account for the effect of moisture variation on particle breakage, alternate wetting and drying cycles on coalwash aggregate was performed. Substantial particle degradation was observed after 25 cycles of wetting and drying. Results show that while the compacted coalwash conforms to typical <b>structural</b> <b>fill</b> criteria in terms of shear strength, the excessive deformation associated with change of particle size distribution due to particle breakage may render the material unsuitable in practice...|$|R

We scanned a phantom {{filled with water}} or with 100, 50, or 5  % v/v concentrations of CM and then virtually produced CM-delayed projection data by partially replacing the projection images. Artifacts {{as a function of}} concentration, percentage of filling time, and size and position of the <b>filling</b> <b>area</b> were assessed. In addition, we used an automatic power injector with different injection delays to inject CM during the scans. A decrease in filling times caused by a lag in CM arrival during the scan resulted in a decrease in pixel values, distortion of the <b>filling</b> <b>area,</b> and appearance of streak artifacts. Even a delay of approximately 20  % in CM arrival in the total scan time resulted in obvious distortion of the <b>filling</b> <b>area.</b> The distortion and streak artifacts tended to worsen at higher CM concentrations. Use of a minimum CM concentration based on the purpose of the examination and constant filling at the target region are effective for avoiding these artifacts. © 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the percentage of voids, gutta-percha and root canal sealer using 4 different filling techniques. Fifty-two extracted maxillary lateral incisors were prepared using the crown-down pressureless technique. The teeth were randomly divided in 4 groups (n= 13) : Lateral compaction (LC), Tagger's hybrid (TH), MicroSeal (MS) and GuttaFlow (GF) techniques. Horizontal cross-sections were made at the 2, 10 and 15 mm levels from the apex. Digital images of the root canal areas were acquired using a stereomicroscope and examined using the Image Tool 3. 0 software. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (&# 945;= 0. 05). In general, a significant decrease in the gutta-percha <b>filled</b> <b>area</b> and increase of sealer area were observed at the apical level for all the evaluated techniques (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The use of coal ash in <b>structural</b> <b>fills</b> {{to support}} {{footings}} and pavements in low lying areas {{can be one}} of the cost effective and environmentally friendly solutions to disposal problems related to coal ash, because wastes can be consumed in large quantities in such applications. The difficulty with this ash disposal solution is that the <b>structural</b> <b>fills</b> may not meet the foundation requirements for bearing capacity and settlement, especially when footings and pavements are constructed near the crest of the ash fill slope. Inclusion of geosynthetic reinforcements as horizontal sheets within the fill may be one of the most viable techniques for improving the load bearing capacity of the coal ash slope. Most technical information available in the literature on the load bearing capacity of footings resting on the slopes is based on small scale laboratory model tests; hence practicing engineers cannot generally adopt the information realistically. Therefore, in the present study as described in this paper, large scale model footing tests were conducted in the laboratory to find out the effectiveness of use of single and multilayer geosynthetic reinforcements in improving the load bearing capacity of coal ash slope. The results were found to be encouraging and they may have practical applications...|$|R

The goal of this project is to develop a classification system for fly ash based on parameters that relate to performance specification of engineering and construction applications.
