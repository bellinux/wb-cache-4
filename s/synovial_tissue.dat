The production of PGs in <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> is catalyzed by an enzyme cascade that includes phospholipase A 2 s (PLA 2 s), cyclooxygenases (COXs), and terminal PG synthases. There are two isoforms of COX expressed in <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues.</b> COX- 1 is constitutively expressed in synovia, particularly in synovial lining cells.

In-vitro, COX- 2 expression in synovial cells is dramatically increased by proinflammatory cytokines, phorbol ester, and stimulation of certain cell surface receptors. A number of different transcription factors are likely {{to be involved in the}} up-regulation of COX- 2 in <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues.</b> Expression of COX- 2 is inhibited by glucocorticoids in synovial cells as in other cell types.

Early intervention followed by early diagnosis can result in disease remission; however, both early stage diagnosis and provision of effective treatment have been impeded by the heterogeneity of RA, which details of pathological mechanism are unclear.

Methods: Using immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and real-time PCR we investigated {{the expression of}} TRAIL, TRAIL receptors and several key molecules of the intracellular apoptotic pathway in human <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> from various types of arthritis and normal controls. <b>Synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inactive RA, osteoarthritis (OA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA) and normal individuals were studied. Results Significantly higher levels of TRAIL, TRAIL R 1, TRAIL R 2 and TRAIL R 4 were observed in <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> from patients with active RA compared with normal controls (p < 0. 05). TRAIL, TRAIL R 1 and TRAIL R 4 were expressed {{by many of the}} cells expressing CD 68 (macrophages).

Higher levels of survivin and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (xIAP) were expressed in active RA <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> compared with inactive RA observed at both the protein and mRNA levels.

50|$|Changes in the {{expression}} of CD97 have been described for auto-inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The expression of CD97 on macrophage and the abundant presence of its ligand CD55 on fibroblast-like synovial cells suggest that the CD97-CD55 interaction {{is involved in the}} recruitment and/or retention of macrophages into the <b>synovial</b> <b>tissue</b> in rheumatoid arthritis. CD97 antibodies and lack of CD97 or CD55 in mice reduced synovial inflammation and joint damage in collagen- and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis. In brain tissue, CD97 is undetectable in normal white matter, and expression of CD55 is fairly restricted to the endothelium. In pre-active lesion, increased expression of CD55 in endothelial cells and robust CD97 expression on infiltrating leukocytes suggest a possible role of both molecules in immune cell migration through the blood-brain barrier.

To explore this hypothesis, we have investigated the expression in RA <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> of various embryonic growth factors from the wingless (wnt) and frizzled (fz) families, which have been implicated in cell-fate determination in both bone marrow progenitors and limb-bud mesenchyme. Reverse transcriptase–PCR analysis revealed expression of five wnt (wnt 1, 5 a, 10 b, 11, and 13) and three fz (fz 2, 5, and 7) isoforms in RA <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues.</b> Osteoarthritis <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> expressed much less wnt 5 a and fz 5.

One patient taking acetyl salicylic acid at 75 mg {{at the time of the}} biopsy presented with hemarthrosis 48 h after the procedure, which resolved following simple arthrocentesis. A definitive diagnosis was achieved in 16 % of the patients where <b>synovial</b> <b>tissue</b> was sampled successfully. CONCLUSION: US-guided synovial biopsies in clinical practice can be performed safely on patients with undifferentiated arthritis and with heterogeneous presentations. The rate of success in acquiring <b>synovial</b> <b>tissue</b> is high. The procedure usually retrieves quality tissue and leads to a definite diagnosis in a significant minority of patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is new bone formation and bone resorption at sites of chronic inflammation. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} the hyperplasia and inflammation of <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> are significantly related to the pathogenic process of AS. The present study used a proteomic approach to identify novel AS-specific proteins by simultaneously comparing the expression profiles of synovial membranes from patients with AS, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Methods <b>Synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected from the hip joints of patients with AS and knee joints of patients with RA or OA (n = 10 for each disease) during joint replacement surgery. Proteins extracted from the <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> were separated by 2 -D electrophoresis (2 -DE), and the proteins with significantly increased expression in the AS samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS analysis. The results were verified using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Levels of the candidate proteins in synovial fluids from knee joints (n = 40 for each disease) were measured using ELISA. Results The proteomic approach revealed significantly increased expression of carbonic anhydrase I (CA 1) in the synovial membrane of patients with AS as compared with the RA and OA tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis confirmed the findings described above. The ELISA detected a higher level of CA 1 in synovial fluids from patients with AS than those with OA. The mean value of the CA 1 level was also higher in AS patients as compared with RA patients. This study also detected increased expression of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin in the <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> from AS patients, which is in agreement with other reports. Conclusion In vitro experiments by other groups indicated that CA 1 catalyzes the generation of HCO 3 - through the hydration of CO 2, which then combines with Ca 2 + to form a CaCO 3 precipitate. Calcification is an essential step of bone formation. Substantial evidence indicates that carbonic anhydrase also stimulates bone resorption. Hence, overexpression of CA 1 in the <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> of AS patients may promote improper calcification and bone resorption in AS. </p...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{interleukin}} 6 (IL 6 /B cell stimulatory factor- 2) were detected in synovial fluids from the joints {{of patients with}} active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The cells found in freshly isolated synovial fluid constitutively expressed IL 6 mRNA. The <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> obtained by joint biopsy were also found to produce IL 6 in vitro. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that CD 2 + T cells as well as CD 20 + blastoid B cells in the <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> produce IL 6. The data indicate that IL 6 is generated constitutively in RA and its overproduction may explain the local {{as well as the}} generalized symptoms of RA, since IL 6 can function as B cell growth and differentiation factor as well as hepatocyte-stimulating factor...|$|R
40|$|RA {{associated}} with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation {{has been a}} major health problem among the population worldwide. In this study protective effect of methanolic extract of Adhatoda vasica leaf (AVE) was evaluated on Collagen-induced arthritis in male Swiss albino mice. Post oral administration of AVE at 50, 100 and 200  mg/kg body weight doses decreased the arthritic index and footpad swelling. AVE administration diminished pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues.</b> Reduced chemokines and neutrophil infiltration in <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> after AVE administration dictated its protective effect against RA. Decreased LPO content and SOD activity along with concomitant rise in GSH and CAT activities from liver, spleen and <b>synovial</b> <b>tissues</b> indicated regulation of oxidative stress by AVE. In addition decreased CRP in serum along with suppressed TLR- 2 expression in CIA mice after AVE treatment was also observed. Protective effect of AVE in RA is further supported from histopathological studies which showed improvement during bone damage. In conclusion this study demonstrated A.  vasica is capable of regulating oxidative stress during CIA and therefore down regulated local and systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which might be linked to mechanism of decreasing synovial TLR- 2 expression via downregulating release of its regular endogenous ligands like CRP...|$|R
