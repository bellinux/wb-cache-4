This study aimed at evaluating the influence of microencapsulated bitter compounds on human appetite and energy intakes. A microencapsulated bitter ingredient (EBI) with a core of bitter Gentiana lutea root extract and a coating of ethylcellulose–stearate was developed and included in a vanilla microencapsulated bitter ingredient-enriched pudding (EBIP). The coating masked bitterness in the mouth, allowing the release of bitter <b>secoiridoids</b> in the gastrointestinal tract. A cross-over randomised study was performed: twenty healthy subjects consumed at breakfast EBIP (providing 100 mg of <b>secoiridoids)</b> or the control pudding (CP) on two different occasions. Blood samples, glycaemia and appetite ratings were collected at baseline and 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after breakfast.

In this work, the phenolic composition was studied in six major cultivars grown in the same orchard under the same agronomical and environmental conditions in an effort to test the effects of cultivars on phenolic composition in fruits and oils as well as on transfer between matrices. The phenolic fractions were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. A total of 33 phenolic compounds were determined in the fruit samples and a total of 20 compounds in their corresponding oils.

40|$|Abstract – The {{quality of}} {{extra virgin olive}} oil (EVOO) is deeply related to the amount of its minor compounds, chiefly {{volatile}} and phenolic compounds, which confer the sensory note and the remarkable nutritional and biological properties of this traditional Mediterranean fruit juice. Several agronomic aspects and technological factors affect the qualitative and quantitative composition of these compounds in EVOO. The most abundant natural antioxidants of EVOO are tocopherols, carotenoids and hydrophilic phenols. The EVOO phenols represent a group of secondary plant metabolites not often present in other oils and fats. The class of the hydrophilic phenols includes phenolic alcohols and acids, flavonoids, lignans and <b>secoiridoids.</b> The latter group is exclusively found in the Oleacease family plants of which the olive is the only edible fruit and it is considered as the most important fraction from a biological point of view. In particular, the <b>secoiridoids</b> are the most relevant phenols associated to health and biological proprieties and, at the same time, they are responsible for the bitter and pungency sensory notes of EVOO. The new approach to the EVOO extraction technologies is oriented towards the improvement of the virgin olive oil healthy and sensory properties by optimizing the oil mechanical extraction process conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} the olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet on breast cancer risk might be underestimated when HER 2 (ERB B 2) oncogene-positive and HER 2 -negative breast carcinomas are {{considered}} together. We here investigated the anti-HER 2 effects of phenolic fractions directly extracted from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) in cultured human breast cancer cell lines. Methods Solid phase extraction followed by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to isolate phenolic fractions from commercial EVOO. Analytical capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry was performed to check for the composition and to confirm {{the identity of the}} isolated fractions. EVOO polyphenolic fractions were tested on their tumoricidal ability against HER 2 -negative and HER 2 -positive breast cancer in vitro models using MTT, crystal violet staining, and Cell Death ELISA assays. The effects of EVOO polyphenolic fractions on the expression and activation status of HER 2 oncoprotein were evaluated using HER 2 -specific ELISAs and immunoblotting procedures, respectively. Results Among the fractions mainly containing the single phenols hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, the polyphenol acid elenolic acid, the lignans (+) -pinoresinol and 1 -(+) -acetoxypinoresinol, and the <b>secoiridoids</b> deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone, ligstroside aglycone, and oleuropein aglycone, all the major EVOO polyphenols (i. e. <b>secoiridoids</b> and lignans) were found to induce strong tumoricidal effects within a micromolar range by selectively triggering high levels of apoptotic cell death in HER 2 -overexpressors. Small interfering RNA-induced depletion of HER 2 protein and lapatinib-induced blockade of HER 2 tyrosine kinase activity both significantly prevented EVOO polyphenols-induced cytotoxicity. EVOO polyphenols drastically depleted HER 2 protein and reduced HER 2 tyrosine autophosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. EVOO polyphenols-induced HER 2 downregulation occurred regardless the molecular mechanism contributing to HER 2 overexpression (i. e. naturally by gene amplification and ectopically driven by a viral promoter). Pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 prevented EVOO polyphenols-induced HER 2 depletion. Conclusion The ability of EVOO-derived polyphenols to inhibit HER 2 activity by promoting the proteasomal degradation of the HER 2 protein itself, together with the fact that humans have safely been ingesting <b>secoiridoids</b> and lignans {{as long as they have}} been consuming olives and OO, support the notion that the stereochemistry of these phytochemicals might provide an excellent and safe platform for the design of new HER 2 -targeting agents. </p...|$|R
