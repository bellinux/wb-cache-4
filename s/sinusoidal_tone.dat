The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation or CESSB) achieves about 3.8dB of peak reduction for speech transmission.

In {{addition to}} these well-known parametric tools, {{it might also be}} desirable to synthesize parametric <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tones</b> in the decoder. Low computational complexity is an important criterion in codec development and essential for acceptance and deployment. Therefore, efficient ways of generating these tones are needed. Since contemporary codecs like AAC or USAC are based on an MDCT domain representation of audio, we propose to generate synthetic tones by patching tone patterns into the MDCT spectrum at the decoder. We demonstrate how appropriate spectral patterns can be derived and adapted to their target location in (and between) the MDCT time/frequency (t/f) grid to seamlessly synthesize high quality <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tones</b> including sweeps...|$|R

He supported the idea that perception of sound derives from signals from nerve cells of the basilar membrane and that the elastic appendages of these cells are sympathetically vibrated by pure <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tones</b> of appropriate frequencies.

When excited with one ore more <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tones,</b> the diode generates harmonic components that are reflected back through the antenna. Normally, only the fundamental and the second harmonic are effectively re-irradiated because of antenna inefficiency at other frequencies [33]. The presence of harmonic components in the received signal allows the receiver to easily identify the tag contribution among clutter components that are received superimposed to the signal backscattered by the tag at the fundamental frequency.|$|R
50|$|When a {{sinusoidal}} signal and a sinusoidal masker (tone) are presented simultaneously the envelope {{of the combined}} stimulus fluctuates in a regular pattern described as beats. The fluctuations occur at a rate defined by {{the difference between the}} frequencies of the two sounds. If the frequency difference is small then the sound is perceived as a periodic change in the loudness of a single tone. If the beats are fast then this can be described as a sensation of roughness. When there is a large frequency separation, the two components are heard as separate tones without roughness or beats. Beats can be a cue to the presence of a signal even when the signal itself is not audible. The influence of beats can be reduced by using a narrowband noise rather than a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tone</b> for either signal or masker.|$|E
50|$|The {{generation}} of standard SSB modulation results in large envelope overshoots {{well above the}} average envelope level for a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tone</b> (even when the audio signal is peak-limited). The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform.

This results in an effective average power increase of about 140%.Although the {{generation of}} the CESSB signal can {{be integrated into the}} SSB modulator, it is feasible to separate the generation of the CESSB signal (e.g. in form of an external speech preprocessor) from a standard SSB radio. This requires that the standard SSB radio's modulator be linear-phase and have a sufficient bandwidth to pass the CESSB signal. If a standard SSB modulator meets these requirements, then the envelope control by the CESSB process is preserved.|$|E
50|$|By way of example, {{consider}} a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tone</b> of 262 Hz, which corresponds approximately to middle C on a piano, played in one ear, while {{a slightly different}} frequency tone of 260 Hz is played to the other ear. When one listens to only one side, that person will hear a constant tone. However, when listening to both sides simultaneously, the hearer perceives {{the sound of a}} rhythmic pulse. This perception is similar to hearing a beat frequency on a nominally middle C carrier tone, something that could be achieved by bringing two speakers in near proximity to one another and using them to interfere with pressure waves in the air by playing a 262 Hz tone on one and a 260 Hz tone on the other. The fundamental difference between these two cases is that, in the latter, eardrums are vibrated in a way that includes pulsating beats, whereas in the former the MSO is fooled into reacting {{in the same way as}} it would to a single speaker emitting a tone corresponding to a middle C that's swaying back-and-forth.|$|E

Our analysis allows the roles of time and frequency to be exchanged, and we study the particular problem of estimating the frequency of a pure <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tone</b> from a small number of random samples in the time domain. Thus, for signals parameterized by an unknown translation in either the time or frequency domain, our theoretical bounds and experimental results confirm that random measurements provide an economical means for capturing and recovering such information...|$|E

The scheme includes sampling as well as binary encoding, and the input signal in the experiment was a 1. 25 -GHz <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>tone</b> that was successfully digitized with a nominal resolution of 21 digital levels. Single-sample measurements yielded an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 2. 6, which was limited by thermal detection noise while multisample averaged measurements resulted in an ENOB of 3. 6 bits, mainly limited by phase drift. Apart from the experimental results, this paper covers an extensive theoretical analysis of the system, including calculations on the fundamental maximum bandwidth, the required optical power, the generated binary code, and its error robustness, as well as the impact of detection noise on the signal-to-noise ratio of the digitized signal.

Recent observations revealed that CO is an inducer of cell expansion in wheat root segments, acting similarly to IAA and NO. Evidence also indicated that IAA could result in either the potent induction of HO- 1 transcript or endogenous CO releasing in wheat root segments.

We applied event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate how temporal regularity impacts pre-attentive and attentive processing of deviance in the auditory modality.

In the attentive session, the P 3 b was smaller for deviant tones embedded in irregular temporal structure, while the N 2 b component remained unaffected. These findings confirm that temporal regularity can reinforce cognitive mechanisms associated with the attentive processing of deviance.
