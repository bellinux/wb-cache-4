He is described as having [...] "the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had". His professional attitude contrasts with Wemmick's more outwardly pleasant home and personal life. Jaggers was a <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> man who did not seem to pay Wemmick well, and when Pip tried to buy a boat he had made fun of him, calling the young boy poor.|$|E

In relation to great powers, he makes the following points: The United States is still preeminent but the legitimacy, effectiveness, and durability of its leadership is increasingly questioned worldwide because {{of the complexity of}} its internal and external challenges. ... The European Union could compete to be the world's number two power, but this would require a more robust political union, with a common foreign policy and a shared defense capability. ... In contrast, China's remarkable economic momentum, its capacity for decisive political decisions motivated by clearheaded and <b>self</b> <b>centered</b> national interest, its relative freedom from debilitating external commitments, and its steadily increasing military potential coupled with the worldwide expectation that soon it will challenge America's premier global status justify ranking China just below the United States in the current international hierarchy. ... A sequential ranking of other major powers beyond the top two would be imprecise at best. Any list, however, has to include Russia, Japan, and India, as well as the EU's informal leaders: Great Britain, Germany, and France.|$|E
