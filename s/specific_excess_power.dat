The onset of the <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> apparently develops in a gradual manner.

In an effort to increase {{the magnitude of the}} <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> output, slits were introduced into the larger cathodes to increase the perimeter to area ratio. Two SEC systems were used during the course of these experiments. Using data from the first SEC system we find that four of seven (57 %) of the experiments with slit cathodes showed an <b>excess</b> thermal <b>power,</b> averaging 322 mW (ranging from 136 to 509 mW) and five of fourteen (36 %) of the experiments with no cathode slits gave <b>excess</b> thermal <b>power,</b> averaging 171 mW (ranging from 115 to 233 mW).

40|$|A need {{exists to}} safely {{integrate}} Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System. Replacing manned aircraft's see-and-avoid capability {{in the absence}} of an onboard pilot is one of the key challenges associated with safe integration. Sense-and-avoid (SAA) systems will have to achieve yet-to-be-determined required separation distances for a wide range of encounters. They will also need to account for the maneuver performance of the UAS they are paired with. The work described in this paper is aimed at developing an understanding of the trade space between UAS maneuver performance and SAA system performance requirements. An assessment of current manned and unmanned aircraft performance was used to establish potential UAS performance test matrix bounds. Then, nearterm UAS integration work was used to narrow down the scope. A simulator was developed with sufficient fidelity to assess SAA system performance requirements for a wide range of encounters. The simulator generates closest-point-of-approach (CPA) data from the wide range of UAS performance models maneuvering against a single intruder with various encounter geometries. The simulator is described herein and has both a graphical user interface and batch interface to support detailed analysis of individual UAS encounters and macro analysis of a very large set of UAS and encounter models, respectively. Results from the simulator using approximate performance data from a well-known manned aircraft is presented to provide insight into the problem and as verification and validation of the simulator. Analysis of climb, descent, and level turn maneuvers to avoid a collision is presented. Noting the diversity of backgrounds in the UAS community, a description of the UAS aerodynamic and propulsive design and performance parameters is included. Initial attempts to model the results made it clear that developing maneuver performance groups is required. Discussion of the performance groups developed and how to know in which group an aircraft belongs for a given flight condition and encounter is included. The groups are specific to airplane, flight condition, and encounter, rather than airplane-only specific. Results and methodology for developing UAS maneuver performance requirements are presented for each maneuver as well. Results for the vertical maneuver indicate that a minimum <b>specific</b> <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> value can assure a minimum CPA for a given time-to-go prediction. However, smaller values of <b>specific</b> <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> may achieve or exceed the same CPA if the UAS has sufficient speed to trade for altitude. Level turn results are less impacted by <b>specific</b> <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> and are presented as a function of turn rate. The effect of altitude is also discussed for the turns. Next steps and future work are discussed. Future studies will lead to better quantification of the preliminary results and cover the remainder of the proposed test matrix.

40|$|Review of the {{procedures}} used to select engines for transport and combat aircraft by illustrating {{the procedures}} for a long haul CTOL transport, a short haul VTOL transport, a long range SST, and a fighter aircraft. For the CTOL transport, it is shown that advances in noise technology and advanced turbine cooling technology will greatly reduce the airplane performance penalties associated with achieving low noise goals. A remote lift fan powered by a turbofan air generator is considered for the VTOL aircraft. In this case, the lift fan pressure ratio which maximizes payload also comes closest to meeting the noise goal. High turbine temperature in three different engines is considered for the SST. Without noise constraints it leads to an appreciable drop in DOC, but with noise constraints the reduction in DOC is very modest. For the fighter aircraft it is shown how <b>specific</b> <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> requirements play the same role in engine selection as noise constraints for commercial airplanes...|$|E

These advanced capabilities in the form of superagility and supermaneuverability will require special design techniques which translate advanced air combat maneuvering requirements into design criteria. Control design metrics can provide some of these techniques for the control designer. Thus study presents an overview of control design metrics and investigates metrics for advanced fighter agility. The objectives of various metric users, such as airframe designers and pilots, are differentiated from the objectives of the control designer.

40|$|A limited aerodynamic, {{stability}} and control, and task {{evaluation of a}} new rocket-powered Mars airplane design was conducted. The Mars airplane design, designated the Argo VII, was patterned after the NASA ARES- 2 design. The aerodynamic and {{stability and}} control parameters of the Argo VII were determined using analytical and computational techniques and were {{comparable to those of}} the ARES- 2. The Argo VII was predicted to be statically stable and damped in all axes on Earth and Mars. A series of flight tests were performed using a MATLAB Simulink-based flight simulation program to assess the performance, longitudinal flying qualities, and mission effectiveness of the Argo VII flying on Earth and Mars. At an assumed Mars mission flight condition of 2 km (6, 562 ft) altitude and 0. 65 Mach, the Argo VII had a maximum range lift coefficient of 0. 44, a maximum lift-todrag ratio of 15. 5, and a maximum endurance lift coefficient of 0. 76. The Argo VII was dynamically stable and damped in the longitudinal axis.

40|$|Many {{advances}} in technology are expected to increase the capabilities of next generation aircraft, and these advances will increase the thermal load on the aircraft as well. In order to assess and account for these increased thermal loads, three studies were performed: a fuel pump trade study, a high energy pulsed system (HEPS) implementation study, and a legacy vehicle environmental control system (ECS) study. The fuel pump study addresses {{the effect of the}} implementation of a centrifugal fuel pump versus a variable displacement fuel pump. Traditionally, aircraft designers have used a centrifugal fuel pump over a piston based pump based primarily on mass, volume, cost, and reliability. This study considers <b>specific</b> <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> (SEP), fuel burn and thermal margin and shows the piston based pump performing superior mainly because it eliminates fuel recirculation resulting in an increased thermal margin. This investigation demonstrates the benefit of capturing component level models and thermal concerns in the conceptual design process. Both of these issues are vital to the development of future aircraft designs. Additional research needs to be completed to compare both pumps based on the mass and volume of each system. The second study investigates the implementation of a HEPS device at an air vehicle level. HEPS generate excessive amounts of heat during operation, creating challenges in how to integrate them into an aircraft without overwhelming the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s power and thermal management systems (TMS). In order to evaluate the impact of the HEPS electrical and thermal load on the aircraft 2 ̆ 7 s mission, a vehicle level modeling and simulation (M 2 ̆ 6 S) effort must be executed of the power and thermal management systems. To accurately evaluate the total effect on the aircraft, the HEPS must be integrated into a Tip to Tail (T 2 T) model of the system that includes the aircraft power and thermal management subsystems. With the HEPS system integrated into the T 2 T model, not only can its mass and volume effects be analyzed, but also the transient power and thermal loads created by the new system can be evaluated for their effect on other aircraft subsystems. Furthermore, the aircraft subsystems can be optimized to vehicle level metrics instead of subsystem level only. This will result in a more effective and balanced overall aircraft design. Using a T 2 T model to evaluate the integration of a HEPS system on an aircraft will enable assessment of its overall impact to next generation aircraft. Therefore, the significant impact of highly dynamic power and thermal loads on next generation aircraft is addressed. The third study is the implementation of an air cycle based ECS in a legacy (4 th generation) air vehicle. Relatively few {{attempts have been made to}} define appropriate validation testing constructs for T 2 T analysis in a transient mode of operation. Current research addresses the process of validation testing using legacy aircraft systems in order to acquire relevant data that will lead to the validation of existing models, and different modeling methods. The model developed in this work will eventually be utilized in these validation efforts at a later date. To this end, an air vehicle system (AVS), turbine engine, generator, and environmental control system (ECS) have been modeled in a T 2 T model of the actual legacy system. In particular, this study will focus on the creation and integration of the ECS model. The ECS uses an air cycle machine, which utilizes a Brayton refrigeration cycle to cool the air to the cockpit and avionics. The ECS model will be shown to successfully cool these components while subjected to varying bleed rates from the turbine engine...|$|E
