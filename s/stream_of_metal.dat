40|$|In the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{process a}} {{rotating}} pin inserted into a seam literally stirs the metal from {{each side of}} the seam together. It is proposed that the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} pin-tool comprises a primary rapid shear over a cylindrical envelope covering the pin-tool and a relatively slow secondary flow taking the form of a ring vortex about the tool circumference. This model is consistent with a plastic characterization of metal flow, where discontinuities in shear flow are allowed but not viscous effects. It is consistent with experiments employing several different kinds of tracer: atomic markers, shot, and wire. If a rotating disc with angular velocity w is superposed on a translating continuum with linear velocity omega, the trajectories of tracer points become circular arcs centered upon a point displaced laterally a distance v/omega from the center of rotation of the disc in the direction of the advancing side of the disc. In the present model a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> approaching the tool (taken as the coordinate system of observation) is sheared at the slip surface, rapidly rotated around the tool, sheared again on the opposite side of the tool, and deposited in the wake of the tool. Local shearing rates are high, comparable to metal cutting in this model. The flow patterns in the vicinity of the pin-tool determine the level of homogenization and dispersal of contaminants that occurs in the FSW process. The approaching metal streams enfold one another as they are rotated around the tool. Neglecting mixing they return to the same lateral position in the wake of the tool preserving lateral tracer positions as if the metal had flowed past the tool like an extrusion instead of being rotated around it. (The seam is, however, obliterated.) The metal stream of thickness approximately that of the tool diameter D is wiped past the tool at elevated temperatures drawn out to a thickness of v/ 2 (omega) in the wiping zone. Mixing distances in the wiping zone are multiplied in the unfolded metal. Inhomogeneities on a smaller scale than the mixing length are obliterated, but structure on a larger scale may be transmitted to the wake of a FSW weld...|$|E
40|$|The {{modeling}} {{of the gas}} metal-arc (GMA) welding process in three dimensions for moving heat sources has been attempted using the finite element method. The occurrence of finger penetration in the weldment resulting from a <b>streaming</b> type <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> transfer at high contents is explained by assuming that the heat content of transferring droplets is distributed in a certain volume of the workpiece below the arc. Volumetric distribution of the heat content of transferring droplets has been considered as an internal heat-generation term, and the differences between penetration characteristics in two cases <b>of</b> globular and <b>streaming</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> transfer have been analyzed. It is shown that weld penetration depends on the depth at which the droplets distribute their energy inside the workpieces. Temperature dependence of thermo-physical properties, i. e [...] thermal conductivity and specific heat, has been included. Latent heat is incorporated by a direct iteration method. Heat losses from the plate caused by convection and radiation are also considered. The model is validated by predicting the weld-bead dimensions and comparing them with experimental data...|$|R

50|$|The alloy was the {{end result}} of a {{research}} program into amorphous metals carried out at Caltech. It was {{the first of a series}} of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates. Amorphous metals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> molten <b>metal</b> on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.|$|R

Hitherto Titus had desired to {{preserve}} all the Temple, {{even to the}} outer courts and cloisters, but now he commanded that the gates, built of great beams of cedar and overlaid with silver plates, should be fired. Through a storm of spears and arrows soldiers rushed {{up to them and}} thrust lighted brands into every joint and hinge. They caught, and presently the silver plates ran down their blazing surface in molten <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Nor was this all, for from the gates the fire spread to the cloisters on either side, nor did the outworn Jews attempt to stay its ravages. They drew back sullenly, and seated in groups upon the paving of the Court of Women, watching the circle of devouring flame creep slowly on. At length the sun rose. Now the Romans were labouring to extinguish the fire at the gateway, and to make a road over the ruins by which they might advance. When it was done at last, with shouts of triumph the legionaries, commanded by Titus himself and accompanied by a body of horsemen, advanced into the Court of Women. Back before them fled the Jews, pouring up the steps of the Gate Nicanor, on the roof of which Miriam was chained to her pinnacle. But of her they took no note, none had time to think, or even to look at a single girl bound there on high in punishment for some offence, of which the most of them knew nothing. Only they manned the walls to right and left, and held the gateway, but to the roof where Miriam was they did not climb, because its parapet was too low to shelter them from the arrows of their assailants.|$|R
40|$|The {{spray forming}} process {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} rapid solidification processing with the cost advantages associated with near net shape processing. High pressure gas impinges on a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> molten <b>metal</b> and atomises it into an array of fine droplets. The gas then accelerates these droplets towards a moving substrate where they are collected and a near net shaped preform is formed incrementally. Preforms may have billet, tube or strip geometries depending on {{the configuration of the}} substrate manipulation system. This paper will describe and discuss the key stages of the process of gas atomisation, droplet flight, deposition and microstructural evolution, and will highlight current knowledge and recent advances. It will also address the future directions of research and development. An important technological requirement, for instance, is increased yield through the reduction of over-sprayed powder and the control of preform shape.

40|$|Osprey {{process is}} a new kind <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> forming technology. In this process, a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> liquid <b>metal</b> is {{atomized}} into a spray of molten droplets by a high velocity inert gas jet. The atomized droplets are accelerated towards a substrate of suitable shape and size. At the same time, they are rapidly cooled by the surrounding relatively cold gas and thereby partly solidified. After a certain flight distance, the droplets impinge on the cold substrate, and solidification continuous on the substrate. Near-net shaped products can be manufactured by this process. In this study, a simple mathematical model is established to describe the atomizing gas velocity profile and the velocity, thermal and solidification profiles <b>of</b> rapidly cooled <b>metal</b> droplets <b>of</b> different sizes during the in flight droplet-gas interaction. Given the relevant spray parameters, the model allows to predict quickly the transient droplet velocity, temperature, and solid fraction contents of individual droplets at various spray distances from the substrate.

The developed mathematical model has been used to predict thermal history and solidification behavior of atomized droplets of gamma-TiAl alloy.

50|$|The {{original}} American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), {{which was}} developed in 1955 by the General Electric Corp. The Mk-2's design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article). The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower ballistic coefficient and also trailed a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> vaporized <b>metal</b> making it very visible to radar. These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. Consequently, an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric. This new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS (nylon phenolic). This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible. However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3360 kg, a length of 3.1 meters and a half-angle of 12.5°. Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6. Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10° to 11°.|$|R
