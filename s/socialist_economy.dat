Reformers targeted the labor market as unproductive because industries were frequently overstaffed to fulfill socialist goals and job-security reduced workers' incentive to work. This socialist policy was pejoratively called the iron rice bowl.|$|E

The socialist nature of the economy created a great deal of inefficiency which the government was able to offset through foreign aid, first in the form of West German Holocaust reparations then through direct aid, primarily from western nations.|$|E

The well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.|$|E

The International Front of the Working People of Latvia or Interfront, established in 1989, came out openly for remaining in the Soviet Union and preserving a <b>socialist</b> <b>economy.</b> Interfront aimed to win the sympathies of those Russians who were opposed to the idea of Latvia as a national state.|$|E

However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas.

50|$|The great {{paradox of}} {{socialism}} {{is the fact}} that socialism needs capitalism in order to survive. Unless <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> allow for some free markets which provide the pricing information possible, <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> would soon collapse. Von Mises' claims were strengthened by {{the fact that this is}} exactly what happened in cases such as the Soviet Union, where socialist states attempted to abolish all markets. The result is that no socialism in practice can dispense with market exchanges. Consequently, socialism attacks the market at the same time it is forced to utilize the market process.|$|R

Veblen believed that technological developments would eventually lead to a <b>socialist</b> <b>economy,</b> but his views on socialism and the nature of the evolutionary process of economics differed sharply from Karl Marx's. While Marx saw socialism as the immediate precursor to communism and the ultimate goal for civilization to be achieved by the working class, Veblen saw socialism as an intermediate phase in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would arise due to natural decay of the business enterprise system.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{important}} social-political {{changes were}} made in the country, which, of course, had their influence on the development of Zrenjanin, newly named in 1946. In August 1945 the Agriculture Reform Act came into force, in June 1950 the Worker Self-Management Act, in 1959 the first direct urban plan of the town development, which indicated the urbanism-economic development of the town, was passed. The development, in the first after war decade, was directed by the directive plans, which were based on the principles of <b>socialist</b> <b>economy</b> in which the most important industrial branches were industry and agriculture. By the 1980s many people left their villages and moved into towns which brought many changes in the social, educational and ethnic structure of the town. There was permanently shortage of housing. That is why many new parts of the town and many new apartment buildings were built.

40|$|Under-urbanization, {{defined as}} the {{achievement}} of a high industrial growth without a parallel growth of urban population, can be plausibly viewed as a typical phenomenon of <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> and is widely recognized in the special case of China. This paper highlights the characteristics of China's under-urbanization and demonstrates system-related elements with specific linkages {{to the process of}} urbanization. In contrast to the thrust of the extant literature on urbanization in the context of <b>socialist</b> <b>economies,</b> where industrialization strategies alone are taken as fundamental in explaining the nature of China's urbanization, we have focused, rather, on systemic characteristics to interpret China's under-urbanization. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|A Western economist’s {{first visit}} toa socialistnation is an eye-opening experience. One’s first {{impressions}} are rather like those from visiting the poorer regions {{of our own}} economies—most visibly {{the lower levels of}} creature comforts, health, and environmental conditions. It would be a mistake, however, to explain the differences between the market and <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> in terms ofthe conditions that explain the differences over time or among regions in the productivity and average income within a market economy. An economist studying a market economy, for example, is most likely to focus on the differences in human skills, private and public investment, and natural resources, and the incremental or small dif-ferences in government policy. We are less likely to study the basic institutions of a market economy, because they have changed only gradually over time and are common across the nation. Indeed, our standard graduate training in economics hardly mentions these insti-tutions, and few economists have more than a shallow understanding of their importance. The most important differences between the market and <b>socialist</b> <b>economies,</b> however, are the less-visible or quantifiable differences in these basic institutions. I am not a specialist in the socialistecono-mies, so my understanding of the Soviet economy is necessarily secondhand. For the past several years, however, the inchoate reforms in the <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> and my own brief visits to several other <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> have led me to reflect on the basic institu-tions, or “soft infrastructure, ” of a market economy.

500|$|Influenced by Frantz Fanon and the African-American Black Power movement, Biko and his compatriots {{developed}} {{the idea of}} Black Consciousness, which became SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned {{for an end to}} apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward universal suffrage and a <b>socialist</b> <b>economy.</b> It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan [...] "black is beautiful". In 1972, he was involved in founding the Black People's Convention (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a banning order in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a crèche in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was severely beaten by state security officers, resulting in his death. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.|$|E
500|$|Following the Civil War, {{particularly}} {{following the}} Depression of 1873–79, {{there was a}} rapid expansion of industrial production in the United States. Chicago was a major industrial center {{and tens of thousands}} of German and Bohemian immigrants were employed at about $1.50 a day. [...] American workers worked on average slightly over 60 hours, during a six-day work week. [...] The city became a center for many attempts to organize labor's demands for better working conditions. [...] Employers responded with anti-union measures, such as firing and blacklisting union members, locking out workers, recruiting strikebreakers; employing spies, thugs, and private security forces and exacerbating ethnic tensions in order to divide the workers. [...] Mainstream newspapers supported business interests, and were opposed by the labor and immigrant press. [...] During the economic slowdown between 1882 and 1886, socialist and anarchist organizations were active. Membership of the Knights of Labor, which rejected socialism and radicalism, but supported the 8-hour work day, grew from 70,000 in 1884 to over 700,000 by 1886. In Chicago, the anarchist movement of several thousand, mostly immigrant, workers centered about the German-language newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung ("Workers' Times"), edited by August Spies. Other anarchists operated a militant revolutionary force with an armed section that was equipped with guns and explosives. Its revolutionary strategy centered around the belief that successful operations against the police and the seizure of major industrial centers would result in massive public support by workers, start a revolution, destroy capitalism, and establish a <b>socialist</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lenin's Marxist beliefs {{led him to}} {{the view}} that society could not {{transform}} directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a [...] "dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a <b>socialist</b> <b>economy.</b> He defined socialism as [...] "an order of civilized co-operators in which the means of production are socially owned", and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a society of abundance. To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with – in his words – [...] "all citizens" [...] becoming [...] "hired employees of the state". Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and statist, with both production and distribution strictly controlled. He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation. In this way, his calls for [...] "workers' control" [...] of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a [...] "workers' state". This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{economic}} transformation under socialism in general, {{and the growth}} and development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in particular, {{have been based on}} the assumption that SOEs are a homogeneous entity. With few exceptions, the extant literature tends to compare SOEs as a whole with other economic sectors. Little has been written about the heterogeneous nature of SOEs. The author examines the internal variation of SOEs at different administrative levels in terms of productivity and profitability in China, which remains one of the largest <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> undergoing profound structural changes. The performance of SOEs is found to have varied significantly among the administrative hierarchy of the socialist political system. The changing politics of scale from promoting regional self-reliance in the Maoist era toward both expanding SOE autonomy and fiscal decentralization in the post-Maoist era, has resulted in an increase in the disparity between the SOEs affiliated with the national government and those affiliated with local governments. The investigation of SOEs in the Chinese context raises important theoretical questions concerning the growth dynamics of SOEs and suggests the need for a more careful and path-dependent treatment of <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> under reform. The growth of SOEs in transitional <b>socialist</b> <b>economies</b> provides an interesting testing ground in which to evaluate the theoretical discourse concerning the politics of scale and the rescaling of politics. ...|$|R
