40|$|The study {{objective}} was to describe the profile and factors related to alcohol consumption among emergency room visits by external causes.

Statistical analysis were performed for all cases treated in selected services, comparing {{the characteristics of the}} victims, according to the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>consumption.</b> 33, 289 visits to emergency rooms by external causes in the population above 18 years of age were included. The prevalence <b>of</b> self-reported <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> among these services was 14. 9 % for the 24 capitals and the Federal District, and was significantly higher among visits by violent causes than by accidents. For both accidents and violence the associated causes were victims male, black/brown, less educated, members of specific populations, occurrences on public roads. The results support global discussions on the importance of establishing policies and legal measures to restrict the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and vehicular direction, control advertising of alcoholic beverages, and laws normalizing the functioning of sales points of alcoholic beverages...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Elevated levels <b>of</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> among {{university}} students are well documented. Policymakers {{have attempted to}} combat this issue at a university, national and international level. Tailoring public health policy to effectively tackle alcohol use is crucial. Using Q-methodology, the current study aims to develop a typology <b>of</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> in the Irish university student population. Setting: A large Irish university. Participants Hundreds <b>of</b> possible <b>statements</b> on types <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> were generated from a systematic review {{and a set of}} one-on-one interviews. These were reduced to 36 statements, 6 statements which define each of the 6 previously defined consumption types. Participants were advised to scan through the 36 statements and fill the statements into a ‘forced choice, standardised distribution’. Following this, a 45 – 90 min interview was conducted with students to illuminate subjectivity surrounding alcohol consumption. Analysis was conducted using PQ Method and NVivo software. Principal component analysis, followed by varimax rotation, was conducted to uncover the final factor information. Results: In total, 43 students completed the Q-study: 19 men and 24 women. A typology describing 4 distinct groupings of alcohol consumer was uncovered: the guarded drinker, the calculated hedonist, the peer-influenced drinker and the inevitable binger. Factor loadings of each of the consumer groupings were noted for type description. Conclusions: This is the first study to propose ideal types <b>of</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> among a university student population. Further research is required to investigate the degree to which each of these ideal types is subscribed. However, this typology, in addition to informing public policy and strategies, will be a valuable analytic tool in future research...|$|R
