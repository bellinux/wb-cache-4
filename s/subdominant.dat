5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the tonic or dominant, but in the <b>subdominant.</b> The second, B part, {{continues}} to modulate by ascending fourths, until it reaches the key of D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local <b>subdominant</b> (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first in the major mode, then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the tonic and the opening section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the tonic minor in the sonata.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's second theme (the B {{section of}} the rondo) indulges in a long {{harmonic}} and melodic excursion, going through the keys of the <b>subdominant</b> and flat submediant. Beethoven's more traditional short and simple theme merely consists of alternating tonic and dominant harmonies.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while <b>subdominant</b> weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E

5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, <b>subdominant,</b> and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|II. Adagio in A-flat major, A–B–A–B–A form. Nostalgic in its {{traditional}} classical character (one {{of the few}} instrumental adagios Schubert wrote), the opening theme of this movement is an elegant, touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment, undermining the peaceful setting. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} the voice-leading of the first phrase, 1–7–1–2–3–4–3, is based on the initial A-flat digression {{in the beginning of the}} Allegro. The unorthodox, chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section, leading to a plagal cadence in the <b>subdominant</b> key (D-flat), chromatically colored with its own minor <b>subdominant</b> chord (G-flat minor). The importance of this progression and of D-flat in general is emphasized by its quotation in a climax of the finale's exposition. This diversion of the main theme's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section, which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos. In the second appearance of the A and B sections, almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up, further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole. The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement, with even subtler chromatic coloration and more distant modulations, touching on C major, before the piece finally ends in the tonic, the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences, free modulation, and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the <b>subdominant</b> as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and compare the guilds of parasitic Hymenoptera associated with the grain aphid on rye and winter wheat in northern Poland. Of the seven species of primary parasitoids (Braconidae: Aphidiinae, Aphelinidae), parasitizing colonies of Sitobion avenae, the most numerous and most frequently occurring, included Praon volucre, Aphidius ervi and Aphidius uzbekistanicus. Primary parasitoids of grain aphids were largely eliminated by hyperparasitoids, mostly of the families Megaspilidae (Dendrocerus carpenteri), Figitidae-Alloxystini (Alloxysta spp. and Phaenoglyphis villosa) and Pteromalidae (Pachyneuron aphidis, Asaphes vulgaris, Coruna clavata), but D. carpenteri and Alloxysta spp. belonged to dominants and <b>subdominants,</b> respectively...|$|R
5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing <b>subdominant</b> tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The sonata {{begins with}} a forte, heavily {{textured}} chordal fanfare emphasizing a low A pedal and duple-meter stepwise diatonic ascent in thirds in the middle voices, followed immediately by quiet descending triplet arpeggios punctuated by light chords outlining a chromatic ascent. These highly contrasting phrases provide the motivic material {{for much of the}} sonata. The second theme is a lyrical melody written in four-part harmony. The exposition follows standard classical practice by modulating from tonic (A) to dominant (E) for the second theme, even preparing the latter tonality with its own V – the only first movement {{to do so in the}} mature Schubert. Despite this traditional approach, both exposition themes are built in an innovative ternary form, and in each resulting 'B' section a highly chromatic development-like section based on the exposition's second phrase modulates through the circle of fourths, only to return to the tonic. This novel structure creates a sense of harmonic movement without actually committing to a thematic modulation, and is one of the techniques Schubert uses to achieve a sense of scale in the movement. The development proper is based on a scalar variation of the second theme heard at the end of the exposition. Here, in contrast to the striking modulatory excursions nested in the exposition, the tonal plan is static, shifting constantly between C major and B major (later B minor). After the development theme is finally stated in the tonic minor, the dramatic retransition has the unconventional role of only shifting to the major mode to prepare the recapitulation, rather than fully preparing the tonic key (which in this case has already been established). The recapitulation is traditional – staying in the tonic, and emphasizing the tonic minor and the flat submediant (F major) as <b>subdominant</b> tonalities. The coda restates the first theme, this time in a much more 'hesitant' manner, pianissimo and with further allusions to <b>subdominant</b> tonalities. The movement ends with serene arpeggios; however, for the penultimate chord, Schubert chose a striking Italian sixth on II, instead of the more usual dominant or diminished seventh chords. This choice is not arbitrary – it is a final statement of the chromatically-based ascending minor second motive that pervaded the movement, a motive that will be reversed into a descending minor second in the following movement.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different <b>subdominant</b> tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

5000|$|Paraphrased {{from the}} CD liner notes: In the late 1970s, Prof. Blackwood won {{a grant from}} the National Endowment for the Humanities to {{investigate}} the harmonic and modal properties of microtonal tunings. The project culminated in the Microtonal Etudes, composed as illustrations of the tonal possibilities of all the equal tunings from 13 to 24 notes to the octave. He was intrigued by, [...] "finding conventional harmonic progressions," [...] in unconventional tunings. [...] "What I was particularly interested in was chord progressions that would give a sensation either of modal coherence or else of tonality.

5000|$|Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote {{a set of}} 25 Preludes, Op. 31, {{published}} in 1847. His key scheme differs from Chopin's in that the major keys ascend chromatically and are followed by their respective minor <b>subdominants,</b> though Alkan also starts on C major. The last piece returns to C major, hence the additional prelude (a device Alkan repeated in the Esquisses, Op. 63, and that César Cui employed in his own 25 Preludes, Op. 64). As a further distinction between his and Chopin's sets, Alkan provides programmatic titles for several of his preludes, including {{the most famous of}} the set, La chanson de la folle au bord de la mer (The Song of the Madwoman by the Seashore).|$|R
5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and <b>subdominant</b> tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} {{traditional}} form, the morna obeys {{a cycle of}} fifths. The harmonic progression starts in a chord (the tonic) of a certain tonality, the second chord is the lower fifth (the <b>subdominant),</b> the third chord {{is the same as}} the first and the fourth chord is the upper fifth (the dominant seventh).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} oats phytocenosis (the crop and weeds) treated as a competitor group as concerns the species domination developing within it. The study covered oats cultivated on plots after potatoes (in crops rotation system with 25 % share of oats) and twice after oats (75 % share of oats in the rotation system) during the years 1990 - 2000. Simpson's species domination ratio and domination structure in the association identifying groups of: dominants, <b>subdominants,</b> influents and accessory species, were computed and studied. Relations between the studied phytocenosis features and weather conditions and oats yield were also determined. It was shown that quantitative relations in the assessed competitor associations were characterized by high variability between years and vegetation periods while no major {{differences were found between}} positions in the crop rotation systems. The density of spring phytocenosis during 11 years of studies increased resulting from increasing numbers of weeds appearing; during the late vegetation period they changed the density of associations slightly. In the spring, the groups competitive to the group of dominants consisted usually of the crop and Thlaspi arvense as well as Chenopodium album; with the passage of years their position strengthened. The enrichment of species in phytocenosis was represented mainly by an increase in numbers of accessory species. At the end of vegetation the importance of oats as a dominant increased significantly; during some seasons Chenopodium album co-dominated, however, with the passage of years the group of <b>subdominants</b> grew. Domination ratios for the studied competitor groups decreased with the passage of years, parallel to decrease of oats share in them. The studied features of phytocenosis showed a stronger correlation to the passage of years than the weather development. Invasiveness of weeds increased during consecutive seasons of cultivation while it showed less correlation with the density of oats. Oats yields showed a slight decreasing trend from year to year and was highly determined by the density of the entire weeds assemblage and in the spring by density and share of dominating species...|$|R

30|$|Annual fire and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{triennial}} fire represent extreme fire scenarios in short-grass steppe, but are still considered to be options for wildlife habitat management and short-term enhancement of forage quality for livestock. The inclusion of these fire frequencies allows us to address concerns that land managers have regarding potential negative impacts on forage production and plant community composition. In particular, one hypothesized reason that fire could affect certain plant species (i.e., <b>subdominants</b> other than the C 4 grasses) in semiarid grasslands is through a reduction in spring soil moisture retention due to increased bare soil exposure in burned areas (Vermiere et al. 2005, Schientaub et al. 2009). In addition, species that have already initiated growth when the dominant C 4 grasses are still dormant could be directly injured by flames during dormant-season burns (Schientaub et al. 2009, Vermiere et al. 2011, Russell 2013). Based on these mechanisms, we hypothesized that fire would have more severe negative effects on C 3 graminoids, forbs, and the annual grass, sixweeks fescue, than on C 4 grasses.|$|R

40|$|Family {{flocks of}} Marsh Tits Parus palustris in {{southern}} Sweden kept together until 11 - 15 d after fledging and stayed within the former {{territory of the}} parents. Mortality in the family flocks was low in one year (1. 2 - 3. 6 %) but higher in another (18. 6 %). This level of mortality is compared with post-dispersal mortality in other species of tits. The occurrence of a parent-offspring conflict with regard to when juveniles should disperse is called in question. The level of aggression from parents towards their young was very low. Experimental broods of increased and reduced size stayed equally long within the parental territory, thus refuting the hypothesis that parents force their young to emigrate to avoid local competition for food or the harassment from the begging young. Dispersal of young from a family flock took place over more than one day. Late dis- persers were significantly smalller than their nestmates.

The aim of this research was to study guild organization among the epigeous Formicidae living in Atlantic forest remnants of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Ant collections were performed in three distinct Atlantic forest biome areas: arboreal littoral vegetation ("restinga") (Cananéia), semideciduous seasonal forest (Piracicaba) and dense ombrophylousforest (Pariquera-Açu).
