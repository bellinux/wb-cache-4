40|$|Results of {{comparative}} liberation tests on electrically disintegrated and mechanically comminuted oxide ores containing hematite and PGM and sulphide ores containing complex Cu sulphides and pentlandite showed that disintegration of ore aggregates by electrical pulses generates {{a higher percentage}} of liberated particles and lower percentage of fine material than that obtained by mechanical comminution. Mechanism of electrical disintegration creating a specific liberation process by splitting mineral aggregates along boundaries of minerals with different electrical parameters is described. The main effect of liberation by electrical pulses manifests in the generation of {{a higher percentage of}} the coarse monomineral particles and in the general increase of liberated material with dimensions of particles, which can be efficiently treated by the <b>separating</b> <b>equipment.</b> Comparative amount of monomineral particles in the fine (106 μm), this difference sometimes exceeds 40 %. General improvement in the recovery and grade was achieved on both oxide ores and in the pentlandite ore...|$|E
40|$|DE 19857130 A UPAB: 20000811 NOVELTY - In the {{production}} of lightweight concrete containing granular plastics aggregate, the plastics consist (partly) of scrap, which is first rendered inert by chemical treatment with strong caustic alkali and/or strong acid. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for:- (1) equipment for separating granular material into various grain fractions; (2) plastics aggregate for lightweight concrete {{in the form of}} granular waste rendered inert by chemical treatment with strong caustic alkali and/or strong acid. USE - The <b>separating</b> <b>equipment</b> is used for separating round and angular grains, especially the plastics aggregate (all claimed). The lightweight concrete is useful e. g. in overground, underground, agricultural and horticultural construction and road building. ADVANTAGE - Recycling plastics scrap saves mineral oil resources and reduces carbon dioxide and associated toxic emissions by avoiding incineration. However, impurities in the scrap can make concrete swell on exposure to humidity and reduce the strength. Chemical treatment eliminates this problem. The lightweight concrete has good processing properties and pumpability and no or little swelling and gives durable lightweight structures of satisfactory strength...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Fouling of {{suspended}} solids on piping and equipment causes severe operating and maintenance problems in process, water treatment and miningrelated plants. In the SASOL environment fouling related problems are mainly experienced on equipment operating in process cooling water services. Suspended solids {{appear in the}} form of activated sludge in the cooling water system and the solid particle sizes are usually submicron in size. Conventional solid liquid separation techniques like centrifuging, sedimentation, filtration, etc. could up to this stage not be applied successfully to remove the finest solids from the process cooling water system. The possibility to separate solid liquid suspensions by means of acoustic energy was investigated. The theoretical principles of acoustic waves, especially standing waves, were studied and explained. A theoretical model indicates that separation of solid/liquid suspensions can be obtained virtually immediately after acoustic energy is applied. Theoretically the size and frequency of a tipical acoustic transducer can be calculated for a specific application. Based on theoretical calculations and findings, an experimental setup was prepared to carryout experiments on different suspensions. A control suspension made-up of water and powder, of Yttlich the particle sizes were approximately 10 pm, was prepared and exposed to a standing acoustic wave. Separation was achieved successfully. Follow-up experiments were carried out to establish the optimum conditions to which separation could be achieved. Different flow velocities were tested as well as different power inputs. The best separation was achieved with the lowest flow rate of 2. 5 mils and the highest available voltage of 12 Volt. These conditions were not only used to separate a control suspension but also in a real situation where it was attempted to separate {{suspended solids}} from the cooling water system. The attempts were unsuccessful. Additional experiments were also done on ash water and cooling water blowdown which also failed. The failure of effective separation of the process cooling water suspensions is due to the extremely small sizes of the solid partides in suspension. Greater energy input than was available for this project, is required as the particle sizes decreases. Provision needs to be made for all particle sizes to achieve effective results. The separation of solid liquid suspensions is achievable with the aid of acoustic energy. The physical properties of the suspension however determines the size and magnitude of the <b>separating</b> <b>equipment.</b> A proposal for the implementation of a full scale acoustic separation system is given. The proposal comprises of a parallel system to ensure continuity of the cooling process...|$|E
40|$|The {{aspects of}} gas turbine design that are {{explored}} herein are focussed on reduction or elimination {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emissions and reduction of noise. There are 3 separate but related investigations. 1. Aero gas turbine engine thermodynamic cycles for subsonic transport aircraft are explored to optimise performance (thus reducing CO 2 emissions) and to minimise noise; particular {{attention is paid to}} choices of fan pressure ratio, bypass ratio, installation configuration and fan design. Turbofans with long and short cowls are explored, as are propfans of various bypass ratios. The performance and noise comparisons of the engines are made using consistent technology standards; this approach is not apparently available in the literature. It is shown that relative to present day engines, useful improvements in Direct Operating Cost (DOC), fuel burn and noise are possible. It is shown, not surprisingly, that the optimum installed engine cycles for performance and noise are different. 2. The performance effects of using hydrogen fuel in “conventional” aero gas turbine engines are discussed. Also, some novel un-conventional hydrogen fuelled aero gas turbine cycles are examined. Hydrogen fuelled engines create no emissions of CO 2; however, this environmental benefit is partly offset by the increased water in the engine contrails. It is shown that “conventional” engines benefit from using hydrogen fuel, measured by the thrust obtained for a given fuel energy input rate. The novel un-conventional configurations that are examined offer useful performance benefits, including significant power increases, by suitable use of the cold “sink” and high pressure of the liquid hydrogen fuel. 3. Two ways of eliminating CO 2 emissions from industrial gas turbines are examined. The first is by use of hydrogen-rich fuel. There are performance gains, as with the aero engines; however in the industrial cases, the hydrogen is sometimes produced {{in such a way that}} it is mixed with substantial amounts of nitrogen, which significantly influences the results. The second is the use of CO 2 in the working fluid for partially-closed and closed cycle arrangements. This permits easy sequestration of excess CO 2 without the use of the large <b>separating</b> <b>equipment</b> that is necessary for extracting CO 2 from the exhausts of standard open cycle plants breathing air. The changes required to a standard gas turbine to allow it to use CO 2 as its working fluid are explored in some detail; this is not clearly addressed in the literature. It is shown that the turbines - the most expensive part of the gas turbine - can be operated satisfactorily but changes are sometimes required to the compressors.
