40|$|Sulphate and methanesulphonate (MSA), the {{two major}} sulphur species trapped in polar ice, have been extensivelyh studied in Antarctic and Greenland ice cores {{spanning}} the last centuries, {{as well as the}} entire last climatic cycle. Data from the cores are used to investigate the past contribution of volcanic and biogenic emissions to the natural <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> in high latitude regions of both Hemispheres. Sulphate concentrations in polar ice very often increased during one or two years after large volcanic eruptions. Sulphate records show that fossil fuel combustion has enhanced sulphate concentrations in Greenland snow by a factor of 4 since the beginning of this century, and that no similar trend has occurred in Antarctica. At present, sulphate in Antarctic snow is mainly marine and biogenic in origin and the rate of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) emissions may have been enhanced during pst developments of El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Marine biota and non-eruptive volcanic emissions represent the two main contributors to the natural high northern latitude <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget.</b> Whele these two sources have contributed equally to the natural <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> of Greenland ice over the last 9000 years BP, non-eruptive volcanic emissions largely dominated the budget {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene. A general negative correlation is observed between surcace air temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere and Greenland snow MSA concentrations over the last two centuries. Positive sea-ice anomalies also seem to strengthen DMS emissions. A steady decrease of MSA is observed in Greenland snow layers deposited since 1945, which may either be related to decreasing DMS emissions from marine biota at high northern latitudes or a changing yield of MSA from DMS oxidation driven by modification of the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in these regions. Slightly reduced MSA concentrations are obvserved in Greenland glacial ice with respect to interglacial levels. In contrast, sulphate and calcium levels are strongly enhanced during the ice age compared to the present day. These long-term variations in Greenland cores are opposite in sign to those revealed by Antarctic ice cores. Such a difference suggests that climate changes led to a quite different sulphur cycle response in the two Hemispheres...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based {{measurements}} {{strongly support}} the hypothesis that pollutant materials of anthropogenic origin are being transported over long distances in the midtroposphere and are a significant source of acid rain, acid snow, trace metal deposition, ozone and visibility-reducing aerosols in remote oceanic and polar regions of the Norhern Hemisphere. Atmospheric <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> calculations and studies of acid rain on Bermuda indicate that a large fraction of pollutant materials emitted into the atmosphere in eastern North America are advected eastwards over the North Atlantic Ocean. The first direct airborne measurements of the vertical distribution of tropospheric aerosols over the western North Atlantic is reported here. A newly developed airborne differential adsorption lidar system was used to obtain continuous, remotely sensed aerosol distributions along its flight path.

40|$|The air-sea {{exchange}} {{is one of}} the main mechanisms maintaining the abundances of trace gases in the atmosphere. Some of these, such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulphide (DMS), will have a bearing on the atmospheric heat budget. While the former facilitates the trapping of radiation (greenhouse effect) the latter works in the opposite direction through reflectance of radiation back into space by sulphate aerosols that form from oxidation of DMS in atmosphere. Here we report on the first measurements made on DMS in the Bay of Bengal and the factors regulating its abundance in seawater. Phytoplankton alone does not seem to control the extent of DMS concentrations. We find that changes in salinity could effectively regulate the extent of DMSP production by marine phytoplankton. In addition, we provide the first ever evidence to the occurrence of DMS precursor, DMSP, in marine aerosols collected in the boundary layer. This suggests that the marine aerosol transport of DMSP will supplement DMS gaseous evasion in maintaining the atmospheric non-sea salt <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of sulphate in today’s oceans—approximately 28, 000 [*]μmol[*]l− 1 —is maintained by {{a balance between}} removal by pyrite burial and evaporite deposition and supply by oxidative weathering and the erosion of sulphate minerals from evaporites 1. Oceanic sulphate concentrations were much lower before the rise of atmospheric oxygen about 2. 4 [*]Gyr ago 2. The limited spread of δ 34 S values in sedimentary sulphides from 3. 85 to 2. 5 [*]Gyr ago suggests that microbial sulphate reduction, if it {{played an important role}} in the Archaean marine sulphur cycle, must have occurred at sulphate concentrations of 200 [*]μmol[*]l− 1 or less 3. Here we use sulphur isotope systematics of the 2. 7 [*]Gyr old volcanogenic massive sulphide ore deposits from Kidd Creek, Ontario, to provide constraints on seawater sulphate concentrations independent of biological considerations. By comparing these values with metal and <b>sulphur</b> <b>budgets</b> from modern hydrothermal settings, we estimate that seawater sulphate concentrations 2. 7 [*]Gyr ago were roughly 80 [*]μmol[*]l− 1. At these levels, the residence time of sulphate was on the order of 200, 000 years, sufficiently long to make sulphate a conservative compound in the open ocean, but still short enough to suggest that hydrothermal sulphur fluxes were accompanied by a globally significant sink associated with microbial sulphate reduction...|$|R
40|$|PnET-BGC is an {{integrated}} biogeochemical model formulated {{to simulate the}} response of soil and surface waters in northern forest ecosystems to changes in atmospheric deposition and land disturbances. In this study, the model was applied to five intensive study sites in the Adirondack and Catskill regions of New York. Four were in the Adirondacks: Constable Pond, an acid-sensitive watershed; Arbutus Pond, a relatively insensitive watershed; West Pond, an acid-sensitive watershed with extensive wetland coverage; and Willy’s Pond, an acid-sensitive watershed with a mature forest. The fifth was Catskills: Biscuit Brook, an acid-sensitive watershed. Results indicated model-simulated surface water chemistry generally agreed with the measured data at all five sites. Model-simulated internal fluxes of major elements at the Arbutus watershed compared well with previously published measured values. In addition, based on the simulated fluxes, element and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) budgets were developed for each site. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>budgets</b> at each site indicated little retention of inputs of sulphur. The sites also showed considerable variability in retention of NO 3. Land-disturbance history and in-lake processes {{were found to be}} important in regulating the output of NO 3 via surface waters.

40|$|While Antarctica {{is often}} {{described}} as a pristine environment, the potential threats from local pollution sources including tourist ships and emissions associated with scientific activities have recently been raised. However, to date there has been no systematic attempt to model the impacts of such pollutants at the continental scale. Indeed, until very recently there was not even a <b>sulphur</b> emission <b>budget</b> available for Antarctica. Here we present the first comprehensive study of atmospheric pollution in Antarctica using a limited area chemistry climate model, and a monthly emissions inventory for sulphur from maintenance of research stations, ground and air traffic, shipping and the active volcano Mt. Erebus. We find that ship emissions, both sulphurous and black carbon, dominate anthropogenic pollution near the ground.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of DMS concentrations in surface {{waters of the}} southern North Sea is described for nine months (February-October) in 1989. Minimum concentrations in winter were 0. 13 nM and the maximum, monthly mean concentration was 25 nM, in May, coincident with large blooms of Phaeocystis pouchetii, off the continental coast. Comparison with other North Sea data suggests that the interannual seasonal pattern of DMS concentrations is similar. Transfer velocities, for sea-to-air transfer of DMS are derived, comparing a number of methods, {{and some of the}} uncertainties in the flux calculation are discussed. Optimised flux data for the North Sea show a distinct annual cycle with monthly averages ranging from 0. 2 to 16. 4 µmol m- 2 day- 1 for February and June, respectively. Comparison with other data suggests that North Sea fluxes are very similar to other ocean areas in a similar latitude band and on an annual and seasonal basis. The potential impact of North Sea DMS fluxes on the European atmospheric <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Emiliania huxleyi {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the global cycle of C 02, the major greenhouse gas. It is a member of the Prymnesiophyceae, the class of marine microalgae that is notorious for its high level of DMSP, an osmolyte that is the precursor of dimethylsulfide (DMS). DMS is a volatile sulphur compound: it is released to the atmosphere when the balance of production, decomposition and transport of DMSP under water is positive. In the atmosphere DMS contributes to cloud formation because its oxidation products are cloud condensation nuclei. Emiliania has been said to counteract the greenhouse effect of CO 2 in this way. The other "global change" phenomenon discussed nearly as much as global warming in the last decade is the increase in ultraviolet-B radiation because of depletion of atmospheric ozone. UV-B has a negative effect on phytoplankton performance, therewith limiting its CO 2 uptake potential, but it was not known if the contents of DMSP in algal cells would change under enhanced UV-B radiation. The results of our laboratory experiments suggest that UV-B has no effect on the DMSP contents of Emiliania huxleyi cells. It is possible that the longer-wave UV component UV-A has counteracted UV-B effects on growth, cell division and DMSP production. The conclusion from the experiment is that increases in UV-B, expected to continue in the next decades, do not have to be considered in the global <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> regarding DMSP-DMS cycling between sea and atmosphere as far as a major source of DMS is concerned: the DMSP production of Emiliania huxleyi. ...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{carbonyl}} sulphide (COS) {{is the most}} abundant sulphur gas in the atmosphere. Our chemistry-climate model (CCM) of the lower and middle atmosphere with aerosol module realistically simulates the background stratospheric sulphur cycle, as observed by satellites in volcanically quiescent periods. The model results indicate that upward transport of COS from the troposphere largely controls the <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> and the aerosol loading of the background stratosphere. This differs from most previous studies which indicated that short-lived sulphur gases are also important. The model realistically simulates the modulation of the particulate and gaseous sulphur abundance in the stratosphere by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). In the lowermost stratosphere organic carbon aerosol contributes significantly to extinction. Further, using a chemical radiative convective model and recent spectra, we compute that the direct radiative forcing efficiency by 1 kg of COS is 724 times that of 1 kg CO 2. Considering an anthropogenic fraction of 30 % (derived from ice core data), this translates into an overall direct radiative forcing by COS of 0. 003 W m − 2. The direct global warming potentials of COS over time horizons of 20 and 100 yr are GWP(20 yr) = 97 and GWP(100 yr) = 27, respectively (by mass). Furthermore, stratospheric aerosol particles produced by the photolysis of COS (chemical feedback) contribute to a negative direct solar radiative forcing, which in the CCM amounts to − 0. 007 W m − 2 {{at the top of}} the atmosphere for the anthropogenic fraction, more than two times the direct warming forcing of COS. Considering that the lifetime of COS is twice that of stratospheric aerosols the warming and cooling tendencies approximately cancel...|$|E
40|$|Cape Town {{experiences}} unpleasant pollution (called the Brown Haze) in winter. Sulphur is a {{major constituent}} of this haze. To reduce sulphur pollution, and its negative impact on health in Cape Town, air quality management has focussed on identifying local sources and reducing the local emissions of sulphur. Meanwhile, the transport of sulphur pollutants from areas outside Cape Town can contribute to ambient sulphur concentrations. This work studies the transport of sulphur pollutants over South Africa and examines whether Cape Town is a net source of or sink for the pollutant. It shows the link between sulphur emissions on the Mpumalanga Highveld (the most polluted area in South Africa) and sulphur pollution in Cape Town. Two atmosphere chemistry-transport models (RegCM-Chem and WRF-Chem) were used for this study. The models were applied to simulate the atmospheric flow and chemistry transport over South Africa for two years (2001 and 2002), {{and the results were}} validated with observations within Cape Town. The models reproduced observed seasonal variability in atmospheric wind flow and sulphur concentrations over Cape Town. Results from both models show a transport of sulphur pollutants from the Mpumalanga Highveld to Cape Town. While the sulphur pollutants from the Mpumalanga Highveld are transported eastward (toward the Indian Ocean) at middle atmospheric levels, the pollutants are transported south-westward (towards Cape Town) at lower atmospheric levels. In addition, the pollutants are transported from the Mpumalanga Highveld to Cape Town, following the south coast of South Africa, in April. During an extreme sulphur pollution event in Cape Town, there is formation of either a col or a converging flow over the city. These features encourage the accumulation of sulphur over Cape Town. The <b>sulphur</b> flux <b>budget</b> analysis shows that Cape Town can be a net source of or sink for sulphur during an extreme pollution event. This study has application potential in developing policies to reduce sulphur pollution in Cape Town and in other areas of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study of {{volcanic}} gases at Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, which includes the first spectroscopic measurements of the major gas species CO 2 and H 2 S at this volcano using a Multisensor Gas Analyzer System (MultiGAS) sensor. The fluxes of CO 2 and H 2 S were 640 – 2750 t/d and 84 – 266 t/d, respectively, during July 2008, during a prolonged eruptive pause. The flux of CO 2 is similar to estimates for the entire arc from previous geochemical studies, while the measured H 2 S flux significantly alters our interpretation of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> for this volcano. The fluxes of both sulphur and carbon show considerable excesses over that which can be supplied by degassing of erupted magma. We demonstrate, using thermodynamic models and published constraints on preeruptive volatile concentrations, that the gas composition and fluxes are best modeled by mixing between (1) gases derived from isobaric quenching of mafic magma against cooler andesite magma at depth and (2) gases derived from shallower rhyolitic interstitial melt within the porpyritic andesite. The escape of deep-derived gases requires pervasive permeability or vapor advection extending to several kilometers depth in the conduit and magma storage system. These results provide more compelling evidence for both the contribution of unerupted mafic magma to the volatile budget of this andesitic arc volcano and the importance of the intruding mafic magma in sustaining the eruption. From a broader perspective, this study illustrates the importance and role of underplating mafic magmas in arc settings. These magmas {{play an important role in}} triggering and sustaining eruptions and contribute in a highly significant way to the volatile budget of arc volcanoes...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{dimethyl}} sulphide (DMS) and its oxidation products, methane {{sulphonic acid}} (MSA), sulphate, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulphone (DMSO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in the atmosphere have been made during all seasons of 1988 / 1990 at coastal sites in northwest Scotland and Eire. The annual average air concentration of DMS was estimated from results obtained on 92 days in 1989 / 1990 to be 58 ng (S) m− 3 and that of MSA to be 6 ng (S) m− 34. Backward air mass trajectories were used for each sampling period to explain the observed concentrations {{in terms of the}} origins of the sampled air. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were observed for DMS with maximum concentrations > 300 ng (S) m− 3 occurring at night and during the spring in air of oceanic origin. Maximum MSA concentrations (up to 120 ng (S) m− 3) were observed during the spring. Using a steady state approximation, the sea-to-air flux of DMS from the Atlantic north of 45 ° was estimated to be 0. 93 μmol m− 2 d− 1 or 96 Gg (S) yr− 1. Three methods were used to correct the observed air concentrations of the various sulphur species for anthropogenic emissions. The resultant flux of biogenic sulphur into the United Kingdom from the North Atlantic, net of any anthropogenic sulphur, was estimated to be 30 - 96 Gg (S) yr− 1, or 2 - 5 % of the total anthropogenic emission rate of sulphur from the U. K. A simple 10 -step model was used to describe the equilibria existing between the various sulphur species and CO 2 in cloud water at cloudwater concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 2. 5 g m− 3 and the resultantacidity calculated. Values of pH as low as 3. 4 were predicted, with MSA having a negligible effect and sulphate dominating. Biogenic sulphur species from the North Atlantic may therefore make a small but quantifiable contribution to the atmospheric <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> of the U. K. and may {{play an important role in}} determining rainwater acidity in the west of the country...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the work done}} within the project "Input - outputrelationships for Intensive Monitoring sites", EC contract number SG(99) D/ 10844. The project results are extensively reported in the Technical Report 2000 (De Vries et al., 2001). Input estimates for selected Level II plots are obtained from throughfall measurements corrected for canopy exchange. Output fluxes were obtained using hydrological model output combined with soil concentrations. Leaching fluxes and input estimates provided the balances. Mean yearly interception evaporation ranged from approximately 160 mm for Pine and Oak to approximately 250 mm for Beech and 300 mm for Spruce, reflecting the increasing interception capacity of those tree species. Median transpiration fluxes were rather constant among the tree species and ranged from 325 mm. yr- 1 for Pine to 385 mm. yr- 1 for Spruce stands. At most plots, the leaching flux of SO 4 is {{higher than that of}} NO 3, despite the generally lower input of S than of N, indicating that SO 4 is still the dominant source of actual soil acidification. The median <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> is close to zero, but at a considerable number of sites, sulphur is released by the soil, indicating that these systems are recovering from previous episodes of high sulphate input. The leaching of N is generally negligible below throughfall inputs of 10 kg. ha- 1. yr- 1. There is a significant relationship between N leaching and N deposition but no significant relationship was found with the soil C/N ratio. Nitrogen budgets show that at most sites (90 %) the N input is higher then the N leaching. Variations in base cations leaching were significantly related to the S input and the pH and base saturation. The median base cation balance is close to zero, implying a net adsorption and a net release of base cations at approximately 50 % of the plots. The Al leaching flux was significantly related to the SO 4 input reflected by the fact that sites with a high Al leaching coincide with sites with a high input of SO 4. The geographic patterns of both elements, however, did not coincide very well since soil base saturation was also significantly related to the Al leaching flux...|$|E
40|$|The {{time series}} of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) {{emissions}} during the continuing eruption of Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, yields insights into conduit permeability and driving pressures, {{the role of}} the hydrothermal system and changes in magma flux both at depth and to the surface. On a time scale of years, an effectively constant supply of sulphur from a more mafic magma at depth permits evaluation of changes in the permeability of the plumbing system between 1995 and 2002 (due to magma rheology changes and hydrothermal sealing), most of which take place in the upper few hundreds of metres (dome and upper conduit). A broadly increasing SO 2 emission rate from 1995 to 1997 can be attributed to a constant or increasing supply of exsolving sulphur from depth, combined with a broadly increasing magma discharge rate at the surface. Decreases in SO 2 flux over three orders of magnitude, from July 1998 to November 1999, were due to a corresponding decrease in permeability of the upper conduit and dome due to cooling and ‘sealing’ by the precipitation of hydrothermal minerals and the closure of fracture and bubble networks. The second phase of dome growth, from November 1999 to the present, April 2002, has been associated with a similar range of SO 2 fluxes to the first phase. Large dome collapses in 1997 and during a period of zero magma flux in 1998 were associated with instantaneous SO 2 emissions of 3 ̆e 10 kt, which indicate a capacity for significant SO 2 storage in the conduit and dome prior to the collapses. SO 2 data suggest that the second phase of dome building, despite a similar <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> in terms of supply from depth and mean SO 2 emission rate at the surface (around 500 t/d), is characterised by a higher bulk permeability at shallow depths and is a more ‘open’ system with respect to fluid through-flow than the first phase of dome building from 1995 to 1998. The lack of large SO 2 emissions after large dome collapses, in 2000 and 2001, suggests limited storage of SO 2 in the conduit system. The data suggest that the likelihood of a switch to explosive activity after a large collapse is more unlikely now than during the first phase of dome building. Over shorter time scales, permeability changes may be recognised from the SO 2 flux data prior to the onset of dome growth and during cycles of small explosions in 1999. On time scales of minutes to hours, pulses of SO 2 -rich gas emissions occur after rockfalls and pyroclastic flows, due to the release of a SO 2 -rich fluid phase stored in closed fractures and pore spaces within the dome. Long period and hybrid seismic events may be associated with changes in SO 2 emission rate at the surface at various times of the eruption, although only when the temporal resolution of SO 2 monitoring is improved, will it be possible for these short-term changes to be correlated and evaluated effectively. Monitoring SO 2 emission rates from Soufrière Hills Volcano is, at this stage, of primary value in the long run, on the time scale of years, where the relationships between deep supply and surface emissions can be used to evaluate whether the eruption might be waning, or has merely paused, which is of considerable value for hazard assessment...|$|E
40|$|The Platreef {{has been}} the site of {{platinum}} mining since the 1920 ’s. The reef itself comprises a series of pyroxenites, gabbronorites and norites that contain xenoliths/rafts of footwall rocks. The Platreef is irregularly mineralised with PGE, Cu and Ni, and has a greater abundance of sulphides than the Merensky Reef. The main base metal sulphides within the Platreef are pyrrhotite, pyrite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite. Extremely varied platinum group minerals occur as tellurides, bismuthotellurides, antimonides and arsenides. This study aimed to gain {{a clearer understanding of}} the formation of sulphides within the Platreef. In order to do this, cores from both the northern and southern sectors of the Platreef were sampled. A detailed study of the sulphides within these cores was conducted to identify different styles of mineralisation and their occurrences. Four different styles of mineralisation were identified: massive, net-textured, blebby and interstitial. In general, sulphides in the southern sector of the Platreef are concentrated in the lower portion of the package, whereas in the northern sector they are concentrated in the upper part although in both sectors the sulphide occurrences are associated with metasedimentary xenoliths. Conventional and multiple sulphur isotope analyses were undertaken on sulphides from cores from both the southern and the northern sectors. This was done {{in order to determine the}} source of the sulphur. These analyses were also conducted to examine sulphur isotope variations with changing footwall. Previous sulphur isotope data predominantly obtained from the central sector of the Platreef indicated a crustal contribution to the <b>sulphur</b> <b>budget</b> but did not provide much data on footwall sulphides so the nature of the crustal component was only implied. In this thesis sulphur from an external source was identified as having contributed to the formation of sulphides in both the southern and the northern sectors of the Platreef, especially for sulphides in proximity to metasedimentary xenoliths. In the southern sector of the Platreef this source was identified as most likely being pyritic shales of the Lower Duitschland Formation. In the northern sector, Malmani dolomites, which are suggested to have collapsed from the roof of the Platreef, are the most likely source of sulphur. Importantly, in the northern sector no sulphur is thought to have come from the Archaean granite footwall. Oxygen isotope analyses were conducted on samples from the southern sector of the Platreef to verify the presence of crustal contamination. Data collected indicated that there had been a crustal oxygen component involved in the formation of silicates that led to their partial recrystallisation. When compared to oxygen isotope data from the central sector of the Platreef it appears that there are variations along strike that most likely result due to the changing footwall. This data indicates a major contribution of oxygen-, sulphur- and other volatile-rich fluids to the Platreef. This led to the partial re-crystallisation of silicates, and in areas in close proximity to sulphur-bearing metasedimentary xenoliths aided in the formation of sulphides. These volatile-rich fluids most likely originated from metasedimentary xenoliths during metamorphism that then migrated through the Platreef package. When the observations from both the southern and northern sectors of the Platreef are compared and combined with pre-existing data for the central sector, several general observations can be made. 1. The entire length of the Platreef has been affected by contamination from crustal sulphur sources to some degree. This contamination is suggested to be from volatile-rich fluids which were released from metasedimentary crustal xenoliths and footwall during metamorphism. 2. The proximity between sulphide enrichment and sulphur-bearing sediments (as footwall or xenoliths) is important and indicates the source of the sulphur which led to sulphide formation. 3. Contamination occurred on a localised scale, depending on the composition of the sedimentary lithologies and the proximity of the contaminant to the magma. In the southern sector of the Platreef the source of the sulphur is almost certainly pyritic shales of the Lower Duitschland Formation. In the central sector, sulphur has most likely come from sulphur-rich dolomites and evaporites from the Malmani dolomites. In the northern sector, sulphur-rich fluids were released from Malmani dolomite rafts that collapsed from the roof into the magma during the emplacement of the Platreef. The Archaean footwall in this area has had little or no control on the formation of the sulphides within the Platreef...|$|E
