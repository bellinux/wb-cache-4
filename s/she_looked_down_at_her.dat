60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dress half despondently, and {{yet with}} some pride.|$|E
60|$|She {{was caught}} in a strange snare. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{she wrote}} to {{me to say that}} if I ever felt myself hurt,' <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> young mistress, 'or found myself worried,' <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> again, 'I might go to her, and be considerately treated. I was to think of it, and could speak to her by the church. So I went there to thank her.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his deformity, and woman-like she shivered.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} the insolent manner which he knew so well.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a half pathetic, half humorous {{twitching}} of her lips.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face for}} a moment shone. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> gown. He laughed.|$|E
60|$|Had mamma {{discovered}} her? With a despairing {{sense of}} being caught <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> tell-tale clothes and the unslept-in bed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hands--very {{beautiful}} and well-kept hands--and sighed. This young man, with his unusual imperturbability and hateful common sense, was getting on her nerves.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright eyes, and a frown {{which did not}} come easily.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew then}} {{what it was}} that she had been hoping for. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him and smiled.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Clark {{rose and}} stood over her, {{and after a}} vain attempt to meet his gaze <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> apron. [...] "I {{made this}} myself. Do you know our {{business}} is increasing wonderfully? I'm busy every moment of the day till bedtime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Love!" [...] {{echoed the}} widow, fairly starting, though <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> netting, and looked as {{confused}} {{as she knew}} how. [...] "That is a very decided word, Captain Spike, and should never be mentioned to a woman's ear lightly." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was sitting at her table writing letters. She lifted her face abstractedly when he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> paper again.|$|E
6000|$|Juliette {{seemed to}} wake {{as if from}} a dream. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Anne Mie with a glance of hope, almost of joy, and whispered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do {{not regard}} {{you in that}} light," [...] said Lilly, with a faint smile, and then, hesitatingly, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him a moment, {{and then}} she shook her head. [...] "I don't think I can promise that, father. I am excited already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know as {{we ought}} to go up there in this rig," [...] said Mrs. Treat doubtfully, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> [...] "show dress," [...] made to display her arms and neck to the {{greatest}} advantage, and then at her husband's costume, which was as scanty as his body. [...] "I wanted to dress up when we went there; but I don't see how I'll get the chance to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Herdsmen {{here are}} {{good with the}} quarter-staff. They know how to stand against the Scots, and do not get bowed like our Midland serfs,' put in Anne, before Archie could answer, which he did with {{something}} of a snarl, as Bertram laughed somewhat jeeringly, and declared that the Lady Anne had become soft-hearted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> roses, but in the dismounting and mounting again the petals of the red rose had floated away, and nothing was left of it save a slender pink bud enclosed within a dark calyx.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy {{had only}} one other dress, but that {{happened}} to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, {{it was still a}} pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them, <b>she</b> {{pulled the}} lace of her sleeves over them, but {{otherwise}} {{she did not}} heed him. She was lost in unexpressed imaginings.|$|R
6000|$|She {{placed her}} hands in one another on his shoulder, and laying her rich brown cheek against them as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the fire, went on thoughtfully: ...|$|R
6000|$|Romola on {{her side}} was not unobservant; and when the second supply of milk had been drunk, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the round-headed man, and said with mild decision-- ...|$|R
60|$|They were {{a revelation}} of elegance and grace to the farmer's daughter. Their gaiters {{were of the}} same color as their dresses. This was most {{wonderful}} of all. Such unity and completeness of attire was unknown to her before. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> red dress, which Mattie Teel had cut out for her, and she saw it in all its deformity. The sleeves didn't fit like Josie's did. It didn't hang right; it just wrinkled all around her waist, and hung in bunches, and she knew it. And her hat, made over from her last winter's hat, was awful.|$|E
60|$|As {{she said}} this <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hands, and was {{surprised}} to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must be growing small again.' She {{got up and went to}} the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.|$|E

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the river, gleaming {{below the}} glade in a curving silver line. [...] "Dick, {{there are such}} a lot of splendid things that we might do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a strange}} child, Miss Jane," [...] she said, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me; [...] "a little roving, solitary thing: {{and you are}} going to school, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tessa {{was only}} more frightened, {{understanding}} nothing. Her first conjecture settled on her basket of sweets. They wanted that, these alarming angels. Oh dear, dear! <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Curiouser and curiouser!" [...] cried Alice, (she was so {{surprised}} that she quite forgot how to speak good English,) [...] "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!" [...] (for when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so far off,) [...] "oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall {{be a great deal}} too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you can--but I must be kind to them," [...] thought Alice, [...] "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas." ...|$|E
60|$|But Hetty {{seemed to}} have {{made up her mind}} that {{something}} was wanting, for she got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the linen-press, and a pair of large ear-rings out of the sacred drawer from which she had taken her candles. It was an old old scarf, full of rents, but it would make a becoming border round her shoulders, and set off the whiteness of her upper arm. And she would take out the little ear-rings she had in her ears--oh, how her aunt had scolded her for having her ears bored!--and put in those large ones. They were but coloured glass and gilding, but if you didn't know what they were made of, they looked just as well as what the ladies wore. And so she sat down again, with the large ear-rings in her ears, and the black lace scarf adjusted round her shoulders. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> arms: no arms could be prettier down to a little way below the elbow--they were white and plump, and dimpled to match her cheeks; but towards the wrist, she thought with vexation that they were coarsened by butter-making and other work that ladies never did.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dress. Its half-mourning still betokened {{that she}} had lost one who was very dear to her, but {{the black and white}} was a mockery. She remembered in a flash the {{stunning}} grief which Alec's letter had brought her. It seemed at first that there must be a mistake and that her tears were but part of a hateful dream. It was too monstrously unjust that the fates should have hit upon George. She had already suffered too much. And George was so young. It was very hard that a mere boy should be robbed of the precious jewel which is life. And when she realised that it was really true, her grief knew no bounds. All {{that she had}} hoped was come to nought, and now she could only despair. She bitterly regretted that she had ever allowed the boy to go on that fatal expedition, and she blamed herself because it was she who had arranged it. He must have died accusing her of his death. Her father was dead, and George was dead, and she was alone. Now she had only Alec; and then, like some poor stricken beast, her heart went out to him, crying for love, crying for protection. All her strength, the strength on which she had prided herself, was gone; and she felt utterly weak and utterly helpless. And her heart yearned for Alec, and the love which had hitherto been like a strong enduring light, now was a consuming fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, {{her mind}} swayed between pity and contempt. Then pity won {{the day in}} the wayward but ever gentle heart of Valentina. She bade him rise.|$|R
60|$|Estella {{looked at}} her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not {{otherwise}} disturbed; when the moment was past, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the fire again.|$|R
60|$|He {{shifted his}} hand along her arm with soft sensuousness, and <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his lips, remembered the long {{tingling}} {{they had given}} hers {{the first time they}} had met.|$|R
