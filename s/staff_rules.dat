40|$|Background: Rehabilitation Care is a {{treatment}} process that involves multiple disciplines, which are affiliated with different departments and use different planning horizons. This {{often results in}} planning difficulties and long waiting lists. In order to increase efficiency the Rehabilitation Centre "Het Roessingh" in the Netherlands has introduced the concept of treatment plans. Purposes: We support Het Roessingh to make their organizational process ready for implementation of treatment plans with the managerial purpose to prospectively assess the consequences of various interventions, without experimenting on the real-world system. Methods: We use mathematical models based on techniques from Operations Research and Management Science. A simulation model is {{used to analyze the}} integral impact of proposed organizational solutions on the patient flows. Findings: First, given the number of referrals per week, a necessary number of intake slots is determined in order to satisfy the access time requirements. Second, we quantify capacity losses resulting from cancellations of interdisciplinary meetings,. Third, we conclude that several disciplines are going to form bottlenecks in patient flow once the treatment plans are implemented. Fourth, a balanced <b>staffing</b> <b>rule</b> is computed for each discipline, by which bottlenecks will be avoided and higher efficiency will be achieved,. Finally, we show that the system cannot function at demand/capacity ratios close to 100 % because disciplines affect each other. Practice Implications: A sufficient number of intake slots must be planned weekly. The interdisciplinary meetings are of great importance and must have top priority for practitioners. When the treatment plans are implemented, the proposed balanced <b>staffing</b> <b>rule</b> enables a higher efficiency than the current <b>staffing</b> <b>rule.</b> It must be accepted by the management that multidisciplinary care cannot function with 100 % efficiency, because of the necessity to buffer for variation in demand, and the interdependency between the disciplines in each patient treatment...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by call centers, {{we study}} {{large-scale}} service systems with homogeneous impa-tient customers and heterogeneous servers. The servers differ {{with respect to}} their speed of service. For this model, we propose <b>staffing</b> and routing <b>rules</b> that are jointly asymptotically optimal as the system approaches the heavy-traffic many-server QED regime.

40|$|Today’s {{call center}} {{managers}} face multiple operational decision-making tasks. One {{of the most}} common is determining the weekly staffing levels to ensure customer satisfaction and meeting their needs while minimizing service costs. An initial step for producing the weekly schedule is forecasting the future system loads which involves predicting both arrival counts and average service times. We introduce an arrival count model which is based on a mixed Poisson process approach. The model is applied to data from an Israeli Telecom com-pany call center. In our model, we also consider the effect of events such as billing on the arrival process and we demonstrate how to incorporate them as exogenous variables in the model. After obtaining the forecasted system load, in large call centers, a manager can choose to apply the QED (Quality-Efficiency Driven) regime’s “square-root <b>staffing</b> ” <b>rule</b> in order to balance the offered-load per server with the quality of service. Implementing this <b>staffing</b> <b>rule</b> requires that the forecasted values of the arrival counts and average service times maintain certain levels of precision. We develop different goodness of fit criteria that help determine our model’s practical performance under the QED regime. These show that during most hours of the day the model can reach desired precision levels. 1. Introduction. Man...|$|R
