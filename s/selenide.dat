5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium <b>selenide,</b> CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a <b>selenide</b> were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards <b>selenide</b> formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down the group for the group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E

Sheets of amorphous selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel X-ray cameras.

40|$|Indium <b>selenides</b> have {{attracted}} extensive attention in high-efficiency thermoelectrics for waste heat energy conversion {{due to their}} extraordinary and tunable electrical and thermal properties. This Review aims to provide a thorough summary of the structural characteristics (e. g. crystal structures, phase transformations, and structural vacancies) and synthetic methods (e. g. bulk materials, thin films, and nanostructures) of various indium <b>selenides,</b> and then summarize the recent progress on exploring indium <b>selenides</b> as high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. By highlighting challenges and opportunities in the end, this Review intends to shine {{some light on the}} possible approaches for thermoelectric performance enhancement of indium <b>selenides,</b> which should open up an opportunity for applying indium <b>selenides</b> in the next-generation thermoelectric devices...|$|R
50|$|Vinylic <b>selenides</b> are organoselenium {{compounds}} that {{play a role}} in organic synthesis, especially in the development of convenient stereoselective routes to functionalized alkenes. Although various methods are mentioned for the preparation of vinylic <b>selenides,</b> a more useful procedure has centered on the nucleophilic or electrophilic organoselenium addition to terminal or internal alkynes. For example, the nucleophilic addition of selenophenol to alkynes affords, preferentially, the Z-vinylic <b>selenides</b> after longer reaction times at room temperature.The reaction is faster at a high temperature; however, the mixture of Z- and E-vinylic <b>selenides</b> was obtained in an almost 1:1 ratio. On the other hand, the adducts depend {{on the nature of the}} substituents at the triple bond. Conversely, vinylic <b>selenides</b> can be prepared by palladium-catalyzed hydroselenation of alkynes to afford the Markovnikov adduct in good yields. There are some limitations associated with the methodologies to prepare vinylic <b>selenides</b> illustrated above; the procedures described employ diorganoyl diselenides or selenophenol as starting materials, which are volatile and unstable and have an unpleasant odor. Also, the preparation of these compounds is complex.|$|R

5|$|In living systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl <b>selenide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide, BeO, {{is a white}} {{refractory}} solid, {{which has}} the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as in some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Salts of beryllium can be produced by treating Be(OH)2 with acid. Beryllium sulfide, <b>selenide</b> and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{commonly}} {{reacts with}} heavier chalcogens. Lead sulfide is a semiconductor, a photoconductor, and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector. The other two chalcogenides, lead <b>selenide</b> and lead telluride, are likewise photoconducting. They are unusual in that their color becomes lighter {{going down the}} group.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen <b>selenide</b> is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl <b>selenide,</b> selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) <b>selenide</b> (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{involved in}} obtaining pure Kesterite Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) thin film primarily arises {{due to its}} narrow region of stability, leading {{to the presence of}} unavoidable binary <b>selenides</b> of the constituent metals. This study offers an insight on the formation of Cu <b>selenides</b> when the amount of Cu is varied in the precursor from Cu poor to Cu rich. The amount of Cu <b>selenides</b> was found to decrease when the composition of CZTSe absorber approached Cu rich conditions but functional devices were not obtained. Detailed characterizations also showed that the Cu and Sn binary phases were present at the backside interface of CZTSe solar cells. However with an increase in the selenization temperature {{it was found that the}} amount of Cu <b>selenides</b> and other secondary phases could be drastically minimized or even eliminated leading to high efficiency devices...|$|R

5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in {{fluorescence}} microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium <b>selenide</b> quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, yellow or red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure <b>selenide</b> or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including <b>selenide,</b> selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E

Although the arylation reactions with triarylbismuthines are usually catalyzed by transition-metal complexes, the present arylation of diaryl diselenides with triarylbismuthines proceeds upon photoirradiation {{in the absence}} of transition-metal catalysts. A variety of unsymmetrical diaryl <b>selenides</b> can be conveniently prepared by using this arylation method...|$|R

5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is {{a device that}} converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens {{was among those who}} recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver <b>selenide</b> in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium <b>selenide</b> (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead <b>selenide</b> are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E

5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, <b>selenide</b> and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium <b>selenide</b> is a red pigment, {{commonly}} called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source.
