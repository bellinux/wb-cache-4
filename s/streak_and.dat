40|$|Systematic Mariner 9 {{monitoring}} of the space and time distribution of Martian bright and dark markings, the <b>streaks</b> <b>and</b> splotches, indicates a range of global correlations. The time-variable classical dark markings owe their configurations and variability to their constituent <b>streaks</b> <b>and</b> splotches, produced by windblown dust. <b>Streaks</b> <b>and</b> splotches are consistent wind direction indicators. Correlation of global streak patterns with general circulation models shows that velocities of about 50 to 90 m/sec above the boundary layer are necessary to initiate grain motion on the surface <b>and</b> to produce <b>streaks</b> <b>and</b> splotches. Detailed examples of changes in Syrtis Major, Lunae Palus, and Promethei Sinus are generally consistent with removal of bright sand and dust and uncovering of darker underlying material as the active agent in such changes, although dark mobile material probably also exists on Mars. The generation of <b>streaks</b> <b>and</b> the progressive albedo changes observed require only threshold velocities of about 2 m/sec for about 1 day at the grain surface...|$|R

40|$|<b>Streaks</b> <b>and</b> gullies {{are common}} on Martian slopes, and are geologically young; slope streaks have formed {{during the last}} few years of Mars Global Surveyor imaging.

The possibility that liquid water was involved makes gullies <b>and</b> slope <b>streaks</b> important for understanding Mars recent climate and for the hope of extant life near its surface. Here, we show that significant features of slope <b>streaks</b> <b>and</b> gullies are consistent with dry flows of granular material. Liquid water may not be required...|$|R

5|$|The Habs {{started the}} 2015–16 {{season with a}} nine-game winning <b>streak,</b> <b>and</b> posted an 18–4–3 record {{in the first two}} months of the season.

Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.|$|E
5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning <b>streak,</b> <b>and</b> the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E

Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during a three-game losing <b>streak,</b> <b>and</b> his Libyan teammates had bruises and scratches, as they were beaten by security during such slumps. The team received millions of dollars in funding from the Gaddafi family and its home arena had been the site of Gaddafi's first public execution.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones {{and center}} Elden Campbell were {{traded to the}} Charlotte Hornets. The team also {{acquired}} J. R. Reid, B. J.

The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} that the Rockets would unveil their classic yellow and red logo and {{accompanying}} uniforms used {{until the end of}} the 1994–95 season.

Egan led the Rockets back to the playoffs in 1975, where the franchise also managed to win their first round against the New York Knicks, subsequently losing to the veteran Boston Celtics in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, selling out several home games during the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then selling out all of their home playoff games.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, 2012, Aron Winter {{resigned}} from the club upon refusing to be reassigned from his head coaching role after the team started {{the season with a}} nine-game losing streak, setting an MLS record for worst start to a season. Under Winter in 2012, the club's league record was 1–9–0 and in all other competitions was 3–1–4, including a fourth-straight Canadian Championship. He was replaced by Paul Mariner, but TFC continued to struggle finishing with a 4–12–8 record in league play under him. Toronto FC also failed to advance in the CONCACAF Champions League, finishing second in its group with a 2–2–0 record. Overall, they finished the MLS season on a 14-game winless <b>streak</b> <b>and</b> ended up in last place, with five wins and 23 points (both franchise lows).|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{played the}} Los Angeles Raiders in Los Angeles in week three.

Raiders running back Marcus Allen was held to 40yards on 15 carries, ending his then-NFL record 11 game 100yard rushing <b>streak,</b> <b>and</b> the Giants {{defeated}} the Raiders 14–9. The Raiders gained a total of 58 rushing yards, and committed nine penalties.

5|$|The Persians {{found the}} Ionians {{difficult}} to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus {{was able to}} identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent <b>streak,</b> <b>and</b> have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.|$|E

5|$|After the 76ers {{got off to}} an 0–16 {{start to}} the season, Okafor was {{involved}} in a street fight with taunting individuals on November 25 in Boston. On November 30, with additional reports surfacing that Okafor had been involved in various controversial and dangerous off-the-court situations, the 76ers agreed to a request to assign a security guard to accompany Okafor in public. On December 1, Okafor and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103–91. The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States (28 games going back to the prior season) and the worst start in NBA history (tied with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets at 0–18). The next day, video surfaced on TMZ of a second fight in Boston from November. Okafor was subsequently suspended by the 76ers for two games. He returned from suspension against the San Antonio Spurs on December 7, recording 10 points and 4 rebounds off the bench in a 119–68 defeat. On January 16, 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a 114–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, helping the 76ers snap a four-game losing <b>streak</b> <b>and</b> improving their record to 5–37.

Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three-game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a 4–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four-game win streak of the season for the Blue Jackets. They immediately matched their four-game win streak with a four-game losing <b>streak</b> <b>and</b> with ten games remaining, the Blue Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6–3; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus.

5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest <b>streak</b> <b>and</b> $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
