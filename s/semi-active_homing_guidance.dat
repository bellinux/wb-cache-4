50|$|The Raytheon MIM-23 Hawk is an American medium-range surface-to-air missile. It was {{designed}} to be a much more mobile counterpart to the MIM-14 Nike Hercules, trading off range and altitude capability for a much smaller size and weight. Its low-level performance was greatly improved over Nike through the adoption of new radars and a continuous wave <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|R
500|$|The Israeli Army {{introduced}} a new round known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile. Using a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be selected to either attack from the top (to defeat enemy armor) or direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters). Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both [...] and 120mm tank guns. The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users. Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage. Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate body armor.|$|R
5000|$|The Hellfire II, {{developed}} in the early 1990s is a modular missile system with several variants. Hellfire II's semi-active laser variants—AGM-114K high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), AGM-114KII with external blast fragmentation sleeve, AGM-114M (blast fragmentation), and AGM-114N metal augmented charge (MAC)—achieve pinpoint accuracy by homing in on a reflected laser beam aimed at the target. Predator, Reaper and AH 665 Tiger, UCAVs carry the Hellfire II, but the most common platform is the AH-64 Apache helicopter gunship, which can carry up to 16 of the missiles at once. The AGM-114L, or Longbow Hellfire, is a fire-and-forget weapon: equipped with a millimeter wave (MMW) radar seeker, it requires no further guidance after launch—even being able to lock-on to its target after launch—and can hit its target without the launcher or other friendly unit being {{in line of sight}} of the target. It also works in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, such as smoke and fog which can mask the position of a target or prevent a designating laser from forming a detectable reflection. Each Hellfire weighs 47 kg, including the 9 kg warhead, and has a range of 8000 m. The AGM-114R [...] "Romeo" [...] Hellfire II entered service in late 2012. It uses a <b>semi-active</b> laser <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> system and an integrated blast fragmentation sleeve warhead to engage targets that previously needed multiple Hellfire variants. It will replace AGM-114K, M, N, and P variants in U.S. service.|$|R
5000|$|The S-300PS/S-300PM (Russian С-300ПC/С-300ПМ, NATO {{reporting}} name SA-10d/e) {{was introduced}} in 1985 {{and is the only}} version thought to have been fitted with a nuclear warhead. This model saw the introduction of the modern TEL and mobile radar and command-post vehicles that were all based on the MAZ-7910 8 × 8 truck. This model also featured the new 5V55R missiles which increased maximum engagement range to 90 km and introduced a terminal <b>semi-active</b> radar <b>homing</b> (SARH) <b>guidance</b> mode. The surveillance radar of these systems was designated 30N6. Also introduced with this version was the distinction between self-propelled and towed TELs. The towed TEL is designated 5P85T. Mobile TELs were the 5P85S and 5P85D. The 5P85D was a [...] "slave" [...] TEL, being controlled by a 5P85S [...] "master" [...] TEL. The [...] "master" [...] TEL is identifiable thanks to the large equipment container behind the cabin; in the [...] "slave" [...] TEL this area is not enclosed and is used for cable or spare tyre storage.|$|R

Over and above there will be periodic data loss due to eclipsing. For generating smooth <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> commands an efficient filter having minimum lag and maximum seeker noise attenuation capability is required. This report presents an interacting multiple model seeker filter with extended Kalman filter as mode-matched filter which operates in closed <b>homing</b> <b>guidance</b> loop to generate required guidance commands to intercept maneuvering air-breathing targets. The performance of the seeker filter is evaluated using simulation of different interceptor-target engagement scenarios with different target maneuver profiles...|$|R
