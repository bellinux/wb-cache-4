5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> can absorb in one day.

40|$|Abstract –The shading {{pattern of}} a <b>Solar</b> <b>Panel</b> if {{analyzed}} helps {{to improve the}} performance of a <b>Solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Shades on top of a <b>Solar</b> <b>Panel</b> are one of the major factors which causes disturbance on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> This paper helps analyze the shading on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> which is caused by steady clouds. This may help to increase the efficiency of a <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Various methods of Image processing technique is used to get the desired output. Those methods include techniques like median filtering and various morphological functions like usage of structuring element which gives the desired output. The problem of Boundary Estimation of a shading patter on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> is addressed. Short-time shading and lightning is not at all useful for solar power plant. If the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> is shaded then proper measures have to be taken to keep the efficiency intact else there would be a serious loss in the amount of current generated {{with the help of a}} <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Here the pixel values are measured and thus the exact numbers of dark and bright pixels are calculated and even the pixel values are reconfigurated to get the correct boundary estimation. The bypass diode is used to bypass the shaded area on the panel, which in turn helps to increase the efficiency of a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> by a significant amount. This method takes care of processing all kinds of shade on the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> from whatever source the shade is generated from. This concept can be taken further to analyse the various other parameters for effective operation...|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaic, or PV for short, is a {{technology}} in which light is converted into electrical power. One of the applications of PV is in solar tracker. A solar tracker is a device for operating a <b>solar</b> photovoltaic <b>panel</b> or concentrating <b>solar</b> reflector or lens forward sun-concentrates, especially in solar cell application, require {{high degree of}} accuracy {{to ensure that the}} concentrated sunlight is dedicated precisely to the power device. Solar tracker is invented because <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> disables to move toward the sunlight when the sun moves from east to west. In order to produce maximum power output, solar tracker is design with motor so that the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> will move toward the position of sun. To control the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> so that it will always face the sun, the circuit has timer that consistent to the sun movement. The timer indicates the time to move <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> in 12 hours. It moves the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> every one hour.
