5|$|Other offices {{included}} the <b>sworn</b> clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight <b>sworn</b> clerks, so called {{because they were}} <b>sworn</b> officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The <b>sworn</b> clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each <b>sworn</b> clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a <b>sworn</b> clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the <b>sworn</b> clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to <b>sworn</b> clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the <b>sworn</b> clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be <b>sworn</b> officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a <b>sworn</b> officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
