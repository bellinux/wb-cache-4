5|$|Rollingstock in Victoria {{has used}} air braking since tests of {{continuous}} train brakes {{were carried out}} in 1884. Initially <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> were used to connect wagons, but from 1924 automatic knuckle couplers were introduced, with buffers removed from freight wagons by 1960.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of LMS (NCC) coaches {{can be described}} as conforming to the design criteria of LMS Period I stock. This was perpetuated into the mid-1930s with repeat orders to existing designs. These coaches were mounted on steel under frames that were generally [...] long, weighed between 28 and 31 tons depending on type, and ran on two four-wheeled bogies. They had wooden framed, fully panelled bodies with semi elliptical roofs and three-link <b>screw</b> <b>couplings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The train {{consisted}} of 071 Class locomotive number 075, a generator van and 11 coaches. Six {{of the coaches}} {{consisted of}} wooden bodies on steel underframes. Four of these were either destroyed or badly damaged in the impact, the two which survived were {{at the rear of}} the train. The remainder of the coaches were light alloy Cravens stock; most of which survived the crash. The generator van, a modified BR Mark 1, was severely damaged. All of the vehicles were coupled using <b>screw</b> shackle <b>couplings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} has {{a chassis}} with two axles and welded frame. Bushing bumpers, <b>screw</b> and air <b>couplings</b> are mounted {{to the front}} and back of the frameThe body of the locomotive is composed of two engine compartments (front and back) and the elevated engineer compartment in between. The compartments are welded. Engine compartments have doors on all sides, providing convenient access to all the systems inside.The engineer compartment has large front, back and side windows with hand-powered wipers. In cold weather it is heated with fluid from the engine cooling system flowing through two radiators ...|$|R
50|$|IRR uses Soviet-style SA3 {{automatic}} couplers. In {{order to}} allow interchange with CFS and Turkish State Railways which both use screw couplers, IRR locomotives and most wagons are equipped with <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> and buffers. In Iraqi service the buffers do not make contact and the <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> hang down unattached. The railways in adjoining Saudi Arabia use American type Janney automatic couplers. There is currently no rail link planned to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|The VT 98.9 {{evolved from}} the VT 95.9 which, with its single motor, was too underpowered for many lines. The VT 98.9 was {{therefore}} fitted with two driving motors. Because this variant of the railbus was fitted with normal buffers and <b>screw</b> <b>couplings,</b> it could haul other types of wagon or be placed {{at the end of}} other trains hauled by other locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{level of}} {{standardisation}} achieved with BR's first generation DMUs was much higher than it is with modern DMUs. All had side buffers, <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> and vacuum brakes and the majority had the standard Blue Square coupling code system for control of engine speed and gear-changing. There were some units with non-standard coupling codes but they were a small minority. The coupling codes were: ...|$|E
50|$|Other cars {{known to}} have been {{included}} were some BC vans, with one end fitted with dual couplings since the R Class locomotives - then the most popular choice for heritage steam specials - were not compatible with <b>screw</b> <b>couplings.</b> When the BC cars were removed from service, the function of conversion cars was taken up by ABU carriages, about half of which had dual- or screw-couplings on at least one end.|$|E
50|$|Again {{built at}} the London plant in 1994 and 1995, the six Class 59/2 {{locomotives}} differ from the Class 59/1s in several ways. A carbon dioxide fire control system replaces the original Halon system, and the fleet were originally fitted with drop-head knuckle couplers but were later replaced with standard <b>screw</b> <b>couplings.</b> A more advanced slow speed control suitable for merry-go-round power station coal train operation has been fitted, as well as yaw dampers for a higher top speed.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from special}} locomotives, the iron ore trains have some special {{equipment}} {{to allow the}} high train weights, higher {{than anywhere else in}} Scandinavia, and probably anywhere in the European Union. They use special brakes and SA3 couplers instead of the <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> otherwise standard in Sweden. After extension of passing loops to 750 m in 2008 and 2009, the trains will have 68 cars, weighing 8600 tonnes including the locomotive, with 6800 tonnes of iron ore.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of LMS (NCC) coaches {{can be described}} as conforming to the design criteria of LMS Period I stock. This was perpetuated into the mid-1930s with repeat orders to existing designs. These coaches were mounted on steel under frames that were generally 57 ft long, weighed between 28 and 31 tons depending on type, and ran on two four-wheeled bogies. They had wooden framed, fully panelled bodies with semi elliptical roofs and three-link <b>screw</b> <b>couplings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were all}} fitted with three-link <b>screw</b> <b>couplings,</b> vacuum brakes {{in place of}} Westinghouse air brakes, Detroit sight-feed lubricators, and electric marker lights on the smokebox side and bunker to make them suitable for TGR service. With {{the arrival of the}} new DP railmotors and the V class 0-6-0DM diesel shunters (mechanically similar to the DS class), these locomotives were progressively withdrawn from 1951 when DS 2 was withdrawn. The last, DS 7, was withdrawn from TGR service in 1958.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} most other British railways, goods trains were coupled {{together}} by a large three-link chain between sprung hooks on each wagon. Some vacuum-braked wagons were fitted with <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> which could be tightened so that wagons did not bounce back and forwards on their buffers, in which the middle link of the coupling was a threaded bar with a handle to rotate it. More common on GWR wagons was an instanter coupling, in which the middle link was specially shaped {{so that they could}} be shortened when in vacuum-fitted trains.|$|E
50|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday.

50|$|A {{majority}} of carriages retained their Pintsch gas lighting, <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> and buffers {{until the late}} 1950s. These were replaced {{around the same time}} as fitting of diaphragms took place; this latter project involved cutting out the middles of walls at either ends of the carriages and fitting a standard inter-carriage walkway/diaphragm unit to the end in its place, with a door which could be locked by railway staff. Until this time the water fonts for carriages were mounted on the end walls between the lavatory and washroom; when this portion of the wall was removed, the fonts were shifted into the lavatory area.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, {{the wheel}} {{handbrake}} could be screwed down {{to keep the}} loose <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> taut between unfitted wagons, to minimise the risk of snapped broken couplings from the locomotive [...] "snatching" [...] or jerking, which was particularly a problem as locomotives became more powerful. As breaking couplings on unfitted trains when starting were a fairly common occurrence, train crews were given specific instruction. Upon starting a freight train, rules mandated the footplate crew {{to look back on}} their train towards the brake van, waiting for the guard to signal (by flag or lamp) that the entire train was moving and all couplings were taut, before accelerating to higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|The trains {{were made}} up in 3-car {{formations}} as follows:Driving motor with two saloons of 3+4 bays + 9 compartment intermediate trailer + driving trailer with two saloons of 3+4 bays. Unusually for the time, the vehicles featured <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> both within and between the units, {{in contrast to the}} SR units which had intermediate single buffer and chain and buckeye couplings at the unit ends. Although all other areas of the London Midland region had trains with both first and second class accommodation, the inner London area had withdrawn first class from main line trains operated entirely within the London Transport boundaries as a wartime measure in 1940. It was never reinstated, so these trains were second class only.|$|E
5000|$|As {{there were}} {{initially}} only light locomotives (with two two-axle carriages hauled {{by one of}} five three-axle locomotives of Prussian class T 3), freight made powerful locomotives more necessary. Between 1925 and 1940, locomotives with four or five axle were procured. In 1933, the first three two-axle railcars were used, they {{had been made in}} Gothaer Waggonfabrik. As a result, the number of services that could be operated increased from seven pairs of trains in 1930 to 22 pairs of trains. Four-axle railcars were procured in 1951 and 1953 and a MAN railbus was acquired in 1958. Due to the scrapping of the pre-war railcars from 1961, new and used Uerdingen railbuses were purchased. They were single-engined, like the VT 95, but had normal buffers and <b>screw</b> <b>couplings.</b> In order to rationalise vehicle classes, the MAN railbuses were transferred to the Alster Northern Railway in 1968 [...] With the acquisition by the AKN, it was operated with AKN rollingstock. Two of the Uerdinger railbuses are still operated for special events.|$|E
50|$|Two new dining {{cars were}} built in 1927, named {{respectively}} Avoca and Hopkins. These had a similar underframe to the standard E type carriage, but the body design was a much closer match to {{the latter half of}} the Long W type carriages, using steel plates rivetted to the frame. The cars externally looked very similar to the E type Sleepers, Werribee, Indi and Ovens. However, the pair were so heavy, at over 70 tons, that they had to be placed on Tait Motor-car bogies to support the tremendous weight. Aside from the three Pullman cars, these were the heaviest items (by axle load) of rollingstock to run in Victoria, possibly until modern times. Couplings were an oddity; the two were fitted with standard <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> when new, but by late 1935 they were both converted to autocouplers. A few months later they went to transition couplings, then back to proper autocouplers in 1936. Inside, the cars were petitioned at about the half-way mark, with 48 seats arranged in a 2+2 with 12 tables saloon configuration. Beyond this was a counter/buffet area facing the dining area; a corridor then ran along one side of the kitchen area, with the rest of the car devoted to a kitchen and food preparation area.|$|E
50|$|Guard Cooke was in {{the rear}} brake van of the train, {{together}} with six passengers, who {{should not have been}} there. Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the main <b>screw</b> <b>couplings</b> and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another screw coupling was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find spare three-link or screw couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made screw coupling was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).|$|E

40|$|Off shore {{wind power}} plants have special {{requirements}} to corrosion protection systems {{because of the}} complex environmental impact and the operating efficiency. The presented investigations are focussed on the highly loaded areas of the tower construction (splash zone, water transition zone and near submerged zone). In this investigation field and laboratory tests in combination with electrochemical investigations have been performed. The Field tests were carried out on Helgoland over 3 years. The design of the coated test samples was related to constructive aspects of the tower (weld seams, <b>screw</b> <b>couplings,</b> coating transitions, overlaying coating edges, a. s. o.). As laboratory standard tests like ISO 20340 which is a special test evaluated for off shore applications, furthermore ISO 15711 and ASTM G 8 for cathodic disbonding. Additional investigations to the degradation of the coatings have been performed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E
