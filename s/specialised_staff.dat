50|$|Starbucks: This company {{entered a}} {{historically}} crowded market place, {{the coffee shop}} industry; however, it {{found its way to}} success through the blue ocean strategy. Starbucks separated itself from the competition by combining differentiation, low cost and a customer oriented approach from the beginning of its operation. As well as this, Starbucks focused on maximising its brands exposure, rather than solely focusing on itself as just another coffee shop. In terms of differentiation, Starbucks offered a variety of products, such as smoothies, teas and a selection of coffees that no other establishment was offering. By training <b>specialised</b> <b>staff,</b> the company was operating on less staff than would usually be needed, whilst maintaining professionalism and excellent customer service, for example, personalised coffee cups. In order to maximise the customer experience, Starbucks set out to change the furnishings throughout their stores, creating a comfortable environment which convinces its customer to spend longer in store.|$|E

5000|$|Once it {{no longer}} {{required}} a subscription, the Berliner Illustrirte fundamentally changed the newspaper market, attracting readers by its appearance, particularly the eye-catching pictures. The first cover created a sensation, featuring a group portrait of officers {{who had been killed}} in a shipwreck. Initially it was illustrated with engravings, but it soon embraced photographs. Beginning in 1901, it was also technically feasible to print photographs inside the magazine, a revolutionary innovation. Building on the example of a rival Berlin publication, August Scherl's Die Woche, Ullstein developed it into the prototype of the modern news magazine. It pioneered the photo-essay, had a <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> and production unit for pictures and maintained a photo library. With other news magazines like the Münchner Illustrierte Presse in Munich and Vu in France, it also pioneered the use of candid photographs taken with the new smaller cameras. In August 1919, a cover photograph of the German President Friedrich Ebert and Minister of Defence Gustav Noske on holiday on the Baltic coast, clad in swimming trunks, caused heated debate about propriety; within a decade, such informality would seem normal. Kurt Korff (Kurt Karfunkelstein), then the editor in chief, pointed out in 1927 the parallel with the rise of the cinema, another aspect of the increasing role of [...] "life 'through the eyes'". He and publishing director Kurt Szafranski sought out reporters who could tell a story using photographs, notably the pioneer sports photographer Martin Munkácsi, the first staff photographer at a German illustrated magazine, and Erich Salomon, {{one of the founders of}} photo-journalism. After initially working in advertising for Ullstein, Salomon signed an exclusive contract with the Berliner Illustrirte as a photographer and contributed both inside shots of meetings of world leaders and photo-essays on the strangeness of life in the USA, for example eating at automats (for which he used staged photographs depicting himself being schooled in how it was done).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} has been to check the co-operation relationship between {{the parents of the}} persons with moderate, severe and profound deficiencies in mental and physical development and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members in social welfare institutions, particularly in training, occupation and care centres in Slovenia. The co-operation is importantly connected with the interactive style and the relationship competence of the families of these parents and the families of the <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members. We have been interested in the data on what the interactive style and relationship competence in the families with persons with deficiencies who are included in these centres are like, and what the interactive style and relationship competence in the families of <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members who work with these persons in these centres are like. The co-operative relationship which is established {{plays an important role in}} planning and co-ordination of the needs of these persons and the interests of everybody involved in the co-operation relationship. Furthermore, we have established the connectedness of the co-operation relationship with the inclusion of the parents into the self-assistance groups for the parents and the staff into groups having to do with supervision, intervision and key persons. Survey questionnaires for parents and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members have been used for the purpose of the exploratory quantitative research method. The first, translated part of the survey questionnaire checks the co-operation relationship and interactive style of the families of the parents and the families of the <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members. The second part of the survey questionnaire, which checks the co-operation relationship between the parents and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members, has been formed on the basis of theoretical starting points and professional practice. The research has been the means of ascertaining the structural difference between the group of parents and the group of <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members; on the basis of the results obtained via statistical analyses we have defined the system which best anticipates the degree of mutual co-operation relationship. In order to establish the connectedness of the interactive style and relationship competence with the co-operation relationship, Pearson’s correlation coefficient has been used. The results have shown that the interactive style and relationship competence in the families of the parents as well as in those of <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members critically connected with the degree of the co-operation relationship between the parents and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members. On the basis of the system of variables we have assumed that there is a structural difference between the parents who are involved in self-assistance groups for parents and those who are not. Individual bi-variant calculations have been applied with categorical variables, to wit, point-biserial correlation coefficient with non-categorical variables in order to establish the differences. It has been established that mothers are substantially more involved in these groups than fathers and unmarried parents are more so than those living in a partnership relation; it has furthermore been established that in the units with around-the-clock-care and training of persons with deficiencies their parents participate in the self-assistance groups for parents significantly less frequently as opposed to the parents with of persons with deficiencies who are involved in the units with day care and training. In addition, on the basis of the system of variables structural differences among <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members who are included in the groups for the staff and those who are not have been assumed. We have come to the conclusion that the groups for the staff are least frequented by the <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members with a pre-university degree of education and most frequented by those with a higher education degree or post-graduate degree; moreover, guardians as compared with pedagogical and health care workers are involved in the groups for the staff in a significantly smaller number. The establishment of the differences in the degree of the co-operation relationship of the parents who are involved in the groups for self-assistance for parents and those who are not, as well as that of the <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members who are involved in the groups for self-assistance for the staff and those who are not, has been checked by means of a one-way analysis of variance. The results have not confirmed differences in parents as opposed to the surprising fact that the <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members who are involved in the groups for the staff have displayed a significantly lower degree of the co-operation relationship with parents. The statistical method of two-way analysis of variance has been applied to establish the differences in the degree of the co-operation relationship given the gender and the age of the parents and the staff. The results have confirmed the differences in the age of the male staff, namely, that with their age the degree of co-operation relationship with parents increases. On the basis of the results of the research we have substantiated and proposed the concepts of a successful co-operation relationship between the parents and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members which enable the understanding of this relationship and contribute to a more effective realisation of the programme for persons with moderate, severe and profound deficiencies in mental and physical development. The differences which have been demonstrated between the centres indicate the need for a more coordinated operation of the centres knowledge exchange in the area of the attitude in the relations with parents. It is particularly necessary to encourage those parents to co-operate who have persons with deficiencies included in around-the-clock-care and training, primarily fathers. In addition, the method of work in the day care and training practices needs to be brought as close as possible to the work in the around-the-clock-care and training practices; moreover, more recruitment of more male staff members should be attempted. Furthermore, we have proposed a revision and organisation of the groups for the staff such as intervision and particularly supervision which includes <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members with the highest degree of education. All this requires new forms of work and co-operation with parents, new forms of co-operation between centres and, last but not least, training of parents and <b>specialised</b> <b>staff</b> members. ...|$|E

In a prospective study we evaluated the effect of providing images for remote consultation through an iPad on the number of in-hospital orthopaedic consultations for children with bone fractures. Methods Children from 0 to 18 years diagnosed with a bone fracture by the radiologist during the hours when an orthopaedic service is provided only on-call were eligible for enrollment. Cases were enrolled prospectively during September and October 2013. A standard approach (verbal information only, no X-Ray provided remotely) was compared to an experimental approach (standard approach plus the provision of X-ray for remote consultation through an iPad). The primary outcome was the number of orthopaedic in-hospital consultations that occurred.
