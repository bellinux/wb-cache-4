40|$|Rabies is a {{preventable}} disease, but {{it kills}} up to 55, 000 people each year. Therefore on World Rabies Day, 28 September 2011, the Public Health Agency {{wants to raise}} awareness and understanding {{about the importance of}} seeking medical advice on whether the country or countries people are visiting require vaccination against this serious disease. Rabies is transmitted to humans mainly by the bite of an infected animal (commonly a dog, but can be spread by other mammals including cats and monkeys). It can also be spread through a scratch, or by the animal licking a cut or a wound and saliva from the infected animal getting into the eyes, mouth or nose. It is impossible to tell just by looking at an animal if they are infected, therefore while visiting other countries it is best to avoid touching animals, especially strays. Dr Michael Devine, Consultant in Health Protection, PHA, said: "Rabies is an acute viral infection which is almost certainly fatal. The infection causes inflammation of the brain and symptoms usually start 2 - 8 weeks after exposure. Early symptoms include headache, fever and anxiety; progressing to acute pain, violent uncontrolled movements, <b>spasms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscles</b> making it impossible to drink and respiratory failure. "People may be used to thinking about rabies when they go to more exotic locations like Asia and Africa, {{but it can also be}} present closer to home, such as in some eastern European countries. So it is always best to play it safe and avoid animals, especially strays. "Dr Devine continued: "If you are bitten by an animal while abroad it is important to clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately, even if you have been previously immunised, as treatment must be given to attempt to reduce the risk of developing the disease - treatment works best if initiated as soon as possible. Rabies vaccination is very effective - almost 100 %. Booster doses may be required after one year and then every 2 - 5 years for those at continued risk. ...|$|R

40|$|Stroke {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} causes of dysphagia, a serious symptom triggered by affected coordination <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscles</b> or limited sensation. This bachelor thesis focuses on providing a compendium of literature concerned with dysphagia and demonstrating how the symptom occurs after cerebrovascular accident. The first part discusses the swallowing process and stroke from anatomical, physiological and neurophysiological standpoint. Second part presents a closer view of the upper sphincter of esophagus, additional healt problems caused by dysphagia and possibilities of alimentation and brings up a set of the most frequently used diagnostic methods. From chapter 4 and 5 on, the thesis describes methods and technics that can be involved in the treatment <b>of</b> patient with <b>swallowing</b> difficulties and casuistry of a patient suffering from serious dysphagia caused by cerebrovascular accident...|$|R
40|$|In {{dysphagia}} {{the ability}} of elevating the larynx and hyoid is usually impaired. Electromyography (EMG) and Bioimpedance (BI) measurements at the neck {{can be used to}} trigger functional electrical stimulation (FES) <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> related <b>muscles.</b> Nahrstaedt et al. 1 introduced an algorithm to trigger the stimulation in phase with the voluntary swallowing to improve the airway closure and elevation speed of the larynx and hyoid. However, due to non-swallow related movements like speaking, chewing or head turning, stimulations might be unintentionally triggered. So far a switch was used to enable the BI/EMG-triggering of FES when the subject was ready to swallow, which is inconvenient for practical use. In this contribution, a range image camera system is introduced to obtain data of head, mouth, and jaw movements. This data is used to apply a second classification step {{to reduce the number of}} false stimulations. In experiments with healthy subjects, the amount of potential false stimulations could be reduced by 47 % while 83 % <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> intentions would have been correctely supported by FES...|$|R

The symptoms are usually mild or moderate, including poor sucking and generalized hypotonia, and the condition usually resolves {{within a few weeks}} [13]. Respiratory support and tube feeding are only necessary in few cases, but close observation of the newborn of every MG mother is important in order to detect involvement <b>of</b> respiratory or <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Head {{and neck}} cancer (HNC) {{patients}} may develop dysphagia due to muscle atrophy and fibrosis following chemoradiotherapy. Strengthening <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscles</b> through therapeutic exercise is potentially effective for improving swallowing function. We hypothesize that a customized Swallow Exercise Aid (SEA), developed for isometric and isokinetic strengthening exercises (against resistance), {{can help to}} functionally strengthen the suprahyoid musculature, which in turn can improve swallowing function. An effectiveness/feasibility study was carried out with ten senior healthy volunteers, who performed exercises 3 times per day for 6 weeks. Exercises included chin tuck against resistance (CTAR), jaw opening against resistance (JOAR), and effortful swallow exercises with the SEA. Multidimensional assessment consisted of measurements of maximum chin tuck and jaw opening strength, maximum tongue strength/endurance, suprahyoid muscle volume, hyoid bone displacement, swallowing transport times, occurrence of laryngeal penetration/aspiration and/or contrast residue, maximum mouth opening, feasibility/compliance (questionnaires), and subjective swallowing complaints (SWAL-QOL). After 6 -weeks exercise, mean chin tuck strength, jaw opening strength, anterior tongue strength, suprahyoid muscle volume, and maximum mouth opening significantly increased (p <. 05). Feasibility and compliance (median 86 %, range 48 - 100 %) of the SEA exercises were good. This prospective effectiveness/feasibility study {{on the effects of}} CTAR/JOAR isometric and isokinetic strengthening exercises on swallowing musculature and function shows that senior healthy subjects are able to significantly increase <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and volume after a 6 -week training period. These positive results warrant further investigation of effectiveness and feasibility of these SEA exercises in HNC patients with dysphagi...|$|R

In addition, we examine approaches that may be useful in speeding up recovery <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Swallowing may be a useful model in which to study central nervous reorganization after injury...|$|R
50|$|Several {{treatment}} regimens {{have been}} described for esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis. Because the condition is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, proton pump inhibitors as anti-acid medications are used to treat the condition. If the condition is associated with <b>spasm</b> <b>of</b> the esophagus, antispasmodic medications such as butylscopolamine can be used. Dilation of areas of stricturing using esophageal bougies may provide relief <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> symptoms. The pseudodiverticulae themselves rarely cause symptoms, and treatment is not directed toward them.|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{findings}} on the relationship between tubal muscles and the Eustachian tube as described in the previous report, the actions of various tubal muscles on the Eustachian tube are discussed, and the observations carried out by the methods described below on the movements in vivo of the naso-haryngeal orifice at the time of phonation and <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> reveaied the following results. 1. Observations were carried out {{with the use of a}} nasopharyngoscope. 2. Observations were done on the patients who underwent the radical operation for the cancer of maxillar sinus. As the inferior nasal concha was already removed at the time of the operation, it was possible to insert a small nasal mirror into the posterior nasal cavity of the operated side to catch the whole view around the tubal orifice of healty side. 3. For the children over 5 - 6 years old with cleft palate, observations were carried out directly on the pharyngeal orifice through the mouth cavity (motion pictures were taken in this instance). At a result it has been found that the nasopharyngeal orifice of the tube is widened because the posterior lip and the mucous membrane of the base of the Eustachian tube move slightly outward at the time <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> In anatomically summarizing these observations the author arrived at the following conclusions. At the time <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> the tensor <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> the palate dilates the Eustachian tube at the points near the middle part and the anterior part of the tube. The levator palatini muscle assists the opening action of the tensor muscle by fixing or by drawing the base of the tube slightly toward the inferior-interior side. The salpingopharyngeus muscle or the salpingopharyngeal fold, being drawn inward by the cephalopharyngeal muscle and pahryngopalatine muscle and widening the nasopharygeal orified, assists the dilatating action of the tensor muscles. When the muscles are relaxed, the Eustachian tube is closed probably by the elasticity of the lateral cartilaginous lamina and by the pressure of the tissues surrounding the tube...|$|R
40|$|Inclusion body {{myositis}} is {{the most}} common disabling inflammatory myopathy in the elderly. It is more frequent in men and after the age of 50 years. Inflammatory and degenerative features coexist. There is a T-cell mediated autoimmunity driven by in situ clonally expanded cytotoxic CD 8 -positive T-cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibres expressing MHC-I antigen. The hallmarks of degeneration are the deposition of protein aggregates and the formation of vesicles. The course of the disease is slow and the diagnosis is usually set after several years. The muscle weakness and wasting is assymetric, affecting predominantly distal muscles of the upper extremity and proximal muscles of the legs. The signs and clinical course can be characteristic, but the diagnosis is established by muscle biopsy. There is currently no evidence based effective treatment for sIBM. Prednisone, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine and IFN-beta failed. Oxandrolon did not improve symptoms. Treatment with intravenous immunglobuline (IVIG) induced in some patients a transient improvement <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> and <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> strenght, but the overall study results were negative. A T-cell depleting monoclonal antibody (alemtuzumab), in a small uncontrolled study slowed down disease progression for a six-month period. Repeated muscle biopsies showed the reduction of T-cells in the muscle and the suppression of some degeneration associated molecules. An effective therapeutic mean should act on both aspects of the pathomechanism, on the inflammatory and the degenerative processes as well...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{depend on}} the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is {{progressive}} spasticity in the lower limbs, due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices.More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Upper extremity <b>muscle</b> tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, mental retardation, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.|$|R

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{on relationships}} between physical properties of foods and masticatory movements {{deal with them}} to individual foods in experimental conditions. This study was done for effects of 10 different types of daily meal on masticatory patterns, such as the numbers of bringing food to mouth and chewing, the duration of taking a daily meal, the total duration of moving chopsticks, and on EMG activities <b>of</b> masticatory and <b>swallowing</b> <b>muscles.</b> Each daily meals had the following composition: boiled rice, noodles, bread and roll as principal food, and broiled fish, tempura and meat with potato, meat dish, ground meat rolled in cabbage leaves, stew, roast tofu, spaghetti mushroom as side dish, etc. The amount and the calorie were calculated on each daily food. EMGs were recorded simultaneously from eight parts as following: both temporal, both masseter, inferior orbicularis oris, one side of digastric and both sternohyoideus muscles. Five subjects varying in age fron 1 22 to 26 years and weighing from 46 to 64 kg with both sexes took part in this study. The numbers of bringing food to mouth and chewing it are not many in the diet with bread or noodle compared with in the diet with rice, and in the soup without ingredients compared with that with it. The average values for bringing to mouth and chewing are 75. 4 ± 12. 3 times (min; 42, max; 115) and 679. 6 ± 99. 6 times (min; 354, max; 924). Integrated value of EMG is directly proportional to the chewing times and the duration time of taking a daily meal. EMGs produced the patterns with some characters in dropping to mouth, chewing and swallowing, and in case of each food. It is supposed that the diet with rice elevates the number and EWIG activities of chewing {{in comparison with the}} diet with another principal food...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Oropharyngeal {{dysphagia}} is {{a common}} feature of patients with myotonic dystrophy and is not usually perceived due to their emotional deficits and lack of interest. The aim was to show the existence and frequency of subclinical electrophysiological abnormalities in oropharyngeal swallowing and to clarify the mechanisms of dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy.  METHODS—Eighteen patients with myotonic dystrophy were examined for oropharyngeal phase <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> by clinical and electrophysiological methods. Ten patients had dysphagia whereas 11 patients had signs and symptoms reflecting CNS involvement. Four patients with myotonia congenita and 30 healthy volunteers served as controls. Laryngeal movements were detected {{by means of a}} piezoelectric sensor. EMG activities of the submental muscle (SM-EMG) and needle EMG of the cricopharyngeal muscle of the upper eosophageal sphincter (CP-EMG) were also recorded during swallowing.  RESULTS—In about 70 % of the patients with myotonic dystrophy, the existence of oropharyngeal dysphagia was indicated objectively by means of the technique of "dysphagia limit" and by clinical evaluation. Duration <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> reflex as defined by the laryngeal relocation time (0 - 2 time interval) and submental muscle excitation as a part <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> reflex (A-C interval) were significantly prolonged in patients with myotonic dystrophy, especially in dysphagic patients. Triggering time <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> reflex (A- 0 interval) also showed significant prolongation, especially in the patients having both dysphagia and CNS involvement. During <b>swallowing,</b> CP <b>muscle</b> activity was abnormal in 40 % of the patients with myotonic dystrophy.  CONCLUSION—Both myopathic weakness and myotonia encountered in oropharyngeal muscles play an important part in the oral and the pharyngeal phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy. It was also suggested that CNS involvement might contribute to the delay of the triggering <b>of</b> the <b>swallowing</b> reflex and some abnormal EMG findings in the CP sphincter, resulting in oropharyngeal dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy. ...|$|R
