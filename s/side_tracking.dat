50|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on 4 November about 560 km (345 mi) {{north of}} the Cocos Islands, associated with a tight low-level circulation. With good outflow and moderate but decreasing wind shear, conditions favored development. By early on 5 November, the system consisted of a partially exposed circulation with deep convection on its western <b>side,</b> <b>tracking</b> southwestward. At 0400 UTC that day, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth issued a gale warning {{in association with the}} disturbance.

30|$|Bertini et al. (1980) {{report on}} the {{drilling}} of well Sasso 22 – 4092 m depth within the Larderello geothermal field. This well was intended as an exploration well to investigate potential reservoir formations underlying the productive horizons. Nearly the entire well was drilled with complete circulation loss in very hard and inhomogeneous rock. Due to elevated temperatures and corrosive conditions, severe drilling problems such as tool deviation, drill pipe corrosion, breakage, fishing, and <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> arose below 3000  m. Core samples and logs could be retrieved and {{it was found that}} the formations were highly fractured to total depth. Measured temperatures reached 380  °C at 3970  m depth. Due to an unsuccessful primary cement job on the 9 5 / 8 ′′ production casing, and subsequent unsuccessful remedial cementations, the casing was heavily damaged to 2200  m depth after many string maneuvers and shocks. The well therefore had to be abandoned soon after drilling (Baron and Ungemach 1981).|$|E
30|$|A second well, San Pompeo 2, {{targeted}} the same reservoir interval as Sasso 22 (Batini et al. 1983). Again, drilling problems led to <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> of the well. At 2930  m a fractured horizon was found, and the well violently blew out. This {{led to formation}} cave-in, blockage of the drill string, and accumulation of debris in the well. During subsequent cleaning operations, the well blew out again {{and could not be}} controlled, leading to abandonment. Downhole temperatures and pressures up to 394  °C and 212  bar were measured at 2560 m depth. Extrapolated to a depth of 2930  m, the reservoir conditions were estimated to be > 400  °C and 240  bar (Batini et al. 1983). Close to San Pompeo 2, well Carboli 11 was drilled down to 3455  m in 1990. A temperature of 427  °C was indicated at a depth of 3328  m using a melting alloy. In 1991, a sidetrack was drilled down to 3825  m (Ruggieri and Gianelli 1995; UNMIG 2010).|$|E

30|$|Several {{drilling}} issues arose. As {{is common}} in geothermal wells, especially in highly fractured reservoirs, wells were drilled with total circulation loss, and sometimes a very low rate of penetration (ROP) and high bit wear. In addition, problems arose due to additives to the drilling fluid. The fluid sometimes coagulated, blocking the drill string and eventually leading to stuck pipe. Due to the high temperatures and acidic reservoir fluids, drill string fatigue and corrosion was observed, sometimes leading to breakage [(Gunnlaugsson et al. 2014; Miller 1980; Sanada et al. 1998) and references given in “Initial experience with supercritical systems” section]. Consequently fishing, and eventually <b>side</b> <b>tracking,</b> was performed. Often, cementing a casing across high permeability fractures is necessary. The high-temperature environment also affects cement setting kinetics {{and can lead to}} cement-job failures. To be able to economically access and to sustainably utilize supercritical geothermal systems, improved drilling, completion, and cementing practices have to be implemented. Completion components {{have to be able to}} handle high temperatures and pressures and acidic environments. Monitoring of subsurface conditions by measurements while drilling (MWD) can help to predict critical zones and conditions. Scaling and erosion processes have to be considered. Once a well is completed, logging and monitoring instruments have to be capable of operating at ambient downhole conditions.|$|E

Our aim here is to have a much more realistic and broad notion of context and activity implemented in our systems, moving beyond an implicit assumption that all that is significant about a person's activity is on their desktop. We outline our current work extending Recer to track multiple devices and media so that recommendations refer to people, places and things [...] -both physical and digital.

40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI) {{has been}} the leading {{investigator}} {{in the field of}} high power laser applications research for well construction and completion applications. Since 1997, GTI (then as Gas Research Institute- GRI) has investigated several military and industrial laser systems and their ability to cut and drill into reservoir type rocks. In this report, GTI continues its investigation with a 5. 34 kW ytterbium-doped multi-clad high power fiber laser (HPFL). When compared to its competitors; the HPFL represents a technology that is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair. Work performed under this contract included design and implementation of laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of high power laser energy on a variety of rock types. All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole. The results of this experiment will assist {{in the development of a}} downhole laser perforation or <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> prototype tool. To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone. The focus of the experiments was on laser/rock interaction under confining pressure as would be the case for all drilling and completion operations. As such, the results would be applicable to drilling, perforation, and <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> applications. In the past, several combinations of laser and rock variables were investigated at standard conditions and reported in the literature. More recent experiments determined the technical feasibility of laser perforation on multiple samples of rock, cement and steel. The fiber laser was capable of penetrating these materials under a variety of conditions, to an appropriate depth, and with reasonable energy requirements. It was determined that fiber lasers are capable of cutting rock without causing damage to flow properties. Furthermore, the laser perforation resulted in permeability improvements on the exposed rock surface. This report has been prepared in two parts and each part may be treated as a stand-alone document. Part 1 (High Energy Laser Drilling) includes the general description of the concept and focuses on results from experiments under the ambient lab conditions. Part 2 (High Energy Laser Perforation and Completion Techniques) discusses the design and development of a customized laser pressure cell; experimental design and procedures, and the resulting data on pressure-charged samples exposed to the laser beam. An analysis provides the resulting effect of downhole pressure conditions on the laser/rock interaction process...|$|E

30|$|Effective drilled {{cuttings}} {{removal from}} the wellbore {{has been reported}} to be a key challenge in drilling operations (Duan et al. 2008; Gbadamosi et al. 2018 a, b; Hakim et al. 2018). This challenge appears to have being well examined in case of straight hole-angle (Belavadi and Chukwu 1994), {{but in the case of}} highly deviated and horizontal portions of the well, removal of drilled cuttings is still a major problem (Ismail et al. 2016). Also, when drilling in highly deviated and horizontal portions of the annulus, the cleaning of the well worsens with increasing well depth and hole deviation (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989). Application of this form of drilling system is in most cases linked with serious drilling problems which often affect the performance of drilling muds. High torque and drag, barite sag, formation damage, lost circulation, slow drilling rate, increased equivalent circulating density (ECD), kick leading to blowout if not properly controlled, hole instability, and in terrible situation, differential stuck pipe, are several of the problems faced while drilling in highly deviated or horizontal wells (Ismail et al. 2016; Onuoha et al. 2015; Gavignet and Sobey 1989; Ford et al. 1990). If these problems are not properly addressed, it can get worse and probably lead to well <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> or even loss of the entire well (Gatlin 1960). Thus, appropriate design of drilled cuttings transport strategy, such as incorporating optimum drilling fluid properties with the best drilling practice is crucial to obtaining a successful drilling operation.|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the effects of low frequency switching with a non-linear step size DC-to-AC direct conversion on systems that employ photovoltaic (PV) power as an input source. These techniques exhibit dramatic reductions in circuit complexity and power dissipation compared to traditional pure sine-wave inverters. However, designing multilevel DC-to-AC inverter-less systems with maximum efficiency and reduced circuit complexity is challenging. This project has produced two novel multilevel DC-to-AC inverter-less systems for PV applications that reduces the power dissipation and circuit complexity to minimum. First, a DC-to-AC direct conversion system based on two ladders of switches structured as in the Golomb ruler is implemented at 600 Hz switching frequency. The technique has been evaluated analytically, experimentally and by simulation. The evaluation prove the reduction in series resistance loss of Golomb structure over the conventional contiguous block arrangement. It is also shown that Golomb structure can cause uneven PV panel utilization. In order to ensure even panel utilization and produce a good-quality sine-wave output signal, a novel cyclic selection multilevel inverter-less system is developed. The need for the magnetic materials is removed by selecting series and parallel combinations of PV cells. Closed-form cyclic selection expressions are derived and analytically investigated. Calculations prove that this system has exactly the same performance as a conventional magnetic core-based inverter. Laboratory and simulation results prove the efficiency of the system in PV applications. The task of determining the timing steps of the multilevel signal of known amplitude is resolved using a completely new mathematical method to minimize harmonic distortion. Closed-form expressions for the timing steps method are derived for three levels signal and the methodology is extended to an unlimited number of levels. This method gives the same results as the well-known Fourier series method but requires no carefully-chosen optimization starting point. Finally, a multiple step, forward-backward algorithm is employed to maximize the power into a given load. This work uses the second order central difference theory to establish an approximate equation for MPPT. This approach is unlike previous work in that it does not rely on a PV <b>side</b> <b>tracking.</b> Laboratory and simulation results prove the efficiency of the algorithm in rapidly varying insolation conditions...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainty {{analysis}} is performed {{to analyze the}} motions and results of maneuvering characteristics of a 1 / 49 scale surface combatant model during free-running maneuverability testing. The model is designed with a twin rudder and twin propeller rotating inwards. Calm water and wave testing is completed with an initial ship speed corresponding to a Froude number of 0. 20 while the wave cases have wavelength to ship length ratio of 1. 0 and wave height to wavelength ratio of 0. 02. These conditions were tested for course keeping, turning circle, and zig zag maneuvers. The turning circles were completed to both port and starboard <b>side.</b> <b>Tracking</b> of the model is completed with an overhead carriage design with a mounted camera to record the motions {{of the ship and}} convert these motion to six degree of freedom motions. The combination of the tracking systems are analyzed to find the systematic standard uncertainty of the system. Uncertainty was performed in accordance with the performance test codes written by ASME during 2013 to find the systematic standard and random uncertainty of measurements. The random uncertainty is found based on the standard deviation of repeated measurements, while the systematic standard uncertainty is found based on the bias of the measurement system and the sensitivity coefficients found from the data reduction equations. The data reduction equations are used to non-dimensionalize the measured values to compare to CFD results as well as results from other model scales. From the data reduction equations partial derivatives are taken to determine how the uncertainty propagates throughout the sensitivity coefficients. After the uncertainties are calculated the results were compared to other facilities to evaluate the method used and gauge the quality of the repeatability of the measurements. Few other facilities have analyzed the uncertainty during free running tests past looking at the random error based on repeated tests. The comparison with these facilities displayed that the uncertainty process and measurement repeatability used by IIHR at the wave basin produce consistent results with limited uncertainties when the end results of maneuvering characteristics are observed. Large uncertainties occur for some of the measured variables during the full scale of the testing time when the uncertainties are reported {{as a percentage of the}} harmonic amplitudes and the reported harmonic amplitude are near zero with a small uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Background: Marker based {{motion capture}} (MBS) is the {{preferred}} method for 3 D motion analysis in sports injury prevention. There is a continuous search for more efficient and low-cost methods that can produce equally reliable measures. Markerless motion capture systems (MLS), like the Kinect v 1 and v 2 are cheap commercial 3 D sensors that have implications for injury risk research. The purpose of this thesis is to validate a markerless 3 D motion capture system (MLS) against a marker-based motion capture system (MBS). Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy and tracking ability of MLS, Kinect v 1 and v 2 To investigate the <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> ability of MLS To investigate the inter-trial reliability of MLS for each task To assess methods for synchronizing {{the data from the}} MBS and MLS in time and space To consider use of MLS in a clinical setting for knee motion assessment Material and Methods: During two screening sessions with 12 (3) Norwegian elite female basketball players performed three tasks; a vertical drop jump, two-legged squat (front/side) and single-leg squat (left/right). The MLS (Kinect v 1 /v 2) and MBS (Qualisys) simultaneously recorded the respective testing sessions in a 3 D motion analysis lab. Kinematic measures were calculated and compared in a statistical analysis. Results: Kinect v 1 and 2 had very good correlation scores for mean PF during the two-legged squat, indicating a significant relationship between MLS and MBS. Almost all VDJ variables were not significantly different from the MBS (twotailed paired samples t-test, p < 0. 05). KASR was poorly correlated for Kinect v 1, except for mean PF during the squat(SRCC: 0. 93) The two-legged squat scored highest overall in inter-trial reliability for all variables in session 1 and 2 (ICC: 0. 81 - 0. 99). FPPA was estimated more accurately by Kinect v 1 than v 2. Conclusion: Visual inspection of curves (PF and FPPA) for VDJ and squat, confirmed a real relationship between MLS and MBS variables. Adjustments to screening protocol will most likely improve the accuracy of the skeletal tracking (front and side) for Kinect v 2 MLS. A simple method for estimating a common start-point in time for MLS and MBS, was found in session 1. Synchronization in space for kinematic measures require defining local coordinate systems for each body segment in MLS skeleton. Implementation of MLS in a clinical setting require further testing and verification of its accuracy in motion tracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is borehole stability in the Åre Formation of the Heidrun reservoir, in connection with open hole sand screen completions. Due to operational limitations this type of completion will be more sensitive for borehole stability problems, and each failure or misrun will {{cost a lot of}} money in lost equipment, downtime, <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> and delayed production. To find a best practice for drilling and completing these wells will therefore be of key importance for the further field development. The purpose of this Master Thesis was to perform literary studies on coal, borehole stability of fractured formations and previous coal experience, and tie this back to the experienced problems with running screens in the Åre reservoir. Some of the main results are shown below: o Coal is a combustible, organic rock with large heterogeneities and anisotropydue to a very characteristic cleat system. With confining strengths Heidrun coal are quite strong with a UCS of 37 MPa from rock mechanical laboratory testing performed by SINTEF. However, due to the cleat system coal appearsas an easily friable rock, which can cause significant problem downhole whenrunning equipment like open hole screen completions, as is the case on Heidrun. o The presence of coal in the Heidrun reservoir has been investigated, as has the coal appearance in Åre problem wells. The coalbed thickness is mostly quite small, about 0, 5 mTVD, and this would most likely not cause a problem inlow to medium angle wells. Almost horizontal wells on the other hand canhave severe differences with this thickness, well illustrated by well A- 24 T 2. o Due to the unpredictable nature of the coal abundance and cleat orientation some uncertainties can not be eliminated in the planning phase. o Even though there are at least 4 of the problem wells that seemingly has nocoal in them, the general assumption from CPI logs is that coal is the mainproblem geology regarding hole enlargements and possible ledge problematic. o Due to the cleat system, coal can be particularly sensitive to pressure transients, caused by surge/swab and ECD variations. This also applies to other geologies, but to a much smaller degree. The solution can prove to be implementing a good mud system that can prevent pressure equalization through the cleat system of coal. Also LEDO drilling and “finesse” during drilling operations are recommended. o The increase in failure wells in the recent years can possibly explained by an increase in ECD and other pressure transients. In addition, depletion in thereservoir can in case of a permeable borehole wall and high angles have a negative effect on stability. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} Subsea Well Intervention System (SWIS) andto test the hypothesis that this system has significant potential economic benefits over asemi-submersible rig-based system which is normally used for completing common subseawell intervention procedures. These interventions are carried out in water depths from 200 mto 3, 000 m. This thesis describes SWIS and its applications to subsea well interventions, discusses themain technical issues involved and provides an economic analysis of the cost benefit incomparison to semi-submersible and Drill Ship rig-based systems. Examples of subsea wellinterventions discussed in this thesis include: de-sanding, de-scaling, re-entry drilling andwellhead recovery. A discussion {{and analysis of the}} vessel response to the likely operatingsea states and an analysis of heave compensation for the Coiled Tubing (CT) system isincluded as these are critical factors to the technical viability of SWIS. SWIS is designed to have a light to medium level well intervention capability and it willprovide a tool for common subsea well intervention procedures. It is not designed for tubingchange out which is classified as a heavy level workover. In this case a conventional rig or aHydraulic Workover rig supported by a semi-submersible would be used. SWIS will be designed to include the following capabilities: Well and field abandonment;Artificial Lift Services; Re-entry Drilling using CT including well <b>side</b> <b>tracking</b> anddeepening operations (Operations to include CT under-balanced drilling and ThroughTubing); Deployment and recovery of Sand Control Screens using CT as a conveying tool;Through Tubing Completions using CT as a conveying tool; Post-completion well clean-upoperations; Slick-line and electric line operations and sub-sea wellhead maintenance andrecovery. The SWIS concept vessel is a large scale wave piercing catamaran which will be maintainedon station and heading into the prevailing sea using a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS). Initial modelling of the response of the vessel to typical expected operating sea stateconditions is encouraging because the results indicate that this type of vessel will provide astable platform from which to carry out typical subsea well intervention procedures. The modelling has demonstrated that the vessel motions (other than heave) are minimalunder the expected operating conditions and will be compensated by the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR) and the CT. The heave amplitude and heave acceleration of the centre of gravity of the vessel will besuch that an off the shelf heave compensation system is available for the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR). Research has indicated that existing CT heave compensation systems can bereadily modified for use with SWIS to provide the required level of motion compensation tocarry out intervention procedures in moderately rough seas. The hypothesis that a catamaran based platform used for the above purpose has significantpotential economic benefits over a semi-submersible for common types of interventionprocedures is supported by the research completed. It is concluded that the savings resultingfrom the use of the SWIS vessel compared to a semi-submersible would be around USD 360, 000 per day. It is also concluded from the research and modelling completed that SWIS is a technicallyand economically viable system. Based on the survey carried out it has the potential for ahigh degree of utilization in the East Asian and Australian offshore regions due of the abovecost saving. It also has the potential for a high degree of utilisation in other offshore regions such as Brazil and West Africa where sea states are light to moderate...|$|E
