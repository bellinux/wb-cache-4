5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is <b>sliced</b> <b>into</b> triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then <b>sliced</b> <b>into</b> triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

40|$|Lathyrism, a human {{neurological}} disorder {{has been linked}} to the excessive consumption of a plant toxin, p-oxalylamino-L-alanine CL-BOAA) present in Lathyrus sativus. The present study was carried out to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying L-BOAA-induced toxic insult. Incubation of sagittal slices of mouse brain with L-BOAA resulted in dose and time-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial NADH-dehydro-genase (NADH-DH). Significant inhibition of NADH-DH was seen following incubation of brain slices with very low concentration of L-BOAA (0. 1 PM). L-BOAA also induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from the <b>slice</b> <b>into</b> the medium in dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of NADH-DH preceded LDH leakage from the <b>slices</b> <b>into</b> the medium. L-BOAA had no effect on other mitochondrial enzymes, namely, isocitrate dehydrogenase or cytochrome c oxidase. Incubation of isolated mouse brain mitochondria with L-BOAA also resulted in inhibition of NADH-DH. L-BOAA-induced inhibition of NADH-DH was prevented by non-N-methyl-o-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate receptor antago-nists in general and a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist (NBQX) in particular. Other glutamate agonists examined namely, N-methyl-p-aspartate, /?-N-methylamino-L-alanine (L-BMAA), L-glutamic acid, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), quisqualic acid, kainic acid or AMPA did not have any effect on NADH-DH activity in slices although they induced LDH leakage from the <b>slice</b> <b>into</b> the medium. Incubation of brain slices with L-BOAA did not induce lipid peroxidation or changes in glutathione levels. Prior incubation of slices with glutathione (GSH) or GSH-isopropyl ester did not prevent L-BOAA-induced inhibition of NADH-DH. However, incubation of isolated mitochondria with L-BOAA in the presence of GSH-isopropyl ester prevented L-BOAA-induced inhibition of NADH-DH, indicating th...|$|R
