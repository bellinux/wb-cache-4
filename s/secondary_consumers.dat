5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E

They have a big impact on the biodiversity of the area.

Copepods are a group of small crustaceans found in ocean and freshwater habitats. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea, and are important prey for forage fish. Krill constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers,</b> along with the forage fish.|$|E

50|$|Within an {{ecological}} food chain, consumers are categorized into three groups: primary consumers, <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and the tertiary consumers.

Here, we show that in Svalbard in the high Arctic, extreme weather events synchronize population fluctuations across an entire community of resident vertebrate herbivores and cause lagged correlations with the <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer,</b> the arctic fox. This synchronization is mainly driven by heavy rain on snow that encapsulates the vegetation in ice and blocks winter forage availability for herbivores. Thus, indirect and bottom-up climate forcing drives the population dynamics across all overwintering vertebrates.

40|$|Abstract. Anatomical, histological, and ultrastructural {{investigation}} of the hydrothermal vent phyllodocid Galupagomystides aristata shows that this unusual polychaete has a normal mouth and foregut but a highly modified midgut with a blood-filled lumen.

Midgut tissues contain concentrically banded spherocrystals, composed mainly of iron, phosphorus, and silicon, and abundant lipid droplets.

More specifically, the paper investigates the household willingness-to-pay in the UK for a GM and non-GM labelling program under two alternative payment vehicles: 1) a standard product tax, under which consumers must trade-off some of their personal income for the labelling program; and 2) a taxation reallocation scheme, whereby consumers must trade-off some amount of their household’s taxation money that is currently spent on other government-funded goods. Contrary to previous valuation research, the willingness-to-pay under each vehicle is not found to be statistically significantly different, suggesting that in the case study investigated here, the marginal values of private income and other public goods in the UK are approximately equal. ...|$|R
50|$|Lead has marked adverse {{environmental}} impacts in aquatic systems. Water {{from the region}} eventually drains into the Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, which has raised lead levels in the lake. A health advisory warns people {{to limit the number}} of fish they consume from this area.Estimates in 1982 showed lead and cadmium levels in the underground aquifer of Picher were five times the national standards for drinking water. Mine water has to be treated to prevent its contaminating other clean water sources, such as nearby Grand Lake, which already has elevated levels of lead due to mining activities. Photosynthetic organisms in the water have no means to dispose of heavy metals they absorb and accumulate these. Any animal or fish that feeds on this primary producer accumulates the higher concentrations of these contaminants, as the primary producer has a higher concentration of heavy metals relative to the water. <b>Secondary</b> and tertiary <b>consumers</b> accumulate even higher concentrations of such metals in a process called biomagnification). Since humans consume fish rather than phytoplankton, they are considered a <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer,</b> and are at high risk of lead poisoning from fish taken from contaminated lakes.|$|R

50|$|Predators {{are often}} another organism's prey, and {{likewise}} prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes {{may be the}} prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as <b>secondary</b> <b>consumers.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>consumers</b> are a type of carnivore, {{but there are also}} tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quaternary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain is called an apex predator; examples include the sperm whale, Komodo dragon, tiger, and most eagles and owls. Many predators eat from multiple levels of the food chain. A carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers, and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons. Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores. Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of an experimental food chain permits {{a study of}} the impact of the radioactive pollution on the marine environment. The chain is constituted by unicellular algae (Dunaliella bioculata or Acetabularia mediterranea), a filter feeding organism (Mytilus edulis) and a carnivore (Carcinus maenas). It was found that 60 Co is mostly concentrated (at least 100 times) at the level of the primary producers. Under laboratory conditions, the primary consumer (Mytilus) concentrates about 20 times the 60 Co, when this radionuclide is bound to Dunaliella cells or to Acetabularia chloroplasts. However, 50 - 70 % of the 60 Co are rapidly (48 h) lost when the mussels are transferred to normal sea water. After 2 weeks, only 10 % of the initial radioactivity is present in the mussels. After a single meal (6 h), the <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer</b> (Carcinus) ingested an important part (about 30 %) of the radioactive food. By transfer into normal sea water, the radioactivity in the crabs progressively decreases. These results underline the importance of 60 Co for health protection...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{and past}} {{research}} suggests that greater levels of consumer involvement and product usage lead {{to higher levels of}} word of mouth (WOM). This paper presents some tests of hypotheses related to product usage and WOM, based on <b>secondary</b> <b>consumer</b> panel data from five fmcg product trials. The main findings are that brand usage range within a product category has a pervasive effect on pre-trial intentions to recommend the trialled product, as well as the actual number of WOM conversations generated by the trial and their effectiveness (the rate of attitudinal conversion based on interest generated). Frequency of product use only significantly affects the number of WOM conversations. Second, compared to non-users, being a loyal user of the trialled product (having used the brand more frequently than other brands) has a negative effect on WOM effectiveness, while non-loyal users' WOM is more effective compared to that of loyal users. The study thereby provides more evidence that loyal users are not necessarily the best targets of WOM marketing campaigns, and suggests that research on the interaction between involvement or product usage and loyalty in relation to firm-generated WOM may be an interesting area of further research...|$|R
