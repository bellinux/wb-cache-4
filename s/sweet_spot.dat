25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on the <b>sweet</b> <b>spot,</b> they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E
25|$|As {{a matter}} of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus {{generally}} have better sharpness when stopped down some– note that this is sharpness in the plane of critical focus, setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction begins to become significant. There is accordingly a <b>sweet</b> <b>spot,</b> generally in the 4– 8 range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{even though}} tight {{sandstone}} gas reservoirs present large gas-bearing areas, their enrichment {{is controlled by}} <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> and fractures, and they show signs of partial accumulation (Zhao et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2007). <b>Sweet</b> <b>spots</b> {{are considered to be}} central to tight reservoirs. The USGS in 1999 first defined <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> as resource blocks that are capable of offering continuous stable production for 30  years. Law (2002) proposed that <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> are composed of tight sandstone zones with relatively high porosity and permeability. <b>Sweet</b> <b>spots</b> are now commonly used to study unconventional resources and are defined as local zones of higher porosity and permeability that are capable of offering relatively high daily gas production and continuous economic production within areas with poor physical properties. <b>Sweet</b> <b>spots</b> can be divided into two types: “Pore” <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> and “Fracture” <b>sweet</b> <b>spots.</b> “Pore” <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> are mainly controlled by sedimentation and diagenesis processes, and “Fracture” <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> are controlled by fracture distribution, with structural fractures serving as the most critical factor (Yang et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|The {{reasoning}} being <b>Sweet</b> <b>Spots</b> {{stems from}} the classical effect in psychology known as the Serial position effect (aka. the rules of recency and primacy). The thought is, customers {{are most likely to}} remember the first and last things they see on a menu—hence, <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> on a menu should be where the customers look first and last. To date, there is no empirical evidence on the efficacy of the <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> on menus.|$|R
30|$|Source rocks as a reservoir, such as shales and coals, are {{not only}} usually poor in quality but may be also more {{heterogeneous}} relative to many other reservoirs, particularly those of conventional accumulations. The heterogeneity of a source-rock reservoir, however, is generally a propitious factor for the occurrence of abundant hydrocarbon accumulations because <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> can only be developed in reservoirs with certain heterogeneity. Otherwise, hydrocarbon enrichment might be unlikely if the source-rock reservoirs are highly uniform {{in terms of their}} properties. It is the reservoir heterogeneity and development of <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> that control the specific locations of hydrocarbon enrichment. The <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> in source rocks can be classified into two types: structural and non-structural. The former is represented by anticlinal <b>sweet</b> <b>spots,</b> while the latter includes geochemical <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> (favorable regions for TOC, Ro, thickness, etc.) and petrophysical (porosity and permeability) <b>sweet</b> <b>spots.</b> Accordingly, continuous accumulations can be divided into two types, namely structural sweet-spot accumulations and non-structural sweet-spot accumulations. In general, structural sweet-spot accumulations are characterized by higher resource abundance and producibility and relatively smaller areas of oil/gas distribution than non-structural sweet-spot accumulations. For example, the Fuling Field in the Sichuan Basin seems to be a structural sweet-spot type of shale gas accumulation (Zhao et al. 2016 a).|$|R
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} electrical charge noise on a resonant exchange (RX) qubit in a triple quantum dot. This RX qubit is {{a variation of the}} exchange-only spin qubit which responds to a narrow-band resonant frequency. Our noise model includes uncorrelated charge noise in each quantum dot giving rise to two independent (noisy) bias parameters ε and Δ. We calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a function of these two bias detuning parameters to find "sweet spots", where the qubit is least susceptible to noise. Our investigation shows that such <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> exist within the low bias regime, in which the bias detuning parameters have the same magnitude as the hopping parameters. The location of the <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> in the (ε,Δ) plane depends on the hopping strength and asymmetry between the quantum dots. In the regime of weak charge noise, we identify a new favorable operating regime for the RX qubit based on these <b>sweet</b> <b>spots.</b> Comment: 11 pages (including two appendices), 6 figure...|$|R

The conditions for <b>sweet</b> <b>spots</b> with minimal charge noise are predicted analytically and verified numerically.

500|$|Rivera's {{signature}} pitch was a cut fastball or [...] "cutter", which exhibited {{lateral movement}} towards left-handed hitters {{similar to that}} of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the <b>sweet</b> <b>spot</b> of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a [...] "buzz saw". Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, allowing him to impart more spin on the ball. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, [...] "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90smph.|$|E
