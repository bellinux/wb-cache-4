In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.

5|$|In December 1695 the Spanish colonial {{authorities}} in Mérida received a diplomatic visit {{sent by the}} Aj Kan Ek'. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, alcalde of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived {{around the same time}} that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'.

5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> William.|$|E

Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found {{that the majority of the}} inhabitants had fled.

Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Antiochus III {{launched}} a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II.

The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at Magnesia in 190BC. Phriapatius of Parthia (r. c.191–176BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I of Parthia (r. c.176–171BC) eventually ascended the throne. Phraates I ruled Parthia without further Seleucid interference.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> authority.|$|E
5|$|At the {{midpoint}} of the twelfth century, the kingdom was under the overlordship of Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster (died 1171). The latter's ultimate overking, however, was Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166). The year after Brodar's death, numerous sources indicate that Mac Murchada, with a force of Dubliners in tow, formally rendered <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Mac Lochlainn. In 1162, the fifteenth–sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals that Mac Murchada gained an almost-unprecedented authority over Dublin. There is reason to suspect that his success stemmed from assistance received from Mac Lochlainn. The latter, for example, is recorded by the same source to have laid siege to the town within the year. In fact, this military campaign may have been undertaken to counter the Dubliners' attempt to install Gofraid mac Amlaíb, King of the Isles (died 1187) to the kingship of Dublin, as recounted by the thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E

5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the legal arguments, but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had almost universally recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E
