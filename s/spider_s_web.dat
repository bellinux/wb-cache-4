Within the client/server scope we will consider existing online education systems and their lack of interactivity. Usage of various Java based technologies like multimedia authoring with JMF (Java Media Framework), online agents and search with XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are provided as improvements. All these methods are used together with databases and existing information resources. We give some examples of courses produced with these methodologies.

This paper reports on a study to investigate the factors that influence the creation of links to journal Web sites. An empirical approach is used: collecting data and testing for significant patterns. The specific questions addressed are whether site age and site content are inducers of links to a journal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Web</b> site as measured by the ratio of link counts to Journal Impact Factors, two variables previously discovered to be related. A new methodology for data collection is also introduced that uses the Internet Archive to obtain an earliest known creation date for Web sites.

Comparisons between the two fields also show disciplinary differences in Web site characteristics.
