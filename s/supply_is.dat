5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E

5|$|Germanium {{differs from}} silicon {{in that the}} <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> limited by the {{availability}} of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and quartz.

The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has decreased in significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city's international airport in 1999.|$|E

5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power <b>supply,</b> <b>is</b> used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} gas {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field {{off the coast of}} County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> some of the cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E
5000|$|Unreliable maps or poor {{visibility}} in the drop zone meant that <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> often misdropped. Parachutes <b>were</b> in limited <b>supply.</b> As a result, only essential equipment, ammunition and medical <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> dropped with parachutes. Rations and other <b>supplies</b> <b>were</b> [...] "free dropped". Packaging was primitive and inadequate. The {{rate of recovery}} was low {{and the rate of}} breakage high - on average, 50 percent. Of a drop made on 22 November, it was reported that only about 5 percent was recovered.|$|R

5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Ramanathapuram circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> provided by the Rameswaram Municipality – the head works is located at Nambunayaki Amman Kovil, Meyyambuli, Semmamadam & Natarajapuram and distributed through four over head tanks having a total capacity of 1430,000 litres. About 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town {{every day in the}} four zones covering the whole of the town. Rameswaram does not have a sewerage system for disposal of sullage and the disposal system consists of septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry untreated sewage out of the town to let out raw into the sea or accumulates in low-lying area.|$|E

Water <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> provided by the Sirkazhi municipality from the Kollidam river; it is distributed through five water tanks which supply 2million (two million) litres a day. Push carts and tricycles are used to collect solid waste, which is deposited in marsh lands located outside the town. Sirkazhi municipality is implementing underground drainage and the current sewerage system is through septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry away untreated sewage, which is released into the sea or accumulates in low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk <b>supply</b> <b>is</b> exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E
