5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing {{what is best for}} the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The <b>Social</b> <b>Conquest</b> of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E

The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite: hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis."

He supported his reasoning by stating our eusocial similarities to ants, and by observing that early hominins cooperated to rear their children while {{other members of the}} same group hunted and foraged; he noted that all eusocial species went through just such a stage of collective rearing. Humans also fall under some of Wilson's original criteria of eusociality (some kind of division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of young including ones that are not their own). Wilson argued that through cooperation and teamwork, ants and humans gain a type of [...] "superpower" [...] that is unavailable to other social animals that have failed to make the leap from social to eusocial.

But in addition, transitional demands include the call for [...] "employment and decent living conditions for all" [...] and reach beyond what the capitalists will willingly give, challenging the [...] "very basis of the bourgeois regime." [...] Demands such as higher wages are not impossible demands in themselves, Trotsky argues, but capitalism in crisis demands lower wages in the hope of increasing profitability. Transitional demands therefore do not draw back {{in the face of the}} contingencies of capitalist economics, but on the contrary, it is proposed, they continually challenge the logic of the capitalist system, expose it in the eyes of the workers, and thus help them draw towards a fully rounded out socialist consciousness - an acceptance and adoption of the [...] "maximum programme" [...] which the socialist leaders kept for their holiday speechifying, as an immediate and realistic necessity.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, after the American LGBT liberationist {{movement}} {{has managed to}} make new voices heard and acquired certain <b>social</b> <b>conquests,</b> partly overturning decades of exclusion and segregation, gay American drama has often focused on the stories of white upper-middle class men who lead lives that conform to heteronormative roles.

However, the LGBT collective debates between stances of assimilation to mainstream society and the intention of preserving identity paradigms that differ from hegemonic norms. The intersections between sexuality and ethnic identity offer an alternative model of characterization in drama, one that highlights differences and addresses issues that are frequently overlooked by the mainstream. The crosses between race and sexual orientation focus on the preservation of differences {{as a response to}} conformity to social mores.

60|$|Mrs. Ludlow sacrificed, as I say, to Paris, yet {{had doubts}} and wonderments not allayed at that altar; and {{after her husband}} had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations. They all had Isabel for subject; but Edmund Ludlow, as he had always done before, {{declined}} to be surprised, or distressed, or mystified, or elated, at anything his sister-in-law might have done or have failed to do. Mrs. Ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various. At one moment {{she thought it would}} be so natural for that young woman to come home and take a house in New York--the Rossiters', for instance, which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own; at another she couldn't conceal her surprise at the girl's not marrying some member of one of the great aristocracies. On the whole, as I have said, she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities. She had taken more satisfaction in Isabel's accession of fortune than if the money had been left to herself; it had seemed to her to offer just the proper setting for her sister's slightly meagre, but scarce the less eminent figure. Isabel had developed less, however, than Lily had thought likely--development, to Lily's understanding, being somehow mysteriously connected with morning-calls and evening-parties. Intellectually, doubtless, she had made immense strides; but she appeared to have achieved few of those <b>social</b> <b>conquests</b> of which Mrs. Ludlow had expected to admire the trophies. Lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague; but this was exactly what she had expected of Isabel--to give it form and body. Isabel could have done as well as she had done in New York; and Mrs. Ludlow appealed to her husband to know whether there was any privilege she enjoyed in Europe which the society of that city might not offer her. We know ourselves that Isabel had made conquests--whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land it would be a delicate matter to decide; and it is not altogether with a feeling of complacency that I again mention that she had not rendered these honourable victories public. She had not told her sister the history of Lord Warburton, nor had she given her a hint of Mr. Osmond's state of mind; and she had had no better reason for her silence than that she didn't wish to speak. It was more romantic to say nothing, and, drinking deep, in secret, of romance, she was as little disposed to ask poor Lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever. But Lily knew nothing of these discriminations, and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti-climax--an impression confirmed by the fact that Isabel's silence about Mr. Osmond, for instance, was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts. As this happened very often it sometimes appeared to Mrs. Ludlow that she had lost her courage. So uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune was of course perplexing to the cheerful Lily; it added to her general sense that Isabel was not at all like other people.|$|R

In particular, I analyze how David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, and his Bible study group parsed the book of Joshua and argue that their interpretations, like the book of Joshua itself, represent projections of nationalist desire onto a varied, multifarious <b>social</b> setting. Joshua’s <b>conquest</b> and Israel’s founding narrative both involve military narratives generated in order to obscure the presence of non-nationals. In the next stage of the argument, I suggest that the story of the conquest itself attests to the very fluid social setting that it aims to overcome. Just as Ben-Gurion appealed to Joshua as precedent and the contemporary State of Israel looks to Ben-Gurion as a model, post-nationalists can locate a paradigm in the selfsame founding myths...|$|R
40|$|General {{education}} must develop in students {{an appreciation of}} the power of science, how it works, why it is an effective knowledge generation tool, and what it can deliver. Knowing what science has discovered is desirable but less important. Surely one aim of that uniquely American learning aspiration we call general education is to give college graduates the capacity and the confidence to think for themselves about big questions. One of the biggest questions is the human condition. Why are we such a bundle of contradictions? How can we be both selfless and selfish? How can the same person be kind to animals and instigate the Holocaust? In The <b>Social</b> <b>Conquest</b> of Earth, E. O. Wilson, a scientist who has spent his life studying insects, proposes a radical answer: “The human dilemma was foreordained in the way our species evolved [...] [G]ood and evil was created by multilevel selection, in which individual selection and group selection act together on the same individual but largely in opposition to each other ” (2012, p. 241). This is an audacious hypothesis. Many people, including philosophers, novelists, and religious leaders, offer very different perspectives. Wilson says that none can have the answer because an explanation cannot be generated by introspection alone. Instead, he unapologetically offers an aggressively scientific answer: evolution made us so. What is a well-educated citizen to make of this argument? She is almost cer-tainly not a science graduate. How is she to decide whether Wilson’s argument is worth considering at all? If she does consider it, how is she to evaluate it? More generally, what does a nonscientist need to have a fighting chance of generating an informed understanding of any scientific claim?

40|$|This is not {{a perfect}} book, but it is unique, and if you skim the first 400 or so pages, the last 300 (of some 700) are a pretty good attempt to apply what's known about {{behavior}} to social changes in violence and manners over time. The basic topic is: how does our genetics control and limit social change? Surprisingly he fails to describe the nature of kin selection (inclusive fitness) which explains much of animal and human social life. He also (like nearly everyone) lacks a clear framework for describing the logical structure of rationality (LSR—John Searle’s preferred term) which I prefer to call the Descriptive Psychology of Higher Order Thought (DPHOT). He should have said something about the many other ways of abusing and exploiting people and the planet, since these are now so much more severe as to render other forms of violence irrelevant. Extending the concept of violence to include the global long term consequences of replication of someone’s genes, and having a grasp {{of the nature of}} how evolution works (i. e., kin selection) will provide a very different perspective on history, current events, and how things are likely to go in the next few hundred years. One might start by noting that the decrease in physical violence over history has been matched (and made possible) by the constantly increasing merciless rape of the planet (i. e., by people's destruction of their own descendants future). Pinker (like most people most of the time) is often distracted by the superficialities of culture when it’s biology that matters. See my recent reviews of Wilson’s ‘The <b>Social</b> <b>Conquest</b> of Earth’ and Nowak and Highfield’s ‘SuperCooperators’ for a brief summary of the vacuity of altruism and the operation of kin selection and the uselessness and superficiality of describing behavior in cultural terms.

As you get to the end he lets his anti-science and anti-rationality out in the open, telling us that regardless of whether our behavior is innate we should not investigate it! The fact that our brain is no different from our other organs and it's functions a product of genes and evolution continues to be resisted or just ignored not only by academics but by the general public. Nevertheless the basics of our behavior are as innate as our heartbeat and detailed evidence (for those who have trouble with the obvious) is all around us everywhere we look once our eyes are opened-just watch people doing anything or turn on the tv (or see the huge and rapidly growing scientific literature). Novices can start with Pinker's "The Blank Slate" but there are now dozens of good popular and scientific books on evolutionary psychology and hundreds of articles in the literature of philosophy, psychology, economics etc. The articles in Buss's The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology and some at the end of Gazzinaga's The Cognitive Neurosciences 3 are good starting points for the serious reader., and science are all manifestations of our innate psychology (with the minor extensions we call culture and civilization), you can look almost anywhere in literature or life to study our adapted mind except here.

40|$|International audienceFrom {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his work on gentrification, Neil Smith has stressed the role of public policies in this process (Smith, 1979). After Philadelphia, Smith analyzed New York public policies in the nineties as revanchist policies that clearly supported gentrification (Smith, 1996), which led him to conceptualize gentrification as a general urban strategy. This chapter presents the case of public policies in Paris since the accession to power of the leftwing Socialist Party and discusses the concept of a “revanchist city”. I argue that not only do revanchist or neoliberal policies support gentrification, but also that inclusive discourses on social mix and the promotion of public social housing can also foster gentrification, without meeting with any resistance. Although the city of Paris is not widely known for its gentrification, this process of <b>social</b> and urban <b>conquest</b> of working-class neighborhoods by a new middle class was well advanced in 2001 when a leftwing Mayor was elected. The new Mayor, Bertrand Delanoë, set a new goal for city planning: promoting social mix in every part of the city. This emphasis placed by Delanoë on social mix in each public address was held up as a complete departure from the rightwing policies of the past. The main policy that was perceived as contrasting with the past was the revitalization of public social housing. Since 2001, the policies of the Left in Paris have been characterized by strong public action and by the promotion of a mixed city shared between diverse social and ethnic groups, generations and genders. However, this chapter demonstrates that theses policies are only a ‘soft’ way of fostering gentrification, and that we need to deconstruct this promotion of ‘social mix’. References:Smith, N. (1979).
