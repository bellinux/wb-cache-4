50|$|Non-weight bearing {{lameness}} (grade 5) is {{most commonly}} the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hoof</b> abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable {{and do not}} cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non-weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection.|$|R

50|$|Hoof cracks are separations or {{breaks in}} the wall <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hoof.</b> The {{most common type of}} hoof cracks are quarter cracks, which occur at the quarter, the {{thinnest}} and most delicate part of the hoof wall.

Quarter cracks originate from the coronet and run down the hoof wall, rather than a sand crack that begins at the ground surface and runs up the hoof wall. Hoof cracks force 2% of racehorses to retire.|$|R
