5000|$|Lombe's Mill, in Derby was {{the first}} {{successful}} powered <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> <b>mill</b> in England. John Lombe visited a successful <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> <b>mill</b> in Piedmont in 1717, and returned to England with details of the Italian silk throwing machines- the filatoio, and the torcitoio, and with some Italian craftsmen built replicas. [...] This was an early example of industrial espionage. The architect George Sorocold built it next to Thomas Cotchett's failed 1704 mill (which used copies of Dutch throwing machines) {{on the west bank}} of the River Derwent. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe, born 1685, instructed George Sorocold to build a mill for the Italian-style machines. To the north of the powered Italian Works an un-powered Doubling Shop was built at some time before 1739, and when this mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson an inventory taken which still exists today. Thomas Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used. The King of Sardinia responded to this challenge badly, and stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe, took over the business.|$|E
50|$|King Edward I granted {{permission}} {{to build a}} mill. Congleton became an important centre of textile production, especially leather gloves and lace. Congleton had an early <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> <b>mill,</b> the Old Mill built by John Clayton and Nathaniel Pattison in 1753. More mills followed, and cotton was also spun. The town's prosperity depended on tariffs imposed on imported silk. When tariffs were removed in the 1860s, the empty mills were converted to fustian cutting. A limited silk ribbon weaving industry survived into the 20th century, and woven labels were still produced in the 1990s. Many mills survive as industrial or residential units.|$|E

He was granted a fourteen-year patent, and built Lombe's Mill in Derby. The King of Sardinia retaliated by prohibiting the export of raw silk. Nevertheless, in 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport, and in 1744, The Button Mill was erected in Macclesfield and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton.

50|$|J.S. O'Connor American Rich Cut Glassware Factory, {{also known}} as Maple City Glass Company, H.W. Kimble Silk Company, and Arrow Throwing Company, is a {{historic}} glassware factory and silk mill located at Hawley, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. With the waning of the canal and gravity rail operations in the late 19th Century, Hawley developed into a busy manufacturing town. In addition to silk fabric and garments, among the chief products was fine cut glass. The leading cut glass establishment was that of John Sarsfield O’Connor (1831 - 1916) {{at the base of}} the Paupack Falls. The building was built on the site of previous mills of wood frame construction in 1890. The earliest of these dates back to the founding of the hamlet of Paupack Eddy, the forerunner of Hawley, in the closing decade of the 18th Century. It is a three-story, 160 feet long and 44 feet wide, bluestone building in the Federal style, with an addition 40 by 75 feet. J.S. O’Connor Rich Cut Glass has been described as one of the most extensive glass cutting factories in America. O’Connor is recalled as one of the finest glass cutters in the nation.The factory was said to be one of its kind in America, run by water power and lit by electricity generated by its own electrical plant. The firm had a capacity of 250 cutting frames. When the third floor was rebuilt, 50 cutting frames were added.This brought the workforce from 150 to nearly 200, and a new showroom was built. Another reference says that the workforce eventually reached almost 300. In 1902, the cut glass firm relocated from Hawley to Goshen, Orange County, NY. On January 16th of that year, J. S. O’Connor sold his Hawley plant. The addition was built in 1926, when the building was converted to a <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> <b>mill.</b> In 1941 Daniel Vacca Sr, purchased the silk mill. Vacca & Sons operated the Arrow Throwing Company at the facility. During World War II, the Vaccas were a major supplier of yarn for emblems and insignias as well as nylon cord for parachutes. Arrow Throwing Company, the last remaining silk mill in Hawley and one of the few throwing mills left in the Northeast, closed its doors in 1987. Soon a lobby was added to the building by new owners in 1988, when converted to an inn, and a restaurant was added years later. It has a shed roof and features pedimented windows and a decorative cornice.|$|E

50|$|Silk is a {{naturally}} produced fibre obtained from {{many species of}} the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5-10 μm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented {{in place by the}} use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. <b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling.|$|R

There is an illustration of a circular handpowered throwing machine drawn in 1487 with 32 spindles. The Italians called the throwing machine, a filatoio, and the doubler, a torcitoio.

The process was described in detail to Lord Shaftesbury's Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Employment of Children in 1841:For twisting it is necessary to have what are designated shades which are buildings of at least 30 or 35 yards in length, of two or more rooms, rented separately by one,two or four men having one gate and a boy called a helper... the upper storey is generally occupied by children, young persons or grown women as 'piecers', 'winders' and 'doublers' attending to their reels and bobbins, driven by the exertions of one man...
