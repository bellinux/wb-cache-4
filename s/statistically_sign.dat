40|$|Objective: Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} which develops due to intracranial aneurysm rupture, is {{an urgent}} medical situation. It {{is also a}} catastrofic incident with a high mortality rate of 50 %. 60 % of the patients who can reach neurosurgery clinics can survive, whereas 20 % of them lose their life. Therefore, the primary factors and their effects on the final results should be overviewed in detail so they can {{shed light on the}} prognosis of aneurysm related subarachnoid hemorrhage. Material and Methods: In Bakırköy Professor Dr. Mazhar Osman, Mental Health and Neurological Diseases Training and Research Hospital, 3 rd Neurosurgery Clinic, 130 intracranial aneurysms diagnosed patients were admitted and observed between January 1996 and July 2004. One hundered and nineteen of these 130 cases were operated and treated by clipping the intracranial aneurysms. The remaining 11 patients were embolized with coil. In this study, the effect of age, gender, existence of hypertension, alcohol and tobacco consumption, aneurysm localization, hydrocephalus development and the patients state at the time of admission, to the neurological outcome of the patient, were discussed {{in the light of the}} literature. Results: When we look at the distribution of gender within the total 119 aneurysms cases, we noticed that there were 71 (59. 7 %) females, 48 (40. 3 %) males and their mean age was 47. 3. In our study, it is proved that 67. 2 % of patients were found to have good neurological outcome at their time of discharge, and the mortality rate is 10. 1 %. By using the linear regression analysis stepwise method, it is found that the neurological state (Beta= - 0. 378, p< 0. 005) and the gender (Beta= - 0. 282, p= 0. 001) of the admitted patient, have <b>statistically</b> <b>sign</b> ıficant effects on their neurological charts while being discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: We noticed that fernale cases were 59. 7 % predominant to mail in this case. This result was similar to other studies. However, we discovered that being female effected the prognosis in a deteriorating situation. Likewise, we discovered that patients with bad initial neurological states also had bad prognosis.

The results of the analysis are important for the further correction and improvement of web part organization. The aim of the paper is modeling of probabilities‘ accesses to the categories of web parts of portal. We deal with the access probabilities to the individual categories of faculty portal content depending on the day’s hour and the week’s day. The probabilities are estimated using multinomial logit model for employees and students separately. In logit models, in case of students and employees, the week’s days present <b>statistically</b> significant <b>signs,</b> representing dummy variables (MON, TUE,…) in the model. On the other hand, day’s hours representing with variables HOUR_DAY and their square HOUR_DAY_Q, are shown as <b>statistically</b> significant <b>signs</b> only in the case of students. These results correspond with the computing probabilities wherein the probabilities of access to web parts of the portal are more stable in the case of employees than of students during the day. The analysis provided us several interesting and surprising results. For instance, from the analysis, results follow that the part study is the most visited part by students in the evening and night hours. The analysis results confirmed general trends, for example the part announcements is the most visited part in morning’s hours, at the beginning of the week especially. All of the analysis results will help us to further optimize our web portal. This is especially point in level of portal adaptivity on the basis user and access hour on portal...|$|R

We {{investigate}} the relative timing between hard X-ray (HXR) peaks and structures in metric and decimetric radio emissions of solar flares {{using data from}} the RHESSI and Phoenix- 2 instruments. The radio events under consideration are predominantly classified as type III bursts, decimetric pulsations and patches. The RHESSI data are demodulated using special techniques appropriate for a Phoenix- 2 temporal resolution of 0. 1 s. The absolute timing accuracy of the two instruments is found to be about 170 ms, and much better on the average. It is found that type III radio groups often coincide with enhanced HXR emission, but only a relatively small fraction (∼ 20 %) of the groups show close correlation on time scales < 1 s. If structures correlate, the HXRs precede the type III emissions in a majority of cases, and by 0. 69 ± 0. 19 s on the average. Reversed drift type III bursts are also delayed, but high-frequency and harmonic emission is retarded less. The decimetric pulsations and patches (DCIM) have a larger scatter of delays, but do not have a <b>statistically</b> significant <b>sign</b> or an average different from zero. The time delay does not show a center-to-limb variation excluding simple propagation effects.

40|$|A {{profound}} assumption in peculiar velocity cosmology is b(v) = 1 at sufficiently large scales, where bv is the volume-weighted halo(galaxy) velocity bias {{with respect}} to the matter velocity field. However, this fundamental assumption has not been robustly verified in numerical simulations. Furthermore, it is challenged by structure formation theory (Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser and Szalay, Astrophys. J. 304, 15 (1986); Desjacques and Sheth, Phys. Rev D 81, 023526 (2010), which predicts the existence of velocity bias (at least for proto-halos) {{due to the fact that}} halos reside in special regions (local density peaks). The major obstacle to measuring the volume-weighted velocity from N-body simulations is an unphysical sampling artifact. It is entangled in the measured velocity statistics and becomes significant for sparse populations. With recently improved understanding of the sampling artifact (Zhang, Zheng and Jing, 2015, PRD; Zheng, Zhang and Jing, 2015, PRD), for the first time we are able to appropriately correct this sampling artifact and then robustly measure the volume-weighted halo velocity bias.

CONCLUSION: <b>Signs</b> of probable heart disease, even though asymptomatic, may reduce the functional capacity, perhaps due to the lower maximal cardiac output and/or muscle metabolic changes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ease of {{insertion}} between rotational laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion and Brain 2 ̆ 7 s LMA insertion technique in terms of number of LMA insertion attempts, time duration of LMA insertion and complications: trauma, laryngospasm, and hypoxaemia. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from September 2006 to May 2007. METHODOLOGY: One hundred ASA I and II adults undergoing short elective surgical procedures requiring general anaesthesia with spontaneous breathing were enrolled. Following pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 mug/kg. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} study groups: rotational-(R) and standard-(S). LMA insertion was performed when patients became apnoeic and adequate LMA insertion depth achieved. Successful placement was confirmed by chest expansion, reservoir bag movement and appearance of capnographic tracing in both spontaneously breathing patients and in apnoeic patients with assisted ventilation. RESULTS: Significant differences were not seen in patient 2 ̆ 7 s demographics, Mallampati score, ASA status and pre-operative vital <b>signs.</b> <b>Statistically</b> insignificant difference was found for the time duration and number of LMA insertion attempts. The incidence of trauma was significantly noted in standard insertion technique (28...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Indirect {{systolic}} blood pressures {{were measured}} on females of three egg type strains of chickens over five consecutive generations. The measurements were taken between 165 - 175 days of age. Blood pressure measurements were also taken in one generation on breeder males at 380 days of age. Two of the strains were under selection for egg production traits while the third strain was a control {{derived from the}} same genetic base {{as one of the}} selected strains. Mean blood pressures were 148 mm. Hg for females and 203 mm. Hg for males. Heritability estimates for females averaged 0. 26. Additive type of genetic expression of blood pressure was indicated. Mean blood pressure of birds dying (to 500 days of age) was significantly lower in the control and related selected strain than the mean blood pressure of survivors. In the other selected strain there was no relationship between blood pressure and mortality. A significant interaction was observed between strains and sexes. Genetic and phenotypic correlations with production and egg quality traits were for the most part of a low order of magnitude and relatively few of them <b>statistically</b> significant. The <b>sign</b> of the genetic correlation was positive for body weights and most egg quality traits but negative for egg production and age to first egg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 1 We {{present a}} {{functional}} data analysis (FDA) based method to <b>statistically</b> model continuous <b>signs</b> of the American Sign Language (ASL) {{for use in}} the recognition of signs in continuous sentences. We build models in the Space of Probability Functions (SoPF) that captures the evolution of the relationships among the low-level features (e. g. edge pixels) in each frame. The distribution (histogram) of the horizontal and vertical displacements between all pairs of edge pixels in an image frame forms the relational distributions. We represent these sequence of relational distributions, corresponding to the sequence of image frames in a sign, as a sequence of points in a multi-dimensional space, capturing the salient variations in these relational distributions over time; we call this space the SoPF. Each sign model consists of a mean sign function and covariance functions, capturing the variability of each sign in the training set. We use functional data analysis to arrive at this model. Recognition and sign localization is performed by correlating this statistical model with any given sentence. We also present a method to infer and learn sign models, in an unsupervised manner, from sentence samples containing the sign; {{there is no need for}} manual intervention. 1...|$|R
40|$|Foram estudados 20 pacientes com síndrome parkinsoniana e crises oculógiras. Essa cifra, no cômputo geral de pacientes parkinsonianos estudados (111), mostra uma freqüência de 18 %. Dos 20 pacientes citados, 14 eram do sexo masculino e 6 do feminino. As idades de início da síndrome parkinsoniana variaram entre 10 e 40 anos. Em apenas um paciente as crises oculógiras foram o sinal clínico inicial. Em 83 % dos casos a direção foi {{vertical}} para cima. O déficit de convergência e a diplopia foram os sinais oculares associados mais freqüentes. Não houve diferença de incidência das crises oculógiras nas formas parkinsonianas uni ou bilaterais. A etiologia mais encontrada foi a encefalítica. From 111 {{patients with}} parkinsonism there were found twenty presenting oculogiric crisis corresponding to a 18 % frequency. From these twenty patients 14 were male and 6 female, the starting {{age of the}} Parkinson's syndrome varying from 10 to 40 years. Only one patient presented the oculogiric crises as the initial sign. In 83 % of the cases the vertical upward direction was observed, the convergence impairment and the diplopia being the other more frequent associated ocular <b>signs.</b> <b>Statistically</b> {{there was no difference}} of incidence of the oculogiric crisis in the unilateral or bilateral parkinsonism.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the frequency of human toxocariosis in a child population from Morrope district, Lambayeque, Peru. From October to December 2005, 182 school children (96 male and 86 female) were studied. Blood samples were collected for Toxocara ELISA-IgG test and hematological examination. Additionally, stool samples were collected for coproparasitological examination to check cross reactions. We found frequency of positives in 32. 4 % (59 / 182) with a significant higher proportion of positivity in male children (p < 0. 00001). 71. 2 % of the children with positive serology (52 male and seven female), were between five and 10 years old, 77. 96 % had respiratory symptoms, 61. 02 % had ocular manifestations, 38. 98 % had hepatic symptoms, 38. 98 % had mild or moderate eosinophilia, <b>signs</b> <b>statistically</b> associated with seropositivity. 83. 5 % of studied population had some intestinal parasite, such as: Blastocystis hominis (53. 3 %), Giardia lamblia (31. 3 %), Entamoeba coli (29. 1 %), Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (1. 1 %), Hymenolepis nana (5. 49 %), and Ascaris lumbricoides (3. 3 %), but they had not any association with serology results. The ownership of dogs or/and cats were significantly associated with seropositivity to anti-Toxocara antibodies although the presence of such pets within the house was not. In conclusion, clinical and serological evidence of Toxocara infection exists in the studied population...|$|R
