50|$|In a {{move away}} from U.S. Army tradition, a <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> (COE) design was {{selected}} for the FMTV as while the US Army did not specify this configuration, given the Cold War situation prevailing {{at the time it}} had indicated that overall length for shipboard transport was a consideration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{same basic}} design family {{was used for}} all of its trucks {{including}} the Suburban, panel trucks, canopy express and <b>cab</b> <b>overs.</b> The <b>cab</b> <b>overs</b> used the same basic cab configuration and similar grille but used a shorter and taller hood and different fenders. The unique <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> fenders and hood required a custom cowl area which makes the <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>cabs</b> and normal truck cabs incompatible with one another while all truck cabs of all weights interchange.|$|R
50|$|The AFKWX (A for 1939, F for forward cab, K for all wheel drive, and W for tandem rear axles) 353, a <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> {{cargo bed}} {{version of the}} CCKW, went into {{production}} alongside it in 1942 at Yellow’s Pontiac plant and Chevrolet’s in St. Louis. Otherwise mechanically identical, its compact cabin design allowed a 15 ft, and later 17 ft cargo bed to be fitted. The first 50 produced had closed cabs, all others were open. The <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> design made <b>engine</b> maintenance difficult. As a result, only 7235 were built, none with a front-mounted winch.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} three common cab {{configurations}} used in tractors, two are still widely used. The conventional has an <b>engine</b> and hood <b>over</b> the front axle {{in front of the}} cab, as in most automobiles. This style is almost universal in North America. The <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> or <b>cab</b> forward has a flat nose cab with the driver {{sitting in front of the}} front axle. Widely used in the EU and Japan, this style has the advantages of good vision, maneuverability, and allows maximum trailer length relative to overall length. In the North America this type of cab can be useful in straight trucks, but now has little advantage in tractors and is rarely used. A North American style <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine,</b> now largely obsolete, had a flat nose <b>cab</b> located higher <b>over</b> the <b>engine,</b> with the driver sitting above the front axle. This allowed a sleeper compartment in a short tractor, and maximum wheelbase relative overall length, important for bridge formula weight restrictions. With the loosening of length restrictions in 1982 this style had limited applications, and is no longer manufactured for the U.S. market. This style is still however popular in Australia where length restrictions still apply on many roads and it is used to maximise the capacity of both single trailer and B double configurations, and American companies Freightliner and Kenworth still manufacture trucks in this style for this market. In Australia both styles of <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> truck as well as conventionals are in common use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design was}} a militarized {{version of a}} {{civilian}} <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> (COE) model, partly redesigned to make it 4WD. A Mack engine and transmission were matched with a Timken 2-speed transfer case and double-reduction axles. The EN532 engine was a 532 cuin L L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing [...] at 2500 rpm. The 5-speed transmission drove the separate transfer case.|$|R
5000|$|Cab-over, {{also known}} as <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> (COE), <b>cab</b> forward (U.S.), or forward control (UK), is a body style of truck, bus, or van that has a {{vertical}} front, [...] "flat face" [...] or a semi-hood, with the cab of the truck sitting above (or forward of) the front axle. This contrasts with a conventional truck where the engine is mounted {{in front of the}} driver.|$|R
50|$|The {{cab forward}} truck {{configuration}} is currently common among European and Japanese truck manufacturers, because the laws governing overall vehicle lengths are strict {{and the body}} style allows longer trailers or a longer cargo area for the same overall length than a standard truck (with an engine compartment ahead of a conventional cabin). Better visibility and maneuverability in tight quarters, such as for city delivery, is a benefit of locating the truck's cab up front. Large trucks of this type are most often described as <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (COE) or <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> models.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{popular among}} United States heavy truckers and {{trucking}} companies during the 1970s because of strict length laws in many states, when those length laws were repealed, most heavy-truck makers moved to other body styles. It is, however, still {{very popular in}} the light- and medium-duty truck segment. However American companies Paccar and Freightliner still manufacture traditional <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> designs for the Australian and South African markets where length restrictions still make them advantageous.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (COE) or flat nose, {{where the}} driver is seated {{on top of the}} front axle and the engine. The front doors are {{typically}} in front of and above the front tires. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated. They were common in the United States and Canada but such body style in heavy duty type trucks lost prominence, when the legally permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, COE's are still popular among medium and light duty trucks in the United States. To access the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of tilt-cab. This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient path and trackways which require the additional turning capability of the <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> type. The operating conditions of these vehicles tend to be cooler than the conventional cab design and so the increased engine surface area used for cooling in hotter climates is not required. Access to a COE cab is commonly by steps forward of the front tires.|$|R
5000|$|In {{road vehicle}} design, Cab forward, {{also known as}} Cab-over, COE (<b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine),</b> or forward control, is a body style of truck, bus or van that has a {{vertical}} front or [...] "flat face", with the cab sitting above the front axle. This body design allows for a more compact configuration. For example, the Jeep Forward Control model {{was the first time}} the payload (or pickup box) length - 9 ft with the tailgate up - exceeded the wheelbase of a truck.|$|R
50|$|The STZ-5 {{features}} a fully enclosed metal, two person crew compartment (<b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> design) {{with a flat}} wood cargo bed with drop down wood side walls. The MA-1 gasoline engine (7.4 l. 4 in-line cylinders) was rated at 52HP (38.8 kW) at 1250 rpm. The STZ-5 was rated to carry 1.5 tonnes of cargo on its bed or tow 8 tonnes or less. Under optimum conditions its 6 gear transmission (5 forward, 1 reverse) could yield a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15 mph). It had an operational range of 140 km.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{as the war}} approached, the Autocar Company, who had been selling trucks to the Army since 1909, began {{adapting}} their commercial <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> trucks for military service. In 1939 the Model U70 5-ton (4,536 kg)(on road cargo rating) 4x2 was developed into the U2044 and U4044 [...] ton (2,268 kg)(off load rating) 4x4s, the U5044T and 7144T (“T” indicates tractor) 5-ton (4,536 kg) 4x4s, and the largest, the U8144T. In 1941 the U8144T became the Army's standard ponton tractor, and went into production.|$|R

Their Model 519 Delivery body resembled the bodies found on today's UPS trucks - sans the <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> front end. The front of the body attached directly to the Ford cowl-chassis and offered department stores and parcel delivery services a whopping 260 cubic feet of cargo capacity (minus the driver's compartment) when built on a 133 1/2" [...] chassis. An even larger body was available for Ford's 157" [...] chassis that advertised over 360 cubic feet of storage.|$|R

50|$|The Australian-designed and -built International Australian-constructed cab-over (ACCO) {{was first}} {{produced}} in the late 1960s. The ACCO is a <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> type truck and has been offered in 4x2, 4x4, 6x2, 6x4, 8x4, and 10x4 configurations. Engines used have been Cummins, Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, or GMC with Road-Ranger or Allison transmissions and Rockwell differentials. The ACCO range were built to order, serving private operators, fire departments, military services, and municipal departments across Australia and New Zealand. The ACCO became the most popular product of International Harvester in Australia. The ACCO continues to be manufactured to date, under the ownership of Iveco.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} situating the driver {{on top of}} the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is often called in the U.S. [...] "cab over", short for <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> configuration, and in Europe a [...] "forward control" [...] vehicle. The body styling {{borrowed}} heavily from the smaller, UK-made Ford Thames 400E van that had been in production since 1957, as well as the Jeep Forward Control that were introduced in 1956, but were not factory available as an enclosed van. The 1961 Econoline made Ford the first American manufacturer to offer a van series as it is now known.|$|R
50|$|The Mack model EH {{trucks were}} {{a family of}} 4x2 trucks used by the US and British {{military}} before and during World War II. They were built in conventional and <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> models, and were used as both trucks and semi-tractors. Originally a commercial design, in 1943 a military version became standard. The EHX Model was available with extended frame. One I know of was built directly after the war, in Oct 1945 for Silver Lake Lumber Co to haul logs out of Oregon. It has an extra 4 speed transmission mid ship. This set up offers 48 speeds total. It looks like a factory add on.|$|R
50|$|The Metropolitan Body Company (MBC) {{was located}} at 434 Grand Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut. It {{operated}} {{as a separate}} company from International Harvester until 1948. Prior to that it produced bodies {{for a variety of}} auto and truck manufacturers. MBC produced equipment for Chevrolet, Dodge Bros. and Ford chassis during the late 1930s and were pioneers in the development of <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (COE) route delivery bodies. MBC had an extensive patent protected line of utility cabs, beds, and bodies with unique functional aspects that likely contributed to International Harvester Company's position as an innovator and market leader in the commercial truck industry {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The laws of {{the time}} limited overall truck length to 42 ft on highways. Setting the <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> the <b>engine</b> and front axle shaved several feet off {{the length of the}} tractor, feet which could then be added to the length of the trailer while keeping the {{dimensions}} of the entire truck within the permissible limit. Schreckengost patented the design in 1934.|$|R
50|$|The Autocar Company is an American {{specialist}} {{manufacturer of}} severe-duty, <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> vocational trucks, based in Hagerstown, Indiana. Started in 1897 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as {{a manufacturer of}} Brass Era automobiles, and trucks from 1899, Autocar is the oldest surviving motor vehicle brand in the Western Hemisphere. The last cars were produced in 1911 and the company continued as an innovative maker of severe-duty trucks. In 1953 Autocar {{was taken over by}} the White Motor Company which made Autocar their top-of-the-line brand. White was taken over in turn by Volvo Trucks in 1981 with Autocar continuing as a division. In 2001, Autocar was acquired by GVW Group, LLC, which revived Autocar as an independent company. Autocar now builds three models of custom-engineered, heavy duty trucks and has regained leading positions in several vocational segments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{noticeable}} {{difference between}} tractor units in Europe and North America is {{that almost all}} European models are <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (called [...] "forward control" [...] in England), {{while the majority of}} North American trucks are [...] "conventional" [...] (called [...] "normal control" [...] or [...] "bonneted" [...] in England). European trucks, whether straight trucks or fully articulated, have a sheer face on the front. This allows shorter trucks with longer trailers (with larger freight capacity) within the legal maximum total length. Furthermore, it offers greater maneuverability and better overall view for the driver. The major disadvantage is that for repairs on COE trucks the entire cab has to hinge forward to allow maintenance access. Conversely, [...] "conventional" [...] cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment and better protection in a collision.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cab over engine" [...] (COE) or [...] "flat nose"; {{where the}} driver is seated above the front axle and the engine. This design is almost {{ubiquitous}} in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, but also widely used {{in the rest of}} the world as well. They were common in North American heavy duty trucks, but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium and light duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of [...] "tilt-cab". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> type. The COE design was invented by Viktor Schreckengost.|$|R
40|$|The length {{legislation}} for trucks in Europe regulates the total {{length of a}} vehicle combination, {{from the front of}} the cab to the trailing edge of the trailer. The European <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> (COE) tractive units are, compared to the conventional designs with a hood, not preferred aerodynamically due to its flat front and relatively sharp edges. If elongating the nose of the COE cab, creating a so-called Soft Nose (SN), potential for improved aerodynamic properties is seen. To improve the transport efficiency, some countries in Europe allow vehicle combinations of up to 25. 25 m; the aerodynamic properties of these longer vehicles have however not been in much focus historically. This thesis deals with perspectives of aerodynamic drag and cooling airflow for heavy trucks, under the circumstances of reconsidered total length legislation. The potential for design changes of different parts of a complete truck-trailer combination have been evaluated. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was the main tool for obtaining the results; measurements have been used to verify the results.|$|R

50|$|On April 1, 1929 Consolidated Freightways {{was founded}} by Leland James as a single truck LTL {{operation}} in Portland, Oregon. The company realized expanded growth rather quickly. James was an innovator, and purchased his custom power units from Freightways Manufacturing Company. Always striving to haul more product on a truck/trailer combination, James helped design the first C.O.E. (<b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine)</b> cab-over power units the United States had ever seen. The power units were lightweight and short, allowing for an additional freight box {{mounted on the frame}} of the truck behind the cab (single trailer units). With the short cab-overs, short trailers (hitched as doubles) could be lengthened, allowing for more freight as well. Length laws were stringent in the 1930s, so if a company were to survive they had to be innovative. In Nov. 1951, Consolidated Freightways went public, opening on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.80. The stock was valued at $38.00/share in 1981. In 1981, CF won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp.. The court found that Iowa's length restriction on tractor-trailers violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the Faun {{plants were}} {{destroyed}} {{to a large}} extent. In 1946, manufacturing began again, first using pre-war and war designs. In 1948, the first new post-war design {{was introduced to the}} market: a small 4.5t truck with diesel engine with an output of between 90 and 100HP. In 1949, the L7 model was introduced providing a load-carrying capacity of 6.5t and a 150HP engine by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz. Tractors were also built1. The L7 was available as traditional American-style truck and as cabover. From 1951 and 1950, the L8 (180HP and 8t live load) and Sepp (130HP and 6.5-7t live load) models replaced the former Faun models. From 1953 on, the triple-axle L900 truck was built, a vehicle for operating on difficult and heavy construction sites. The L900 could carry up to 16 tons. The L8 and the L900 models were produced until 1962, the Sepp until 1955. In 1955, modernised models with a new identifier system came to the market (F55, F56, F64, F66, F68), with a live load capacity of 4.5 to 5.6t. In 1955, Faun acquired a light <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> from the Ostner plants for its own delivery programme which underwent a technical overhaul in 1957 and was built until 1968. From 1956 onwards, heavy trucks and tractor units were added to the programme, which were also available with four-wheel drive.|$|R
