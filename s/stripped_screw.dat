The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns. Consequently, many curious soldiers took the locks apart. This resulted in breakage of parts, <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> heads and inoperable guns. Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued. In late 1843, after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company's most liquid assets.|$|E
40|$|Removal {{of plates}} is a {{procedure}} commonly performed by orthopaedic surgeons and stripped screws {{are probably the}} most common problem encountered during this procedure. Stripped screws are caused by slippage between the screwdriver and the screw. Due to the inherent difficulty in removing such screws, surgeons should be knowledgeable in techniques for their removal and should be equipped with the proper instruments to expedite the procedure. There are few published articles about such techniques. This report describes a technique for removal of plates with stripped screws. The tip of a <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> is approached from the far cortex and then reamed with a trephine reamer {{in the direction of the}} screw until both cortices are cleared. The plate is then removed with stripped screws attached. All the removals utilizing this technique to date have been successful with no complications, and this method is safe, efficient and technically easy to learn...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} nonretrievable implant {{components}} represents {{a challenge in}} implant dentistry. The mechanical approach involves the risk of damaging the implant connection or the bone-to-implant interface. This case report describes a cryo-mechanical approach for the safe removal of a nonretrievable implant component. A patient had an implant surgically placed in a private practice. When the patient returned to the restorative dentist to make a definitive impression, the healing abutment could not be loosened. The patient was referred to the Division of Fixed Prosthodontics (University of Bern, Switzerland), where the <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> hole was enlarged with a special drill from a service kit of the implant provider. Although an extraction bolt was screwed into the opening and the torque ratchet was activated, the healing abutment would not loosen. A novel approach was attempted whereby the healing abutment was cooled with dry ice (CO 2). The cooling effect seemingly caused shrinkage of the healing abutment and a reduction of the connection forces between the implant and the nonretrievable component. The approach of creating an access hole {{for the application of}} reverse torque via the extraction bolt in combination with the thermal effect led to the successful removal of the blocked component. Neither the implant connection nor the bone-to-implant interface was damaged. The combined cryo-mechanical procedure allowed the implant to be successfully restored...|$|E

None of the techniques described {{for the removal of}} locking plates are adequate for all situations. We report our experience of 27 patients from whom a total of 33 locking plates were removed. We also describe a novel technique for the removal of locking plates which in our experience could be used in most of these patients because it is appropriate for all situations and, from a technical point of view, is easy to use. Our new technique consists of removing the problematic locking screw by cutting the plate {{on both sides of the}} screw hole and using the screw head-plate hole unit for removal. We analyzed all these patients for the location of the plate, number of locking screws, time of implant removal since the initial surgery, reason for removal of the plate, nature of the difficulties encountered during surgery, and any perioperative complications. A total of 43 (17. 34 %) screws were difficult to remove. Twenty screws were found to be stripped, 15 were jammed and 8 were broken. Fourteen of the 20 <b>stripped</b> <b>screws</b> and all 15 jammed screws were removed using our technique.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to achieve adequate screw fixation for plate constructs in fractures with poor quality bone or in metaphyseal bone with extensive bone loss or comminution[7][17]. Furthermore, rescuing or augmenting failed screw fixation in inadequate bone with various cement products has yielded mixed results when tested with pure axial pullout loading[20][21]. In most cases, plate/screw constructs experience both vertical (translational) and horizontal (pullout) forces during physiologic loading[17][20][21]. The increased use of locked screws in plate constructs has also changed the loading patterns of bone screws. For this study, a novel “toggle-out” testing method was developed to more realistically simulate in-vivo loading of screw-plate constructs. Our objective was to compare the fixation of locked and non-locked screws in simulated cancellous bone of three different densities and to determine the effectiveness of augmentation of the screw fixation using either PMMA or a resorbable Calcium Phosphate cement in both stripped and oversized screw holes. Polyurethane foam blocks of 12. 5, 20, and 30 lb/ft 3 densities representing ostoporotic, normal, and high density cancellous bone respectively (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon Island, WA) were used as the bone surrogate for this study. Holes were drilled into the blocks perpendicular to a single face for placement of screws. All screws tested were 4 mm diameter, 32, 34, or 36 mm length stainless steel cancellous bone screws (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The holes were either 2. 5 mm diameter pilot holes, 4. 0 mm diameter (to simulate a <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> hole), or 12 mm diameter (bone loss / void). In the 4 mm stripped holes and the 12 mm holes, various cements were used to augment the screw fixation. The cements used were PMMA (Simplex, Stryker) and Calcium Phosphate Cement (Trabexus, Vivorté). After placement of the screws or after the cement had set for 24 hours, the blocks were mounted on a load frame (MTS Corp) for cyclic testing. The load fixture allowed screws to be configured either as locked screws or non-locked screws with respect to the plate. Along with cyclic transverse loading, a constant axial pullout force of 20 N was applied to each screw during testing. Cyclic “toggle” loading was applied for 1000 cycles at each of ± 25, ± 50, ± 100, and ± 200 N, or until failure by pullout or screw breakage. The average total displacement (positive and negative combined) value for each test was recorded over the last ten load cycles. Under all conditions, the locked screws exhibited significantly less displacement than the non-locked screws (p screws to be set up as locked screws for half of the test conditions. Locking screws exhibited less displacement than non-locking screws across all test samples (P= 0. 00). This study therefore supports the use of a locking-style cancellous screw in poor quality bone or when cement augmentation of large holes is warranted. The behavior in stripped holes was quite interesting and erratic. The non-locking screws easily pulled out in most cases, but the locking screws were able to survive more cycles. Also, the higher density bone made cement augmentation to prevent pullout more difficult because the cement (especially CaP) does not interdigitate with the high density material. Cement augmentation of large defects and stripped holes in poor quality bone {{has the potential to be}} successful regardless of the type of cement used because locking screws were significantly more stable than non-locking screws...|$|E

40|$|Screws {{are widely}} used for the {{internal}} fixation of fractures, either alone or with plates. Constant improvement in design and in operative techniques has led to increased holding power, which now exceeds the shear strength of bone. In fact, if one tries to pull out a freshly inserted screw, the bone threads do not <b>strip</b> but the <b>screw</b> pulls out a small cone-shaped button of compact bone (Bechtol 1971). If one considers only the result of such an immediate test, the question of bone formation around the screws {{would seem to be}} of no interest, as a further increase in holding power would have no practical importance. In cases of accidental <b>stripping</b> of <b>screws,</b> however, bone healing certainly is a matter of considerable importance, as shown by Bechtol (1959). In fact, he found that during the first four weeks after insertion of a screw the holding power exceeded the initial stripping torque, though it should be carefully noted that these screws, once in place, were not subjected to any mechanical forces. Though the enormous holding power of screws in compact bone generally persists during the course offracture healing, clinical experience shows that a plate and its screws are sometimes avulsed from bone. In such cases no bone can be detected around the screws. Moreover...|$|R

For Season 5, the screws were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots.

40|$|Background: Biomechanical {{studies have}} shown C 2 pedicle screw {{to be the most}} robust in insertional torque and pullout strength. However, C 2 pedicle screw {{placement}} is still technically challenging. Smaller C 2 pedicles or medial localization of the vertebral artery may preclude safe C 2 pedicle screw placement in some patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the pullout strength of spinous process screws with pedicle screws in the C 2. Materials and Methods: Eight fresh human cadaveric cervical spine specimens (C 2) were harvested and subsequently frozen to - 20 °C. After being thawed to room temperature, each specimen was debrided of remaining soft tissue and labeled. A customs jig as used to clamp each specimen for screw insertion firmly. Screws were inserted into the vertebral body pairs on each side using one of two methods. The pedicle screws were inserted in usual manner as in previous biomechanical studies. The starting point for spinous process screw insertion was located at the junction of the lamina and the spinous process and the direction of the screw was about 0 ° caudally in the sagittal plane and about 0 ° medially in the axial plane. Each vertebrae was held in a customs jig, which was attached to material testing machine (Material Testing System Inc., Changchun, China). A coupling device that fit around the head of the screw was used to pull out each screw at a loading rate of 2 mm/min. The uniaxial load to failure was recorded in Newton′st dependent test (for paired samples) was used to test for significance. Results: The mean load to failure was 387 N for the special protection scheme and 465 N for the protection scheme without significant difference (t = − 0. 862, P = 0. 403). In all but three instances (38 %), the spinous process pullout values exceeded the values for the pedicle screws. The working distances for the spinous process screws was little shorter than pedicle screws in each C 2 specimen. Conclusion: Spinous process screws provide comparable pullout strength to pedicle screws of the C 2. Spinous process screws may provide an alternative to pedicle screws fixation, especially with unusual anatomy or <b>stripped</b> <b>screws...</b>|$|R

Two hundred mini-implants were divided into 4 groups with 50 screws equally distributed in five diameters (1. 3 to 1. 7 [*]mm) : control group (CG) : unused mini-implants, G 1 : mini-implants inserted in pig iliac bone and removed, G 2 : same protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning and autoclave sterilization, and G 3 : same insertion protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning before and after sandblasting (Al 2 O 3 - 90 [*]µ) and autoclave sterilization. G 2 and G 3 mini-implants were weighed after recycling process to evaluate weight loss (W). All the screws were broken to determine the fracture torque (FT). The influence of recycling process on FT and W was evaluated by ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results. FT was not influenced by recycling protocols even when sandblasting was added. Sandblasting caused weight loss due to abrasive mechanical <b>stripping</b> of <b>screw</b> surface.

Non-locked screws have the potential to lose fixation during implantation by stripping out. A pilot study was thus performed to evaluate the torque at which peripheral non-locked <b>screws</b> <b>stripped</b> (documented as a sharp drop in measured torque) within the bone model and lost fixation. All of the peripheral non-locked screws were then implanted within the torque limits observed, ensuring that each screw placed provided similar fixation. Additionally, the orientation of the baseplate was controlled such that the screw orientation remained constant, preventing variability in rigidity based on the orientation of the locked and non-locked screws. Finally, the central screw baseplates were implanted with an identical maximum torque to ensure that uniform compression was achieved with each tested model.|$|R
40|$|AB Objectives: Bone rivets were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} method to fasten plates during internal fixation of fractures when screw anchorage may be inadequate. This study examined whether such rivets allow proper fracture healing without eliciting adverse bone remodelling and whether they can be removed safely. Methods: A proximal diaphyseal fracture of the tibia was stabilized with a conventional plate (low-contact dynamic compression plate, Synthes) in 10 sheep. The distal fragment was anchored using bicortical screws, and the proximal fragment (1 - 2. 5 mm thick cortex) with 3 rivets following <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Postoperative care included immediate weight bearing and biweekly radiographs. After 12 weeks, implants were removed from 6 sheep and the tibial strength measured. Tibiae with empty and filled rivet holes (at 12 and 24 weeks) were examined histologically. Results: In all sheep, secondary bone healing was observed without length and angulation deformities. All fracture gaps were bridged and filled with new bone. The average torsional strength after 12 weeks was 75 +/- 11 % of the intact tibia (mean +/- SD), and failure never occurred through an empty rivet hole. After 12 weeks, there was intensive cortical remodelling at the rivets correlating with slight to moderate nonprogressive periosteal radiolucency around 55 % of the rivets. However, there was also endosteal appositional bone growth at 85 % of the rivets. There was no observable macroscopic or microscopic osseous damage after implant removal. After 24 weeks, remodelling activity had decreased and was noted only sporadically. Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy of bone rivets for the internal fixation of a fracture with plates, where anchorage of screws may be difficult and/or insufficient, was demonstrated...|$|R

Licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] analysis of bone is an innovative technique that uses sequential image data to analyze bone mechanics under a given loading regime. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel device capable of performing step-wise screw insertion into excised bone specimens, within the microCT environment, whilst simultaneously recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head and rotation angle. The system is computer controlled and screw insertion is performed in incremental steps of insertion torque. A series of screw insertion tests to failure were performed (n= 21) to establish a relationship between the torque at head contact and stripping torque (R 2 = 0. 89). The test-device was then used to perform step-wise screw insertion, stopping at intervals of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % between screw head contact and <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Image data-sets were acquired at each of these time-points as well as at head contact and post-failure. Examination of the image data revealed the trabecular deformation as a result of increased insertion torque was restricted to within 1 mm of the outer diameter of the screw thread. Minimal deformation occurred prior to the step between the 80 % time-point and post-failure. The device presented has allowed, for the first time, visualization of the micro-mechanical response in the peri-implant bone with increased tightening torque.

40|$|Objective: The {{level to}} which bone screws are {{tightened}} is determined subjectively by the operating surgeon. It {{is likely that}} the tactile feedback that surgeons rely on is based on localized tissue yielding, which may predispose the screw–bone interface to failure. A limited number of studies have investigated the ratio between clinical tightening torque and stripping torque. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure, for the first time, the ratio between yield torque (Tyield) and stripping torque (Tmax) during screw insertion into the cancellous bone and to compare these torques with clinical levels of tightening reported in the literature. Additionally, a rotational limit was investigated as a potential end point for screw insertion in cancellous bone. Methods: A 6. 5 -mm outer diameter commercial cancellous bone screw was inserted into human femoral head specimens (n = 89). Screws were inserted to failure, while recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head, and rotation angle. Results: The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: Tyield, Tmax, Tyield/Tmax, slope, Tplateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of Tyield/Tmax and rotation angle was 85. 45 % and 96. 5 degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variation was greatest for the rotation angle compared with the ratio of Tyield/Tmax (0. 37 vs. 0. 12). Conclusions: The detection of yield may be a more precise method than the rotation angle in cancellous bone; however, bone–screw constructs that exhibit a Tyield close to Tmax may be more susceptible to stripping during insertion. Future work can identify factors that influence the ratio of Tyield/Tmax may help to reduce the incidence of <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Melissa K. Ryan, Aaron A. Mohtar, John J.

5000|$|This {{remarkable}} {{little boat}} {{has a history}} which does not reach very far back into the present century. With the assistance of Mr. William Errickson of Barnegat, and Dr. William P. Haywood of West Creek, Ocean County, New Jersey, I {{have been able to}} rescue from oblivion and bring to the light of day a correct history of the Barnegat sneak-box.Captain Hazelton Seaman, of West Creek village, New Jersey, a boat-builder and an expert shooter of wild-fowl, about the year 1836, conceived the idea of constructing for his own use a low-decked boat, or gunning-punt, in which, when its deck was covered with sedge, he could secrete himself from the wild-fowl while gunning in Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays.It was important that the boat should be sufficiently light to enable a single sportsman to pull her from the water on to the low points of the bay shores. During the winter months, when the great marshes were at times incrusted with snow, and the shallow creeks covered with ice,--obstacles which must be crossed to reach the open waters of the sound,--it would be necessary to use her as a sled, to effect which end a pair of light oaken <b>strips</b> were <b>screwed</b> {{to the bottom of the}} sneak-box, when she could be easily pushed by the gunner, and the transportation of the oars, sail, blankets, guns, ammunition, and provisions (all of which stowed under the hatch and locked up as snugly as if in a strong chest) became a very simple matter. While secreted in his boat, on the watch for fowl, with his craft hidden by a covering of grass or sedge, the gunner could approach within shooting-distance of a flock of unsuspicious ducks; and this being done in a sneaking manner (though Mr. Seaman named the result of his first effort the [...] "Devil's Coffin" [...] the bay-men gave her the sobriquet of [...] "SNEAK-BOX"; and this name she has retained to the present day).Since Captain Seaman built his [...] "Devil's Coffin," [...] forty years ago, the model has been improved by various builders, until it is believed that it has almost attained perfection. The boat has no sheer, and sets low in the water. This lack of sheer is supplied by a light canvas apron which is tacked to the deck, and presents, when stretched upward by a stick two feet long, a convex surface to a head sea. The water which breaks upon the deck, forward of the cockpit, is turned off at the sides of the boat in almost the same manner as a snow-plough clears a railroad track of snow. The apron also protects the head and shoulders of the rower from cold head winds.The first sneak-box built by Captain Seaman had a piece of canvas stretched upon an oaken hoop, so fastened to the deck that when a head sea struck the bow, the hoop and canvas were forced upward so as to throw the water off its sides, thus effectually preventing its ingress into the hold of the craft. The improved apron originated with Mr. John Crammer, Jr., a short time after Captain Seaman built the first sneak-box. The second sneak-box was constructed by Mr. Crammer; and afterwards Mr. Samuel Perine, an old and much respected bay-man, of Barnegat, built the third one. The last two men have finished their voyage of life, but [...] "Uncle Haze,"--as he is familiarly called by his many admirers,--the originator of the tiny craft which may well be called multum in parvo, and which carried me, its single occupant, safely and comfortably twenty-six hundred miles, from Pittsburgh to Cedar Keys, still lives at West Creek, builds yachts as well as he does sneak-boxes, and puts to the blush younger gunners by the energy displayed and success attained in the vigorous pursuit of wildfowl shooting in the bays which fringe the coast of Ocean County, New Jersey.A few years since, this ingenious man invented an improvement on the marine life-saving car, which has been adopted by the United States government; and during the year 1875 he constructed a new ducking-punt with a low paddle-wheel at its stern, for the purpose of more easily and secretly approaching flocks of wild-fowl.The peculiar advantages of the sneak-box were known to but few of the hunting and shooting fraternity, and, with the exception of an occasional visitor, were used only by the oystermen, fishermen, and wild-fowl shooters of Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays, until the New Jersey Southern Railroad and its connecting branches penetrated to the eastern shores of New Jersey, when educated amateur sportsmen from the cities quickly recognized in the little gunning-punt all they had long desired to combine in one small boat.Mr. Charles Hallock, in his paper the [...] "Forest and Stream," [...] of April 23, 1874, gave drawings and a description of the sneak-box, and fairly presented its claims to public favor.The sneak-box is not a monopoly of any particular builder, but it requires peculiar talent to build one,--the kind of talent which enables one man to cut out a perfect axe-handle, while the master-carpenter finds it difficult to accomplish the same thing. The best yacht-builders in Ocean County generally fail in modelling a sneak-box, while many second-rate mechanics along the shore, who could not possibly construct a yacht that would sail well, can make a perfect sneak-box, or gunning-skiff. All this may be accounted for by recognizing the fact that the water-lines of the sneak-box are peculiar, and differ materially from those of row-boats, sailboats, and yachts. Having a spoon-shaped bottom and bow, the sneak-box moves rather over the water than through it, and this peculiarity, together with its broad beam, gives the boat such stiffness that two persons may stand upright in her while she is moving through the water, and troll their lines while fishing, or discharge their guns, without careening the boat; a valuable advantage not possessed by our best cruising canoes.The boat sails well on the wind, though hard to pull against a strong head sea. A fin-shaped centre-board takes the place of a keel. It can be quickly removed from the trunk, or centre-board well, and stored under the deck. The flatness of her floor permits the sneak-box to run in very shallow water while being rowed or when sailing before the wind without the centre-board. Some of these boats, carrying a weight of three hundred pounds, will float in four to six inches of water.The favorite material for boat-building in the United States is white cedar (Cupressus thyoides), which grows in dense forests in the swamps along the coast of New Jersey, as well as in other parts of North America. The wood is both white and brown, soft, fine-grained, and very light and durable. No wood used in boat-building can compare with the white cedar in resisting the changes from a wet to a dry state, and vice versa. The tree grows tall and straight. The lower part of the trunk with the diverging roots furnish knee timbers and carlines for the sneak-box. The ribs or timbers, and the carlines, are usually 1 × 1 inches in dimension, and are placed about ten inches apart. The frame above and below is covered with half-inch cedar sheathing, which is not less than six inches wide. The boat is strong enough to support a heavy man upon its deck, and when well built will rank next to the seamless paper boats of Mr. Waters of Troy, and the seamless wooden canoes of Messrs. Herald, Gordon & Stephenson, of the province of Ontario, Canada, in freedom from leakage.During a cruise of twenty-six hundred miles not one drop of water leaked through the seams of the Centennial Republic. Her under planking was nicely joined, and the seams calked with cotton wicking, and afterwards filled with white-lead paint and putty. The deck planks, of seven inches width, were not joined, but were tongued and grooved, the tongues and grooves being well covered with a thick coat of white-lead paint.The item of cost is another thing to be considered in regard to this boat. The usual cost of a first-class canoe of seventy pounds' weight, built after the model of the Rob Roy or Nautilus, with all its belongings, is about one hundred and twenty-five dollars; and these figures deter many a young man from enjoying the ennobling and healthful exercise of canoeing. A first-class sneak-box, with spars, sail, oars, anchor, &c., can be obtained for seventy-five dollars, and if several were ordered by a club they could probably be bought for sixty-five dollars each. The price of a sneak-box, as ordinarily built in Ocean County, New Jersey, is about forty dollars. The Centennial Republic cost about seventy-five dollars, and a city boat-builder would not duplicate her for less than one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The builders of the sneak-boxes have not yet acquired the art of overcharging their customers; they do not expect to receive more than one dollar and fifty cents or two dollars per day for their labor; and some of them are even so unwise as to risk their reputation by offering to furnish these boats for twenty-five dollars each. Such a craft, after a little hard usage, would leak as badly as most cedar canoes, and would be totally unfit for the trials of a long cruise.The diagram given of the Centennial Republic will enable the reader of aquatic proclivities to understand the general principles upon which these boats are built. As they should be rated as third-class freight on railroads, it is more economical for the amateur to purchase a first-class boat at Barnegat, Manahawken, or West Creek, in Ocean County, New Jersey, along the Tuckerton Railroad, than to have a workman elsewhere, and one unacquainted with this peculiar model, experiment upon its construction at the purchaser's cost, and perhaps loss.One bright morning, in the early part of the fall of 1875, I trudged on foot down one of the level roads which lead from the village of Manahawken through the swamps to the edge of the extensive salt marshes that fringe the shores of the bay. This road bore the euphonious name of Eel Street, - so named by the boys of the town. When about half-way from its end, I turned off to the right, and followed a wooded lane to the house of an honest surf-man, Captain George Bogart, who had recently left his old home on the beach, beside the restless waves of the Atlantic, and had resumed his avocation as a sneak-box builder.|$|R
