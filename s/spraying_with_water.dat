Dose (≤ 0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) response studies employed momentary time sampling over 30 or 60 min with behaviour being scored in one of 6 or 7 (depending on food availability) mutually exclusive categories (feeding, active, scratching, face-grooming, body grooming, genital-grooming and resting) at 15 s intervals. In non-deprived rats, tested with wet mash available, feeding and activity frequencies were increased, but resting and total grooming were inhibited by 8 -OH-DPAT. Face-, body- and genital-grooming occurred at higher levels than scratching, but all categories were reduced with reductions in scratching occurring at a lower dose (0. 01 mg/kg). Misting rats with a fine water spray selectively increased body grooming and decreased activity without altering feeding, while 8 -OH-DPAT increased feeding and reduced face-, body- and genital-grooming, without affecting already low levels of scratching. In misted rats, tested without food, 8 -OH-DPAT reduced face-, body- and genital-grooming and increased resting. These results confirm i) that the water spray technique is a useful method for increasing grooming and ii) that 8 -OH-DPAT has a suppressant effect on grooming independent of response competition from enhanced feeding...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Flowing water quickly {{saturates}} {{dry surface}} soil as water advances in irrigation furrows. Conversely, rain wets surface soil before runoff occurs. Rapid wetting destroys soil aggregates as water quickly displaces trapped air. Slowly increasing soil water content prior to saturation increases aggregate stability. We hypothesized that instantaneous wetting of dry surface soil during furrow irrigation results in greater soil erosion than if furrow soil was pre—wet immediately before irrigation. We conducted ten irrigation trials on 27 —m long furrows {{in three different}} fields. Soil was pre—wet by surface drip irrigation (12 to 14 nun) or by lightly <b>spraying</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> (1. 3 mm). Pre—wetting with drip irrigation significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced soil loss for 5 of the first 7 irrigations compared to dry soil. The pre—wetting effect on soil loss was not always dramatic, but cumulative soil loss for the first seven irrigations was significantly different among the three treatments: 16, 30, and 56 Mg ha- 1 for drip, spray, and dry treatments, respectively. The dry treatment never had less soil loss than either pre—wetting treatment. Pre—wetting furrow soil by spraying apparently did not add enough water to stabilize soil aggregates and decrease soil erosion for most irrigations. This study demonstrated that erosion was greater when water flowed over initially dry soil, which is typical with furrow irrigation, compared to water flowing over initially wet soil, which occurs during rain...|$|E
40|$|Background. On 21 May 2005, the Norwegian health {{authorities}} were alerted by officials {{from a local}} hospital that several recent patients had received the diagnosis of legionnaires disease; all patients resided in 2 neighboring municipalities. We investigated the outbreak to identify the source and to implement control measures. Methods. We interviewed all surviving case patients and investigated and harvested samples from 23 businesses with cooling towers and other potential infection sources. The locations of the businesses and the patients ’ residences and movements were mapped. We calculated attack rates and risk ratios among people living within various radii of each potential source. Isolates of Legionella pneumophila were compared using molecular methods. Results. Among 56 case patients, 10 died. The case patients became ill 12 – 25 May, resided up to 20 km apart, and had not visited places in common. Those living up to 1 km from a particular air scrubber had the highest risk ratio, and only for this source did the risk ratio decrease as the radius widened.

The experiments dealt with three aspects of sugar-palm seedlings. These were: 1) tofind the most efficient method of propagation, 2) to search for the best way for separation and transplantation, and 3) to findthe best growth promoter. This project was conducted from October 2005 to June 2007 at San Charoen Village, Pha ThongCommunity, Tha Wang Pha District, Nan Province. The results were as follows: Firstly, trimming both ends of 36 -month-oldsugar-palm seeds provided the shortest period of germination. As a side benefit, it was easier to peel the seeds out of thefruit. Secondly, the most efficient way of separating seedlings was transplanting them immediately with their one leaf cuttwo-thirds off. <b>Spraying</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> every two hours during the first week guaranteed 82 percent of survival of the seedlings. Lastly, 15 - 15 - 15, 13 - 13 - 21 and 46 - 0 - 0 fertilizer formulations promoted the growth of one- to three-year sugar-palm seedlings. These seedlings produced more new green emerging leaves than the unfertilized plant. However, when economics areconsidered, the non-fertilizer application gave a better net benefit than the three fertilizer formulations. Therefore, we recommendthat the sugar-palm be planted in community forests in northern Thailand using plenty of water, with a propertillage practice, and without costly fertilizer. We also imply that farmers will be more confident in restoring their sugar-palmforests using this technique because they have an active role in the research project...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to its hyperphagic effect in rats, 8 -OH-DPAT also reduces grooming, but it is uncertain whether the inhibition of grooming is a specific effect or a consequence of response competition from eating. The present experiments explored the effects of 8 -OH-DPAT on periprandial grooming and grooming elicited by spraying rats with water. Momentary time sampling over 30 or 60 min, with behaviour scored in one of 6 or 7 (depending on food availability) mutually exclusive categories (feeding, active, scratching, face grooming, body grooming, genital grooming and resting) at 15 s intervals, was used for data collection. Non-deprived rats were tested in the presence and absence of food and baseline grooming levels were manipulated by spraying the dorsal surface of the back with water. Data were submitted to ANOVA. The first experiment confirmed that 8 -OH-DPAT increased food intake {{and that this was}} associated with a parallel increase in feeding observations; active observations were also increased, but resting and total grooming observations were reduced: scratching was reduced even at 0. 003 mg/kg, face- and body-grooming were reduced at doses > 0. 03 mg/kg and genital-grooming was least sensitive, only being reduced at 0. 1 mg/kg. The second experiment revealed that <b>spraying</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> had no effect on food intake, feeding or resting observations, but increased total grooming (largely due to increased body-grooming) and reduced activity observations. In rats sprayed with water, 8 -OH-DPAT increased food intake (0. 1 mg/kg) and observations of feeding (0. 003 & 0. 1 mg/kg), but total grooming was dose-dependently inhibited, with genital-grooming most sensitive(> 0. 003 mg/kg), followed by face-grooming (> 0. 01 mg/kg) and body-grooming (> 0. 03 mg/kg), whilst low levels of scratching were unaffected. The final experiment tested water-sprayed rats in the absence of food: 8 -OH-DPAT increased resting and reduced total grooming, mostly as a consequence of reductions in face- and body-grooming, but there were also modest reductions in scratching. These results confirm that 8 -OH-DPAT has a suppressant effect on all aspects of grooming, except where there are probable floor effects, and that this is independent of response competition from increased eating...|$|E

Also, a laboratory experiment was conducted at Seed Technology Research Unit at Mansoura, Dakahlia Governorate, Field Crops Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, Egypt, to determine germination percentage and seedling vigor tests (seed quality) of the resultant seed from {{field experiment}}. Results indicated that foliar application of the micronutrients mixture at the rate of 500 ppm produced the highest values of grain yield and its components, chemical composition as well as quality parameters of both grains and seed with significant differences compared with other foliar application treatments in both seasons. The second best treatment was the application of Zn followed by Mn in both seasons. Cu and Fe treatments were similar in their effects and the difference between them were insignificant in most traits. The highest values of both straw and grain yields and yield components as well as quality parameters of grains and seed were resulted from increasing nitrogen levels up to 90 kg N fed - 1 as compared with other levels (50 and 70 kg N fed - 1) in both seasons.
