5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. <b>Software</b> <b>developer</b> Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As a {{research}} community, we currently {{know very little}} about the challenges faced by blind <b>software</b> <b>developers.</b> Without knowing what those challenges are, the community cannot effectively address these challenges. In this paper, we describe the first exploratory empirical study, where we conducted eight interviews with blind <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> to identify aspects of software development that are a challenge. Our results suggest that visually impaired <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> face challenges, for instance, when using screen readers to look up information when writing code. We discuss a variety of implications, including that blind <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> need additional support in discovering relevant software development tools. I...|$|R

5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{personality}} types preferences among <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> in Northern region of Malaysia. Knowledge in human factor personality types is significant {{in order to}} assist project manager for making decision on the right personality types that suit into job tasks assigned to <b>software</b> <b>developers.</b> In addition, there is growing awareness on applying agile methodology during software development. This software methodology claimed to be acknowledged human weaknesses and strengths and thus, has great potential in improving software development effectiveness. Therefore, this study also seeks to compare personality type’s preferences amongst agile and non-agile <b>software</b> <b>developers.</b> A questionnaire that includes personality test questions was distributed amongst 81 <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> that working in the software industry. Results demonstrated that the <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> are mostly Introvert (I) personality types. Furthermore, the dimensions of Intuitive (N), Thinking (T), and Judging (J) are dominant personality types among <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> regardless of <b>software</b> methodology used. This study provides an insight into personality type’s preferences that can guide human resource manager to select the suitable candidate for specific tasks {{in order to improve}} team performance.
