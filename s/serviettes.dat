25|$|Traditional Maltese lace (Maltese: bizzilla) is {{bobbin lace}} of the filet-guipure variety. It is formed on a lace pillow stuffed with straw, and {{frequently}} features the eight-pointed Maltese cross, but not necessarily. Genoese-style leafwork {{is an essential}} component of the traditional designs. Nowadays, Malta lace is usually worked on ivory-coloured linen, although historically it was also worked on black or white silk. It is typically used to make tablecloths, placemats and <b>serviettes,</b> and is periodically featured in couture, and in traditional Maltese costume.|$|E

When he had no sketchbook, Lowry drew scenes in pencil or charcoal {{on the back of}} envelopes, <b>serviettes</b> and cloakroom tickets and presented them to young people sitting with their families. Such serendipitous pieces are now worth thousands of pounds; a serviette sketch can be seen at the Sunderland Marriott Hotel (formerly the Seaburn Hotel).|$|E

60|$|There {{is no one}} to be seen. It is a cold, frost-strong, clear morning. There is {{no one in the}} bar. We stumble {{down the}} dark tunnel passage. The stanza is as if no man had ever set foot in it: very dark, the mats against the wall, the fire-place grey with a handful of long dead ash. Just like a dungeon. The dining-room has the same long table and eternal table-cloth--and our <b>serviettes,</b> still wet, lying where we shovelled them aside. So back again to the bar.|$|E
6000|$|There were no <b>serviettes</b> {{and less}} ceremony, and Kipps {{thought he had}} never enjoyed a meal so much. Everyone was a little excited by the meeting and chatting, and {{disposed}} to laugh, and things went off easily from the very beginning. If {{there was a pause}} Master Walt filled it in. Mrs. Sid, who tempered her enormous admiration for Sid's intellect and his socialism and his severe business methods by a motherly sense of her sex and seniority, spoke of them both as [...] "you boys," [...] and dilated--when she was not urging Kipps to have some more of this or that--on the disparity between herself and her husband.|$|E
6000|$|All these personages {{impressed}} Kipps with a {{sense of}} inferiority {{that in the case of}} Miss Walshingham became positively abysmal. The ideas and knowledge they appeared to have, their personal capacity and freedom, opened a new world to his imagination. These people came and went, {{with a sense}} of absolute assurance, against an overwhelming background of plaster casts, diagrams and tables, benches and a blackboard--a background that seemed to him to be saturated with recondite knowledge and the occult and jealously guarded tips and secrets that constitute Art and the Higher Life. They went home, he imagined, to homes where the piano was played with distinction and freedom, and books littered the tables, and foreign languages were habitually used. They had complicated meals, no doubt--with <b>serviettes.</b> They [...] "knew etiquette," [...] and how to avoid all the errors for which Kipps bought penny manuals, [...] "What to Avoid," [...] "Common Errors in Speaking," [...] and the like. He knew nothing about it all--nothing whatever; he was a creature of the outer darkness blinking in an unsuspected light.|$|E

6000|$|What he {{put into}} Kipps was chiefly bread and margarine, infusions of chicory and tea-dust, colonial meat by {{contract}} at threepence a pound, potatoes by the sack, and watered beer. If, however, Kipps chose to buy any supplementary material for growth, Mr. Shalford had the generosity to place his kitchen resources {{at his disposal}} free--if the fire chanced to be going. He was also allowed to share a bedroom with eight other young Englishmen, and {{to sleep in a}} bed which, except in very severe weather, could be made {{with the help of his}} overcoat and private underlinen, not to mention newspapers, quite sufficiently warm for any reasonable soul. In addition Kipps was taught the list of fines; and how to tie up parcels; to know where goods were kept in Mr. Shalford's systematised shop; to hold his hands extended upon the counter and to repeat such phrases as [...] "What can I have the pleasure...?" [...] "No trouble, I 'ssure you," [...] and the like; to block, fold, and measure materials of all sorts; to lift his hat from his head when he passed Mr. Shalford abroad, and to practise a servile obedience to a large number of people. But he was not, of course, taught the [...] "cost" [...] mark of the goods he sold, nor anything of the method of buying such goods. Nor was his attention directed to the unfamiliar social habits and fashions to which his trade ministered. The use of half the goods he saw sold and was presently to assist in selling he did not understand; materials for hangings, cretonnes, chintzes, and the like, <b>serviettes</b> and all the bright, hard white wear of a well-ordered house, pleasant dress materials, linings, stiffenings--they were to him from first to last no more than things heavy and difficult to handle in bulk, that one folded up, unfolded, cut in lengths, and saw dwindle and pass away out into that mysterious happy world in which the customer dwells. Kipps hurried from piling linen table-cloths, that were collectively as heavy as lead, to eat off oil-cloth in a gas-lit dining-room underground; and he dreamt of combing endless blankets beneath his overcoat, spare undershirt, and three newspapers. So he had at least the chance of learning the beginnings of philosophy.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s Hellyar made large, {{delicate}} bronze sculptures cast {{from plants}} and flowers. She continues today to work across sculpture and installation. In 2015 Hellyar collaborated with artists Maureen Lander and Jo Torr on an exhibition Tell Tails at the National Library of New Zealand. The exhibition took {{inspiration from the}} collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library and Hellyar's contribution Red cloud {{is made up of}} dozens of handkerchiefs, neckerchiefs, <b>serviettes</b> and napkins dyed blood red. These materials were all used as items of exchange in early interactions between indigenous people in the Pacific and European explorers; the work was inspired by a work by colonial artist William Ellis in which Tahitian people wear European neckerchiefs.|$|E
