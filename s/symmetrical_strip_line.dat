40|$|In this article, a very crucial {{subject is}} discussed, {{which is the}} three ports active {{circulator}} transmission lines delayed in time stability analysis. Our circuit is a reflection type phase shifter (RTPS), employing a circulator. Micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> have three ports active circulator, with stability analysis under time delayed. Many radio frequency (RF) systems use active circulator as a passive non-reciprocal three- or four-port device, in which microwave or radio frequency power entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). Micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> feed those active circulator ports and face a delay parasitic effect of transferring signals in time. These circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays cause the system to instability. Due to parasitic effects of active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> there is delay in time for input/output RF signals which result in system instability. We define active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays τ 1 for the first port current and τ 3 for the third port current. Accordingly, active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays Δ 1 for the first port current derivative and Δ 3 for the third port current derivative. We have four delays in time τ 1, τ 2, Δ 1, Δ 3 and discuss sub case where separately delays are equal to zero (τ 1 =τ 2 =τ and Δ 1 =Δ 3 = 0) which describe most of active circulator parasitic effects. The three active circulator ports delayed in time equivalent circuit with micro strip segments can be represented as a delayed differential equation which depends on variable parameters and delays. The investigation of our active circulator element with micro <b>strip</b> <b>lines</b> system differential equation is based on stability switching. Active circulator with transmission lines stability switching analysis is done under different time delays with respect to circulator inputs/outputs currents and currents derivative.
