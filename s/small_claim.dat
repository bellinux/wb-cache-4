5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a <b>small</b> <b>claim</b> near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E

Transcom had been legally represented at earlier hearings, but were not represented at the proof, so Gordon Dick got his decree by default. It is the largest amount awarded in compensation in the United Kingdom since Roberts v Media Logistics case in 2005.|$|E

As might have been predicted, this venture was not more fortunate than his previous ones; and, after a year's endurance, diversified latterly with pecuniary squabbles, in which Hume's tenacity about a somewhat <b>small</b> <b>claim</b> is remarkable, the engagement came to an end.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of an empirical study of the Tasmanian <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court, established in 1985. The major {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the extent to which the Court is effective in achieving the purpose for which it was designed [...] the informal, speedy and inexpensive resolution of minor civil disputes. In conducting the evaluation a multiple evaluation methodology was adopted which sought to illuminate the diverse perceptions of various groups [...] disputants, community organisations, Magistrates, and court officials [...] all of whom are involved with the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court. The individual components of the methodology incorporated: (1) a detailed literature survey of <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Courts within the wider context of dispute resolution; (2) a historical sketch of the establishment of a <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court in Tasmania; (3) a file survey of <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court records for the fiscal year 1989; (4) a survey of disputants who utilised the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court over the period from 1 July 1988 through 30 June 1989; (5) interviews with disputants, court staff, administrators, magistrates and community organisations such as the Hobart Community Legal Service, Legal Aid, and Consumer Affairs; (6) personal observation of approximately thirty cases; and (7) participant observation in conducting my own case before the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court. The empirical data present a detailed account of how Tasmanian <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> disputants perceive and utilise the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court. Included in this account are the types of claims filed and by whom; the amount claimed; the role played by lawyers and insurance companies in giving advice; the perceived helpfulness of court staff; the disposition of cases; the nature of settlements; the perceived degree of formality and privacy, disputant satisfaction with the Court and their perceptions of the Court's strengths and weaknesses; problems of enforcement; and a description of the demographic characteristics of those who utilise the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> procedure. The study further analyses the Court from the perspective of magistrates, court officials and community groups who all have various degrees of involvement with the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court. The principal finding of the study is that the Tasmanian <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court is, to a large extent, achieving the goals for which it was established. More civil cases are tried in <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> than any other court; the vast majority of disputants are satisfied with the system and would use it again; the court staff are considered helpful; and for most litigants there is the appropriate degree of privacy and informality. The major factor influencing disputants' attitudes of fairness, impartiality and general satisfaction with the Court was whether or not disputants felt there was an adequate opportunity to present their side of the case. However, it was found that some areas of the Court's operation could be improved, the major recommendations being: 1) the need for greater public awareness about Small Claims; 2) more education regarding the primary mediation function of the Court; 3) closer working relationships between the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court and other less formal dispute resolution agencies; 4) specialised training for <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> staff and Magistrates; 5) court forms and brochures written in plain English; and 6) improved physical facilities more conducive to the informal atmosphere required of <b>small</b> <b>claims</b> actions. Finally, the study highlights the need for systematic, ongoing evaluation of the <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court with the aim of making further refinements to ensure that, in pursuing the goal of providing a speedy, inexpensive and informal method of resolving minor civil disputes, the rhetoric of <b>Small</b> <b>Claims</b> Court dispute resolution matches the reality...|$|R

50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>claim</b> {{courts in}} Brazil were {{established}} by Law No. 9,099/1995 and Article One of such law states that they shall be organized by both Federal Judiciary and State Judiciary. Therefore, there are Federal <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> Courts (single noun Juizado Especial Federal), {{as well as}} <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> Courts {{that are part of}} a state's judiciary structure. The <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> Courts that belong to a State's Judiciary are subdivided into two types of courts: the Special Civil Court (Juizado Especial Cívil, shortened as JEC) and the Special Criminal Court (Juizado Especial Criminal, shortened as Jecrim). Under Article Three of Law No. 9,099/1995, Civil Claims involving an amount up to 40 (forty) monthly minimal wages or R$24,880.00 (October 2012), which correspond to roughly US$12,440.00, may be filed before a Special Civil Court, as well as small claims involving landlords and some claims set by Article 275, II, of the Code of Civil Procedure. Special Criminal Courts, on the other hand, may process claims involving small criminal offenses, which, under Article 60 of Law No. 9,099/1995 are those either set by the Contraventions Law (Decree No. 3,688/1941) or those where the penalty does not surpass 02 (two years). As per Article 54, there are no court fees for the <b>Small</b> <b>Claim</b> Courts. However, if an appeal is filed, court fees shall be applied.|$|E
