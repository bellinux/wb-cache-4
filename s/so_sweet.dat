5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, Baker had been invited to the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). Baker also starred in <b>So</b> <b>Sweet...</b> So Perverse (1969), Paranoia (1969), A Quiet Place to Kill (1970), and Il coltello di ghiaccio (Knife of Ice) (1972), all horror films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.|$|E

500|$|The band self-produced two EPs {{that drew}} {{attention}} on the underground circuit before signing to Vanguard Records in 1966. Their debut album, Electric Music for the Mind and Body, followed in 1967. It contained their only nationally charting single, [...] "Not <b>So</b> <b>Sweet</b> Martha Lorraine", and their most experimental arrangements. Their second album, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die, was released in late 1967; its title track, with its dark humor and satire, became their signature tune and is among the era's most recognizable protest songs. Further success followed, including McDonald's appearance at Woodstock, but the group's lineup underwent changes until its disbandment in 1970. Members of the band continue {{in the music industry}} as solo recording artists and sporadically reconvene.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{brought the}} character {{back to the}} show {{in the second half}} of the final season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, [...] "Finally, all of your questions [...] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, [...] "No, they will not". Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each other. I was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|E

500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's {{not a lot of}} overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it like high school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture".|$|E
500|$|Miranda Seymour in The New York Times {{remarks on}} the [...] "breathless passion" [...] of the narrator's voice as being {{absolutely}} convincing, citing as an example Nancy's statement to her sister {{at the start of}} the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is <b>so</b> <b>sweet...</b> She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E

[...] ' <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative with this stuff. The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move.

500|$|This {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jon Vitti, his second writing credit of the series since joining {{the staff at the}} beginning of the seventh season. It was directed by series star Steve Carell, the third episode he has directed for the series. The episode marked Amy Ryan's last physical appearance on the series, although she did speak in [...] "Goodbye, Michael". Ryan later said in an interview with New York that [...] "The script was <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> anyway that it made us all have a good cry" [...] especially adding the fact that it was her final appearance. She also expressed her confidence that the series could survive without Carell and that it was the right move for him to leave. Vitti later submitted the episode for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but it was not nominated.|$|E
500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] debuted to {{mixed and}} {{positive}} reviews among critics. After its premiere during Mars' performance on Saturday Night Live, it became {{available as a}} studio version with Chris Martins of Spin labeling it an [...] "epic studio-recorded glory". On a more thorough review, Idolator's Carl Williott found the production [...] "dynamic" [...] comparing it to compositions by Lana Del Rey and while [...] "the pre-chorus could be from a 60's girl group", the [...] "percussion and electro flitting in the background" [...] is what makes pop music nowadays. He concluded, that it's [...] "a flipside" [...] to Mars' lead single.. HitFix's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B- rating, praising the melody and Mars' vocal delivery, writing [...] "he makes it all sound <b>so</b> <b>sweet,</b> and as if he really is tortured by these young girls", but ultimately calling the lyrics [...] "a little skeevy". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, while reviewing the album, believed that it [...] "swells something serious. The ambition is undeniable". He compared it {{to the music of}} U2 and Daughtry.|$|E
500|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{a success}} upon release, {{charting}} at number 39 on the Billboard 200, and {{remains one of the}} most enduring psychedelic works of the counterculture era. A single, [...] "Not <b>So</b> <b>Sweet</b> Martha Lorraine", was distributed a month prior to the release of the album and became the only Country Joe and the Fish single to chart, peaking at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100, in large part a culmination of its airplay on FM broadcasting and college stations. A reworked version of [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was intended to be released as a track on the album. However, Charters vetoed the decision to see whether the controversial song [...] "Superbird" [...] would face a radio ban. Nonetheless, the band was considered a forerunner in the emerging music scene in San Francisco, exhibiting one of the more polished debuts, just as its contemporaries were still refining their own sound. Melton attributes the album's success, particularly in San Francisco, to the band's appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967. Subsequently, the group toured the East Coast with an elaborate psychedelic light show.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on March 3, 1989, it {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, journalists and academics. Taraborrelli commented that the track [...] "deserved every bit of the curiosity it generated. While being devilishly danceable, the song also shows Madonna's uncanny ability to inspire strong, conflicting emotions {{during the course of}} a single song, leaving the listener scratching his head for answers—and craving for more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, while writing about Madonna's re-invention of her image, observed how her sound had changed from the [...] "simple blaring dance-pop to the rich, fully rounded pop of 'Like a Prayer". Lucy O'Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] was Madonna's usage of liturgical words. [...] "There is the surface meaning, forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound <b>so</b> <b>sweet.</b> But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' really takes you there," [...] she concluded. This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that [...] "the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane. There-in lies Madonna's triumph with 'Like a Prayer'. It still sounds catchy and danceable." ...|$|E
500|$|Talia Soghomolian from musicOMH, was {{negative}} in her review, [...] "A {{couple of years}} ago, 50 Cent opened a boutique with the hit 'Candy Shop'. Now it's time for Madonna to lead us up the path to her own confectioner's shop, one that is alas limited in flavours. There are only two, to be precise: not <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> and downright unsavoury". Helen Brown, from The Daily Telegraph compared its sound to Madonna's 1987 hit [...] "La Isla Bonita", but ultimately concluding that it was [...] "sweet and a bit naughty, but forgettably flavourless". A reviewer from Blender called it a [...] "glucose-tolerant" [...] take on the 50 Cent track {{of the same name}} in which Madonna [...] "hawks her reconstituted hotness". Drowned in Sounds Tony Robert Whyte panned the track, calling it [...] "unbelievably more atrocious than the 50 Cent song". Allan Raible of ABC News, opined that [...] " [...] sports the sort of skuzzy funk that the Neptunes have [...] perfected, complete with winkingly cheesy synth-line accents". In Brazil, [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was certified Platinum by the Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos, for exceeding 100,000 digital downloads, while in Finland, it peaked at number 21 on the download chart in August 2009.|$|E
500|$|Joy Kim of Manga Life also {{praised the}} art style saying the {{characters}} were distinctive. She criticized {{the relationship of}} the lead couple, Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park, saying that Mu-Yeon should not be <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> and protective of someone who does not return her feelings. Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting. Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being [...] "somewhat muddled, the visual storytelling is not. The art is clean, lovely, and easy to follow, with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts. The character designs are pretty, distinct, and occasionally even creepy, as with Mu-Yeon's eternally smiling mask. The overall look is undeniably [...] "manhwa" [...] – a draw for some and a turn-off for others." [...] Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume, but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the [...] "Pig Girl" [...] are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters. A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite confusion caused by the plot and [...] "vagueness on the villain front, Pig Bride is still a very entertaining tale." ...|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from.

500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet {{when he saw her}} in 1818. When he saw her again in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> a creature in the midst of such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E

New York Daily News writer Rachel Maresca complimented on Aguilera's new figure, [...] "she looks happier and healthier than ever as she bops around smiling ear-to-ear in swimsuits showing off her trimmed-down figure", while Allison Takeda from US Weekly commented that Aguilera's {{look in the}} video is [...] "slim and gorgeous". Writing for the Daily Mail, George Stark commented that perhaps the clip [...] "might enjoy a new lease of life". According to Sam Lansky for Idolator, the video's message is a [...] "soulful, and completely inexplicable, letter to her fans thanking them for their undying love". Malene Arpe for the Toronto Star was positive toward the clip, calling it a [...] "perfect antidote to a week {{of thinking about the}} Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke porn circus". She continued, [...] "Aguilera's new video is <b>so</b> <b>sweet</b> and innocent and full of goodwill towards humanity, it will make you forget all about twerking and foam fingers and the inherent greasiness of Robin Thicke". Nina Terrero for NBC Latino compared the video for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] to Aguilera's previous video for [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002) for the same positive portrayal of the LGBT community.|$|E
