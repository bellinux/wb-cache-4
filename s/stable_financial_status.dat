40|$|In recent years, in Russia both {{official}} and media discourses {{have emphasized the}} need to modernize, optimize and reform the institutions of public and municipal administration as basic means of socio-economic and political development of the country. Unfortunately, quite often different organizational forms within the system of social management encounter not only institutional or objective obstacles, but also subjective problems determined by the “quality” of human resources. For decades, the concept “official” in the Russian public opinion retains its negative connotations; at the same time, the corresponding professions are extremely attractive for the younger generations as a guarantee of not high income, but rather of a <b>stable</b> <b>financial</b> and social <b>status.</b> The authors compare the results of two surveys conducted in 2011 and 2015 on the samples of “public and municipal administration” students in the Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia to reveal if {{they are committed to}} the stereotypes of mass consciousness on the problems and prospects of the state and municipal employees as a professional group with specific formal and informal corporate rules and requirements, which tends to remain closed for a common man. The authors recognize the limits for comparing two surveys data due to the modification of the questionnaire; however, they identify a number of important trends in the future state and municipal employees’ perception of ethical requirements, public expectations and claims to their work...|$|R

The issue of municipality’s <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> analysis is poorly studied by Lithuanian authors; this matter is more examined by foreign authors.

Data were derived from the 2005 Ontario Student Drug Use Survey of 7 th- 12 th grade students in ontario, Canada. This biennial survey monitors mental and physical health, substance use, and delinquent behavior in adolescent students. Results indicate that the significance of perceived <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> varies across adolescent outcomes. Greater emotional distress and lower self-rated health {{are associated with a}} perception of below average <b>financial</b> <b>status.</b> The associations of illicit drug use and hazardous and harmful drinking with perceived <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> vary for younger and older adolescents. Adjustments for parental education highlight differences in the influences of perceived <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and parental education on health and behavior. Results highlight the utility of perceived family <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> in examinations of adolescent health and behavior, and the importance of examining diverse aspects of health and maladjustment.

Risk management is measured by current ratio, the company's <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> is measured by Altman Z Score bankruptcy prediction, such as the quality of corporate governance Corporate Governance Perception Index (CGPI) while conducting managerial opportunistic behavior pattern of earnings management is proxied by Eckel Index (1981). Testing is done with path analysis (path analysis) with the help SmartPLS 1. 10 versions in 47 companies listed on the Indonesian Institute of Corporate Governance (IICG) 2011 - 2013 and submit an annual report on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). This {{study found that the}} risk management and <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of the company does not have an influence on managerial opportunistic behavior. While the quality of corporate governance can reduce managerial opportunistic behavior. Risk management is a negative impact on the quality of corporate governance while <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> may {{have an impact on the}} quality of corporate governance. Risk management had a positive influence to the company with a sound <b>financial</b> <b>status.</b> In path analysis, risk management is not directly influence on managerial opportunistic behavior. But risk management can improve the <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of the company's reputation and raise the quality of corporate governance, so as to suppress the manager to perform income smoothing. On the one hand, managers still perform income smoothing though the company has a risk management and corporate governance, since the motivation that is efficient to perform earnings management.

In this paper, we examine the impact of the perception of <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> on skirt length preference. Using the “Environmental Security Hypothesis” as a theoretical framework, we predict that people will prefer short to long skirts when they perceive their <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> as good. Two experiments demonstrate that consumers’ preference for short (vs. long) skirts is systematically changed by different perceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>status.</b> Furthermore, this preference occurred due to their perceived need for security. fals...|$|R

40|$|Determining the <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of {{national}} Social Security systems {{is a complex}} and difficult task. Key concepts include how to measure assets and liabilities, {{the length of the}} evaluation period, and whether to view the system as an on-going program or to consider its termination value. Measuring the current and future <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of Social Security is necessary for policymakers and the public to understand the need for modifying and reforming national retirement policies. There are a number of possible methods of illustrating the current and projected future actuarial balance of Social Security. The methods and assumptions employed by the Trustees of the U. S. Social Security system are described in this analysis. The various accounting methods used to show the current <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of Social Security are examined below. Individually, any one of these methods provides an incomplete assessment of the <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of Social Security. Together they show the projected shortfall in revenues for an on-going system, the required funds to pay all accrued benefits if the system is terminated, and the transition costs of a policy reforms.

40|$|Information about company's <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and its {{performance}} results {{is very important}} for the objective evaluation of company's position in the market and competitive possibilities in the future. Such information is provided in the financial statement. It is important to apply and investigate this information properly. The methodology of company's <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and performance results integrated analysis is recommended in this article. This methodology consists of these three elements: 1) research of absolute financial indicators variation; 2) calculation and estimation of relative financial indicators (these are the elements of a traditional finance analysis); 3) standardization and analysis of indicators. Applying this methodology it is enough to use 8 – 10 indicators to estimate <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and performance results of small and medium entities and 15 – 20 indicators to estimate <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and performance results of large entities. The methodology of company's <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> and performance results integrated analysis allows calculating variations of absolute financial indicators and to reveal the grounds of these variations and to suggest the decisions to improve the current situation for the management of the company. The third element of this analysis - standardization and analysis of indicators, allows revealing the aspects of commercial – industrial activities. Application of all three elements of integrated analysis will help company's management to evaluate current <b>financial</b> <b>status</b> of the company and {{its performance}} results and to make proper management decisions that will guarantee the succession of company's activity and good financial results in the future...|$|R

Based on these firm-level financial variables and on planet-level investment and production data from the U. S.
