25|$|The album titled Mercenary was {{released}} on 8 September 1998 in Europe and on 10 November 1998 in the USA, and features 9 tracks. It is an overall slower album than its predecessors. However, it is definitely very heavy and <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> much like classic Bolt Thrower. Karl also returned to performing his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left Benediction.|$|E
25|$|Earlier lineups of {{the band}} were sextets and octets {{employing}} extensive use of saxophones, percussion and live keyboards. From 1991 onwards, the band was a rock power quartet centred on two guitars (with the remaining keyboard and percussion parts sequenced on tape). Vocally, Cardiacs employ a distinctive singing style centred on Tim Smith's lead vocals (reedy and high-pitched, with a strong punk-styled Estuary English accent) and choral sections (varying from yelled to falsetto) involving most or all {{of the band}}. Smith's singing style has been described by music critics as 'skittish'; it has also been commented that his singing voice <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> similar to his speaking one. The band's music is written almost entirely by Tim Smith, although contributions have been made by other group members.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the spoken {{language}} suffered {{none of the}} constraints that applied to the written language and Brazilian Portuguese <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> {{different than any other}} derivative of Portuguese. Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look up to what is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one, specially after a lot of tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil since the country's de-facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden of speaking freely on their native languages in Brazil by fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese law enforcers. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal, and Portuguese actors working in Brazil, despite the differences on spoken language.|$|E

500|$|When {{interviewed by}} ABC News in 2012, Madonna {{was asked about}} the {{similarities}} between [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself", stating: [...] "When I heard [...] on the radio ... I said, 'that <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> familiar' ... It felt reductive." [...] She also came to report to The Newsweek Daily Beast Company what she had in mind when she heard [...] "Born This Way": [...] "I thought, 'What a wonderful way to redo my song'. I mean, I recognised the chord changes. I thought it was... interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, the song's chorus was [...] "set in stone," [...] so {{they asked}} Burgess {{to sing it}} and write some more lyrics. The Chemical Brothers also wanted him to perform his vocals {{at the end of}} the track like his voice from earlier in his career, {{described}} by Burgess himself as [...] "weedy and soft," [...] singing lyrics like [...] "I'm a hustler, I'm a tiger." [...] The duo also stated that his vocal styling in the outcome <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> different from the one of their previous collaboration. The Guardian Alexis Petridis compared it to a [...] "standard-issue mid-Atlannick accent." ...|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{certainly}} think [...] references {{me a lot}} in her work," [...] Madonna said in the ABC interview. [...] "And sometimes I think it's amusing and flattering and well-done. When I heard [...] on the radio ... I said, 'that <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> familiar." [...] Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for [...] "Born This Way". CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation. AllMusic also note a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and Kylie Minogue's 1991 single [...] "What Do I Have to Do", writing that [...] "Kylie Minogue has always displayed a strong Madonna influence—something she’s readily admitted to in interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I know that <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E

500|$|Wild Arms soundtrack was {{composed}} entirely by Michiko Naruke and is heavily inspired by Spaghetti westerns, featuring instrumentation from mandolins, acoustic and electric guitars, finger cymbals, trumpets, and whistling {{to produce an}} Old West sound to fit the game's setting and stylistic approach. A classical theme is also present in many tracks with the melody being provided by string instruments and deep drums to heighten the mood or increase tension. The game's overworld theme [...] "Lone Bird in the Shire", contains the melody from Ennio Morricone's [...] "The Ecstasy of Gold" [...] originally from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The opening theme [...] "Into the Wilderness" [...] is of Riz Ortolani's [...] "Day of Anger" [...] from Day of Anger. The melody that plays while Mother is reawakened <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> similar to the melody of the song [...] "Farewell to Cheyenne" [...] from the popular western, Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the New Statesman, George Eaton {{stated that}} he was {{surprised}} by the moderate stance that Chomsky took in Occupy, remarking that the [...] "self-described anarchist <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> much like a social democrat", offering the [...] "cautious, provisional response one might expect from a Labour shadow cabinet minister" [...] rather than the words of a radical revolutionary. Arguing that he was exhibiting [...] "passionate sanity" [...] at a time when much of the Left was gripped by conspiracy theories, he also criticized Chomsky for being [...] "maddeningly banal" [...] at points during the book, but ultimately thought that there was [...] "much to commend Chomsky's radical pessimism." [...] In a brief review in The Independent, Arifa Akbar highlighted that although Chomsky's claims regarding class war carried with them [...] "the ring of an old Marxist manifesto", the notion that we ourselves need to change in order to allow the state to change was [...] "very contemporary".|$|E
500|$|Many news {{organizations}} reviewed the piece in connection to Sneddon. Fox News Channel and CNN expressed {{the opinion that}} the [...] "cold man" [...] of this song's lyrics is Sneddon, as when sung, [...] "Dom S. Sheldon" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> close to [...] "Thomas Sneddon". The BBC suggested that the lyric's reference to a [...] "B.S.T.A." [...] sounds similar to [...] "S.B.D.A.", meaning [...] "Santa Barbara District Attorney". The Guardian and The New York Times expressed the view that Jackson suggests [...] "Sheldon" [...] has links to the CIA and the Ku Klux Klan and he just [...] "wants your vote". Sneddon's own work website indicates that he believes he {{is the subject of}} the song, stating, [...] "He's the only DA in the nation to have an angry song written about him by pop megastar Michael Jackson". Of the song, he said, [...] "I have not—shall we say—done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot".|$|E

500|$|On June 17, 2011, Jive Records {{announced}} {{through a}} press release that an exclusive 30-second teaser would premiere on June 19, 2011, on Bravo's Watch What Happens: Live and on VEVO simultaneously. The full length video was revealed to premiere on MTV and VEVO on June 22, 2011. Following the premiere, the video was played hourly on MTV, during video hours, and on VH1's Best Morning Buzz Live. Jen McDonnell of Dose said, [...] "damn if [...] doesn't rock. [...] It all <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> weird – and it is. But it's also buckets of fun." [...] Megan Gibson of Time stated that the video is [...] "random, weird and intended to be funny" [...] and that {{despite the lack of}} dancing [...] "Britney seems pleasantly energetic and spunky in 'I Wanna Go' which is a comforting change from her usual blank-eyed look." [...] Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post commented that the video [...] "shows a much livelier Britney than the world has seen since the 'Toxic' years." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Madonna sells the song, due to [...] "the bass gurgles that remind of classic Massive Attack or the {{reference}} to 'Vogue.'" [...] PopMatterss Evan Sawdey enjoyed the sense of dirty fun that permeates [...] "Holy Water", writing that [...] "Madonna <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> much at home with aggressive sentiments like 'Bitch, get off my pole' and 'Yeezus loves my pussy best', blatantly toying around with religious iconography while having a bit of provocative fun." [...] He also found the [...] "Vogue" [...] sample [...] "a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is [...] "a welcome bit of percolating electronica". Cinquemani commended {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "genuflect" [...] in a pop song, but also felt that [...] "Madonna's Catholic baiting [...] like a reflex at this point". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, or just to make a statement [...] "about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos".|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Many reviewers were pleased {{with what they}} saw as a return-to-form sound reminiscent of the Blue Album (1994) and Pinkerton (1996) albums. Pitchfork Media writer Marc Hogan gave the song a positive review and described the song as, [...] "a catchy, self-referential rocker, with the buzzsaw guitars and big choruses of Weezer's glory days, and that familiar, self-assured lameness." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a positive review, [...] "That chunka-chunka guitar hook is pure [...] gold, so much so that I didn't focus on Rivers Cuomo's very clever lyrics at first." [...] Stereogum was also impressed with the song stating it was a [...] "sweet, savory dose of self-referential, self-deprecating Weezer rock... This stuff <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> familiar in a good, good way." [...] NME described the song as having [...] " [...] best chorus in ages". However, Internet reviewer David Ritter speculated that the song was either [...] "voided by the wholesale capitulation involved in going home and writing said commercial material" [...] or [...] "a calculated attempt to boost record sales by wrapping faux-defiance in pretty paper," [...] going on to compliment its [...] "Scorcho-y acoustic guitar," [...] he then said that this, along with the [...] "keyboard twinkles" [...] and [...] "squeals and squeaks", has little effect on the song and that they barely register on top of the much more noticeable lead vocals and power chords.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E
2500|$|Because the /m/ of cum assimilates to the /n/ of nobis, {{and because}} the accent was weaker in Latin than in English, cum nobis (although {{stressed}} on the middle syllable) <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> similar to cunno bis (stressed on the first syllable), meaning [...] "in/from/with a cunt twice".
