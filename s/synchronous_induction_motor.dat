50|$|The {{two main}} types of AC motors are {{classified}} as <b>induction</b> and <b>synchronous.</b> The <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> (or asynchronous motor) always relies on a small difference in speed between the stator rotating magnetic field and the rotor shaft speed called slip to induce rotor current in the rotor AC winding. As a result, the <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> cannot produce torque near <b>synchronous</b> speed where <b>induction</b> (or slip) is irrelevant or ceases to exist. In contrast, the synchronous motor does not rely on slip-induction for operation and uses either permanent magnets, salient poles (having projecting magnetic poles), or an independently excited rotor winding. The synchronous motor produces its rated torque at exactly synchronous speed. The brushless wound-rotor doubly fed synchronous motor system has an independently excited rotor winding that does not rely {{on the principles of}} slip-induction of current. The brushless wound-rotor doubly fed motor is a synchronous motor that can function exactly at the supply frequency or sub to super multiple of the supply frequency.|$|R

50|$|Electric motors {{are unique}} in many ways, {{especially}} when it comes to the power band. The exact characteristics vary greatly with the type of electric motor.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) signals generated within {{electrical power}} equipment {{can be used}} to assess the condition of the insulation. In practice, testing often results in multiple PD sources. In order {{to assess the impact of}} individual PD sources, signals must first be discriminated from one another. This paper presents a procedure for the identification of PD signals generated by multiple sources. Starting with the assumption that different PD sources will display unique signal profiles this will be manifested in the distribution of energies with respect to frequency and time. Therefore the technique presented is based on the comparison of signal energies associated with particular wavelet decomposition levels. Principal component analysis is adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the data, whilst minimizing lost information in the data concentration step. Physical parameters are extracted from individual PD pulses and projected into 3 -dimensional space to allow clustering of data from specific PD sources. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm is chosen for its ability to discover clusters of arbitrary shape in n-dimension space. PD data from individual clusters can then be further analyzed by projecting the clustered data with respect to the original phase relationship. Results and analysis of the technique are compared for experimentally measured PD data from a range of sources commonly found in three different types of high voltage (HV) equipment; ac <b>synchronous</b> generators, <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> and distribution cables. These experiments collect data using varied test arrangements including sensors with different bandwidths to demonstrate the robustness and indicate the potential for wide applicability of the technique to PD analysis for a range of insulation systems...|$|R
40|$|Russer and Thompson 2 have derived (correctly) frequency-power {{formulas}} for loss-less {{models of}} Josephson junctions. Each of these authors stated that his formulas {{are similar to}} the Manley-Rowe relations, but have additional terms for dc power.

My original motivation for this proof was to allow for power transmitted through rotating shafts, especially on <b>synchronous</b> and <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> but the deriva-tion was general enough to include the present Josephson models. Recent results, there-fore, should be regarded as a special case of the Manley-Rowe equations, rather than a new set of equations. Thompson stated explicitly his interpretation that the Josephson junction does not obey the Manley-Rowe equations; it is my belief that a more fruitful viewpoint is that with the dc power interpreted properly, the Josephson junction does obey the Manley-Rowe equations. This viewpoint makes it unnecessary to rederive other forms for the equations, such as would be necessary for subharmonic generation, or for excitation with more independent frequencies. My early result 3 may be stated as follows. Consider a device with one or more ports through which power can pass. Each port has a pair of covariables. In this case there is only one port and the covariables are voltage and current. The Manley-Rowe equa-tions are obeyed by any such device with an energy state function that (i) {{is a function of the}} integrals of one of the covariables from each port, and (ii) has as partial deriva-tives the other covariables.

30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} electrical parameters of power systems, frequency and its dynamic characteristic is crucial for power system operation and control [1]. Frequency dynamics interacts with many devices in power systems in two ways. First, the performance of many devices are affected by frequency, e.g., speed governor of <b>synchronous</b> generators, <b>induction</b> <b>motors,</b> power system stabilizer (PSS) with frequency as input, and reactance and susceptance of transmission lines or shunt components. Second, the dynamic behaviour of system frequency is also affected by those frequency-dependent devices. Besides, dynamic characteristic of frequency is a key factor influencing power system protection. Generators are protected against abnormal frequency deviation with over-speeding and under-speeding protective relays. Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) is an important resort to prevent power system collapse in the event of large generation deficit [2, 3]. The cooperation between the generating unit protective relays and UFLS is important for power system frequency stability [4]. Moreover, investigation into some blackouts indicates that large frequency deviation is a main factor pushing power systems to the edge [5]. In the process of power systems restoration, frequency deviation should be carefully restricted by gradually starting generators and loads to avoid large frequency deviation and subsequent system failure [6]. Furthermore, with large scale of renewable energy integrated into power grids, power fluctuation from renewables will lead to continuous power system frequency fluctuation and deviation [7]. Primary and secondary frequency regulation have important effect on preventing frequency deviation. The participation of renewable energy generation in frequency regulation also plays an important role in frequency security, regulation, and control. Therefore, it is necessary to study the dynamic behaviour of power system frequency for improving the operation performance of modern power systems.|$|R
