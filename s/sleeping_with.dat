5|$|The predation-avoidance {{behavior}} of <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> one eye open, allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware {{while the other}} half sleeps, was first demonstrated in mallards, although it {{is believed to be}} widespread among birds in general.|$|E
5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty the Clown has been <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy {{most of the other}} jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) discovers she is pregnant, but is unsure if {{the father}} of her child is her husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), or her lover and former gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe).

5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as {{a priest}} in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan {{had to wait for}} consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story is unlikely to be true.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Veronica rebuffs Logan for <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> Madison over winter break {{was the subject of}} a {{continuing}} debate in the writers' room about Veronica's character. Specifically, Enbom and Klemmer, two writers for the episode thought that Veronica should be less mistrustful, paranoid and jealous, while executive producers Thomas and Diane Ruggiero advocated for these traits in Veronica. Thomas illustrated their creative differences by stating that he enjoyed the film Chasing Amy, while Enbom did not.|$|E
5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} bluntly that her {{position as a}} married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also <b>sleeping</b> <b>with</b> Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– not to mention her gruesome demise– has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E
