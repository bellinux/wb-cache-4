40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} compare two {{different}} nucleic acid libraries has permitted inquiries {{into the role}} of differentially expressed genes or deleted/inserted genomic sequences involved in the mechanisms of neoplastic transformation, developmental regulation, physiological processing, pathological disorder, and therapeutic efficacy. Subtractive hybridization between two complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries is a powerful tool for identifying differentially expressed genes. In principle, an excess amount of modi-fied <b>subtracter</b> cDNAs derived from cells of a control group are used to bind with tester messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or cDNAs isolated from the cells of interest. Because the <b>subtracter</b> cDNAs are modified to interfere with the amplification processes of reverse transcription (RT) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), all subtracter-bound tester sequences are degraded and only the differentially expressed genes in the tester can be preserved for RT–PCR amplification. To improve the efficiency of subtractive hybridization, we have developed a chemical modification procedure to generate cova-lently binding cDNAs as the <b>subtracter</b> to capture the homologous tester sequences. We have also proved that the covalently bound duplex hybrids cannot be separated in PCR and thus are removed from the amplified differential gene sequences. Using the novel principle of covalently hybridized subtraction (CHS), we provide an easy, fast, and effective subtractive hybridization method for understanding the alterations of gene expression and/or chromosomal rearrangement in disordered cells in comparison with normal ones, which may reveal targets for gene therapy, eugenic improvement, pharmaceutical drug design, and investigation of etiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the consumer electronics market have resulted in a tremendous increase in the scope of applications for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for ultimate quality DSP products which, in turn, necessitates structured design for testability (DFT) methodologies and in particular Built-In Self Test (BIST). The classical BIST schemes usually employ the specialized test pattern generation and test response compaction circuitry, which, in consequence, introduces a significant hardware overhead and performance degradation to a design under test. In this thesis, we propose an entirely new Arithmetic Built-In Self Test (ABIST) concept that utilizes the functional blocks inherent to DSP architectures for testing the entire hardware. Arithmetic blocks such as adders and <b>subtracters</b> are slightly modified to perform test pattern generation and test response compaction in the BIST mode. We demonstrate that ABIST scheme is applicable to testing DSP microcontrollers, as well as regular blocks from the DSP data path like arithmetic and logic blocks and multipliers. In addition, this method provides high quality scan pattern generation and compaction for testing of random logic. The proposed ABIST scheme permits at-speed testing while introducing virtually no area overhead and no performance degradation. These characteristics make ABIST very suitable for consumer applications where the primary objective is to minimize the size of the products without sacrificing the performance. The ABIST scheme is also applicable to embedded DSP cores, where it is extremely difficult to access successive blocks externally...|$|R

Rapid identification and quantification of avian contamination would therefore {{be useful to}} prevent overestimation of human health risk. We used subtractive hybridization of PCR-amplified gull fecal 16 S RNA genes to identify avian-specific fecal rRNA gene sequences. The <b>subtracters</b> were rRNA genes amplified from human, dog, cat, cow, and pig feces. Recovered sequences were related to Enterobacteriaceae (47 %), Helicobacter (26 %), Catellicoccus (11 %), Fusobacterium (11 %), and Campylobacter (5 %). Three PCR assays, designated GFB, GFC, and GFD, were based on recovered sequence fragments. Quantitative PCR assays for GFC and GFD were developed using SYBR green. GFC detected down to 0. 1 mg gull feces/ 100 ml (corresponding to 2 gull enterococci most probable number [MPN]/ 100 ml). GFD detected down to 0. 1 mg chicken feces/ 100 ml (corresponding to 13 Escherichia coli MPN/ 100 ml). GFB and GFC were 97 % and 94 % specific to gulls, respectively. GFC cross-reacted with 35 % of sheep samples but occurred at about 100, 000 times lower concentrations in sheep. GFD was 100 % avian specific and occurred in gulls, geese, chickens, and ducks. In the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, the three markers differed in their geographic distributions but were found across the range tested.

40|$|Centre for Intelligent Systems {{and their}} ApplicationsIn this thesis we {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} proof planning to automate the verification of hardware systems. Proof planning is a meta-level reasoning technique which captures patterns of proof common to a family of theorems. It contributes to the automation of proof by incorporating and extending heuristics found in the Nqthm theorem prover and using them to guide a tactic-based theorem prover {{in the search for}} a proof. We have addressed the automation of proof for hardware verification from a proof planning perspective, and have applied the strategies and search control mechanisms of proof planning to generate automatically customised tactics which prove conjectures about the correctness of many types of circuits. The contributions of this research can be summarised as follows: (1) we show by experimentation the applicability of the proof planning ideas to verify automatically hardware designs;(2) we develop and use a methodology based on the concept of proof engineering using proof planning to verify various combinational and sequential circuits which include: arithmetic circuits (adders, <b>subtracters,</b> multipliers, dividers, factorials), data-path components arithmetic logic units shifters, processing units) and a simple microprocessor system; and (3) we contribute to the profiling of the Clam proof planning system by improving its robustness and efficiency in handling large terms and proofs. In verifying hardware, the user formalises a problem by writing the specification, the implementation and the conjecture, using a logic language, and asks Clam to compose a tactic to prove the conjecture. This tactic is then executed by the Oyster prover. To compose a tactic, Clam uses a set of methods which implement the heuristics that specify general-purpose tactics, and AI planning mechanisms. Search is controlled by a type of annotated rewriting called rippling, which controls the selective application of rewrite scaled wave rules. We have extended some of the Clam's methods to verify circuits. The size of the proofs were orders of magnitude larger than the proofs that had been attempted before with proof planning, and are comparable with similar verification proofs obtained by other systems but using fewer lemmas and less interaction. Proof engineering refers to the application of formal proof for system design and verification. We propose a proof engineering methodology which consists of partitioning the automation of formal proof into three different kind of tasks: user, proof and systems tasks. User tasks have to do with formalising a particular verification problem and using a formal tool to obtain a proof. Proof tasks refer to the tuning of proof techniques (e. g. methods and tactics) to help obtain a proof. Systems tasks {{have to do with the}} modification of a formal tool system. By making this distinction explicit, proof development is more manageable. We conjecture that our approach is widely applicable and can be integrated into formal verification environments to improve automation facilities, and be utilised to verify commercial and safety-critical hardware systems in industrial settings...|$|R

Along with the complexity of computational and storage circuits, the designing, testing and debugging become more and more complex and expensive.

In ALU, addition takes most of the time if it uses the ripple-carry adder. The general strategy for designing fast adders is to reduce the time required to form carry signals. Adders that use this principle are called carry look- ahead adder. The carry look-ahead adder is to be designed with combination of 4 -bit adders.

The PIs to this network are shifted versions of the MCM input. An AND gate represents an adder or a <b>subtracter,</b> i. e., an AND gate generates a new partial term.

A SAT-based solver is used to obtain the exact solution. We argue that for many real problems the size of the problem is within the capabilities of current SAT solvers. We present results using binary, CSD and MSD representations. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results. One is that, in many cases, existing heuristics perform well, computing the best solution, or one close to it.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many {{commercial}} demands for decimal floating-point (DFP) arithmetic operations such as financial analysis, tax calculation, currency conversion, Internet based applications, and e-commerce. This trend gives rise to further development on DFP arithmetic units which can perform accurate computations with exact decimal operands. Due to the significance of DFP arithmetic, the IEEE 754 - 2008 standard for floating-point arithmetic includes it in its specifications. The basic decimal arithmetic unit, such as decimal adder, <b>subtracter,</b> multiplier, divider or square-root unit, as a main part of a decimal microprocessor, is attracting more and more researchers' attentions. Recently, the decimal-encoded formats and DFP arithmetic units have been implemented in IBM's system z 900, POWER 6, and z 10 microprocessors. Increasing chip densities and transistor count provide more room for designers to add more essential functions on application domains into upcoming microprocessors. Decimal transcendental functions, such as DFP logarithm, antilogarithm, exponential, reciprocal and trigonometric, etc, as useful arithmetic operations {{in many areas of}} science and engineering, has been specified as the recommended arithmetic in the IEEE 754 - 2008 standard. Thus, virtually all the computing systems that are compliant with the IEEE 754 - 2008 standard could include a DFP mathematical library providing transcendental function computation. Based on the development of basic decimal arithmetic units, more complex DFP transcendental arithmetic will be the next building blocks in microprocessors. In this dissertation, we researched and developed several new decimal algorithms and architectures for the DFP transcendental function computation. These designs are composed of several different methods: 1) the decimal transcendental function computation based on the table-based first-order polynomial approximation method; 2) DFP logarithmic and antilogarithmic converters based on the decimal digit-recurrence algorithm with selection by rounding; 3) a decimal reciprocal unit using the efficient table look-up based on Newton-Raphson iterations; and 4) a first radix- 100 division unit based on the non-restoring algorithm with pre-scaling method. Most decimal algorithms and architectures for the DFP transcendental function computation developed in this dissertation have been the first attempt to analyze and implement the DFP transcendental arithmetic in order to achieve faithful results of DFP operands, specified in IEEE 754 - 2008. To help researchers evaluate the hardware performance of DFP transcendental arithmetic units, the proposed architectures based on the different methods are modeled, verified and synthesized using FPGAs or with CMOS standard cells libraries in ASIC. Some of implementation results are compared with those of the binary radix- 16 logarithmic and exponential converters; recent developed high performance decimal CORDIC based architecture; and Intel's DFP transcendental function computation software library. The comparison results show that the proposed architectures have significant speed-up in contrast to the above designs in terms of the latency. The algorithms and architectures developed in this dissertation provide a useful starting point for future hardware-oriented DFP transcendental function computation researches...|$|E

40|$|Faecal {{bacteria}} {{from point}} and diffuse source pollution can impact water which poses a serious {{public health and}} environmental threat. Faecal pollution contains nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen and when in excess these nutrients can cause eutrophication. Observing and establishing the source of faecal pollution is imperative {{for the protection of}} water quality and human health. Conventional culture methods to detect such pollution via faecal indicator bacteria have been extensively utilised but do not determine the source of pollution. To combat this, microbial source tracking (MST), an important emerging molecular tool, can be applied to detect host-specific markers in faecally contaminated waters. The main aim of this project was to establish the source of faecal contamination and the pathways by which it was transferred in two rural catchments, Arable B (river catchment) and Grassland D (karst catchment containing turloughs), in Ireland using a multi-tiered approach including elements such as MST. The MST approach was to target ruminant and human-specific faecal Bacteroidales 16 S rRNA genes within the two catchments. From a risk assessment perspective, the two catchments differ greatly due to the varying hydrology, agricultural land use, topography, geology, and human density located in each. These two catchments have combinations of potentially high source and transport pressures. Hydrological connectivity drives the transfer of faecal bacteria and nutrients, of human or agricultural origin, from land to water. In Chapter II, a novel pathway separation technique, Loadograph Recession Analysis (LRA), was applied to identify transfer pathways of faecal bacteria (E. coli). LRA separates the pathways into quick flow - which represents surface overland flow, preferential flow, and tile and ditch drainage; interflow; and delayed flow - which represents baseflow. The study illustrated that high loads of phosphorus and E. coli were transferred during the faster flow pathways in both catchments. Grassland D was found to be a transport limited system and Arable B a less transport limited system. Transfers of E. coli were shown to be dependent on flow and independent of season. Arable B had higher E. coli loads, even in low flow, despite Grassland D having a potentially higher faecal indicator organism FIO source. In Grassland D, higher loads of E. coli were moved during rising phases but this was more subtle in Arable B as the loads mostly remained unchanged during rising and falling phases. Potential chronic point sources in Arable B, were indicated by the asymptotic decline of sustained E. coli loads towards low flows. MST has been used to differentiate between anthropogenic and agricultural faecal sources in faecally contaminated water but has not been used to show how the dominance of faecal sources changes between different phases of hydrological runoff. In Chapter III, it was hypothesised that agricultural ruminant faecal waste would be elevated increased and human faecal waste, where this was present, would be diluted by the quicker flow paths. The universal Bacteroidales qPCR assay, BacUni-UCD, and the host- specific qPCR assays BacBov-UCD and BacHum-UCD were applied to water samples taken during different flow phases. The water samples were also assessed for E. coli occurrence. Statistical analysis illustrated correlations between E. coli, total phosphorus (TP), and BacUni-UCD loads indicating the presence of faecal contamination. BacBov-UCD and BacHum-UCD were detected in Arable B with the agricultural ruminant contamination mostly dominating the quick flow pathway, and human faecal contamination mostly moving through delayed flow. Grassland D also showed low levels of host-specific faecal contamination with ruminant and human sources being highest in quick flows. There are Bacteroidales bovine-specific assays currently available to detect cow faecal pollution but some of these assays have shown cross-amplification with sheep faecal pollution. As of yet, there has been no molecular Bacteroidales assay developed to identify and differentiate sheep-specific microbial pollution. The aim of Chapter IV was to use subtractive hybridisation to identify specific DNA sequences to develop such an assay, thus allowing further differentiation of sources of pollution, aiding water quality. Target sheep-specific faecal Bacteroidales rRNA gene fragments were differentiated from diverging, though closely related <b>subtracter</b> cow and human faecal Bacteroidales sources. The sequences specific to sheep were used to design five PCR assays which worked successfully as demonstrated by their ability to amplify the positive control. Probes were designed to develop qPCR assays to discriminate between sheep and cow faeces. The resultant five qPCR assays were tested against various faecal samples. One qPCR assay was able to successfully differentiate between sheep, cow, human, horse, goat and pig faecal samples. Using combining DNA based analysis of faecal bacteria to discriminate faecal matter sources in conjunction with high-resolution P analysis for hydrological pathway discrimination and E. coli analysis, during different events, will add to the understanding and mitigation of FIO transfers from land to water. This will result in a more targeted approach to best management practices which could limit the deterioration of water quality in the most cost effective way. This information can be used by agricultural policy makers or local county councils to help protect water quality...|$|E
