The equilibrium price from compulsory call auctions for distribution companies {{within the framework of the}} Iberian Power Futures Market is not optimal for remuneration purposes as it seems to be slightly upward biased, though such a premium is not significant (only around 2 % above the average of Settlement Prices). In the period considered (August 2006 to September 2008), monthly futures contracts behave similarly to quarterly contracts. Average risk premia have been positive in power and natural gas markets but negative in oil and coal markets. Different hypotheses are tested regarding increasing volatility with maturity and regarding Forward Risk Premium correlations (negative with variance of <b>spot</b> prices during <b>delivery</b> period and positive with skewness of <b>spot</b> prices during <b>delivery</b> period). Enlarged data sets are recommended for stronger test results. Energy markets tend to show limited levels of market efficiency.

40|$|Vattenfall hedge {{its future}} {{electricity}} production {{in order to}} decrease fluctuations in the result. Hedging can in a simplified way be described as selling the future electricity deliveries in long-term contracts so that the future price of the delivery becomes fixed. The contracts used are electricity forwards traded at the Nordic electricity market Nord Pool. An imbalance between buyers and sellers {{can lead to a}} situation where the forward price not equals the expected spot price. The difference between the forward price and the expected spot price {{is referred to as the}} market risk premium. This is the extra premium that market participants are willing to pay to offset risk. Vattenfall’s production portfolio is one of the largest in the Nordic region and the lack of liquidity at Nord Pool’s long-term contracts is therefore a limiting factor in effective risk management. The theory is that partly due to the lower liquidity in the longer contracts, Vattenfall pays an unfavorable risk premium in its long term hedges (i. e. selling the electricity to a discount). In this master thesis the risk premia in the Nord Pool electricity market is measured. It is also investigated if the risk premia changes with different time left to delivery. The results show that the risk premia is positive for contracts entered close to delivery, i. e. the forward price exceeds the expected spot price. When time to delivery increases the risk premia decreases and turns negative around one and a half year prior to delivery. The second part of this master thesis consists of an introduction and evaluation of a hedge strategy which is commonly referred to as rolling the hedge. This strategy is supposed to remove the negative effects of the long term negative risk premium. The concept is to use two or more short-term contracts instead of a long-term contract. In this way the negative risk premium is avoided. This can be done because the price movements of the short-term contracts are correlated with the long-term contracts so that the result is protected in the same way as with a long-term contract. However less than perfect which means that the volatility (i. e. the risk) will increase. To investigate whether this strategy, in an efficient way, can be applied to increase the expected return without a significant increase in risk, the outcome of the strategy in terms of risk and return from several different starting points are calculated with actual historical price data. It is showed, although the significance of the result should be interpreted with caution, that the expected return of the combined <b>spot</b> <b>delivery</b> and hedge program can be increased without any major increase in the volatility of the returns...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} light in subwavelength photonic and plasmonic structures has shown great potentials in revolutionizing how information is generated, transformed and processed. Chemically synthesized nanowires, in particular, offers a unique toolbox {{not only for}} highly compact and integrated photonic modules and devices, including coherent and incoherent light sources, waveguides, photodetectors and photovoltaics, but also for new types of nanoscopic bio-probes for spot cargo delivery and in-situ single cell endoscopy and sensing. Such nanowire probes would enable us to carry out intracellular imaging and probing with high spatial resolution, monitor in-vivo biological processes within single living cells and greatly improve our fundamental understanding of cell functions, intracellular physiological processes, and cellular signal pathways. My work is aimed at developing a material and instrumental platform for such single nanowire probe. Successful optical integration of Ag nanowire plasmonic waveguides, which offers deep subwavelength mode confinement, and conventional photonic waveguides was demonstrated on a single nanowire level. The highest plasmonic-photonic coupling efficiency coupling was found at small coupling angles and low input frequencies. The frequency dependent propagation loss was observed in Ag nanowire and was confirmed by quantitative measurement and in agreement with theoretical expectations. Rational integration of dielectric and Ag nanowire waveguide components into hybrid optical-plasmonic routing devices has been demonstrated. This capability is essential for incorporating sub- 100 nm Ag nanowire waveguides into optical fiber based nanoprobes for single cell endoscopy. The nanoprobe system based on single nanowire waveguides was demonstrated by optically coupling semiconductor or metal nanowire with an optical fiber with tapered tip. This nanoprobe design requires minimal instrumentation which makes it cost efficient and readily adaptable to average bio-lab environment. These probes are mechanically robust and flexible and can withstand repeated bending and deformation without significant deterioration in optical performance, which offers an ideal instrumental platform for out subsequent effort of using these nanoprobes in chemical sensing as well as single cell endoscopy and <b>spot</b> <b>delivery.</b> Parameters affecting the coupling efficiency and output power of the nanoprobe were studied and chemical etched of single mode fiber with small cone angle was established to be optimized for highly effective optical nanoprobes. 	The versatility of the nanoprobe design was first tested by transforming the nanowire probe into a pH sensor with near-field photopolymerization of a copolymer containing pH sensitive dye {{on the tip of}} the nanowire. The pH-sensitive nanoprobe was able to report the pH difference in micro-droplets containing buffer solution with the excitation of light waveguided on the nanoprobe with internal calibration, fast response time and good photostability and reversibility. Such nanoprobe sensors are ideal for high definition spatial and temporal sensing of concentration profile, especially for the kinetic processes in single cell studies for which chemical probes of minute sizes and fast response are desired. The nanoprobe was then applied into spot cargo delivery and in-situ single cell endoscopy. It was demonstrated that nanowire-based optical probe can deliver payloads into the cell with a high spatiotemporal precision, guide and confine visible light into intracellular compartments selectively and detect optical signals from the subcellular regions with high spatial resolution. The nanoprobe was proven to be biocompatible and non-invasive. The effective optical coupling between the fiber optics and the nanowire enables highly localized excitation and detection, limiting the probe volume to the close proximity of the nanowire. None the less, this versatile technique does not rely on any expensive or bulky instrumentation, and relies only on micromanipulator and optical microscope that are readily available in most biological labs. The different functions can be further integrated to make the whole nanoprobe system more compact and even portable. In addition, my research also includes the first demonstration of the synthesis of the longitudinal heterostructured SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 nanotubes and the nanofluidic diode device based on the discontinuity of their internal surface charge. Comprehensive characterization shows that the nanotubes has heterostructured inner tube walls, as well as a discontinuity of surface charge. The ionic transport through these nanotube heterojunctions exhibits clear current rectification, a signature of ionic diode behavior. The development of such nanofluidic devices would enable the modulation of ionic and molecular transport at a more sophisticated level, and lead to large-scale integrated nanofluidic networks and logic circuits...|$|E

This eventually led to amateur radio becoming the predominant mean of communication and resulted in the installation of special amateur radio work zones within local weather offices.

California almond and stone fruit or-chards cover nearly 1 million acres and produced revenues of $ 3. 6 billion in 2010 (NASS 2013).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To reinvestigate ultra-high {{dose rate}} {{radiation}} (UHDRR) radiobiology and consider potential implications for hadrontherapy. METHODS: A literature search of cellular UHDRR exposures was performed. Standard oxygen diffusion equations {{were used to}} estimate the time taken to replace UHDRR-related oxygen depletion. Dose rates from conventional and novel methods of hadrontherapy accelerators were considered, including <b>spot</b> scanning beam <b>delivery,</b> which intensifies dose rate. RESULTS: The literature findings were that, for X-ray and electron dose rates of around 10 (9) Gy s(- 1), 5 - 10 Gy depletes cellular oxygen, significantly changing the radiosensitivity of cells already in low oxygen tension (around 3 mmHg or 0. 4 kPa). The time taken to reverse the oxygen depletion of such cells {{is estimated to be}} over 20 - 30 s at distances of over 100 μm from a tumour blood vessel. In this time window, tumours have a higher hypoxic fraction (capable of reducing tumour control), so the next application of radiation within the same fraction should be at a time that exceeds these estimates in the case of scanned beams or with ultra-fast laser-generated particles. CONCLUSION: This study has potential implications for particle therapy, including laser-generated particles, where dose rate is greatly increased. Conventional accelerators probably do not achieve the critical UHDRR conditions. However, specific UHDRR oxygen depletion experiments using proton and ion beams are indicated...|$|R
