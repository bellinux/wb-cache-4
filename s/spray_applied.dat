40|$|Presented for World Environmental Health Day, September 26, 2016 in Greenville, North Carolina. Dengue and Zika viruses (DENV and ZIKV, Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) are arboviruses {{that cause}} human epidemics. Due {{to lack of}} {{vaccines}} for many mosquito borne diseases, {{there is a need}} for mosquito control. In the United States and other regions, residual barrier insecticide <b>sprays</b> <b>applied</b> to foliage where female mosquitoes rest and/or sugar feed between blood meals are an important control method for anthropogenic day-active mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus (vector of DENV and ZIKV). These mosquitoes are difficult to control using traditional <b>sprays</b> <b>applied</b> only at dusk or dawn when these mosquitoes are not active. In this exploratory study, we analyzed the extent to which ingestion of a sublethal dose of the active ingredient bifenthrin affected vector competence (i. e. infection, dissemination, and transmission) of Ae. albopictus for DENV and ZIKV...|$|R

50|$|Spraying the infested {{soil with}} {{fungicides}} and {{removal of the}} leaf litter beneath infected plants have not been reliable methods of disease control. <b>Sprays</b> <b>applied</b> at or just before bud opening have offered the best means of control. In general, sprays of triadimefon or benomyl applied at weekly intervals throughout the flowering period have controlled the blight and inhibited sclerotium formation. Making sure diseased or disease-carrying plants are not introduced into the growing area reduces the disease potential.|$|R

50|$|Most {{contractors}} install prefabrication drainage strips {{at regular}} intervals between the native ground and the shotcrete liner.

Where excessive groundwater is present, membranes placed between successive shotcrete layers have been used. Many new products, including admixtures and membranes, are being evaluated and tested to improve moisture conditions.

40|$|Dispersal of Botrytis fabae spores and the {{development}} of chocolate spot lesions were monitored in crops of winter-sown field beans during the 1980 / 81, 1981 / 82 and 1982 / 83 seasons. The greatest numbers of B. fabae spores collected on horizontal sticky slides exposed in crops were associated with periods of heavy rain and numbers declined if weather was dry. Amounts of chocolate spot developing on leaves of young potted plants exposed in crops near the slides followed the same trends as spore numbers. When numerous spores were collected, abundant chocolate spot developed on the leaves of tagged plants in the crops.

5000|$|Spray {{application}} of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides {{is essential to}} distribute these materials over the intended target surface. Pre-emergent herbicides are sprayed onto soil, but many materials are applied to the plant leaf surface. Agricultural sprays include the spraying of cropland, forest, turf grass, and orchards. The sprayer may be a hand nozzle, on a ground vehicle, or on an aircraft. Herbicides, insecticides and pesticides are <b>spray</b> <b>applied</b> to soil or plant foliage to distribute and disperse these materials. See aerial application, pesticide application, sprayer.The control of spray characteristics is critical to provide the coverage of foliage and to minimize off target drifting of the spray to adjacent areas. (pesticide drift). Spray drift is managed by applying only in appropriate wind conditions and humidity, and by controlling drop size and drop size distribution. Minimizing {{the height of the}} spray boom above the crop reduces drift. The spray nozzle type and size and the operating pressure provide the correct application rate of the material and control the amount of driftable fines.Spays, single fluid nozzles, are also used to cool animals ...|$|E
50|$|Protecting the bed {{of trucks}} {{has been around since}} the {{inception}} of the modern pick-up truck in the early 50's with simple modifications being made such as installing planks of wood to the beds. Ford's F100 series featured such options, although now done only for cosmetic purposes or restoration. People have also been known to install a simple sheet of wood as a means to protect the floor from being scratched or dented. As pick-up trucks were designed to haul cargo a more advanced method was created. Thermoforming, a technique that has been around since the 1940s in acrylics and styrene would eventually through advances in development and research create the first plastic drop-in bedliner in 1983 by Penda Corporation. Also during that time another type of product was being utilized that would eventually make its way to the truck market. In 1983, Morgan Evans founder of Rhinolinings in Johannesburg, South Africa initially used a urethane product applying it to rail cars and delivery vehicles, was the first to create a <b>spray</b> <b>applied</b> product for vehicle protection. Then during 1986, Charles Hibberd a Johannesburg native immigrated to Santa Fe, California bringing chemicals and crude equipment, set up shop and was the first to introduce the spray-on bedliner to the US. Shortly after Charles Hibberd's arrival to the U.S. another South African native would follow. In 1987, Russell Lewis, founder of Rhinolinings Corporation and fellow Johannesburg resident had also started doing bedliners in southern California inspired by Charles Hibberd, though his company would become the household standard of the industry. Hibberd's company known today as Arma International, INC. originally named Arma Linings eventually transpired into Arma Coatings after realizing the uses of the material outside the truck market is also the creator of the high pressure spray-on bedliner introduced in 1991. Working with chemist Ezzat Seif and modifying foam machines like the Graco Foam-Cat 200 that could process the materials, perfected the system through trial and error to what we have today.|$|E
