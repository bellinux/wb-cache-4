5|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> {{are closely}} related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> {{production}} is small in Finland. There is, however, a heterogeneous group of 3 000 producers of sheep or goats. Most of them {{only have a}} few animals. This report explores how epizootic diseases may reach the <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> sector in Finland, and what role it might have as a disease transmitter in Finnish animal production. The disease situation of the Finnish <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> sector is good. The spread of diseases into the country seems relatively unlikely, as the import of live animals and gametes is low. On the other hand, it is more difficult {{to prevent the spread of}} vector borne diseases to Finland. <b>Sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> farms are scattered relatively sparsely, which is why the risk of spread of diseases to neighboring farms does not seem very likely. In addition, movements of animals and indirect contacts between farms are far more uncommon than in the pig and cattle industries. Contacts to other animal production are also few.

5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention.

Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus.

40|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> {{production}} {{is different from}} other types of livestock production (cattle, pig, poultry production) because it is most commonly extensive, which means that it demands a relatively low level of investments into buildings, equipment and other fixed assets.

In order to analyse {{the state in the}} EU, data from the appropriate FADN data base were used, as well as the sector analyses conducted for the area of the EU. On the other hand, in order to analyse necessary investments into <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> production in Serbia, available technical and technological data and appropriate literary sources were used. Analysis of construction costs for buildings used in <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> production was done, as well as the calculation of investments into appropriate necessary equipment.

Villages with domesticated cattle, <b>sheep,</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BC, and gradually developed between c. 4000 and 1500 BC beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa Culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|The Slavic people cremated their dead, {{typical for}} the {{inhabitants}} of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations.

The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (swine, <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> bred to a lesser extent).|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive.

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model has been formulated to assess the losses due to a disease in goats in India. The losses due to important diseases in goats have been computed for a 15 -year period (1991 - 2005) based on published reports. The rank analysis has revealed that number of incidence was maximum for PPR, followed by FMD <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pox. These three diseases have accounted for 54 per cent of the total incidences. The maximum deaths on per year average basis for the period 1991 - 2005 {{have been due to}} PPR, followed by <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pox, enterotoxaemia <b>and</b> CCP. These four diseases have accounted for about 74 per cent of deaths. The overall order with respect to the number of incidences has been found as: PPR > FMD > <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pox > CCP > fascioliasis / distomatosis > enterotoxaemia > anthrax. The corresponding ranking order with respect to number of deaths was: PPR > <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pox > enterotoxaemia > CCP > anthrax > fascioliasis / distomatosis > FMD. The total annual average loss due to all diseases in goats has been found of Rs 264. 8 lakh. The PPR disease has accounted for the maximum (34. 5 %) loss, followed by FMD (14. 3 %), <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pox (14. 1 %), CCP (6. 4 %), enterotoxaemia (6. 1 %), facioliasis / distomatosis (5. 0 %) and anthrax (2. 0 %).

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Plants were {{cultivated}} {{mostly in}} small nearby gardens, but wheat and barley were also grown on small fields obtained by burning the forest. In {{the absence of}} animal-drawn plowing devices, soil was being hoed manually. The forest burning activity brought about significant ecological and environmental changes in Lesser Poland, Silesia and Kujawy. Further out were the pastures, the entire area utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5km. Cattle, <b>sheep</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were even more numerous in the northern flatlands, where the land was less fertile.
