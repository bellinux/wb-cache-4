40|$|Abstract. How can {{collective}} decisions be made {{among individuals}} with conflicting preferences or judgments? Arrow’s impossibility theorem and other social-choice-theoretic results suggest that, for many collective decision problems, {{there are no}} attractive democratic solutions. In response, deliberative democrats argue that group deliberation makes collective decisions more tractable. How can deliberation accomplish this? In this chapter, I explore the distinction between {{two different types of}} agreement and discuss how they can facilitate collective decision making. Deliberative democrats have traditionally defended the hypothesis that group deliberation generates consensus on what decision option should be chosen: <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement.</b> But <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> is not only empirically unrealistic, but also logically unnecessary for meaningful collective decision making. An alternative, less demanding hypothesis is that, under certain conditions, group deliberation generates consensus on how a decision problem should be conceptualized: meta-agreement. I assess the latter hypothesis, explain how it can be empirically tested, and cite some evidence consistent with it. My discussion addresses two contexts of democratic decision making: preference aggregation and judgment aggregation...|$|E

When, in 2001, China finally acceded to the World Trade Organization, which included the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), many hoped that China would effectively finally fulfill its international obligations to protect intellectual property rights.

But deliberation can prevent majority cycles – not by inducing unanimity, which is unrealistic, but by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness. We present the first empirical test of this hypothesis, using data from Deliberative Polls. Comparing preferences before and after deliberation, we find increases in proximity to single-peakedness. The increases are greater for lower versus higher salience issues and for individuals {{who seem to have}} deliberated more versus less effectively. They are not merely a byproduct of increased <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> (which in fact does not generally increase). Our results both refine and support the idea that deliberation, by increasing proximity to single-peakedness, provides an escape from the problem of majority cycling...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSoutheast Asia is experiencing tremendous changes both politically and economically. Religious and ethnic issues have increased significantly. The {{move away from}} traditional to modern systems creates a degree of instability, eroding the existing system's socioeconomic and politico-psychological tenets, giving rise to counter-elites and opposition groups, and {{paving the way for}} a resurgence of racial terrorism and ethnic animosities. Although unfamiliar with insurgencies, Southeast Asia, long considered the "Islamic periphery" owing to its moderate Islamic stance, pluralism and nationalism, is facing a more complex challenge. The root causes of terrorism, both domestic and international, are varied and complex. Some factors are essentially ideological and include religious and ethnonationalistic extremism. An adequate response requires counter-terrorist policies to interact with broader foreign policy. To be effective, counter-terrorism demands understanding the terrorist's psychology, motivation and goals. Multilateral diplomatic efforts such as the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) or the ASEAN Regional Forum (AFR) assist in forging <b>substantive</b> <b>agreements</b> that will enhance the sharing of information, tighten border agreements, and reinforce law enforcement cooperation.

30|$|A highly suggestive remark on the {{category}} of sin {{at the close of}} the nineteenth century, these words seem to bear a thick colonial and evangelical missionary experience inflecting them with additional meaning beyond the theological. While one can debate the degree to which Vivekananda’s construal of the doctrine was conditioned by missionaries through whom he and many Indians came into contact with the teaching, neither his speeches nor Lectures on Practical Vedanta offer any clear evidence that he was aware of the connective tissue between sin and grace. In the emphasis he gives to sin as constitutive of persons, of sin as a belief which erects prohibitions and incorrectly binds one down finally against one’s true nature as a creature of God, Swami Vivekananda does not appear aware of the narrative of grace by which sin-talk can be meaningfully Christian. In this disagreement, Swami Vivekananda and the Catholic tradition actually find themselves in <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> despite appearances. For both can agree that the human person is most adequately appreciated and addressed in terms of her nondual “native purity” (Vivekananda) or redetermination by God in Christ (Paul) rather than the distortions and suffering to which she frequently succumbs.|$|E

Significant positive relationships between perceived usefulness, ease of use, and system usage were consistent with previous TAM research. The observed mediating role of perceived usefulness in the relationship between ease of use and usage was also in consonance with earlier findings. The findings are significant because they suggest that the considerable body of previous TAM-related information technology research may be usefully applied to the knowledge management domain to promote further investigation of factors affecting the acceptance and usage of knowledge management information systems such as AGROWIT by farmers, extension workers, and agriculture researchers...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the political-economy literature on environmental treaties. This important but relatively small literature analyzes political and economic determinants of the content of environmental agreements and the pattern of signatories. In general, the literature demonstrates that the nature of the externality addressed, national sovereignty and domestic politics affect the substance of international environmental treaties. Sovereignty implies that international solutions will be voluntary, and that domestic political and environmental considerations ultimately determine which nations sign and implement the treaties developed. The process of negotiation required to realize those mutual advantages provides governments with a sequence of opportunities to sign both symbolic and procedural treaties en route to a <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement.</b> Both the environmental treaties that we observe and statistical evidence on the pattern and timing of signatories suggests that both political and public goods aspects of domestic environmental regulations affect propensities to sign environmental treaties and to adopt the domestic regulations necessary to implement them. For example, democracies are more likely to sign environmental treaties than authoritarian regimes are. Consistent with the theory of the voluntary provision of public goods, international environmental treaties appear to have only modest affects on domestic environmental policies...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of energy issues to sustainable development, energy was a priority issue at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August 2002. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine the outcomes of the Summit on energy, and to assess them against proposals to address the lack of access to modern energy and the need to move toward a cleaner energy system. We find that lack of political leadership from key countries prevented agreement not only on targets for renewable energy, but also on a programme to promote access. The achievements of the Summit were limited to enabling activities such as capacity building and technology transfer, rather than <b>substantive</b> <b>agreements.</b> While WSSD put energy higher on the agenda than before, no institutional home or programme to take the issues forward has emerged. This therefore remains a critical challenge to be addressed. Achieving this broad goal will require building a coalition to promote cleaner energy, and committing resources to programme for energy access. Based on analysis of proposals and the negotiations, we propose several key areas where progress is still possible and necessary, including: shifting more international public and private energy financing toward access investments and cleaner energy investments, advancing regional approaches to access and renewable energy targets, and a range of mechanisms to strengthen institutional capacity for integrating energy and sustainable development...|$|R

The negotiations are being held in Havana, Cuba and followed a pre-negotiation phase, which included {{a year and a}} half of discreet contacts and cofindence building measures as well as six months of secret exploratory talks. The negotiations have already led to three <b>substantive</b> <b>agreements</b> on land reform, political participation and the illegal drugs trade. Three agenda points remain on the rights of the victims of the conflict, the end of the conflict (cease-fire and disarmament) and the implementation of all the agreed points.

40|$|The {{success of}} the GATT/WTO as an {{international}} institution is widely acknowledged. Among multilateral institutions, the GATT/WTO has adopted a distinctive approach to serving as a forum for international negotiation. This approach is based on reciprocal negotiations (over market access) that occur {{on a voluntary basis}} between pairs of countries or among small numbers of countries, and the results of these bilateral negotiations are then “multilateralized ” to the full GATT/WTO membership under the GATT/WTO principle of non-discrimination. In this entry I describe how recent economic research has attempted to understand and interpret these key design features of the GATT/WTO. 1 The GATT was created in 1947, and the WTO came into existence on January 1, 1995, {{as a result of the}} Marrakesh Agreement of April 1994, also known as the WTO Agreement. The WTO Agreement includes the text of GATT. Therefore GATT continues to exist as a <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement,</b> but the WTO Agreement also includes a set of additional agreements that build on and extend GATT principles to new areas. Hoekman and Kosteki (1995) provide an excellent institutional overview of GATT and the WTO. 2 The World Trade Organization (WTO), and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), has in effect served as the constitution of the post-war international trading system. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} 'elite consensus' is pivotal {{to the work}} of John Higley and his associates, but like many key {{political}} concepts its meaning is not precise. Consensus implies broad agreement, but just how much agreement, over what matters, among whom (i. e., who are the relevant elites), and how enduring remain to be specified. Higley et al. recognize these problems, placing their emphasis on procedural rather than <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> and granting that individual cases may lie somewhere on the borderline between elite consensus and disunity. In this essay I explore the consensus issue by examining several cases from East Central Europe and that of Germany {{in the aftermath of the}} fall of Communism. Higley and Burton see especially in the Polish and Hungarian 'roundtables' instances of near-contemporary 'elite settlements. ' But in both cases observers have recently pointed to a degree of political polarization whose intensity seems to call into question the actual achievement of elite consensus and indeed of 'democratic consolidation.

40|$|Content validity, {{the extent}} to which a {{measurement}} reflects the specific intended domain of content, is a basic type of validity for a valid measurement. It was usually examined qualitatively and relied on experts’ subjective judgments, not on respondents’ responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to introduce and demonstrate how to use quantitative methods to examine the content validity for a certain measurement from respondents’ viewpoint with quantitative methods. In the current study, content validity of the WHOQOL-BREF was examined with quantitative methods among 102 undergraduate students and 128 community adults. They were asked to rate the appropriateness of each item with the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF respectively and also asked to sort the items into the four domains. Then, three quantitative methods on examining content validity were applied to analyze the rating and sorting data, including (1) proportion of <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement,</b> (2) substantive validity, and (3) ANOVA approach. These results were used to compare with the original content structure of the WHOQOL-BREF, to see if the original structure is consistent with the structure of subjects’ judgments. The results showed that the content structure gained from appropriateness rating and item sorting was not totally consistent with the original content structure of the WHOQOL-BREF. Among 24 items, 12 items did not have adequate content validity. More discussion on these items and the issue of content validity were further provided...|$|E

Various approaches are assessed in light of the free rider problem and timing concerns. Trade liberalization is the most contentious issue, given the lack of consensus on MFN treatment for non-APEC members, and the unwillingness of some members to engage in formal, comprehensive, and substantive trade negotiations. A new approach to trade liberalization, based on voluntary liberalization and peer group pressure has been proposed, termed "concerted unilateral liberalization. " Whether it will succeed depends on how willing APEC members are to reach <b>substantive,</b> concrete <b>agreements</b> to implement the vision enunciated at Bogor in 1994 of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region by 2010 for developed economy members and by 2020 for the developing members...|$|R

40|$|Michael Oakeshott, in {{his most}} {{developed}} political thought, works {{to account for the}} freedom available in and distinctive to the modern state, as it is found in the model of a civil association. This model accommodates freedom by suggesting that a civil association need not require <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> over policy as long as the agreement about the authority of its practices goes unquestioned. This position, this paper argues, is inconstant since it compels agreement among those who may not recognize the state's authority. While even a limited, liberal regime needs to maintain and possess authority for its rules and procedures, Oakeshott seems to assume that by claiming such authority, a state necessarily has it, since he provides no means for evaluating and judging it. To explore this more thoroughly, this paper will examine one type of political action regarding authority, the example of civil disobedience. For Oakeshott, those who act outside the law are simply criminals or worse rebels. Yet, I argue that one method of identifying and drawing attention to unjust laws or actions by the state is through civil disobedience. This form of political action highlights the dilemma that a liberal state has in recognizing criminal activity as a challenge to its authority, as opposed to merely a sign of the delinquency of the criminal...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} TTIP negotiations and their {{consequences for the}} EU. The degree of attention - academic, political and from the public - has been extraordinary for an agreement which is still in process of negotiation, and that in itself tells us something. The TTIP, and the TTIP negotiations, are indeed significant. In fact, the negotiations themselves have had important consequences, irrespective of whether TTIP is ever finally concluded. If it is concluded, TTIP will be a highly significant agreement for the EU {{and the future of}} its trade policy and perhaps also for the future of multilateral trade (the WTO). If the TTIP fails, that failure and the reasons for it – whether a failure to reach a sufficiently <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement,</b> or a failure to ratify by the European Parliament, or by one or more Member States, or by the US Congress, will also have important consequences for the future of bilateral trade agreements. The TTIP negotiations both demonstrate and are themselves contributing to the changing landscape of EU trade policy. I should like to mention four aspects of this: first putting TTIP into the context of the EU’s trade policy more broadly; second assessing the projected scope of TTIP in terms of its degree of innovation and its sensitivities; third assessing the TTIP in terms of the balance of competence between the EU and its Member States; and fourth looking at innovations in the negotiation process and the roles played by the European Parliament, the Ombudsman and civil society...|$|E

While Pakistan has {{expressed interest in}} another summit, India has been steadfastly holding the position that negotiations will not begin until Pakistan completely stops the proxy war by way of sending armed infiltrators to conduct insurgency in Indian Kashmir. The failure of two past summits [...] Lahore in 1999 and Agra in 2000 [...] to obtain meaningful and long-lasting accords have also made India reluctant to initiate another round of talks without prospects of a concrete agreement in sight. In many respects, Lahore was not a failure as it did produce an agreement between Indian Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee and his then Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. The agreement failed because the Pakistani military, under General Pervez Musharraf, undermined the possibility of its success by launching the Kargil War. The Agra summit failed not because of sentimental reasons or lack of warmth but because the timing was not ripe for a <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement.</b> The parties were holding totally incompatible goals, and they were meeting largely for domestic political reasons and to some extent, because of pressure from the United States.

40|$|International {{antitrust}} {{issues have}} become important in current debates regarding {{international trade and}} international regulation. This Article addresses {{one of the central}} questions about international antitrust – the appropriate forum for negotiations. The Article argues that the combination of domestic antitrust policy and international trade makes a <b>substantive</b> multilateral <b>agreement</b> unlikely unless transfers are made from states that gain from such a deal to those that lose. The Article advocates bringing the issue of international antitrust within the WTO because that forum is the best suited to accommodate such transfers. The experience of efforts to negotiate an agreement in intellectual property (IP) is offered as a demonstration of the advantages offered by the WTO. Like antitrust, the realities of IP made an agreement without transfers virtually impossible. In the case of IP, the difficulty was that developing countries had little to gain from such an agreement. Once negotiations were brought within the WTO, however, an agreement was reached because developing countries were granted trade concessions in exchange for accepting the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement. Like international IP, international antitrust needs to be negotiated in a forum that allows for transfers, making the WTO the best available forum...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand of}} industrialized {{countries}} for a multilateral agreement on investment {{to be negotiated}} under {{the roof of the}} WTO is meeting with considerable resistance on the part of developing countries. The proponents of such a multilateral agreement argue that binding disciplines of capital-importing countries would help reduce uncertainty and, hence, result in more foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. By contrast, the opponents consider such an agreement to be biased in favor of business interests and against the development objectives of Third World economies. It is for various reasons that the case for a multilateral agreement on investment is not compelling: Investment regulations have been liberalized progressively by unilateral measures without multilateral obligations to do so. Moreover, the protection of foreign investors against political risk is fairly advanced given the large number of bilateral and plurilateral investment treaties. A multilateral agreement could reduce FDI-related transaction costs significantly only in the unlikely event that the complex net of existing arrangements would be replaced. A “WTO plus”-type framework appears to be the more realistic outcome of negotiations, with a multilateral agreement defining the smallest common denominator of WTO members and more <b>substantive</b> <b>agreements</b> with limited membership remaining in place. Empirical evidence suggests that WTO negotiations on investment are neither sufficient nor necessary to induce higher FDI flows to developing countries. Transaction-cost-related impediments to FDI have played a minor role in driving FDI, and the absence of a multilateral agreement has not prevented the recent boom of FDI in developing countries. Wishful thinking prevails on the part of developing countries, which insist on preferential treatment with regard to their own obligations as host countries and on binding obligations for foreign investors and their home countries. It is highly questionable whether developing countries could derive more benefits from FDI if a multilateral agreement were to include “development clauses” allowing for flexible and selective approval procedures and performance requirements such as local-content rules. The call for binding rules on the behavior of foreign investors may discourage multinational enterprises from investing in developing countries altogether, instead of fostering transfers of technology and improving the quality of FDI. By insisting on preferential treatment with regard to FDI incentives, developing countries tend to ignore that incentives- based competition for FDI is mainly between themselves. Unless developing countries are prepared to tie their own hands, they cannot reasonably expect significant concessions from industrialized countries. Developing countries will become relevant negotiation partners in the WTO only by offering something on their own. Rather than engaging in a futile attempt to block multilateral negotiations on investment altogether, developing countries should commit themselves to rulebased FDI policies as a negotiating chip. The pressure on industrialized countries to engage in negotiations on labor mobility would mount if developing countries refrained from performance requirements and granted national treatment to foreign investors.

40|$|A central {{problem of}} {{democracy}} is the aggregation of divergent individual inputs into overall collective decisions. Social-choice-theoretic impossibility results famously demonstrate the intractability of a large class of such aggregation problems. This paper develops a taxonomy of two concepts of agreement, <b>agreement</b> at a <b>substantive</b> level and <b>agreement</b> at a meta-level, and discusses the escape-routes these concepts open up from the impossibility problems of social choice. Specifically, two contexts of democratic aggregation are addressed: first, the familiar context of preferences, and second, the largely unexplored context of sets of judgments over multiple interconnected propositions. Drawing on some recent developments in social choice theory and democratic theory, I will defend the view that, when agreement is conceptualized in democratic theory {{and when it is}} sought in democratic practice, more emphasis should be placed on agreement at a meta-level than is commonly done. Finally, I will address the more general question to what extent it is acceptable for the stability of institutions for democratic aggregation to be dependent on specific empirical contingencies. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} book {{entitled}} Pop Internationalism Paul Krugman takes to task several prominent commentators who {{in recent years have}} published works decrying the loss of competitive position of the United States in an increasingly global economy. In particular, Krugman critically considers and rejects several arguments that he considers both wrong and dangerous. Among these are (1) the United States has lost, or {{is in the process of}} losing, its position of global technological leadership; (2) material standards of living in the US are threatened by the country's excessively liberal trade policies as compared with its trade partners; (3) stagnant or declining wages in the US are the result of trade with low wage Third World countries; (4) the US is in need of a new model and a corresponding policy approach that recognizes the changing structure of new global economic forces. The debate over the validity of the above assertions has been largely conducted between adherents of mainstream interpretations of international economic theory and policy. For Krugman the controversies are mostly a matter of a proper understanding of that theory along with an appreciation of the relevant data. The purpose of this paper is to offer an interpretation of the debate from a progressive left perspective. My position is that Krugman's critique of his imagined opponents on most issues is largely overdone and that there is actually <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> among and between these mainstream views on most matters of trade and trade policy. More importantly, however, these same views, including Krugman's, are bounded by assumptions that are not supportable from a progressive left perspective. The title of the paper is an ironic twist on a title of one of Krugman's chapters, 'What do undergrads need to know about trade?'...|$|E
40|$|Spinoza’s legal {{theoretical}} {{ideas are}} based on psychological and sociological regularities in human behaviour of knowledge. His naturalistic and descriptive approach {{of the relationship between}} law and power shows that the exercise of state power on that basis - within the constitutional constraints – may be formally almost unlimited, but, indeed, materially there are limits. The ability of the government to regulate society has its limits which are inherent in the existence of the state. Furthermore, Spinoza. tries to design a system of checks and balances in the distribution of powers between the various public bodies: a dynamic balance of powers. Legal positivism can welcome Spinoza as a kindred spirit – although by no means unconditionally. Effectiveness is a constitutive requirement for positive law. However, effectiveness implies that citizens comply with the (civil) law not only for fear of reprisals, but also out of respect for commonwealth’s authority. Therefore, positive law has {{to take into account the}} interests and moral convictions of the people. With regard the issue of sovereignty, for Spinoza. only a government that embodies the unity of the cooperating citizens has the exclusive (absolute) power to determine the bonum commune. Hence citizens should perceived government as legitimate, which in turn implies that it must strive for peace and security. From this line of argument follows naturally, that the democratic state under the rule of law imposes at least one obligation on both government and citizens: government should permanently create a substantial loyalty of its citizens, on the one hand, but citizens must actively to support the state because of their interest in the existence of the state, on the other hand. In other words, neither party has room for arrogance or permissiveness. In addition, for Spinoza democratic criticism should be based on obedience to the law. As a rule, obedience to the law should not be dependent on the <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> with the law, which actually would undermine the democratic order...|$|E

Experiments demonstrating these effects are legion, suggesting that any number of elements can have determining sway on our behavior, whether it's a simple smile (which can make cooperation among players in strategic games more likely), or the chance finding of a dime in a payphone (which can temporarily increase the probability of the finder acting altruistically), or the presence of unappealing, half-eaten foodstuffs in an experimenter's room (which makes subjects behave moralistically when responding to unrelated experimental questions). Minor details can have major impact on our behavior, and our ignorance of this phenomenon should be of moral concern. This is the focus of my dissertation. In particular, I argue that individuals can often agree or disagree on moral issues not because of the content of their respective beliefs, but rather because of their unawareness of (and thus inattentiveness to) the subtle impact of their immediate environments [...] and their own mannerisms [...] on moral reasoning and conduct. The effects can be considerable: How long we are willing to engage in dialogue; the degree to which we find accommodation to others acceptable; the creativity we deploy in finding mutually agreeable outcomes to problems; the significance we attach to any problems we may have [...] each of these crucial factors in moral deliberation can be affected profoundly by minor variations in our conduct and our situations. Take any social encounter: Even before we share our opinions and engage in serious discussion, we are already signaling various attitudes and even content-rich information about ourselves through cues arising from our facial expressions, posture, tone of voice, forms of address, and other seemingly minor details of our comportment. These cues automatically bias how others interpret our subsequent behavior, and thereby influence how our interactions with others enfold. Attending to such minor details may seem antiquated [...] even priggish [...] from a modern perspective. Yet the influence they exert should caution us against discounting their importance. So I throw my hat in with a philosopher who did not overlook the impact of these variables, and who viewed minding them as a vital source of moral power: Confucius (fl. ca. 6 th century BCE). In the Analects, we find Confucius preoccupied by very minor details of one's mannerisms and their impact on others. This led Confucius to motivate norms of conduct aimed at structuring social exchanges in ways conducive to achieving interpersonal agreement or accommodation. I argue that, for our purposes today, we can reduce his various norms to just two. The first is to 'mind manners' [...] in other words, to be attentive to details of one's own behavior out of consideration of its impact on others; the second is to 'give the benefit of a doubt' [...] to discount the impact of negative first impressions in order to allow for healthy moral relationships to develop. Abiding by these norms can foster a form of ethical bootstrapping [...] that is, lifting or prompting one another towards our joint moral ends. If the social psychological literature is true, then whether or not any individual will be able to meet her ethical aims on any particular occasion will hinge on the actions and manners of her immediate interlocutors, which in turn will hinge on her own. In being mindful of the interconnectedness of our behavior, we not only affect how others react to us, but we also thereby affect the kinds of reactions we face in turn. The bootstrapping is mutual. The deep interconnectedness of our behavior as reflected in experimental social psychology should lead us away from thinking of individuals as trapped by aspects of their psychology and determined to act in fixed ways, come what may. Instead, individuals' behavior is highly malleable; with the right prompts, even the most recalcitrant individuals can be moved in new directions. After all, people can have flourishing or accommodating moral relationships in spite of real differences in their avowed moral commitments, and deleterious or rancorous moral relationships in spite of <b>substantive</b> <b>agreement</b> on big ticket moral items. In pluralistic societies where we expect clashes of norms to occur, it is vital to uncover the conditions propitious to agreement or accommodation not just at a theoretical level but a practical level as well. This begins with what we have most control over: our manners. Dissertatio...|$|E

Scholars have not, however, focused on how states’ expectations about shifting power affect the initial design of international agreements. In this paper, I integrate shifting power into {{an analysis of the}} initial design of both the formal and <b>substantive</b> aspects of <b>agreements.</b> I argue that a state expecting to become more powerful over time incurs an opportunity cost by agreeing to formal provisions that raise the cost of exiting an agreement. Exit costs - which promote the stability of legal rules - have distributional implications. Before joining an agreement, an “ascendant” state will therefore often require either a greater share of the benefits from cooperation, or a reduction in exit costs through the use of formal provisions such as withdrawal clauses, sunset clauses, and provisions affecting the legality of an agreement. I analyze how states determine which concessions to make in order to reach agreement with an ascendant state. This analysis helps explain a number of puzzles in the international legal literature, such as why states with poor compliance rates are sometimes observed to join international agreements at the same or higher rates than states with good compliance rates; why weak agreements often evolve into more constraining agreements; and why multilateral agreements are more likely have low exit costs than bilateral agreements...|$|R
40|$|The {{work of a}} {{legal system}} is merely inseparable with the {{influence}} of a legal culture, that values, hopes and attitudes from which a social force is being composed. In accordance to those, the practice of loan agreement at Bank Bukopin Boyolali, can be seen through the customers, legal culture as to that of the state of customers' legal knowledge. What is meant here is that by knowing the two aspects, an overview on the role of customers' ability to understand the <b>substantive</b> of the <b>agreement</b> and the role of customers legal culture might enhance a positive lega culture reflected within the customers' obedience attitude towards the agreement. The research held for this thesis was based on the qualitative method by using the approach of sosio legal research. In relation to those, the chosen strategy was the micro sociology — qualitative — inductive — explanatory. Through those research system, such a role disability in form of forming a positive legal culture dealing with the work of loan agreement at Bank Bukopin Boyolali, simply comes up and even vicious. The existing role disability is at the very first place simply caused by the lack of understanding on legal knowledge within the customers' mind. Consequently, {{it has something to do}} with the degree of understanding the substantive oh the loan agreement itself. Secondly, surch role disability was as well caused by the existing culture of ewuh pakewuh (Javanese Term) within the life of the customers. Too, a state of misperception on the disperformance contributes to such existence. Being late in paying the debt, interest, and penalty by the customers are all seen to be the matters that must be tolerate by the bank. Developing the legal knowledge at the side of the customers is then considered to be the prior matter to be arranged in order to shape such a positive legal culture in the work of loan agreement. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of unconscionability, which a court may invoke to invalidate a contract, has a nonsubstantive and a substantive branch. Nonsubstantive unconscionability arises when certain factors, {{such as a}} lack of commercial sophistication, apparently prevent a contracting party from exercising his freedom to choose the terms of an <b>agreement.</b> <b>Substantive</b> unconscionability arises when a contract yields a result that affects a contracting party too harshly or that affects a noncontracting party adversely. Such contracts may include an agreement containing a disclaimer of warranties or an assignment of wages. These two branches of unconscionability hereinafter are labeled 2 ̆ 2 nonsubstantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections and 2 ̆ 2 substantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections, respectively. This article explores the nonsubstantive objections to the enforcement of a contract. These objections fall into four categories. The first category, poverty, involves those situations where a poor consumer, although he would prefer not to bear certain risks under a contract, can afford only with great difficulty an agreement that allocates these risks to the seller. The second category, market unresponsiveness, comprises two possible restrictions upon a contracting party 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of choice. First, a buyer accepting a standardized agreement may have to take terms that do not reflect his true preferences because the additional cost of particularizing the contract would exceed the additional benefit that he would derive from an individualized agreement. Second, a seller exercising monopoly power may offer a buyer fewer choices than would exist in a competitive market. The third category of nonsubstantive unconscionability, incompetency, addresses the problem of a buyer who may be too unsophisticated or too inept to make contracts that fully satisfy his preferences. The fourth category, lack of information, involves those situations where a contracting party lacks the information to make his preferences and purchases congruent, either because the information is unavailable or because the cost of finding and absorbing it exceeds, at the margin, the value of the information...|$|R
