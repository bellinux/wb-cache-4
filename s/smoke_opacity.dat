While the electronic fuel control has been extensively developed and used in the common rail injection systems, the “in-air cylinders filling ” control remains poorly exploited. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic engine optimization process that predicts, under transient conditions, the optimal values of the intake pressure and the compressor mass flow rate to be applied to the engine based on pollution criteria such as the opacity. The optimization procedure and a physical mean value model describing the functioning of a variable geometry turbocharged diesel engine and its <b>smoke’s</b> <b>opacity</b> are shown in details.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} fuel dose division in the Diesel engine on <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> and composition of the emitted exhaust gas. The research activities reported in the article include experimental examination of a small Diesel engine with Common Rail type supply system. The tests were performed on the engine test bed equipped with an automatic data acquisition system which recorded all basic operating and control parameters of the engine, and <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> and composition of the exhaust gas. The parameters measured during the engine tests also included the indicated pressure and the acoustic pressure. The tests were performed following the pre-established procedure in which 9 engine operation points were defined for three rotational speeds: 1500, 2500 and 3500 rpm, and three load levels: 25, 40 and 75 Nm. At each point, the measurements were performed for 7 different forms of fuel dose injection, which were: the undivided dose, the dose divided into two or three parts, and three different injection advance angles for the undivided dose and that divided into two parts. The discussion of the obtained results includes graphical presentation of contests of hydrocarbons, carbon oxide, and nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and its <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity.</b> The presented analyses referred to two selected cases, out of nine examined engine operation points. In these cases the fuel dose was divided into three parts and injected at the factory set control parameters. The examination has revealed a significant effect of fuel dose division on the engine efficiency, and on the <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> and composition of the exhaust gas, in particular the content of nitrogen oxides. Within the range of low loads and rotational speeds, dividing the fuel dose into three parts clearly improves the overall engine efficiency and significantly decreases the concentration of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas. Moreover, it slightly decreases the contents of hydrocarbons and carbon oxide. In the experiment the contents of nitrogen oxides markedly increased with the increasing injection advance angle for the undivided dose and that divided into two parts. This, in turn, led to the decrease {{of the contents of}} hydrocarbons and carbon oxide. Fuel dose division into two and three parts leads to the increase of <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> of the exhaust gas, compared to the undivided dose...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} kinds of biodiesel blended with baseline diesel fuel in 50 % v/v were tested in a Cummins 4 BTA direct injection diesel engine, with a turbocharger and an intercooler. Experiments were conducted under five engine loads of two steady speeds. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the effects of fatty ester composition in the particulate emission of biodiesel from different feedstocks. The <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> of SME 50 (Soybean oil methyl ester) is higher than that of RME 50 (Rapeseed oil methyl ester) and PME 50 (Palm oil methyl ester). There is no obvious relationship between total unsaturate fraction and <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity,</b> while <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity</b> is linear with polyunsaturate fraction of fuel at all test modes, which means that the unsaturated ester with two or three double bonds have greater influence in smoke formation than the counterpart with only one double bond. The SOF (soluble organic fraction) proportion of RME 50, PME 50 and SME 50 is 5 times or 4 times larger than that of diesel fuel and ultra-low-sulfur diesel respectively. The overall sequence of SOF is PME 50 >SME 50 >RME 50. SOF fraction is linear with saturate fraction of fuel at all test modes. PME 50 has higher nucleation particle number concentration than that of RME 50 and SME 50. Same with SOF, the increase in total nucleation number concentration depends on saturate fraction of fuel at all test modes. Thus, the feedstocks and composition of biodiesel could be selected and optimized during production process in order to improve the emission conditions of biodiesel.

The effect of water injection by a water mist nozzle and a sprinkler device was investigated. Radiation attenuation in the infrared range and opacity in the visible range were measured, by using a FTIR spectrometer and a dedicated opacimetry device especially designed for the present application. Experiments were done using either a blackbody source for attenuation characterization, or a heptane pool fire aimed at producing <b>smoke</b> for <b>opacity</b> measurements. For tests with smoke, the difficulties raised by the harsh environment involving a hot mixing of gas plus soot and vapor carrying water droplets were circumvented with an original device involving an optical fiber network. Mean infrared transmission was found equal to 12 % for the water mist (with a 25 L/min water flowrate) and 37 % for the sprinkler (with a 91 L/min water flowrate). Fitting the infrared transmission spectra with results obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation provided an estimation of the water volumetric fraction in the spray. It was shown that the better attenuation capability of the water mist is due to two factors: (1) a higher extinction coefficient of the water mist for a given water volumetric fraction due to {{the small size of}} the injected droplets and (2) a higher water volumetric fraction. Opacity measurements in the visible range yielded a measured extinction coefficient in good agreement with an estimation obtained with the Mie theory and the identified water volumetric fraction. Moreover, the water sprays (sprinkler or water mist) was seen to lead to a quick de-stratification of the smoke layer. When the spraying operation was stopped, the visibility re-increased in two main steps: a first step of fast increase and a second step of slow increase needing a few tens of seconds to get again a fully stratified smoke layer...|$|R

The idea is to develop a similar method based on the same physical and chemical principles at the bottom of any dyeing processes and of the current. and already consolidated, chemical finishing treatments. In order to introduce this type of approach. nanotechnology is applied. In particular, the introduction of nanoparticles into the textile is done by the immersion of the fabrics into an aqueous nanoparticle solution, followed by the tinal fixation of the nanoparticles through thermal treatment. The textile material put in contact with the dispersion of nanoparticles absorbs them and, because of the formation of various types of bindings according to both the fiber typology and the nanoparticles, prevents any following release. Cotton, polyester and a blend of them are used. The action mechanism is very similar to the dyes and chemical behavior: {{in the case of the}} cotton, by formation of a chemical bond among the cellulose and the nanoparticles; in the case of the polyester by adhesion of nanoparticles on the polymer surface, after fixation using either thermal or coating treatment.

From the experimental investigation, the safflower diesel blends show better performance and lower smoke when compared to diesel. With blend B 20 the thermal efficiency is increased by 5. 2 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{experimentally}} investigate the effects of HPM and diesel fuel blends on the performance and emissions of a diesel engine. The considered parameters are torque, brake power, speciﬁc fuel consumption and thermal efﬁciency as well as <b>smoke</b> <b>opacity.</b> A four-stroke water cooled direct injection (DI) diesel engine with naturally aspirated, Isuzu 4 JB 1, combined with cooled EGR system was used for conducting test with HPM-diesel blended fuels with ratio 0 / 100, 5 / 95, 10 / 90, and 15 / 85 on volume basis at the variation of engine loads in the range of 25...|$|E
