40|$|All these {{findings}} {{can help us}} to elucidate the mechanisms for the fish to detect changing osmotic conditions and transform signals to osmoregulatory responses. In {{the first part of}} the study, PRL and PRL-releasing peptide (PrRP) cDNAs have been isolated from euryhaline <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream.</b> The PRL cDNA consists of 1360 bp encoding 212 amino acids whereas the PrRP cDNA contains 631 bp encoding prepro-PrRP with 122 amino acids. PRL mRNA was uniquely expressed in sea bream pituitary but PrRP mRNA was expressed in a variety of tissues. Expression levels of both PRL and PrRP mRNA have been examined in sea bream adapted to different salinities (0, 6, 12, 33 and 50 ppt). In pituitary, both PRL and PrRP mRNA were synchronized in their expression, being significantly higher in fish adapted to low salinities (0 and 6 ppt), but the expression profile of hypothalamic PrRP in different salinities was different. These data suggested that PrRP may possibly act as a local modulator in pituitary rather than a hypothalamic factor for regulating pituitary PRL expression in <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream.</b> In the second part of the study, <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> abruptly transferred from 33 to 6 ppt exhibited a remarkable pituitary PRL secretion following closely with the temporal changes in serum osmolality and ion levels. In order to investigate the direct effect of extracellular osmolality to pituitary PRL secretion, sea bream pituitary cells were dispersed and exposed to a medium with reduced ion levels and osmolality. PRL released from pituitary cells was found to be significantly elevated. In hyposmotic exposed anterior pituitary cells, cell volume exhibited a 20 % increase when exposed to a medium with a 20 % decrease in osmolality. These enlarged pituitary cells did not shrink until the surrounding hyposmotic medium was replaced, a phenomenon suggesting an osmosensing ability of <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> PRL cells for PRL secretion in response to a change in extracellular osmotic pressure. In the third part, olfactory rosette in the nasal cavity was surgically removed from <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> adapted to 6 ppt and 33 ppt and mRNA expression of PRL and PrRP in <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> were measured. The elevated pituitary PRL and PrRP mRNA expression levels as seen in 6 ppt-adapted fish were abolished by this olfactory lamellectomy. On the other hand, hypothalamic PrRP mRNA expression in 6 ppt-adapted fish did not change but those in 33 ppt-adapted fish increase significantly after olfactory lamellectomy. These data suggest a possible osmosensing role of the olfactory system for regulation of PRL expression during hypo-osmotic acclimation of the fish. Besides, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) was cloned and its mRNA expression in olfactory system, as shown in other fish species previously, was investigated. However, no CaSR expression could be detected in olfactory rosette and nerve but its expression was demonstrated in osmoregulatory tissues and brain. There was no significant difference in CaSR mRNA expression in pituitary, kidney and anterior intestine of fish adapted to different salinities. These studies could not provide conclusive evidence to correlate CaSR with osmosensing in <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream.</b> The present study used <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Sparus sarba) as a euryhaline fish model to investigate the regulation of prolactin (PRL) expression and secretion in fish adapted to different salinities.

40|$|In {{the second}} part of our study, cDNA of AQP- 1 and pro-vasotocin were cloned from the <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream.</b> An AQP- 1 full clone was {{isolated}} from kidney and intestine and it consists of 904 bp with an open reading frame of 774 bp. The deduced amino sequence of sea bream AQP- 1 shares highest identity with AQP- 1 a of gilthead sea bream (97. 7 %) and AQP- 1 a of other fish species (83. 6 % to 95. 8 %), however, considerably low identity was found between the <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> AQP- 1 and AQP- 1 b of gilthead sea bream (56 %). The <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> AQP- 1 possesses basic features of a functional aquaporin and AQP- 1, which includes two channel-forming asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) signature motifs, six transmembrane domains, residues of the pore-forming region and a potential mercurial inhibiting site (Cys- 178). The water channel was ubiquitously expressed in gills, liver, intestine, rectum, kidney, heart, urinary bladder and blood cells. A partial fragment of pro-vasotocin was isolated from hypothalamus of <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> and consists of 184 bp, including encoding regions for the processing and amidation signal, vasotocin hormone and part of the neurophysin. Lastly, single doses of cortisol (50 microg/g tissue) or vasotocin (1 microg/g tissue) were administered to seawater-acclimated sea bream with further three-day stabilizing period in seawater followed by an abrupt 6 ‰ exposure or administered to seawater transfer controls for three days. Cortisol markedly stimulated intestinal expression of AQP- 1 in both the seawater transfer control and abrupt 6 ‰ transfer groups. Vasotocin treatment did not significantly modify AQP- 1 expression in all tested organs. Hypothalamic pro-vasotocin expression levels were similar among different treatment groups. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used for studying the effect of salinity and hormones on expression of AQP- 1 and pro-vasotocin. In the long-term salinity acclimation experiment, the sea bream were acclimated to six different salinity regimes (0 ‰, 6 ‰, 12 ‰, 33 ‰, 50 ‰, 70 ‰) for four weeks. The abundance of AQP- 1 transcript was the highest in intestine of 70 ‰-acclimated fish among different salinity groups and there was also a statistically significant increase in 12 ‰-acclimated fish. Branchial AQP- 1 expression was significantly upregulated in sea bream acclimated to freshwater. In contrast, the hypothalamic pro-vasotocin expression was significantly downregulated during freshwater acclimation. In addition, the sea bream were also subjected to an abrupt 6 %o transfer at different time intervals (2, 6, 12, 72 and 168 hours). RT-PCR analysis revealed there was a transient decrease in branchial AQP- 1 expression two hours after abrupt hypo-osmotic exposure and the expression levels subsequently returned to the seawater control levels. The expression levels of hypothalamic pro-vasotocin were not significantly altered by the abrupt exposure treatment. The present experiments investigated the effects of salinity and hormones on the relative expression of hypothalamic pro-vasotocin, and aquaporin- 1 (AQP- 1) in intestine, gills and kidney of the <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> Sparus sarba. With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, immunoreactivity of AQP- 1 was detected at the basal side of enterocytes and gill chloride cells, and at the apical brush border of kidney tubules whereas AQP- 3 was only localized in similar positions in the gills and intestines. AQP- 1 was relatively more ubiquitous than AQP- 3 and was localized with same cell types as the electrogenic Na+-K+-ATPase in gills and kidney. The present study had demonstrated the responsiveness of intestinal and branchial AQP- 1 expressions of the <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> to environmental salinity perturbations. Further to this, cortisol was observed to upregulate the transcription of AQP- 1 in the intestine. Pro-vasotocin expression was altered by long-term salinity adaptation, however, the linkage of this alteration to AQP- 1 functioning in different osmoregulatory organs is yet to be elucidated.

Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of chronic salinity acclimation, abrupt salinity transfer and cortisol administration on aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) expression in gill, intestine and kidney of <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Sparus sarba). An AQP 1 a cDNA was cloned and found to share 83 – 96 % amino acid sequence identity with AQP 1 genes from several fish species. Tissue distribution studies of AQP 1 a mRNA demonstrated that it was expressed in gill, liver, intestine, rectum, kidney, heart, urinary bladder and whole blood. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR {{analysis was used to}} measure AQP 1 a transcript abundance in sea bream that were acclimated to salinity conditions of 0, 6, 12, 33, 50 and 70 ppt for 1 month. The abundance of gill AQP 1 a transcript was highest in sea bream acclimated to 0 ppt whereas no differences were found among 0 – 50 ppt groups. For intestine, the highest AQP 1 a transcript amounts were found in sea bream acclimated to 12 and 70 ppt whereas the transcript abundance of kidney AQP 1 a was found to be unchanged amongst the different salinity groups. To investigate the effects of acute salinity alterations on AQP 1 a expression, sea bream were abruptly transferred from 33 ppt to 6 ppt. For intestine AQP 1 a levels were altered at different times, post transfer, but remained unchanged in gill and kidney. To study the effects of cortisol on AQP 1 a expression, sea bream were administered a single dose of cortisol followed by a 3 day acclimation to either 33 ppt or 6 ppt. The findings from this experiment demonstrated that cortisol administration resulted in alterations of AQP 1 a transcript in gill and intestine but not in kidney...|$|R

40|$|Also, the branchial hsp 70 {{levels in}} fish {{following}} chronic salinity acclimation and abrupt hypo-osmotic exposure to 6 ppt were assessed by Western blotting. Upon chronic salinity acclimation, the lowest branchial hsp 70 level {{was found in}} fish cultured in an iso-osmotic salinity of 12 ppt and the highest was in 50 ppt and 6 ppt environments. Freshwater acclimation resulted in return to lower hsp 70 level. The results indicated that iso-osmotic salinity would bring about the least stress level while 50 ppt and 6 ppt were the most stressful salinities to Sparus sarba as indicated by using hsp 70 expression as a biomarker of stress. Compared to 50 ppt and 6 ppt, the stress level of fish in fresh water was lower. On the other hand, Sparus sarba exhibited {{a significant increase in}} branchial hsp 70 level immediately after abrupt hypo-osmotic exposure to 6 ppt when compared with seawater fish sampled at the same time point and increased hsp 70 level was sustained throughout the sampling period, indicating the exposure was stressful to the fish. In the present study, pituitary and serum levels of prolactin in a marine teleost, Sparus sarba, chronically acclimated to various salinities: fresh water (0 ppt), hypo-osmotic (6 ppt), iso-osmotic (12 ppt), normal seawater (33 ppt) and hypersaline (50 ppt) or abruptly exposed to a hypo-osmotic environment of 6 ppt were quantified by the developed peptide-based indirect ELISAs. Progressive increases in pituitary and serum prolactin were found as chronic salinity acclimation progressed from seawater to fresh water. Also, prolactin secretion was immediately induced by abrupt hypo-osmotic exposure to 6 ppt and remained significantly elevated up to 5 days post-exposure to 6 ppt. The results underline the importance of prolactin in marine teleosts kept in fresh water or waters of low salinity. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in pituitary prolactin during the course of the abrupt hypo-osmotic exposure experiment. The results may indicate that prolactin might be secreted rapidly from pituitary in large quantities to cope with abrupt exposure to a low-salinity environment. In the present study, the effects of pharmacological drugs on prolactin levels in pituitary and serum of Sparus sarba were investigated. An increase in prolactin synthesis and release but a decrease in branchial hsp 70 expression were found after treatment with sulpiride, a DA-D 2 receptor antagonist. In contrast, a reduction in prolactin levels in pituitary and serum but an elevation in hsp 70 level in gill were observed following administration of bromocriptine, a DA-D 2 receptor agonist. Since hsp 70 expression indicates the stress levels, the results of these studies supported the notion that increased prolactin synthesis and release might be related to a reduced stress state and prolactin might have a protective effect on stress tolerance in fish. Lastly, the role of prolactin in regulating apoptosis in Sparus sarba branchial cells was examined. Successful induction of apoptosis was indicated by an increase in the apoptotic parameter caspase- 3 activity in primary cultures of Sparus sarba branchial cells treated with camptothecin, a specific inducer of apoptosis. In this study, prolactin was shown to be anti-apoptotic in Sparus sarba branchial cells as co-treatment with ovine prolactin (oPRL) and camptothecin has been observed to attenuate the elevated caspase- 3 activity in gill cell primary cultures. Also, prolactin was found to protect the branchial cells from apoptosis by maintaining the hsp 70 level in the cells treated with camptothecin. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the roles of prolactin in salinity adaptation, hsp 70 expression and apoptosis in <b>silver</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Spaurs sarba). Firstly, specific peptide-based indirect ELISAs were developed for pituitary and serum prolactin of Sparus sarba. These assays had been validated by parallelism between the dilution response curves using serially diluted pituitary homogenate and serum sample with the standard curves of the synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence of black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii) prolactin.

50|$|The {{common bream}} {{can easily be}} {{confused}} with the silver or white bream (Blicca bjoerkna), in particular at the younger stages (see picture). The most reliable method of distinguishing these species is by counting the scales in a straight line downwards from the first ray of the dorsal fin to the lateral line. <b>Silver</b> <b>bream</b> have fewer than 10 rows of scales, while common bream have 11 or more. At the adult stage the reddish tint of the pectoral fin of the <b>silver</b> <b>bream</b> is diagnostic. Like other Cyprinidae, common bream can easily hybridise with other species, and hybrids with roach (Rutilus rutilus) can be very difficult to distinguish from pure-bred bream.|$|E
