50|$|However, {{there is}} no clear {{procedure}} for a declaration of incapacity other than the self declared incapacity; thus if the President were to fall under a severe illness, and refused or were unable to sign a message to Congress spontaneously declaring his incapacity, {{there is no}} straightforward constitutional provision specifying the procedure required for the presidential impediment to be recognized. It is speculated that, if an incapacity were to exist, and if no spontaneous <b>self</b> <b>declaration</b> took place, it would fall to Congress to recognize such incapacity, but no procedure or quorum is clearly established.|$|E
50|$|The FSI grants a {{baseline}} protection certificate as confirmation {{for the successful}} implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, {{this is based on}} <b>self</b> <b>declaration.</b> In stage 3, an independent, FSI-licensed auditor completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. ISO/IEC 27001 certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of BS 7799-2). This process is based on the new FSI security standards. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the BS 7799-2 standard are obliged to carry out a risk assessment. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the protection needs analysis pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict FSI, but also attainment of BS 7799-2 certification. Beyond this, the FSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the GSTOOL.|$|E

Attempts have been made to introduce the Albanian language in schooling, though these endevours were not widely supported in Labuništa.|$|R
50|$|The village {{population}} {{consists of}} a traditionally Muslim Macedonian speaking population that is surrounded by Muslim Albanian villages. Part {{of the population is}} Albanian. Common language and origin with Macedonian Christians does not play a role for a majority of Macedonian Muslims regarding self identification which is based on common religion (Islam) that in Bačišta has led to <b>self</b> <b>declarations</b> of being Albanian. In the 1990s parents from Bačišta refused {{to send their children to}} the local village Macedonian language school and the introduction of Albanian schooling was attempted. Inhabitants of Bačišta have claimed to be Macedonianized Albanians. Blame on the linguistic and identity shift in the 1990s regarding Bačišta has been placed on the Albanian political party, the PDP and its Kičevo branch however the village has been neglected economically and developmentally over time. In 1992 Albanian schooling until the 8th grade was introduced in Bačišta.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2009, Gormley {{introduced}} Non Principal Private Residence tax (NPPR), a tax {{on second}} homes and holiday homes, {{many of which were}} owned by people working abroad. It was a <b>self</b> <b>declaration</b> tax with no bills being issued to property owners, leaving many caught unaware. The scheme was abandoned in 2014 with first and final bills/letters being issued to home owners. Severe penalties were attached to these letters, a late payment charge which amounted to 600 per cent of the premium (€1,000). [...] In 2014 home owners, of which a significant number were non-resident in Ireland, were facing NPPR penalties up to €7,230 which remains as a permanent charge on the property until fully paid. There was uproar {{about the size of the}} penalties, especially from people who live overseas [...] and who say they knew nothing about the NPPR charge until they got these letters. Many feel the 600 per cent penalty charge to be unconstitutional and some have taken their case to the Ombudsman.|$|E
50|$|In early April 2015, Malta adopted {{what some}} have {{declared}} as a groundbreaking bill in Parliament titled the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act' (GIGESC Bill). The bill allows minors {{to have their}} parents apply to have their legal gender marker changed for them or to have a gender marker held from their birth certificate until their gender identity has been self-determined. The bill also prevents surgeries from being performed on intersex infants until their gender identity has been discovered; the parents are no longer required to make an immediate decision and medical personnel cannot override this decision because the bill also outlaws the request to view medical records. For individuals who {{are no longer a}} minor, they only need to request a notary for <b>self</b> <b>declaration,</b> again the individual cannot be asked for medical records when changing their legal gender or performing any other legal changes in conjunction to their gender identity. Also, the entire process can be completed in less than thirty days. In order to continue Malta's progress in LGBT protections and rights, the government has set up a council called the LGBTIQ Consultative Council, this action shows their commitment and dedication to actually enforcing the Bill. While there are other European countries who have created allowances and encouraged acceptance of transgender individuals, most require compulsory sterilization and have lengthy legal proceedings.|$|E
40|$|ISO 14001 {{was issued}} in 1996 and local governments, {{schools and other}} various {{institutions}} as well as enterprises have attained international standards of certifications of ISO 14001. However, in Japan, local governments have increasingly discontinued ISO 14001 registration. In this study, we surveyed all local governments that have discontinued ISO 14001 registration. The results of the survey revealed the following reasons for discontinuing ISO 14001 registration: (1) Cost of assessment is high, (2) ISO 14001 registration requires more time and trouble than other Environment Management Systems (EMS), and (3) There is no benefit from the assessment of ISO 14001. After discontinuing ISO 14001 registration, the local governments are either: (1) using ISO 14001 on their own <b>self</b> <b>declaration,</b> (2) using another EMS, or (3) using their own EMS...|$|E
2500|$|Sputnik Music {{said about}} the song {{in a review of}} The Downward Spiral, declaring that [...] "'Mr. <b>Self</b> Destructs cryptic <b>declarations</b> of the many addictions we seem to openly enjoy are jarringly poetic, and its {{blistering}} chainsaw guitars and machine gun drum loops are an outstanding example of how aggressive yet tuneful industrial music can be." [...] Rolling Stone was also positive towards [...] "Mr. Self Destruct", saying that the song [...] "the soft passages are soft chiefly in the sense of not being loud, as if there were a really great party down the street that you were wimping out on, pumped guitars and cranking boom-thwack drum machines and what not. But almost as soon as you rush to your pre-amp and squeeze in more juice, the loud comes back in, but so unimaginably loud this time that you think your speaker coils might melt, and old man Reilly in the next apartment has already started to bang his broomstick on the wall." [...] "Mr. Self Destruct" [...] was remixed five times for Further Down the Spiral (1995), including a re-work partially produced by Aphex Twin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} ULT began with Robert Crosbie coming {{in contact with}} H.P. Blavatsky in 1887 and his {{subsequent}} association with the Theosophical Society or TS in Boston. Based on H.P. Blavatsky's instructions, he placed himself under the direct guidance of W.Q. Judge. Following {{the death of the}} original founders of the movement, Robert Crosbie was witness to the ensuing rivalries around [...] "leadership", [...] "authority" [...] and [...] "succession" [...] surrounding Katherine Tingley, who headed the American section and Annie Besant, who headed the international section from India. Initially, Robert Crosbie gave his support to Katherine Tingley and went to Point Loma in 1900 to be of assistance there. However, by 1904, he felt the original teachings of Theosophy were almost completely eclipsed by Katherine Tingley's sensational programs. Convinced that further effort was futile, he quietly left Point Loma and moved to Los Angeles. By February 1909, he had gathered around him seven individuals as part of a study group, four of whom were new to Theosophy. This nucleus, under Robert Crosbie's guidance, set to the task of restoring Theosophy along the original lines of its founders without organizational distractions. In the meantime, the original 1888 version of The Secret Doctrine was out of print and replaced by Annie Besant's [...] "Third and Revised Edition". This edition was found to contain tens of thousands of alterations and major distortions. This and other material which diverged significantly from H.P. Blavatsky's original presentation was denominated Neo-Theosophy. Robert Crosbie denounced Neo-Theosophy and considered it along with other leadership claims and rivalries in the Theosophical Society {{to be the result of}} the accentuation of personality, in the Theosophical sense of the lower or illusionary <b>self.</b> Hence the <b>Declaration</b> of the ULT was drawn to emphasize an impersonal, self-reliant, non-hierarchical, non-organizational spirit and loyalty to the original founders and their unaltered message.|$|R
40|$|In the {{physical}} world we have well-established mechanisms for keeping children out of adult-only areas. In the virtual world this is generally replaced by <b>self</b> <b>declaration.</b> Some service providers resort to using heavy-weight identification mechanisms, judging adulthood as a side effect thereof. Collection of identification data arguably constitutes an unwarranted privacy invasion in this context, if carried out merely to perform adulthood estimation. This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult's more extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood {{that they will be}} able to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict that the user was a child 99 % of the time. Unfortunately the scheme also misclassified too many adults. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Sickness {{certification}} is {{a routine}} task {{of primary care}} (PC) physicians which {{has an impact on}} patients' health, the health care system and the economy. As sickness certification is poorly studied, we quantified sickness certification and explored qualitatively the sickness certification process by Swiss PC physicians. PC physicians participating in the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network (SSSN) recorded the frequency and duration of absence from work of each related consultation and certificate during 2005. Patients' age and gender, reason for sick leave, psychosocial cofactors, problems at the workplace, type of employment, type of occupation, duration of absence (weeks) and type of certificate were registered. Physicians' views on the procedure and their suggestions for change were gathered before and after the study by means of a questionnaire containing four open-ended questions. Of the 223 SSSN physicians 73 % participated. A total of 24, 676 forms issued by 150 physicians were analysed. An average of four certificates was issued per 100 consultations; somewhat fewer by internists than by general practitioners and less in rural areas than urban areas. Psychosocial or work-related factors were mentioned in 20 % of the certificates and were more often associated with longer absences from work. These factors were seen as inseparable from the somatic factors. Recommendations for change included the prolongation of <b>self</b> <b>declaration</b> time, a uniform declaration form, availability of an authority to which complex cases can be referred and the use of case management models. Sickness certificates were issued in 4 % of GP consultations. This task has been assessed by physicians as part of their function. The certification process should be improved through better coordination and communication between all parties involved: patients, employers, insurers, physicians and politicians...|$|E
