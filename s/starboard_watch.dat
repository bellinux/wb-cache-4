6000|$|A {{specimen}} of nautical oratory—Criticisms of the sailors—The [...] <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> {{are given a}} holiday—The escape to the mountains.|$|E
6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> were mustered upon the quarter-deck, and our worthy captain, {{standing}} in the cabin gangway, harangued us as follows:— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, boatswain, put the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> {{into the}} boats; lower the two ship's boats also--we will {{get as many}} oars to work as {{possible}} till daylight." ...|$|E
50|$|On board, Moshulu was captained by Captain Mikael Sjögren, {{with a crew}} of twenty-eight, {{including}} officers, cook, steward etc. The work {{of handling}} large acreages of sail was very heavy, even for men and boys with strong constitutions. Bending {{a complete set of}} fair-weather canvas was no easy job, and sail changing was always done four times on a voyage as a ship entered and left the Trade Winds. In one period of twenty-four hours when the Pampero (a wind off the east coast of South America) was blowing, the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>watches,</b> eight men to a watch, took in, re-set, took and re-set again twenty-eight sails, the heaviest of which weighed 11/2 tons - a total of 112 operations.|$|R
50|$|Moshulu, {{like all}} grain ships, was lightly manned; during Newby's {{time on the}} ship the total crew {{numbered}} only 28, including 4 officers, the cook, the steward, and 8 sailors {{in each of the}} port and <b>starboard</b> <b>watches.</b> Routine tasks such as wearing the ship required every crew member to be involved, meaning lost sleep for the free watch. If a sailor became ill or injured, chances were slim that he would receive treatment ashore, especially since Moshulu made no stops between Europe and Australia during Newby's voyage. When a man like Newby applied for a position in the crew, an officer had him climb {{to the top of the}} mainmast, pointing out that at sea, he might have to climb it while it was swaying wildly. For many applicants that was enough; they were never seen again.|$|R
60|$|About midnight of the 19th {{the change}} to the fore-tank was made, and nearly every soul in the ship turned out to see it. The moon was {{partially}} obscured, but darkness was made visible by a row of lanterns hung at short intervals along the trough through which the cable was to be passed, making the ship look inconceivably long. As Robin Wright hurried along the deck he observed that both port and <b>starboard</b> <b>watches</b> were on duty, hid in the deep shadow of the wheels, or standing by the bulwark, ready for action. Traversing {{the entire length of}} the deck-- past the houses of the sheep and pigs; past the great life-boats; past the half-closed door of the testing-room, where the operators maintained their unceasing watch in a flood of light; past the captain's cabin, a species of land-mark or half-way house; past a group of cows and goats lying on the deck chewing the cud peacefully, and past offices and deck-cabins too numerous to mention,--he came at last to the fore-tank, which was so full of cable that the hands ready to act, and standing on the upper coil, had to stoop to save their heads from the deck above.|$|R
6000|$|About midnight, {{when the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> to which, I belonged, was below, the boatswain's whistle was heard, {{followed}} by the shrill cry of [...] "All hands take in sail! jump, men, and save ship!" ...|$|E
60|$|With a {{rattling}} song the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> bent {{to their}} work and hove the cable short, then got the anchor home, and our bark moved off with a stately stride, and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour.|$|E
60|$|The mystery thickened. On Thursday two {{men of the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> were {{reported}} missing. On Friday the carpenter's assistant disappeared. On the night of Saturday a circumstance occurred which, slight as it was, gave me some {{clue as to what}} was happening.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on a}} fine calm morning, {{just after}} breakfast, that we fell in with this ship. We had seen no whales {{for a day or}} two, but we did not mind that, for our hold was almost full of oil-barrels. Tom Lokins and I were leaning over the <b>starboard</b> bulwarks, <b>watching</b> the small fish that every now and then darted through the clear-blue water like arrows, and smoking our pipes in silence. Tom looked uncommonly grave, and I knew that he was having some deep and knowing {{thoughts}} of his own, which would leak out in time. All at once he took his pipe from his mouth and stared earnestly at the horizon.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{traditional}} Royal Navy watch system (a system used by most other Commonwealth navies), 'watch' {{refers to a}} period of time and to a grouping of personnel. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day - known as 'watch-keepers' - are assigned to one of two watches: the Starboard or the Port watch. These can be further divided into two parts, e.g. First Port, Second <b>Starboard.</b> These two <b>watches</b> - or more usually the four parts of watches - alternate in working the following watches: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} of these last manoeuvres had somewhat {{interfered with the}} watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung {{over my head and}} stood craning over the <b>starboard</b> bulwarks and <b>watching</b> the ripples spreading wide before the bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked round, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in his right hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Mr. Blagrove, I {{think that}} you are right. I will {{put you in the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>watch.</b> I am sure that Mr. Bonnor, the third lieutenant, will be glad to keep a special eye on you. Do you {{understand}} anything about handling a boat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll get {{it worse}} when we {{open up the}} Arenas bight," [...] said Jake as {{he glanced at the}} lurching tug. [...] "It looks as if the skipper meant to give the reef a wide berth. He's {{swinging}} off to <b>starboard.</b> <b>Watch</b> his smoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For two sticks tobacco I knock 'm seven bells outa you," [...] {{the skipper}} bullied. [...] "Now {{me give you}} strong fella talk too much. You look 'm eye belong you one time along this fella dog belong me, I knock 'm seven bells and whole <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> outa you. Savve?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{asked where}} {{the rest of}} the ship's company were; a gruff old fellow made answer, [...] "One boat's crew of 'em is gone to Davy Jones's locker:--went off after a whale, last cruise, and never come back agin. All the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> ran away last night, and the skipper's ashore kitching 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|The men {{had jumped}} to the weather braces before I gave the command, {{and all the while}} more sail were {{counting}} from the crosstrees, until their number had reached forty-one. The news spread over the ship; the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> trooped up with their dinners half eaten. Then a faint booming of guns drifted down upon our ears.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{owing to}} the absence of proper discipline, our sick, in {{addition}} to what they took medicinally, often came in for their respective [...] "tots" [...] convivially; and, added to all this, the evening of {{the last day of the}} week was always celebrated by what is styled on board of English vessels [...] "The Saturday-night bottles." [...] Two of these were sent down into the forecastle, just after dark; one for the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> and the other for the larboard.|$|E
6000|$|At noon, when I {{relieved}} Mr. Stacey of the deck, the sun {{had eaten}} up the fog, and the shores of England stood out boldly. Spurn Head was looming up across our bows, while that of Flamborough jutted into the sea behind us. I had the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> piped to dinner, and reported twelve o'clock to the commodore. And had just got permission to [...] "make it," [...] according to a time-honoured custom at sea, when another [...] "Sail, ho!" [...] came down from aloft.|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} divided into two watches, but all were told that, with the {{exception}} of two stationed as an anchor watch, they could turn in till tide turned. Frank threw himself at once into the bunk which had been allotted to him. He had not closed an eye the night before, and was worn out by emotion and fatigue, and scarcely had he lain down than he was sound asleep. He had been placed in the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> and slept till he was roughly shaken at four o'clock in the morning.|$|E
60|$|The {{second mate}} and Roger {{remained}} {{on board with}} the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> the drawing giving the advantage to the others; and these, with the captain and first mate, were soon rowing towards the shore. Those on board, although disappointed that fate had decided against them, had their share of amusement, for a good many canoes afterwards came off to them, filled with goods for barter; and as the captain, before leaving, had told the second mate that he could buy and sell with those who came out, a brisk trade was soon established.|$|E
60|$|But {{this is not}} all. Besides White-Jacket's {{office as}} looser of the main-royal, when all hands were called to make sail; and besides his special offices, in tacking ship, coming to anchor, etc.; he {{permanently}} belonged to the <b>Starboard</b> <b>Watch,</b> {{one of the two}} primary, grand divisions of the ship's company. And in this watch he was a maintop-man; that is, was stationed in the main-top, with a number of other seamen, always in readiness to execute any orders pertaining to the main-mast, from above the main-yard. For, including the main-yard, and below it to the deck, the main-mast belongs to another detachment.|$|E
6000|$|... "There has {{not been}} much to do," [...] the {{commander}} said. [...] "In fact, {{there is nothing to}} be done, except to keep her as much as we dare from running straight before the wind. We have not had much success that way for, as you see, the tumble of water shows that we are still but a short distance from the centre of the gale. I sent the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> below at four bells and, in a few minutes, we shall be relieved. Hardy wanted to stay with me, but I would not have it.|$|E
6000|$|Various {{were the}} {{emotions}} depicted upon the countenances of the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> whilst {{listening to this}} address; but on its conclusion {{there was a general}} move towards the forecastle, and we soon were all busily engaged in getting ready for the holiday so auspiciously announced by the skipper. During these preparations, his harangue was commented upon in no very measured terms; and one of the party, after denouncing him as a lying old son of a sea-cook who begrudged a fellow a few hours’ liberty, exclaimed with an oath, “But you don’t bounce me out of my liberty, old chap, for all your yarns; for I would go ashore if every pebble on the beach was a live coal, and every stick a gridiron, and the cannibals stood ready to broil me on landing.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> to which we both belonged, was to be sent ashore on liberty; and, availing {{ourselves}} of this opportunity we determined, as soon after landing as possible, to separate ourselves {{from the rest of}} the men without exciting their suspicions, and strike back at once for the mountains. Seen from the ship, the summits appeared inaccessible, but here and there sloping spurs extended from them almost into the sea, buttressing the lofty elevations with which they were connected, and forming those radiating valleys I have before described. One of these ridges, which appeared more practicable than the rest, we determined to climb, convinced that it would conduct us to the heights beyond. Accordingly, we carefully observed its bearings and locality from the ship, so that when ashore we should run no chance of missing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lads," [...] he said, [...] "I wish {{to say a}} few words, {{before you}} land. In the first place, you cannot all go. It would never do to leave the ship without {{sufficient}} hands on board to fight her, seeing that at any moment a Spaniard may come round one end of the island or the other, and fall upon us. Consequently, half must remain on board, and take their turn on shore tomorrow. I wish to give no advantage to any; therefore the boatswain shall put two pieces of folded paper in his hat, one being blank and the other having a cross upon it. If the blank paper is drawn, the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> shall go ashore, and the larboard take their turn tomorrow. If the paper with the cross comes out, it will be the other way.|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{will be in}} the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch,</b> Gilmore,” {{the mate}} said when the meal was finished. “That was the one Ayling had. The third lieutenant, Bowden, who is now in charge, isn’t half a bad fellow. Of course he is a little cocky—third lieutenants on their first {{commission}} generally are, but he is kind-hearted and likes to makes himself popular, and he will wink one eye when you take a nap under a gun, which is no mean virtue. The boatswain, who is in the same watch, is a much more formidable person, and busies himself quite unnecessarily. One cannot, however, have everything, and on the whole you will get on very comfortably. I am in the other watch, Rodwell and Forster are with you. They are well-meaning lads; I don’t know that I can say anything more for them, but you will find out their faults soon enough yourself.” ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later the first mate came up and told Jacques to inform Ralph that the captain had ordered him to be {{supplied}} with clothes similar to those worn {{by the rest of}} the crew, and that he was to be told off to take his post regularly as a boy in the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch.</b> Ralph was well pleased at the news. He felt that his best chance was to make himself useful on board, and to become one of the crew as soon as possible, so that in case an English merchantman was met with and captured he should not be sent with her crew as a prisoner to a French port. As long as he was on board various opportunities of escape might present themselves. He might slip away in port, or the brig might be captured by an English cruiser or privateer; whereas, once lodged in a French prison, the chances of such good fortune as had befallen Jacques were slight indeed. He therefore at once turned to with alacrity.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning, Roger and Pengarvan went ashore {{with the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>watch.</b> The captain again accompanied them, and for hours they rambled about the island, wondering at the strange trees and foliage {{and the bright}} flowers; and filled especially with admiration at the tiny birds, with feathers like jewels, that flitted about among the flowers, and concerning which there was much dispute among the men--some asserting {{that they were a}} sort of great bee, while others maintained that they were birds. So quickly did they fly that the men, although they tried hard, failed to catch any of them; but the dispute as to their nature was solved, by the discovery that one of the chiefs had a robe fringed with the skins of these little creatures; and examining these they saw, surely enough, that they were birds, with feathers glistening in the sun like jewels of many colors Captain Reuben persuaded the chief to cut off the fringe and sell it to him, giving in exchange for it the high price of four copper rings, and a tiny looking glass.|$|E
60|$|Lookouts at the mastheads could report no land, {{and the day}} {{passed in}} drizzling calms and violent squalls. By nightfall a heavy sea began to make from the west. The {{barometer}} had fallen to 29.50. There was no wind, and still the ominous sea continued to increase. Soon the Pyrenees was rolling madly in the huge waves that marched in an unending procession {{from out of the}} darkness of the west. Sail was shortened as fast as both watches could work, and, when the tired crew had finished, its grumbling and complaining voices, peculiarly animal-like and menacing, could be heard in the darkness. Once the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> was called aft to lash down and make secure, and the men openly advertised their sullenness and unwillingness. Every slow movement was a protest and a threat. The atmosphere was moist and sticky like mucilage, {{and in the absence of}} wind all hands seemed to pant and gasp for air. The sweat stood out on faces and bare arms, and Captain Davenport for one, his face more gaunt and care-worn than ever, and his eyes troubled and staring, was oppressed by a feeling of impending calamity.|$|E
6000|$|And now {{we stood}} out to sea, {{in a most}} amazing manner; the Skipper himself, the whole crew, the Uncommercial, and all hands present, implicitly believing {{that there was not}} a moment to lose, that the wind had that instant chopped round and sprung up fair, and that we were away on a voyage round the world. Get all sail upon her! With a will, my lads! Lay out upon the main-yard there! Look alive at the weather earring! Cheery, my boys! Let go the sheet, now! Stand by at the braces, you! With a will, aloft there! Belay, <b>starboard</b> <b>watch!</b> Fifer! Come aft, fifer, and give 'em a tune! Forthwith, springs up fifer, fife in hand--smallest boy ever seen--big lump on temple, having lately fallen down on a paving- stone--gives 'em a tune with all his might and main. Hoo-roar, fifer! With a will, my lads! Tip 'em a livelier one, fifer! Fifer tips 'em a livelier one, and {{excitement}} increases. Shake 'em out, my lads! Well done! There you have her! Pretty, pretty! Every rag upon her she can carry, wind right astarn, and ship cutting through the water fifteen knots an hour! ...|$|E
6000|$|At last Mr. Baker had to {{tell the}} captain that James Wait was {{disturbing}} {{the peace of the}} ship. [...] "Knock discipline on the head--he will, Ough," [...] grunted Mr. Baker. As a matter of fact, the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> came as near as possible to refusing duty, when ordered one morning by the boatswain to wash out their forecastle. It appears Jimmy objected to a wet floor--and that morning we were in a compassionate mood. We thought the boatswain a brute, and, practically, told him so. Only Mr. Baker's delicate tact prevented an all-fired row: he refused to take us seriously. He came bustling forward, and called us many unpolite names but in such a hearty and seamanlike manner that we began to feel ashamed of ourselves. In truth, we thought him much too good a sailor to annoy him willingly: and after all Jimmy might have been a fraud--probably was! The forecastle got a clean up that morning; but in the afternoon a sick-bay was fitted up in the deck-house. It was a nice little cabin opening on deck, and with two berths. Jimmy's belongings were transported there, and then--notwithstanding his protests--Jimmy himself. He said he couldn't walk. Four men carried him on a blanket. He complained {{that he would have to}} die there alone, like a dog. We grieved for him, and were delighted to have him removed from the forecastle. We attended him as before. The galley was next door, and the cook looked in many times a day. Wait became a little more cheerful. Knowles affirmed having heard him laugh to himself in peals one day. Others had seen him walking about on deck at night. His little place, with the door ajar on a long hook, was always full of tobacco smoke. We spoke through the crack cheerfully, sometimes abusively, as we passed by, intent on our work. He fascinated us. He would never let doubt die. He overshadowed the ship. Invulnerable in his promise of speedy corruption he trampled on our self-respect, he demonstrated to us daily our want of moral courage; he tainted our lives. Had we been a miserable gang of wretched immortals, unhallowed alike by hope and fear, he could not have lorded it over us with a more pitiless assertion of his sublime privilege.|$|E
6000|$|The {{forecastle}} was a {{place of}} damp desolation. They looked at their dwelling with dismay. It was slimy, dripping; it hummed hollow with the wind, and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a half-tide cavern in a rocky and exposed coast. Many had lost all they had in the world, but most of the <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> had preserved their chests; thin streams of water trickled out of them, however. The beds were soaked; the blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot. They dragged wet rags from evil-smelling corners, and wringing the water out, recognised their property. Some smiled stiffly. Others looked round blank and mute. There were cries of joy over old waistcoats, and groans of sorrow over shapeless things found among the splinters of smashed bed boards. One lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit. Charley whimpered a little. Knowles stumped here and there, sniffing, examining dark places for salvage. He poured dirty water out of a boot, and was concerned to find the owner. Those who, overwhelmed by their losses, sat on the forepeak hatch, remained elbows on knees, and, with a fist against each cheek, disdained to look up. He pushed it under their noses. [...] "Here's a good boot. Yours?" [...] They snarled, [...] "No--get out." [...] One snapped at him, [...] "Take it to hell out of this." [...] He seemed surprised. [...] "Why? It's a good boot," [...] but remembering suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing, he dropped his find and began to swear. In the dim light cursing voices clashed. A man came in and, dropping his arms, stood still, repeating from the doorstep, [...] "Here's a bloomin' old go! Here's a bloomin' old go!" [...] A few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco. They breathed hard, clamoured with heads down. [...] "Look at that Jack!"... "Here! Sam! Here's my shore-going rig spoilt for ever." [...] One blasphemed tearfully, holding up a pair of dripping trousers. No one looked at him. The cat came out from somewhere. He had an ovation. They snatched him from hand to hand, caressed him in a murmur of pet names. They wondered where he had [...] "weathered it out;" [...] disputed about it. A squabbling argument began. Two men brought in a bucket of fresh water, and all crowded round it; but Tom, lean and mewing, came up with every hair astir and had the first drink. A couple of hands went aft for oil and biscuits.|$|E
6000|$|The clerk {{looked at}} him long and {{straight}} and black; his figure seemed to writhe {{like that of a}} snake about to strike; then he turned on his heel, went back to the cabin and opened a bottle of champagne. When eight bells were cried he slept on the floor beside the captain on the locker; and of the whole <b>starboard</b> <b>watch</b> only Sally Day appeared upon the summons. The mate proposed to stand the watch with him, and let Uncle Ned lie down; it would make twelve hours on deck, and probably sixteen, but in this fair-weather sailing he might safely sleep between his tricks of wheel, leaving orders to be called on any sign of squalls. So far he could trust the men, between whom and himself a close relation had sprung up. With Uncle Ned he held long nocturnal conversations, and the old man told him his simple and hard story of exile, suffering, and injustice among cruel whites. The cook, when he found Herrick messed alone, produced for him unexpected and sometimes unpalatable dainties, of which he forced himself to eat. And one day, when he was forward, he was surprised to feel a caressing hand run down his shoulder, and to hear the voice of Sally Day crooning in his ear: [...] "You gootch man!" [...] He turned, and, choking down a sob, shook hands with the negrito. They were kindly, cheery, childish souls. Upon the Sunday each brought forth his separate Bible--for they were all men of alien speech, even to each other, and Sally Day communicated with his mates in English only; each read or made-believe to read his chapter, Uncle Ned with spectacles on his nose; and they would all join together in the singing of missionary hymns. It was thus a cutting reproof to compare the islanders and the whites aboard the Farallone. Shame ran in Herrick's blood to remember what employment he was on, and to see these poor souls--and even Sally Day, the child of cannibals, in all likelihood a cannibal himself--so faithful to what they knew of good. The fact that he was held in grateful favour by these innocents served like blinders to his conscience, and there were times when he was inclined, with Sally Day, to call himself a good man. But the height of his favour was only now to appear. With one voice, the crew protested; ere Herrick knew what they were doing, the cook was aroused and came a willing volunteer; all hands clustered about their mate with expostulations and caresses; and he was bidden to lie down and take his customary rest without alarm.|$|E
