50|$|Beginning in 1989, {{all of the}} 43 8-car trains {{were taken}} to Acton Works, where they were fitted with {{passenger}} alarms, a public address system and other safety related features. The original hydraulic parking brakes were replaced by a new <b>spring-operated</b> <b>brake.</b> Following these changes, two units were selected for refurbishment, which was undertaken by Tickford Rail of Rosyth Royal Dockyard and Vic Berry of Leicester. The work included replacement of the seats, lighting, panelling and grab rails. The transverse seating in the centre section was replaced by longitudenal seating, reducing the seating capacity by 4, but increasing standing room. Externally, the cars were painted in a red, white and blue livery. The two units resumed service on 9 October 1989, and in June 1990, a rolling programme to update all of the cars was awarded to Tickford Rail. The work was completed in 1995.|$|E

During 1976 springs and axles were uprated and the close-ratio version of the five speed Pneumocyclic became standard [...] this applied to the PSU3D, PSU4D and PSU5B.|$|R
