5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures {{his hands}} in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs <b>Strange</b> <b>to</b> Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E
5|$|It's <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what}} we were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|While {{the idea}} of {{national}} symbols was <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them {{to communicate with the}} outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem Kimigayo and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the Hinomaru was the de facto national flag since no law was in place after the Meiji Restoration.|$|E

50|$|Doctor Strange, {{the former}} Sorcerer Supreme {{and one of}} Marvel's premiere magic users, visits Wiccan to discuss his {{potential}} candidacy and ability to assume the position as the new Sorcerer Supreme. When the Hood finds Strange and engages him in magical combat, Wiccan aids him, contrary <b>to</b> <b>Strange's</b> orders <b>to</b> flee. Wiccan and <b>Strange</b> teleport <b>to</b> the New Avengers seeking help. Later, he is seen controlled by Nightmare in Doctor Voodoo.|$|R

5|$|While {{living in}} London, Mr Norrell {{encounters}} Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from Shropshire, and recites the same prophecy, which prompts <b>Strange</b> <b>to</b> become a magician. Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, {{and promises to}} make him a king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.|$|E
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing <b>Strange</b> <b>to</b> no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

Governor Robert Bentley appointed Luther <b>Strange</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacancy, and Strange also sought the Republican nomination in the special election.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary Chinese prostitutes {{were afraid}} of serving Westerners since they looked <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> them, while the Tanka prostitutes freely mingled with western men.

The profession of prostitution among the Tanka women led to them being hated by the Chinese both because they had sex with westerners and them being racially Tanka.|$|E

He told Verónica that they were guiding him along the way, but {{said he did not know}} where he was, that he was scared, and that the whole situation seemed <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> him. That was the last thing Tobares said to Verónica.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley was {{supported}} by the Duke of York, who appointed him vice-admiral of the white, and William succeeded his dead brother as lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth later in 1665. Public scepticism over his actions persisted however, with Samuel Pepys commenting that 'it is <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> see how people do already slight Sir Wm. Berkeley … who three months since was the delight of the Court'. Berkeley's reputation was further tarnished when he was implicated in the irregular plundering of prize goods from captured Dutch merchantmen, and accused of having abandoned an action with the Dutch ship Luipaard in discreditable circumstances on 21 August 1665.|$|E
25|$|Guizot's view of {{politics}} was essentially historical and philosophical. His tastes and his acquirements gave him little {{insight into the}} practical business of administrative government. Of finance he knew nothing; trade and commerce were <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> him; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him; all these subjects he dealt with by second hand through his friends, Pierre Sylvain Dumon (1797–1870), Charles Marie Tanneguy, Comte Duchâttel (1803–1867), or Marshal Bugeaud. The consequence was that few measures of practical improvement were carried by his administration. Still less did the government lend an ear to the cry for parliamentary reform.|$|E

We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{sequel to}} Psychonauts {{has been of}} great detail of {{interest}} to Schafer, {{as well as to}} fans of the game and the gaming press. Schafer had pitched the idea to publishers but most felt the game too <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> take up. During the Kickstarter campaign for Double Fine's Broken Age in February 2012, Schafer commented on the development costs of a sequel over social media, leading to a potential interest in backing by Markus Persson, at the time the owner of Mojang. Though Persson ultimately did not fund this, interactions between him and Double Fine revealed the possibility of several interested investors to help.|$|E
25|$|Father Walke was a High Churchman and {{the changes}} in {{services}} which he introduced were <b>strange</b> <b>to</b> {{the members of the}} congregation. Many came in the early days to marvel at the curious goings on in a communion service unlike the morning prayer to which they were accustomed. However this did not persist and many became hostile and stayed away while others remained faithful worshippers. The open air services he held late on Sundays on the Downs were however popular. W. H. Frere, Bishop of Truro, 1923–35, approved of many aspects of Walke's ministry but their views differed on reservation of the blessed sacrament: the bishop held that it was within his authority while Walke maintained it was inherent in that of a parish priest.|$|E
