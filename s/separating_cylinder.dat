40|$|ABSTRACT: Deformation of a fluid {{interface}} {{caused by}} the presence of objects at the interface can lead to large lateral forces between objects. We explore these fluid-mediated attractive force between partially submerged vertical cylinders. Forces are experimentally measured by slowly <b>separating</b> <b>cylinder</b> pairs and cylinder triplets after capillary rise is initially established for cylinders in contact. For cylinder pairs, numerical computations and a theoretical model are found to be in good agreement with measurements. The model provides insight into the relative importance of the contributions to the total force. For small separations, the lateral force is dominated by the fluid pressure acting over the wetted cylinder surfaces. At large separations, the surface tension acting along the contact line dominates the lateral force. A crossover between the two regimes occurs at a separation of around half of a capillary length. The experimentally measured forces between cylinder triplets are also in good agreement with numerical computations, and we show that pairwise contributions account for nearly all of the attractive force between triplets. For cylinders with an equilibrium capillary rise height greater than the height of the cylinder, we find that the attractive force depends on the height of the cylinders above the submersion level, which provides a means to create precisel...|$|E

40|$|Simple {{rules are}} {{developed}} for obtaining rational bounds for two-phase frictional pressure gradient and void fraction in circular pipes. The bounds {{are based on}} turbulent-turbulent flow assumption. Both the lower and upper bounds for frictional pressure gradient {{are based on the}} <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders</b> formulation. For frictional pressure gradient, the lower bound is based on the <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders</b> formulation that uses the Blasius equation to represent the Fanning friction factor while the upper bound is based on the <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders</b> equation that represents well the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation for turbulent-turbulent flow. For void fraction, the lower bound is based on the <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders</b> formulation that uses the Blasius equation to predict the Fanning friction factor while the upper bound is based on the Butterworth relationship that represents well the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation. These two bounds are reversed in the case of liquid fraction (1 -α). For frictional pressure gradient, the model is verified using published experimental data of two-phase frictional pressure gradient versus mass flux at constant mass quality. The published data include different working fluids such as R- 12, R- 22, and Argon at different mass qualities, different pipe diameters, and different saturation temperatures. The bounds models are also presented in a dimensionless form as two-phase frictional multiplier (ϕl and ϕg) versus Lockhart-Martinelli parameter (X) for different working fluids such as R- 12, R- 22, and air-water and steam mixtures. For void fraction, the bounds models are verified using published experimental data of void fraction versus mass quality at constant mass flow rate. The published data include different working fluids such as steam, R- 12, R- 22, and R- 410 A at different pipe diameters, different pressures, and different mass flow rates. It is shown that the published data can be well bounded {{for a wide range of}} mass fluxes, mass qualities, pipe diameters, and saturation temperatures...|$|R

50|$|The Pescara gas {{generator}} in 040-GA-1 {{consisted of a}} horizontal, single cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. It had no crankshaft and the pistons were returned after each power stroke by compression and expansion of air in a <b>separate</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas-turbine which drove the wheels through a two-speed gearbox and propeller shafts.

25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per cylinder bank, which {{is known as a}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per cylinder bank arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual overhead cam (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two <b>separate</b> <b>cylinder</b> banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|R
25|$|A gamma Stirling {{is simply}} a beta Stirling in which the power piston is mounted in a <b>separate</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{alongside}} the displacer piston cylinder, but is still connected to the same flywheel. The gas in the two cylinders can flow freely between them and remains a single body.

5000|$|The Rider style {{engine is}} an [...] "alpha" [...] engine which uses two <b>separate</b> <b>{{cylinder}}s.</b> As {{air in the}} hot side cylinder heats, it expands, driving the piston upward.

The cold side piston then pushes the cool air over to the hot side, and the cycle repeats.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} on the opposed-piston engine is the free-piston engine, which was patented in 1934 by Raúl Pateras de Pescara. It has no crankshaft, and the pistons are returned after each firing stroke by compression and expansion of air in a <b>separate</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Early applications were for use as an air compressor or as a gas generator for a gas turbine, such as the Pratt & Whitney PT1 design. There is now renewed interest in it for powering vehicles by using it to drive a linear alternator.|$|R
50|$|Such {{a machine}} may be {{constructed}} by mechanically connecting two pistons, each {{working in a}} <b>separate</b> <b>cylinder</b> of a different diameter. As the pistons are mechanically linked, their force and stroke length are the same. If the diameters are different, the hydraulic pressure in each cylinder will vary in the same ratio as their areas: the smaller piston giving rise to a higher pressure. As the pressure is inversely proportional to the area, it will be inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} diameter.|$|R
50|$|The D.III {{was based}} on the same pattern as the earlier Mercedes D.II, {{suitably}} scaled up for higher power settings. Like most inlines of the era, it used a large aluminum crankcase as the main structural component, with <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders</b> made from steel bolted onto it. The technology for screwing a threaded cylinder of steel into an aluminum crankcase did not exist at that time. Jackets for cooling water covered the top 2/3 of the cylinder, feeding a radiator via connections {{at the back of the}} engine.|$|R

2500|$|An annular {{engine is}} an unusual type of engine that has an annular (ring-shaped) cylinder. Some of American {{pioneering}} engineer James P.

Trunk engines were another type of annular engine. A third type of annular marine engine which was sometimes produced utilized the Siamese engine connecting mechanism, but instead of two <b>separate</b> <b>cylinders,</b> had a single annular-shaped cylinder wrapped around the vertical arm of the crosshead (see diagram under [...] "Siamese" [...] above).|$|R
