40|$|AbstractA simply {{connected}} domain G {{is called}} a <b>slit</b> <b>disc</b> if G=D minus {{a finite number of}} closed radial slits not reaching the origin. A <b>slit</b> <b>disc</b> is called rational (rationally placed) if the lengths of all its circular arcs between neighboring slits (the arguments of the slits) are rational multiples of 2 π. The conformal mapping ϕ of D onto G, ϕ(0) = 0, ϕ′(0) > 0, extends to a continuous function on T mapping it onto ∂G. A finite union E of closed non-intersecting arcs ek on T is called rational if νE(ek) ∈Q for every k, νE(ek) being the harmonic measures of ek at ∞ for the domain C∖E. A compact E is rational if and only if there is a rational <b>slit</b> <b>disc</b> G such that E=ϕ− 1 (T). A compact E essentially supports a measure with periodic Verblunsky parameters if and only if E=ϕ− 1 (T) for a rationally placed G. For any tuple (α 1,…,αg+ 1) of positive numbers with ∑kαk= 1 there is a finite family {ek}k= 1 g+ 1 of closed non-intersecting arcs ek on T such that νE(ek) =αk. For any set E=∪k= 1 g+ 1 ek⊂T and any ϵ> 0 there is a rationally placed compact E∗=∪k= 1 g+ 1 ek∗ such that the Lebesgue measure |E△E∗| of the symmetric difference E△E∗ is smaller than ϵ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{computational}} technique, Wave Confinement (WC), {{is extended}} here {{to account for}} sound diffraction around arbitrary terrain. While diffraction around elementary scattering objects, such as a knife edge, single <b>slit,</b> <b>disc,</b> sphere, etc. has been studied for several decades, realistic environments still pose significant problems. This new technique is first validated against Sommerfeld's classical problem of diffraction due to a knife edge. This is followed by comparisons with diffraction over three-dimensional smooth obstacles, such as a disc and Gaussian hill. Finally, comparisons with flight test acoustics data measured behind a hill are also shown. Comparison between experiment and Wave Confinement prediction demonstrates that a Poisson spot occurred behind the isolated hill, resulting in significantly increased sound intensity {{near the center of}} the shadowed region...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{high speed}} gas {{sampling}} system was used to collect gas samples in the engine cylinder. C 1 -C 5 based HC components behaviuor in the engine cylinder were investigated experimentally during the flame period. Model GSD- 10 fast response {{gas sampling system}} was used to sample gas in the cylinder. The high speed gas sampling valve mounted on the engine cylinder {{was connected to the}} gas chromatograph instrument directly, and samplings were continuously gathered at the intended crank shaft angle ranges. The electro-magnetic valve lift time was controlled by setting a time-lag from the TDC reference point of the engine crank angle. Crank pulses were provided by crank pulse generator. The generator consists of a <b>slit</b> <b>disc</b> mounted on the engine shaft and a photo-electric pick-up. It was designed to generate the crank pulse (360 pulses/rev) and the reference pulse (1 pulse/rev). In cylinder gas samples were taken for 10 - 15 degree intervals after the ignition. Samples taken during the flame period were approximately 60 degrees of crank angle after the spark plug ignited. In this study, Agilent 7890 A Gas Chromatography (GC) system was employed to analyze C 1 -C 5 HC component of the sampled gas from the engine cylinder. GC-FID (Flame Ionization Detector) analysis method was utilized to investigate hydrocarbon components. Response time of hydrocarbon components were listed. HC components variation with respect to crank angle were plotted and interpreted...|$|R
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill <b>slits</b> beneath the <b>disc.</b>|$|R

40|$|A torque {{controllable}} {{viscous coupling}} is presented. The coupling {{consists of two}} types of <b>discs</b> with <b>slits.</b> One is connected to a housing (follower discs) {{and the other is}} connected to a shaft (driving discs). The driving discs and follower discs are arranged by turns and they are sandwiched. MR fluid is filled in the housing. Magnetic fields freeze the fluid, so that the shear torque is generated between the diving discs and follower discs due to shears between the <b>slits</b> in the <b>discs</b> under the magnetic fields. The torque is controlled by electromagnets. In order to have large torque with small electric power, coil turns have to be large, so that response delays due to inductance of the coil. A controller which improves response is presented. A method of control is presented which controls distribution of torque of rear wheel and front wheel...|$|R
