50|$|The {{protection}} of habitat and hunting restrictions have allowed pronghorn numbers to recover {{to an estimated}} population between 500,000 and 1,000,000 (excluding the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn,</b> which is down to about 200). Some recent decline has occurred in a few localized populations, due to bluetongue disease, which is spread from sheep, but the overall trend has been positive since conservation measures were put in place.|$|E
50|$|Pronghorns are now quite numerous, and outnumbered {{people in}} Wyoming {{and parts of}} {{northern}} Colorado until just recently. They are legally hunted in western states for purposes of population control and food. No major range-wide threats exist, although localized declines are taking place, particularly to the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn,</b> mainly as a result of, among others, livestock grazing, the construction of roads, fences, and other barriers that prevent access to historical habitat, illegal hunting, insufficient forage and water, and lack of recruitment.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{threatened}} species are the jaguar (the largest cat native to North America), the ocelot (30 pound cats {{that could be}} making a comeback), the Mexican wolf (the smallest gray wolf in North America), the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (related to giraffes, they can run 60 mph and are North America's fastest land mammals), the tiny cactus ferruginous pygmy owl (who fly at about 4.5 to 13 feet, lower than the wall), and the Quino checkerspot butterfly (who fly no higher than 6 to 8 feet).|$|E
50|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{are considered}} endangered in all (A. a. sonoriensis, A. a. peninsularis), {{or part of}} their ranges (A. a. mexicana). Populations of the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> in Arizona and Mexico are protected under the Endangered Species Act (since 1967), and a recovery plan for this subspecies has been prepared by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Mexican animals are listed on CITES Appendix I. Pronghorns have game-animal status {{in all of the}} western states of the United States, and permits are required to trap or shoot pronghorns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{subspecies}} {{known as}} the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (A. a. sonoriensis) occurs in Arizona and Mexico. Other subspecies include the Mexican pronghorn (A. a. mexicana), the Oregon pronghorn (A. a. oregona), and the critically endangered Baja California pronghorn (A. a. peninsularis).Pronghorns prefer open, expansive terrain at elevations varying between 900 and 1800 m, with the densest populations in areas receiving around 25 - 40 cm of rainfall per year. They eat {{a wide variety of}} plant foods, often including plants unpalatable or toxic to domestic livestock (sheep and cattle), though they also compete with them for food. In one study, forbs comprised 62% of their diet, shrubs 23%, and grasses 15%, while in another, cacti comprised 40%, grass 22%, forbs 20%, and shrubs 18%. Pronghorns also chew and eat (ruminate) cud, which is their own partially digested food. Healthy pronghorn populations tend to stay within 5.0 - 6.5 km of water. An ongoing study by the Lava Lake Institute for Science and Conservation and the Wildlife Conservation Society shows an overland migration route that covers more than 160 mi. The migrating pronghorn start travel from the foothills of the Pioneer Mountains through Craters of the Moon National Monument to the Continental Divide. Dr. Scott Bergen of Wildlife Conservation Society says, [...] "This study shows that pronghorn are the true marathoners of the American West. With these new findings, we can confirm that Idaho supports a major overland mammal migration - an increasingly rare phenomenon in the U.S. and worldwide." ...|$|E
40|$|I studied {{vertebrate}} use of 2 {{artificial water}} developments on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Arizona from March 1994 to August 1995 {{to assess their}} use by wildlife, especially regarding endangered <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis). The water developments lie within designated wilderness, and were constructed in the late 1950 s specifically for <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn.</b> I used remote cameras to detect large mammals, live trapping for small mammals, pitfall trapping for reptiles, transect surveys for birds, pond surveys for amphibians, and mist-netting to detect bats. I observed 201 vertebrate species, but <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> were not detected in remote camera photos. Large mammals, bats, birds, and amphibians used free-standing water, but the distribution of species within all taxa may {{have been affected by}} the dense growth of mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa) at each site.

40|$|I {{determined}} if <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis) {{could meet}} water and mineral requirements through consumption of forage. I sampled vegetation using dry weight rank and comparative yield methods in southwestern Arizona from June 1995 to May 1996 to determine preformed water, nutrient content, mineral content, and vegetation abundance. Water and nutrient content of plants varied between 2 sites and among 5 seasons (P ≤ 0. 05). Plants consumed by pronghorn were higher in moisture and nutrients (P ≤ 0. 05) than non-forage species. I constructed {{a model for}} <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> diet based on field data. I used the model to describe dietary intake. Water intake predicted by diet models ranged from 1. 1 to 6. 1 L/animal/day; often exceeding predicted total water requirements (1. 8 - 3. 4 L/animal/day). Models predicted that forage provided adequate water for pronghorn during 5 seasons at 1 of 2 study sites and deficiencies for 5 of 11 minerals at both study sites...|$|E
40|$|From April 1988 to August 1988 {{and from}} March 1989 to August 1989 I studied habitat {{utilization}} of the endangered <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis) on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in southwestern Arizona. Pronghorn groups were small (x = 2. 5) and dispersed widely throughout the study area. I never saw Sonoran pronghorns drinking water. Cacti were the major diet components in the dry seasons. Forbs were the major diet component in the wet season. Cover, plants, and vertical obstruction was generally greater in occupied areas than in unoccupied areas. Plants in occupied areas were higher in protein than plants in unoccupied areas. The percentage of indigestible material (e. g., cellulose) in plants from occupied areas was generally less than in unoccupied areas. My data represent the characteristics of vegetation in areas used by <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn.</b> They could be applied in an intensive habitat management program {{to improve the quality}} of pronghorn habitat...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{accomplished in}} this dissertation used both mathematical and statistical techniques to extract and evaluate measures of landscape temporal dynamics and spatial structure from remotely sensed {{data for the}} purpose of mapping wildlife habitat. By coupling the landscape measures gleaned from the remotely sensed data with various sets of animal sightings and population data, effective models of habitat preference were created. Measures of temporal dynamics of vegetation greenness as measured by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite were used to effectively characterize and map season specific habitat of the <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> antelope, as well as produce preliminary models of potential yellow-billed cuckoo habitat in Arizona. Various measures that capture different aspects of the temporal dynamics of the landscape were derived from AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index composite data using three main classes of calculations: basic statistics, standardized principal components analysis, and Fourier analysis. Pronghorn habitat models based on the AVHRR measures correspond visually and statistically to GIS-based models produced using data that represent detailed knowledge of ground-condition. Measures of temporal dynamics also revealed statistically significant correlations with annual estimates of elk population in selected Arizona Game Management Units, suggesting elk respond to regional environmental changes that can be measured using satellite data. Such relationships, once verified and established, can be used to help indirectly monitor the population. Measures of landscape spatial structure derived from IKONOS high spatial resolution (1 -m) satellite data using geostatistics effectively map details of <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> antelope habitat. Local estimates of the nugget, sill, and range variogram parameters calculated within 25 x 25 -meter image windows describe the spatial autocorrelation of the image, permitting classification of all pixels into coherent units whose signature graphs exhibit a classic variogram shape. The variogram parameters captured in these signatures have been shown in previous studies to discriminate between different species-specific vegetation associations. The synoptic view of the landscape provided by satellite data can inform resource management efforts. The ability to characterize the spatial structure and temporal dynamics of habitat using repeatable remote sensing data allows closer monitoring of the relationship between a species and its landscape...|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} 13 {{case studies}} from Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, {{on the effects}} of transportation corridors on pronghorn (Antiocapra americana). What do we know and {{what can we do about}} it? Since the mid- 1900 s, naturalists/biologists have known that transportation corridors such as highway and railroad rights-of-way can affect pronghorn populations. Beginning in 1983, we have radiomarked ~ 250 adult pronghorn across Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico to assess the effects of transportation corridors on various populations. During this over 20 -year period, we conducted 3 studies, 1 in Sonora, Mexico, on the endangered <b>Sonoran</b> <b>pronghorn</b> (A. a. sonoriensis) and 10 studies in central and northern Arizona on other subspecies. With > 34, 000 radio locations, we report on the documented effects of transportation corridors from these 13 case studies. Transportation corridor effects varied by type of corridor (number of lanes, fenced vs. unfenced, and presumably by traffic volume). Pronghorn readily crossed paved, unfenced roadways with low traffic volume, occasionally crossed paved, fenced 2 -lane highways, but only in certain situations, but did not cross high-volume highways or divided interstates. Railroad rights [...] of-way also isolated pronghorn herds and fragmented habitat. Six mitigation ideas are presented and discussed that could improve the likelihood of pronghorn crossings. The current “wildlife missing linkages” project in Arizona is attempting to identify fragmentation of habitat across the state due to transportation corridors and plan for remedies to lessen the impact of transportation on many species of wildlife, including pronghorn. We conclude that additional research on mitigation features is warranted...|$|E
