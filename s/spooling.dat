40|$|A <b>spool</b> valve as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the <b>spool.</b> The motion of the <b>spool</b> is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the <b>spool,</b> and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the <b>spool</b> valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics of a <b>spool</b> valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

It requires less than two shop visits per 1,000 flight hours and averages 6,500 hours between in-flight events. It also demonstrates high responsiveness to control inputs, <b>spooling</b> from idle to full afterburner in 4 seconds.

25|$|Turbocharger lag (turbo lag) is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed throttle response when accelerating as compared to a naturally aspirated engine. This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as <b>spooling.</b> Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E

500|$|Kilburn's next project, {{known as}} Atlas, aimed {{to create a}} fast {{computer}} by making maximum use of existing and new technologies. The project was backed by Ferranti and a £300,000 grant from the National Research Development Corporation. It incorporated numerous technologies and techniques such as [...] "multiprogramming, job scheduling, <b>spooling,</b> interrupts, pipelining, interleaved storage, autonomous transfer units, virtual storage and paging – though none of these techniques had been invented when the project started in 1956."

500|$|The track {{included}} the highly compressed drums that the Beatles currently favoured, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, a sitar and a tambura drone. The {{use of these}} ¼-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then <b>spooling</b> a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles {{to use the same}} effects and create their own loops.

40|$|Within the Oil industry, subsea {{pipelines}} {{are used}} to transport hydrocarbons from one location to another. After the installation of a subsea pipeline, the final connection between the pipeline ant the interconnecting facilities are done by using tie-in <b>spools.</b> In principle, tie-in <b>spools</b> serve two purposes. First, it needs to provide an interface that bridges the inaccuracies associated with offshore pipeline installation. Inaccuracies related to pipeline installation are numerous, but {{can be related to}} the existing seabed infrastructure, orientation/position of the tie-in facilities with respect to pipeline installation vessel, bathymetry & soil accuracy of data among others. These factors cause the tie-in <b>spool</b> to be measured, fabricated and installed after the pipeline has been laid in order to make up the connection. Secondly, the tie-in <b>spool</b> needs to be a flexible element as pipelines expands during operational conditions because of heat and pressure differences between installation and operational stages. By the tie-in <b>spool</b> being flexible, the forces in connectors are reduced in order to ensure safe transportation of hydrocarbons. These key requirements can have significant impact of the overall cost of a project as they will affect all necessary operations related to tie-in <b>spools.</b> This report assesses key requirements related to tie-in <b>spools</b> by a detailed review about issues related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of tie-in <b>spools.</b> By presenting details from the design of an actual installed tie-in <b>spool</b> in the southern North Sea this is sought achieved. By presenting a tie-in <b>spool</b> and its important design parameters, load steps that it is subjected to, and the results from loading analysis it is wanted to educate about the importance of tie-in <b>spools.</b> A modification of the tie-in <b>spool</b> where done to develop a simple technique to quickly assess the preliminary design/configuration of a tie-in <b>spool</b> based on bending moment capacity of the associated connector. The design parameters, such as pipeline expansion, where extracted from the presented tie-in analysis. Four different analysis methods where used in order to give recommendations on which method are most suited for <b>spool</b> piece analysis. By comparing results with the actual installed <b>spool,</b> calculated results showed that three methods can be suited for simplified <b>spool</b> piece analysis. In order to qualify one of the analysis methods, a downscaled tie-in <b>spool</b> was manufactured based on the modified <b>spool.</b> By innovative use of simple mechanical equipment, the tie-in <b>spool</b> was applied pipeline expansion via a winch. The bending moment in the connector where measured using an adjustable torque wrench. Measured bending moment was compared to the analysis methods and by comparison it was evident that numbers did not correlate.
