He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that {{the letter was written}} to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family.

5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag.

5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

Collins's estranged wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn), whose conversation with Cal seems to imply a past love triangle dating back to their college years, reveals that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> amount of money Sonia received from PointCorp, after just hearing Collins's statement to the newspaper. After the couple leaves, Cal realizes that Collins knew already that Sonia was working for PointCorp. Cal wonders what Collins would have done had he known he had been tricked and whether Collins himself is connected with Sonia's assassin. A picture of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's hunch. Collins reveals {{that he had been}} suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army Corporal Robert Bingham (Michael Berresse), whose life Collins had once saved.

She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> effect that that can have on people. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E

[...] In the song's refrains, she realizes the need to remain strong and breathe in order to live without the person.

Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor James Cromwell, who viewed his character as [...] "a generous gentleman, well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part. He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply {{in love with his}} wife and sympathetic to her concerns about {{what will happen to the}} girls if they don't marry." [...] Joe Anderson portrayed Henry Austen, while Lucy Cohu played the widowed Eliza de Feuillide, the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character [...] "needs security. She is looking to be safe. She finds that security with Henry as <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> Austen family." ...|$|E

My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E

[...] Giuliani emphasized his depiction of Clinton as a carpetbagger. [...] He made a one-day visit to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he announced he would fly the Arkansas state flag over New York's City Hall. [...] When Hillary Clinton visited New York from Washington, he said, [...] "I hope <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> way. I hope she doesn’t get lost {{on one of the}} side streets." [...] Giuliani's campaign prepared a 315-page opposition research dossier that went back to her time at Wellesley College; it included eleven pages of what they termed [...] "Stupid Actions and Remarks". [...] The Giuliani campaign had no problems raising money, getting over 40percent of its funds from out-of-state and outraising Clinton overall two-to-one.|$|E

500|$|The ballet {{is about}} a peasant girl named Giselle, who dies of a broken heart after {{discovering}} her lover is betrothed to another. The Wilis, a group of supernatural women who dance men to death, summon Giselle from her grave. They target her lover for death, but Giselle's great love frees him from their grasp. The Wilis [...] are particularly haunting characters. They are the spirits of virgin girls that died before they married. These creatures were very popular in Romantic era ballets. Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements, and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions. Although still appearing ethereal, watching the Wilis sweep the stage creates an eerie mood that builds as the ballet continues and they enclose on Albrecht. They are ruthless and hateful of men because they have all died of a broken heart. Giselle finds forgiveness in her heart for Albrecht, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> Wilis will not do the same. Their goal is clear and they are relentless on their quest. The Wilis {{are one of the}} most iconic characters in Giselle. They leave an imprint in the viewers mind as they dominate the second act.|$|E
500|$|Conor Behan of The Independent {{qualified}} {{the clip}} as being [...] "effortlessly sexy". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the video {{for the song}} as the most NSFW from the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out referred to the clip for [...] "Partition" [...] as a classic MTV video. A more negative review came from The Verge Trent Wolbe who panned Nava's contribution to the album as uninteresting. The Daily Telegraph writer Sarah Crompton stated that the video looked suitable for a porn website and described its imagery as [...] "strip club dressed up as a Busby Berkeley musical". Crompton went on to call the message the video sent [...] "peculiar" [...] and added that the singer should try to become a better role model for young girls. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-uk commented that such visuals showed that Beyoncé had [...] "sold out" [...] and undermined her position as a [...] "role model" [...] and previous [...] "powerful messages that empowered women and girls". In early March 2014, Bill O'Reilly criticized the video for [...] "Partition" [...] during his show The O'Reilly Factor broadcast on Fox News. He said that it represented glorification of sex {{in the back of}} a limousine and offered critique that teenage girls are influenced by the singer, adding, [...] "Why would she do it when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>the</b> devastation that unwanted pregnancies... and fractured families [...] I think Beyoncé, what she has done here, is inexplicable". In response to these claims, Rutger University's Kevin Allred argues that [...] "Beyonce isn’t sensationalizing her own body and putting it on display for viewers to gawk at. Rather, she performs the historical objectification of black female bodies and replays that objectification in order to point out that, stereotypically, black women have had few means of garnering attention beyond sexual performances. She goes so far as forcing the viewer to be complicit in this objectification by positioning them as the direct viewer of the show she is enacting." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2014 BET Awards. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated in the categories for Best Choreography and Best Female Video.|$|E
