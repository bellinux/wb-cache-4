500|$|The {{defendants}} {{pleaded not}} guilty, {{saying that they}} had not meant their protest to be offensive. [...] "We sang part of the refrain 'Holy shit'," [...] Tolokonnikova said in court. [...] "I am <b>sorry</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> offended anyone with this. It is an idiomatic expression, related to the previous verse — about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government.

[...] Their lawyers stated that the circumstances of the case had revived the Soviet-era tradition of the show trial.

2500|$|During a hustings for the GMB Union on 7 June, McDonnell {{was asked}} what single act he would do to improve the world if he could travel back to the 1980s.

[...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this.
