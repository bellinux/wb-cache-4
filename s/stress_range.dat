5000|$|Design {{stresses}} {{that have been}} determined from the ultimate or yield point values of the materials give safe and reliable results only for the case of static loading. Many machine parts fail when subjected to a non steady and continuously varying loads even though the developed stresses are below the yield point. Such failures are called fatigue failure. The failure is by a fracture {{that appears to be}} brittle with little or no visible evidence of yielding. However, when the stress is kept below [...] "fatigue stress" [...] or [...] "endurance limit stress", the part will endure indefinitely. A purely reversing or cyclic stress is one that alternates between equal positive and negative peak stresses during each cycle of operation. In a purely cyclic stress, the average stress is zero. When a part is subjected to a cyclic stress, also known as <b>stress</b> <b>range</b> (Sr), it has been observed that the failure of the part occurs after a number of stress reversals (N) even if the magnitude of the <b>stress</b> <b>range</b> is below the material’s yield strength.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} models of an upper second premolar and molar with full veneer gold crown preparations were developed from extracted samples. The cement lute width was kept constant at 40 microm, but the height and preparation taper were varied. For both models the preparation height was either 1. 5 mm (short preparation) or 3 mm (long preparation). The preparation taper was either 10 degree or 30 degree, giving a total of eight models. Each model was loaded with a 10 N horizontal load, a 10 N vertical load or a 10 N load distributed across the occlusal surface. The maximum shear stress and the maximum Von Mises' stress in the cement lute of each model were recorded. For the premolar, the maximum shear <b>stresses</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 3 - 5. 43 MPa and the maximum Von Mises' <b>stress</b> <b>ranged</b> from 1. 44 - 14. 98 MPa.

Unlike the creep of polymers and metals, it exhibits multi-months aging, caused by chemical hardening due to hydration which stiffens the microstructure, and multi-year aging, caused by long-term relaxation of self-equilibrated micro-stresses in the nano-porous microstructure of the C-S-H. If concrete is fully dried, it does not creep, but it is next to impossible to dry concrete fully without severe cracking.|$|E

A {{very small number of}} cycles of overstress applied intermittently during {{a very large number of}} cycies of understress below threshold caused significant acceleration, of about one hundred times, in crack growth rate as compared to the case of steady cyclic stress in the cases of moist air, dry air and nitrogen. In the region of low understress, the acceleration in moist air was appreciably less than that in dry air and nitrogen due to oxide-induced crack closure. The acceleration in vacuum was smaller than that in other environments over all understress levels, possibly because of reweiding. There was no effect of an overstress sequence on the acceleration.

40|$|High cycle {{fatigue failure}} {{is likely to}} occur when a rather undamped {{offshore}} installation is operated {{over a long period}} of time. Especially welded parts are vulnerable to fluctuating <b>stress</b> <b>ranges,</b> if the structural components, such as the small bore side branches, are loaded in resonance. In particular, the welded connections at e. g. tie-in points can be critical. Therefore, it is important to know what the current status of existing welded connections is and how long they can still be operated at any specific operating condition without failure. This paper describes an advanced fatigue assessment method to determine the cumulative damage in the critical parts of the system. The method is developed for industrial applications where the available information is limited. The method comprises of a mechanical analysis and a fatigue assessment based on a fracture mechanics crack growth model. The method enables determination of inspection intervals and at the same time layout optimization for a long term safe operation. This paper pays special attention to complex, braced small bore side branches. Standard fatigue stress assessment methods can be conservative for the fatigue assessment of high frequent <b>stress</b> <b>ranges</b> with relatively low <b>stress</b> <b>ranges.</b> The current paper shows the effect of the fracture mechanics procedure for an example of a braced side branch connected to the main piping: both a fracture mechanics model and a detailed 3 D FE model are made.

40|$|Long-span {{suspension}} bridges carrying both {{highway and}} railway {{have been built}} in wind-prone regions. The estimation of fatigue damage of such bridges under the long-term combined action of railway, highway, and wind loading represents a challenging task in consideration of randomness in multiple types of loading. This study presents a framework for fatigue reliability analysis of multiloading long-span suspension bridges equipped with structural health monitoring systems (SHMS), and the Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong is taken as a case study. A limit-state function in the daily sum of m -power <b>stress</b> <b>ranges</b> is first defined for fatigue reliability analysis. Probabilistic models of railway, highway, and wind loading are established {{on the basis of}} the measurement data acquired from the SHMS. The daily stochastic stress responses induced by the multiple types of loading are simulated at the fatigue-critical locations of the bridge deck by using the finite-element method and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) together with the loading probabilistic models established. The probability distribution of the daily sum of m -power <b>stress</b> <b>ranges</b> is estimated {{on the basis of the}} daily stochastic stress responses. The probability distribution of the sum of m -power <b>stress</b> <b>ranges</b> for a given time period is then evaluated in consideration of future traffic growth patterns. Finally, the fatigue failure probabilities of the bridge at the fatigue-critical locations are calculated for different time periods. The results demonstrate that the health condition of the Tsing Ma Bridge at the end of its design life will be satisfactory under current traffic conditions without growth but that attention should be paid to future traffic growth because it may lead to a much greater fatigue failure probability.
