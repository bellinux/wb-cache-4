5|$|In Japan the {{practice}} of keeping horned rhinoceros beetles (Dynastinae) and <b>stag</b> <b>beetles</b> (Lucanidae) is particularly popular amongst young boys. Such is the popularity in Japan that vending machines dispensing live beetles were developed in 1999, each holding up to 100 <b>stag</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The park is an {{important}} refuge for other wildlife, including woodpeckers, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, <b>stag</b> <b>beetles</b> and many other insects plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.|$|E
5|$|Polyphaga is {{the largest}} suborder, {{containing}} more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including rove beetles (Staphylinidae), scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), blister beetles (Meloidae), <b>stag</b> <b>beetles</b> (Lucanidae) and true weevils (Curculionidae). These polyphagan beetle groups can be identified {{by the presence of}} cervical sclerites (hardened parts of the head used as points of attachment for muscles) absent in the other suborders.|$|E

5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as <b>stag</b> <b>beetles,</b> have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
25|$|This {{exhibit is}} an indoor {{tropical}} jungle {{and home to}} nearly 800 species including Asian small-clawed otters, Javan lutungs, silvery lutungs, northern white-cheeked gibbons, Matschie's tree-kangaroos, gharials, and Malayan tapirs, living in mangroves and on the beaches. Visitors can watch the gibbons swinging or singing, and watch the otters play. The exhibit includes species that are usually on the jungle floor including <b>stag</b> <b>beetles,</b> scorpions, and fire-bellied toads, but behind glass. A pond with a waterfall lets visitors sit and observe gourami and Fly River turtles.|$|E
25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; ramsons (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple hairstreak, white-letter hairstreak and speckled wood butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and <b>stag</b> <b>beetles.</b> Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E
50|$|Lissotes latidens, {{commonly}} known as the Wielangta <b>stag</b> <b>beetle</b> or broad-toothed <b>stag</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of <b>stag</b> <b>beetle</b> which is only found in an area centred in Wielangta Forest in eastern Tasmania. It is one of the rarest animals in Australia.|$|R

25|$|Chewing insects {{have two}} mandibles, {{one on each}} side of the head. The mandibles are {{positioned}} between the labrum and maxillae. The mandibles cut and crush food, and may be used for defense; generally, they have an apical cutting edge, and the more basal molar area grinds the food. They can be extremely hard (around 3 on Mohs, or an indentation hardness of about 30kg/mm2); thus, many termites and beetles have no physical difficulty in boring through foils made from such common metals as copper, lead, tin, and zinc. The cutting edges are typically strengthened by the addition of zinc, manganese, or rarely, iron, in amounts up to about 4% of the dry weight. They are typically the largest mouthparts of chewing insects, being used to masticate (cut, tear, crush, chew) food items. They open outwards (to the sides of the head) and come together medially. In carnivorous, chewing insects, the mandibles can be modified to be more knife-like, whereas in herbivorous chewing insects, they are more typically broad and flat on their opposing faces (e.g., caterpillars). In male <b>stag</b> <b>beetles,</b> the mandibles are modified to such an extent as to not serve any feeding function, but are instead are used to defend mating sites from other males. In ants, the mandibles also serve a defensive function (particularly in soldier castes). In bull ants, the mandibles are elongated and toothed, used as hunting (and defensive) appendages.|$|E
2500|$|Starewicz had {{interests}} {{in a number}} of different areas; by 1910 he was named Director of the Museum of Natural History in Kaunas, Lithuania. There he made four short live-action documentaries for the museum. For the fifth film, Starewicz wished to record the battle of two <b>stag</b> <b>beetles,</b> but was stymied by the fact that the nocturnal creatures inevitably die whenever the stage lighting was turned on. Inspired by a viewing of Les allumettes animées [...] (1908) by Émile Cohl, Starewicz decided to re-create the fight through stop-motion animation: by replacing the beetles' legs with wire, attached with sealing wax to their thorax, he is able to create articulated insect puppets. The result was the short film Lucanus Cervus (1910), apparently the first animated puppet film [...] and the natal hour of Russian animation.|$|E
