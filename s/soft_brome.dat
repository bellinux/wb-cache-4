25|$|Twenty {{acres of}} fields around {{the centre of}} the hamlet of Little Langdale were {{designated}} a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria. The habitat varies from floodplain near the Brathay to higher, dryer haymeadow with both being home {{to a wide variety of}} herb, grass and flower species. Grasses found in these meadows include sweet vernal-grass, wood-crane's-bill, common bent, crested dog's tail, red fescue, meadow fescue, Yorkshire-fog, smooth meadow-grass, rough meadow-grass, cock's-foot, <b>soft</b> <b>brome</b> and perennial rye-grass. Perhaps the rarest species found there is the globe-flower.|$|E
50|$|Bromus hordeaceus, <b>soft</b> <b>brome,</b> is {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} species of {{grass in the}} true grass family (Poaceae). It is also known in North America as bull grass, soft cheat, and soft chess.|$|E
50|$|The {{wild fauna}} {{of the valley}} is similar to other nearby valleys and {{includes}} the badger, grey squirrel, hare, hedgehog, rabbit, roe deer, red deer, red fox, stoat, weasel, buzzard, cuckoo, house martin, peregrine, raven, ring ouzel, swallow, swift, and slowworm. Rarely the adder, otter and red squirrel are seen. Pine marten, previously rare, are no longer seen in the valley. The tarn shore supports a population of great crested grebe and the dark green fritillary butterfly.Twenty acres of fields around {{the centre of the}} hamlet of Little Langdale were designated a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria.

30|$|A {{total of}} 52 plant species were {{identified}} {{at the line}} transects of which 49 belonged to the ground strata. Species frequently observed included ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), creeping wild rye (Leymus triticoides), bur chervil (Anthriscus caucalis), Mexican spangletop (Leptochloa uninervia), Santa Barbara sedge (Carex barbarae), <b>soft</b> chess <b>brome</b> (Bromus hordeaceus), mugwort (Artemesia douglasiana), California blackberry (Rubus ursinus), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor), sandbar willow (Salix exigua), red willow (Salix laevigata), and box elder (Acer negundo).

5000|$|Herbland {{dominated}} by introduced plants: 600-800 m ASL, {{mainly on the}} central plateau. This habitat is almost entirely a consequence of overgrazing; hardly anything of the original ecosystem remains. Dominant introduced plants are Avena barbata, Bromus berteroanus, great brome (B. diandrus), <b>soft</b> <b>brome</b> (B. hordeaceus sspp. hordaceus and mollis), red brome (B. madritensis ssp. rubens), tocalote (Centaurea melitensis), nettle-leaved goosefoot (Chenopodium murale), Filago californica, wall barley (Hordeum murinum sspp. glaucum and leporinum), crystalline iceplant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), M. nodiflorum, Polypogon monspeliensis and Sisymbrium orientale. The non-endemic natives dwarf coastweed (Amblyopappus pusillus), island false bindweed (Calystegia macrostegia ssp. macrostegia), Cryptantha maritima var. maritima, Filago arizonica, Gilia nevinii, California goldfields (Lasthenia californica), Pectocarya palmeri and Perityle emoryi {{as well as the}} endemics Cryptantha foliosa and Sphaeralcea palmeri can be found here also; some are still numerous. This probably was a mesic shrub/herbland before the goats destroyed the upland forest, upsetting the water supply. Native plants still found on Guadalupe, like Crossosoma californicum, laurel sumac (Malosma laurina) and the endemic Camissonia guadalupensis ssp. guadalupensis, presumably thrived here in former times, as would have such taxa as the native hoary-leaved ceanothus (Ceanothus crassifolius), wedge-leaved ceanothus (C. cuneatus) - and possibly also felt-leaved ceanothus (C. arboreus), which was found in 2001-2003 surveys -, Cammisonia robusta, red-flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) and the endemic Hesperalea palmeri, which have now disappeared from the island.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand {{herbage seed}} is {{exported}} around the globe. Quality control is effected by the New zealand Seed Certification Scheme; computerised records of certified crops enabled {{establishment of a}} weed seed contamination database. Surveying of the database in 1993 and 1994 revealed the main problem weeds in white clover (Trifolium repens) seed crops to be field madder (Sherardia arvensis) and chickweed (Stellaria media), while those in ryegrass (Lolium perenne) seed crops are <b>soft</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus mollis) and vulpia hair grass (Vulpia sp.). Identification of problem weeds has enabled advice {{to be given to}} the industry on targeting weeds during appropriate parts of the crop rotation, and modifying cultivation and harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{undertaken}} {{over three years}} to determine herbicide options for grass weed control in cereal crops (wheat and barley). The susceptibility of phalaris, perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass, prairie grass and <b>soft</b> <b>brome</b> {{to a range of}} herbicides were evaluated at fixed rates and with a logarithmic sprayer. Wheat and barley damage and grain yield were also assessed and in general good tolerance was found in the 11 cultivars evaluated. The trials identified a number of control options for grass weeds in wheat and barley, in particular pre-emergence mixtures of cyanazine + terbuthylazine; chlorsulfuron + terbuthylazine; or metribuzin alone. Brome species were the most difficult to control and further research is required...|$|E
40|$|Increasing forage {{productivity}} in the Sierra foothill rangelands would help sustain the livestock industry as land availability shrinks and lease rates rise, but hardly any {{studies have been}} done on forage selections. From 2009 to 2014, in one of the first long-term and replicated studies of seeding Northern California's Mediterranean annual rangeland, we compared the cover of 22 diverse forages to determine their establishment and survivability over time. Among the annual herbs, forage brassica (Brassica napus L.) and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) proved viable options. Among the annual grasses, <b>soft</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus hordeaceus) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) performed well. However, these species will likely require frequent reseeding to maintain dominance. Long-term goals of sustained dominant cover (> 3 years) are best achieved with perennial grasses. Perennial grasses that persisted with greater than 50 % cover were Berber orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), Flecha tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) and several varieties of hardinggrass (Phalaris aquatica L., Perla koleagrass, Holdfast, Advanced AT). In 2014, these successful perennials produced over three times more dry matter (pounds per acre) than the unseeded control and also suppressed annual grasses and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) cover...|$|E
