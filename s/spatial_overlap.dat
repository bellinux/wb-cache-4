40|$|Based on {{a network}} {{approach}} to internationalisation, the paper presents concepts for analysing companies' processes of internationalising in a moving context of other firms internationalising. The analytical problem and research question {{of the study is}}: How are firms internationalising in a continuously moving context of other, connected firms that are internationalising concurrently? The idea of connected and overlapping network processes is introduced as an analytical tool for approaching the problem. The concept <b>spatial</b> <b>overlapping</b> is applied to analyse geographical aspects of overlapping internationalisation processes. These processes are illustrated with an empirical study of the internationalisation processes of channel intermediaries. The empirical aim of the study is to complement earlier research into the internationalisation of manufacturing firms, service firms, retail chains, etc. with a study that puts channel intermediaries in focus. Connected internationalisation processes are illustrated with a case from the electronic component distribution industry. Two issues are brought up in the analysis of the case: various ways of handling concurrent and connected internationalisation processes, and of handling the resulting <b>spatial</b> <b>overlapping</b> processes, including the redefinition of market regions, regionalisation. In the final implications, the handling of network contradictions and tensions emerging from connected internationalisation processes are elaborated on in a model suggesting further research into this line of internationalisation research.

The definition can be split into two different phenomena, co-occurrence, which refers to the presence of two (possibly unrelated) fluorophores in the same pixel, and correlation, a much more significant statistical relationship between the fluorophores indicative of a biological interaction.

50|$|The Cieplak effect {{relies on}} the {{stabilizing}} interaction of mixing full and empty orbitals to delocalize electrons, known as hyperconjugation. When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap,</b> the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full σ (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty σ* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.|$|E

Compared to terrestrial carnivores, relatively {{little is known about}} the factors influencing conspecific <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> in snakes, although across snake taxa there appears to be substantial variation in conspecific <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap.</b> In this study, we described conspecific <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> of eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon couperi) in peninsular Florida and examined how conspecific <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> varied by sex and season (breeding season vs. non-breeding season). We calculated multiple indices of <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> using 6 - and 3 -month utilization distributions (UD) of dyads of simultaneously adjacent telemetered snakes. We also measured conspecific UD density values at each telemetry fix and modeled the distribution of those values as a function of overlap type, sex, and season using generalized Pareto distributions. Home range overlap between males and females was significantly greater than overlap between individuals of the same sex and male home ranges often completely contained female home ranges. Male home ranges overlapped little during both seasons, whereas females had higher levels of overlap during the non-breeding season. The spatial patterns observed in our study are consistent with those seen in many mammalian carnivores, in which low male-male overlap and high inter-sexual overlap provides males with greater access to females. We encourage additional research on the influence of prey availability on conspecific <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> in snakes as well as the behavioral mechanisms responsible for maintaining the low levels of overlap we observed...|$|E

40|$|As we {{approach}} the first array deployments of tidal stream turbines, the risk of collisions between moving components of devices and deep-diving seabirds need assessing at population levels. Part of assessing risks is quantifying {{the extent to which}} the foraging distributions of deep-diving seabirds overlap with the potential locations of devices in the large tidal pass habitats favoured for array installations (<b>spatial</b> <b>overlap).</b> Shore-based surveys using single vantage points and extensive grid systems to record the locations of foraging birds are often used in large tidal passes. Here, an application of these methods in the Fall of Warness (FOW), Orkney, UK are used to evaluate their effectiveness for quantifying and statistically analysing <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> in large tidal passes. Whilst it was possible to quantify and statistically analyse <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> using the methods evaluated here, viable statistical analysis required data sacrifices through the use of presence rather than abundance data. Moreover, comparisons between simultaneous shore-based and boat-based surveys, which are assumed to represent an accurate method, showed that sightings in the former were biased towards non-turbine microhabitats. This shore-based survey bias reflected low detection rates of foraging birds in fast unidirectional currents away from coastlines. Therefore, the methods evaluated here are unsuitable for quantifying and statistically analysing <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> in large tidal passes. It is suggested that future shore-based surveys should overcome aforementioned issues by using several vantage points spread throughout large tidal passes, and comparing species use of neighbouring turbine and non-turbine microhabitats at reasonable distances to the vantage points (< 2 km) during favourable sea states (Beaufort Scale < 3). It is hoped that these recommendations lead to the development of standardised shore-based survey methods, providing comparable measurements of <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> across tidal passes earmarked for array deployments: a key step towards estimations of collision risks at population levels...|$|E

Thirteen infants had valid data from two sessions held 8. 5 months apart (4 to 8 months and 12 to 16 months). Inter- and intrasession fNIRS test–retest reliability was assessed at the individual and group levels using the oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2) signal.

This raises the question whether this method could also serve as a pre-surgical planning tool. Generating reliable functional connectivity patterns is of crucial importance, particularly for pre-surgical planning, as these patterns may directly affect the outcome. Methods: This study investigated the reproducibility of four commonly used resting-state conditions: fixation on a black crosshair on a white screen; fixation on the center of a black screen; eyes closed and fixation on the words Entspann dich! (Engl., relax). Ten healthy, right-handed male subjects (mean age, 25 years; SD 2) participated in the experiment. The <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> for different RSNs across the four conditions was calculated. Results: The <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> across all four conditions was calculated for each seed region on a single subject and at the group level. Activation maps at the single-subject and group levels were highly stable, especially for the reading network. The lowest consistency measures were found for the visual network. At the single-subject level <b>spatial</b> <b>overlap</b> values ranged from 0. 31 (visual network) to 0. 45 (reading network).
