50|$|The ground flora {{includes}} Dog's Mercury, Bramble and Hart's-tongue Fern. Rarities include Broad-leaved Helleborine, <b>Spurge</b> <b>Laurel</b> {{and some}} Wild Daffodil. There are various varieties of mosses and liverworts recorded.|$|E
50|$|This coppice with {{standards}} {{site has}} diverse woodland types and ground flora. Plants indicative of ancient woodland include nettle-leaved bellflower, wood spurge, butterfly orchid and the uncommon <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{adjacent}} woods {{are mainly}} coppiced small-leaved lime, {{with a small}} stream and many flowering plants, including wood anemones, sweet violets, <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel,</b> stinking iris and early purple orchid.|$|E
50|$|Daphne laureola, {{commonly}} called spurge-laurel (or daphne-laurel, laurel-leaved daphne, olive-spurge, wood laurel, copse laurel), is a shrub in the flowering plant family Thymelaeaceae. Despite the name, this woodland plant {{is neither a}} <b>spurge</b> nor a <b>laurel.</b> Its native range covers much of Europe and extends to Algeria, Morocco and the Azores. With Daphne mezereum {{it is one of}} two species of Daphne native to Britain, both of which have a strong preference for alkaline soils and are most commonly found in limestone areas, although D. laureola is also found on clay. However, unlike D. mezereum, D. laureola is an evergreen with yellowish green flowers borne very early in the spring and black berries, which are poisonous to humans but not to birds, present from late summer. All parts of the plants are poisonous. The sap is known to cause skin rashes on contact.|$|R
50|$|This is {{an ancient}} coppice with {{standards}} wood mainly on boulder clay, with some areas of sandy soil. Dog's mercury is dominant in the ground flora, and other plants include <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel,</b> wood spurge, herb paris and hairy woodrush.|$|E
50|$|The larvae mainly feed on {{the flowers}} and fruit of grape (Vitis vinifera) and <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> (Daphne gnidium), {{but it has also}} been {{reported}} on several other plants (Rubus fruticosus, Ribes sp., Olea europaea, Prunus avium, Prunus domestica, Actinidia chinensis, Punica granatum, etc.). Lobesia botrana normally has two - three generations in Europe. Larvae develop in 20 to 30 days. Pupae overwinter inside a silken cocoon.|$|E
50|$|While {{the story}} of Daphne is {{traditionally}} connected with the bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), almost 90 species of evergreen shrubs noted for their scented flowers and poisonous berries are grouped under the genus Daphneâ€”including the garland flower (Daphne cneorum); the February Daphne or mezereon (Daphne mezereum); and <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> or wood laurel (Daphne laureola). These genera are categorized in the family Thymelaeaceae and are native to Asia, Europe and North Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} soils {{give rise to}} a {{similarly}} diverse ground flora which includes bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), great butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and common spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> (Daphne laureola). The woods have a rich fauna which includes fallow deer (Dama dama). They provide an excellent habitat for birds that breed in woodland such as buzzard (Buteo buteo), great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) and tree creeper (Certhia familiaris).|$|E
5000|$|Daphne mezereum, {{commonly}} known as February daphne, mezereon, [...] mezereum, <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> or spurge olive, is a species of Daphne in the flowering plant family Thymelaeaceae, native to most of Europe and Western Asia, north to northern Scandinavia and Russia. In southern Europe it is confined to medium to higher elevations and in the subalpine vegetation zone, but descends to near sea level in northern Europe. It is generally confined to soils derived from limestone.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of semi-natural woodland trees and rare and uncommon plants. Beech is dominant on the upper slopes and is frequently ancient coppice. Where the soil is calcareous there are Small-leaved Lime, Ash and Yew. Silver Birch and Oak grow on the acidic soils. Mature woodland does not support a strong ground flora and here is dominated by Ivy and species such as <b>Spurge</b> <b>Laurel.</b> Coppiced areas allow in light and denser ground flora occurs.|$|E
50|$|Westridge Wood (unit 1) and Conygre Wood (unit 3) are the {{two main}} areas of ancient {{woodland}}, which are mostly beech. Ash and pedunculate oak are widespread, and other trees include field maple and locally small-leaved lime. Historically the woods were managed as coppice and old stools remain present. The woodland is now high forest with an understorey, and a rich flora which is characteristic of beech woods. Ground flora includes nettle-leaved bellflower, goldenrod, <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> and tutsan. stinking hellebore and wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) may also be found. The site {{is one of only}} two United Kingdom sites for the nationally rare limestone woundwort which is found and monitored in Old London Road reserve (unit 2). It is also now reported present in Westridge Wood and Conygre Wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} mediterranean, having hot summers and {{generally}} warm to cool, dry winters. The park {{falls within the}} Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest up to 600 m above the sea level. The flora of the park is diverse and is characterized with high endemism due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude variation. The forests are host to several plants such as Bosnian pine, Black pine, Bulgarian fir, Silver fir, ash trees, kermes oak, tree heather, prickly juniper, common box, <b>spurge</b> <b>laurel,</b> spindle, european yew and so on.The vertebrate fauna of the national park consists of large number of species. Among the species of highest conservation value are Griffon vulture, Golden eagle, Rock partridge, Fallow deer, Roe deer, European wildcat, Chamois, Red squirrel, Eurasian otter, European otter, Stone marten, Wolf and the Red fox.|$|E
40|$|Description: <b>Spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> is an {{evergreen}} shrub {{that grows}} up to 3 - 4 feet tall. Whorls of dark green, shiny, leathery leaves grow {{at the ends}} of the branches. Leaves are oblong in shape, 1 - 5 inches long and to 1 inch wide. <b>Spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> blooms in late winter and early spring, producing small (less than inch long) tubular, yellow-green flowers. The flowers, which are sometimes fragrant, grow in small clusters at the base of leaves, near the tops of the stems. Oval, black berries are produced in early summer. <b>Spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> is slow-growing and long-lived. (Daphne laureola) Impacts: <b>Spurge</b> <b>laurel,</b> a shrub native to Western Europe and the Mediterranean, was introduced into North America as a garden ornamental. It has escaped cultivation, invading roadsides, parks and wooded areas. <b>Spurge</b> <b>laurel</b> can replace native understory plants in forested areas, and can form large single-species stands. It tolerates a wide range of environmenta...|$|E
