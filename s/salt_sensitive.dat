Direct {{effects of these}} two salts included the loss of cell membrane integrity in exposed pathogens. In this work, four fungal potato pathogens were studied in order to elucidate the role of membrane lipids and lipid peroxidation in the relative sensitivity of microorganisms exposed to these salts. Inhibition of mycelial growth in these fungi varied considerably and revealed sensitivity groups within the tested fungi. Analysis of fatty acids in these fungi demonstrated that sensitivity was related to high intrinsic fatty acid unsaturation. When exposed to the antifungal <b>salts,</b> <b>sensitive</b> fungi demonstrated a loss of fatty acid unsaturation, which was accompanied by an elevation in malondialdehyde content (a biochemical marker of lipid peroxidation).

Events in early life, such as low birth weight, maternal smoking, and lack of breast feeding may be risk factors for adult essential hypertension, although the mechanisms linking these exposures to adult hypertension remain unclear.

In this study, we examined some of the biochemical properties of the SOS 2 in vitro.

These active mutants exhibited a preference for Mn 2 + relative to Mg 2 + and could not use GTP as phosphate donor for either substrate phosphorylation or autophosphorylation.

Salinity reduced the Ys of the cellular sap of leaves and roots in both genotypes, mainly in the <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> one. The higher decrease in the Ys in the <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> genotype was mostly due to higher accumulation of Na+ and Cl- that probably exceeded the amount needed for the osmotic adjustment.

Arabidopsis <b>salt</b> overly <b>sensitive</b> 4 mutants were originally identified by screening for NaCl-hypersensitive growth. The SOS 4 (<b>Salt</b> Overly <b>Sensitive</b> 4) gene was recently isolated by map-based cloning and shown to encode a pyridoxal (PL) kinase involved in the production of PL- 5 -phosphate, which is an important cofactor for various enzymes and a ligand for certain ion transporters. The root growth of sos 4 mutants is slower than that of the wild type. Microscopic observations revealed that sos 4 mutants do not have root hairs in the maturation zone. The sos 4 mutations block the initiation of most root hairs, and impair the tip growth of those that are initiated. The root hairless phenotype of sos 4 mutants was complemented by the wild-type SOS 4 gene. SOS 4 promoter-β-glucuronidase analysis showed that SOS 4 is expressed in the root hair and other hair-like structures. Consistent with SOS 4 function as a PL kinase, in vitro application of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, but not PL, partially rescued the root hair defect in sos 4 mutants. 1 -Aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid treatments promoted root hair formation in both wild-type and sos 4 plants, indicating that genetically SOS 4 functions upstream of ethylene and auxin in root hair development.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The startle reflex {{is a well}} {{established}} paradigm in psychophysiology. Reflex modulation by affective stimuli and {{the reaction of the}} heart rate are well known. Salt sensitivity is considered a risk factor for the development of primary hypertension later in life. One possible explanation for this heightened risk is an enhanced affective reactivity that also modulates cardiovascular reactions (presumably mediated by an over-reactive amygdala). Enhanced cardiovascular reactions to mental stress and enhanced affective modulation of the startle reflex have both been demonstrated in <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> subjects. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the cardiovascular reaction to startle stimuli and its modulation by affective stimuli in salt resistant and <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> normotensives. METHODS: 80 subjects were categorized as salt resistant and salt sensitive. To modulate the startle reflex, pictures from the categories pleasant, unpleasant and neutral from the international affective pictures system were used. Heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductance were recorded continuously. RESULTS: A heart rate and blood pressure rise followed the startle stimulus. The reaction of the heart rate was modulated by the valence of the pictures, but the blood pressure reaction was enhanced in pleasant and unpleasant context. <b>Salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> subjects had an enhanced modulation of the eye blink and heart rate reaction, but a smaller and less modulated blood pressure reaction. DISCUSSION: <b>Salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> subjects demonstrated an enhanced affective modulation of the heart rate reaction to startle stimuli. This finding supports the view of an over-reactive amygdala. The modulation of the blood pressure reaction to startle stimuli appears to be an indicator for the arousal that is elicited by the pictures. The smaller blood pressure reaction of <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> subjects could be explained by stimulus characteristics or by a less flexibile blood pressure reaction. An enhanced affective modulation of cardiovascular reactions, as well as a less flexible blood pressure regulation can contribute the development of primary hypertension later in life...|$|E

A strong influence of urinary kallikrein excretion on the salt sensitivity of blood pressure has been recently suggested in normotensive patients. To evaluate {{the relationship between}} kallikrein and salt sensitivity in essential hypertension, active kallikrein excretion, plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone levels were evaluated in 37 male hypertensives (mean age 43. 3 ± 4. 7 years) after two weeks on a normal NaCl diet (120 mmol NaCl per day). After kallikrein determination, salt sensitivity was assessed in a randomized cross-over double-blind fashion by evaluating the blood pressure response to a high (240 mmol NaCl per day for two weeks) and a low (40 mmol NaCl per day for 2 weeks) NaCl intake. Blood pressure changes were evaluated considering as baseline blood pressure the measurement taken {{at the end of}} the 2 weeks under normal NaCl intake. Patients were classified as <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> when a diastolic blood pressure change of 10 mm Hg or more occurred after both periods of low and high NaCl intake. At the end of the assessment of salt sensitivity, 19 hypertensive patients (mean age 43. 0 ± 4, 6 years) were <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> while 18 (mean age 43. 5 ± 4. 7 years) were classified as salt resistant. The urinary excretion of active kallikrein was significantly lower (P < 0. 0001) in <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> (0. 51 ± 0. 36 U/ 24 hr) than in salt resistant patients (1. 28 ± 0. 48 U/ 24 hr).

A range of experimental techniques is described, some unique to characean plants. Application of these methods provided electrical characteristics of membrane transporters, which dominate the membrane conductance under different outside conditions. With this considerable background knowledge the electrophysiology of <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> and salt tolerant genera can be compared under salt and/or osmotic stress. Both salt tolerant and <b>salt</b> <b>sensitive</b> Characeae show a rise in membrane conductance and simultaneous increase in Na+ influx upon exposure to saline medium. Salt tolerant Chara longifolia and Lamprothamnium sp. exhibit proton pump stimulation upon both turgor decrease and salinity increase, allowing the membrane PD to remain negative. The turgor is regulated through the inward K+ rectifier and 2 H+/Cl- symporter. Lamprothamnium plants can survive in hypersaline media up to twice seawater strength and withstand large sudden changes in salinity. Salt-sensitive Chara australis succumbs to 50 - 100 mM NaCl in few days. Cells exhibit no pump stimulation upon turgor decrease and at best transient pump stimulation upon salinity increase. Turgor is not regulated. The membrane PD exhibits characteristic noise upon exposure to salinity. Depolarization of membrane PD to excitation threshold sets off trains of action potentials, leading to further loses of K+ and Cl-.

The transmembrane region of SOS 1 has significant sequence similarities to plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporters from bacteria and fungi. Sequence analysis of various sos 1 mutant alleles reveals several residues and regions in the transmembrane {{as well as the}} tail parts that are critical for SOS 1 function in plant salt tolerance. SOS 1 gene expression in plants is up-regulated in response to NaCl stress. This up-regulation is abated in sos 3 or sos 2 mutant plants, suggesting that it is controlled by the SOS 3 /SOS 2 regulatory pathway...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} salt-sensitive signaling molecules on ionic fluxes and gene expression related to K+/Na+ homeostasis in a perennial herb, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, during short-term NaCl stress (100 mM, 24 h). Salt treatment caused more pronounced Na+ accumulation in root cells than in leaf cells. Na+ ions were mostly compartmentalized in vacuoles. Roots exposed to NaCl showed increased levels of extracellular ATP (eATP), cytosolic Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, and NO. Steady-state flux recordings revealed that these salt-sensitive signaling molecules enhanced NaCl-responsive Na+ efflux, due to the activated Na+/H+ antiport system in the plasma membrane (PM). Moreover, salt-elicited K+ efflux, which was mediated by depolarization-activated cation channels, was reduced {{with the addition of}} Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, NO, and eATP. The salt-adaptive effects of these molecules (Na+ extrusion and K+ maintenance) were reduced by pharmacological agents, including LaCl 3 (a PM Ca 2 + channel inhibitor), DMTU (a reactive oxygen species scavenger), cPTIO (an NO scavenger), or PPADS (an antagonist of animal PM purine P 2 receptors). RT-qPCR data showed that the activation of the PM Na+/H+ antiport system in salinized roots most likely resulted from the upregulation of two genes, GuSOS 1 and GuAHA, which encoded the PM Na+/H+ antiporter, <b>salt</b> overly <b>sensitive</b> 1 (SOS 1), and H+-ATPase, respectively. Clear interactions occurred between these salt-sensitive agonists to accelerate transcription of salt-responsive signaling pathway genes in G. uralensis roots. For example, Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, NO, and eATP promoted transcription of GuSOS 3 (<b>salt</b> overly <b>sensitive</b> 3) and/or GuCIPK (CBL-interacting protein kinase) to activate the predominant Ca 2 +-SOS signaling pathway in salinized liquorice roots. eATP, a novel player in the salt response of G. uralensis, increased the transcription of GuSOS 3, GuCIPK, GuRbohD (respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein D), GuNIR (nitrate reductase), GuMAPK 3, and GuMAPK 6 (the mitogen-activated protein kinases 3 and 6). Moreover, GuMAPK 3 and GuMAPK 6 expression levels were enhanced by H 2 O 2 in NaCl-stressed G. uralensis roots. Our results indicated that eATP triggered downstream components and interacted with Ca 2 +, H 2 O 2, and NO signaling to maintain K+/Na+ homeostasis. We propose that a multiple signaling network regulated K+/Na+ homeostasis in NaCl-stressed G. uralensis roots...|$|R
40|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) {{was used}} to define an aminosilane nanopatterned surface in order to electrostatically self-assemble gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The chemically modified nanopatterned surfaces were immersed into a Au NP solution to allow the Au NPs to self-assemble. Equilibrium self-assembly was achieved in only 20 Â¬â€ min. The number of Au NPs that self-assembled on an aminosilane dot was controlled by manipulating the diameters of both the Au NPs and the dots. Adding salt to the Au NP solution enabled the Au NPs to self-assemble in greater numbers on the same sized dot. However, {{the preparation of the}} Au NP solution containing <b>salt</b> was <b>sensitive</b> to spikes in the salt concentration. These spikes led to aggregation of the Au NPs and non-specific deposition of Au NPs on the substrate. The Au NP patterned surfaces were immersed in a sodium hydroxide solution in order to lift-off the patterned Au NPs, but no lift-off was observed without adequate physical agitation. The vanÂ¬â€ derÂ¬â€ Waals forces are too strong to allow for lift-off despite the absence of electrostatic forces...|$|R
