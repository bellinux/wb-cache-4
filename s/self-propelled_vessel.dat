40|$|The Reynolds Transport theorem {{for energy}} {{is used to}} study propeller-hull {{interaction}} effects by analyzing different components of energy flux through a control volume around a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vessel.</b> These components are the axial kinetic energy, the transversal kinetic energy, the turbulent kinetic energy, the internal energy and the pressure work. This energy balance approach is here used to study the influence of propeller diameter on the propulsive power. To this end, propellers of different diameters have been studied in behind condition. In {{order to keep the}} incoming wake into the propellers as simple as possible, an axi-symmetric hull shape is employed. The energy fluxes are calculated employing a RANS approach to solve the momentum transport and continuity equations together with the energy equation (the heat transfer equation in fluid).

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{the maximum amount of}} energy from tidal stream {{extraction}} devices, deployment in large arrays should be studied. The area of seabed with favorable conditions is fairly limited; therefore layout spacing has to be optimized. In this paper a feasibility study for a novel experimental facility, suitable for the testing of an array of tidal devices, is presented. To avoid space and scale limitations of towing tanks, testing is proposed to be performed in large lakes or calm seas using a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vessel,</b> which will carry an array of devices with variable spacing, creating relevant speed differences and measuring their performance and loading. Using hydrodynamic scaling laws, an appropriate size for test turbines and the range of vessel speed was determined to fulfill experimental requirements. Computational fluid dynamic simulations, using the actuator disc method, have suggested a suitable turbine array configuration to resemble real application conditions. A simplified model of the vessel was analyzed using the finite elements method to determine the main scantlings. The hull resistance calculated by empirical formulae was found to be negligible compared to the resistance of the tested turbine. It was confirmed that turbine size and speed determined by scaling laws are also reasonable from a propulsion point of view...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the propeller race on upstream and downstream self propelled AUVs. Initially simulations of a self-propelled hull are performed at the Reynolds Number 3. 2 x 10 ^ 6 with software commercial RANS code ANSYS CFX 12. 1, utilising a body force model to replicate the impact of the propeller utilising momentum source terms. This is then extended to consider a fleet of two self-propelled vehicles operating at a range of longitudinal offset and transverse separations. The results highlight that operation in close proximity to another <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vessel</b> has a significant impact of both the flow around the hull and drag experienced by the vehicle. A propeller race deduction is proposed to account for the increase in vehicle drag due to the propulsors of other vehicles. The propeller race deduction is dependent upon both longitudinal and transverse separation. From a vehicle or mission design perspective, it is important to correctly understand the true propulsive energy budget of the vehicle and its impact on both range and endurance. This study highlights the importance of considering both thrust deduction and any propeller race deductions when calculating the propulsive power consumption of an individual or fleet of vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. Most <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vessels</b> moving on, or under, the ocean surface, contain rotating machinery that radiate finite bandwidth signals into the water. Empirical {{evidence suggests that}} the signal bandwidth estimated with a far field receiver is often greater than expected. This thesis investigates the use of an acoustic propagation model to predict the received bandwidth of sinusoidal signals when both the source and the receiver are in motion. The bandwidth parameter is calculated from the multi-frequency transmission loss (TL) predicted with a re-written version of K. Smith's Monterey-Miami Parabolic Equation (MMPE) model, including both receiver and source motion. The results for various propagation environments allow exploration of the characteristics of received bandwidth, predicted from sources on the surface or at depth. The dependency of aggregate bandwidth upon conditional parameters such as range, depth, and normalized pressure are evaluated. In addition to modeling results, this thesis documents a new implementation of the MMPE model, for narrowband signals using only the MATLAB programming language. A MATLAB version has the inherent advantages of increased flexibility and portability. A MATLAB implementation of a range dependent ray trace function based upon a Runge-Kutta integration of the eikonal equations is also presented. Naval Postgraduate School author (civilian) ...|$|R

40|$|For {{seakeeping}} {{tests in}} a standard towing tank with self-propellet marine models, even in oblique waves, this paper proposes a model testing technique using tailored transient 'design' wave packets and vertical side wall wave absorbers. The method allows the determination of all motion transfer functions (RAO) by magnitude and phase in just one single model test. For model excitation wave packets are developed combining broad energy spectra in the relevant frequency domain {{as well as a}} short extension at the location of wave/model interaction. The proposed technique is baded on a fully automatic, computer controlled procedure which governs - the generation of a short, specially tailored wave train with a 'design' spectrum represented by the superposition of several thousands wave frequencies - the control of the speed of the carriage and of the model course. As a result, the model interacts with the wave train within a predetermined section of the tank which is equipped with vertical side wall wave absorbers for simulating an infinite tank width. The duration of a typical seakeeping test is about 5 minutes with a relevant time window of 10 - 20 seconds only. As the wave train is exactly defined in space and time, it is easy to transpose the registration to any position along the tank or on the moving vessel. Of course, wave trains are exactly repeatable. Thus, the wave/model interaction of towed or <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vessels</b> can be investigated at different speeds and at different positions in the tank using identical wave packets. The new technique is demonstrated by analyzing the motion behaviour of a towed high speed catamaran and a self-propelled monohull.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalSmall {{submersible}} vessels {{have been}} used for years by nation states, terrorist groups, and criminal organizations to achieve operational objectives. These entities have sought to capitalize on the overriding tactical advantage of submersible technology which is stealth. For example, drug trafficking organizations in Central and South America have been routinely using <b>self-propelled</b> semi-submersible <b>vessels</b> to clandestinely transport large quantities of illicit drugs to North America. Small submersible vessels can also be nefariously used in the maritime domain to transport persons or weapons or they could be used as waterborne improvised explosive devices. Terrorists and criminals are complex adaptive adversaries and are driven to innovate when confronted with threats to their operational effectiveness. Innovation and adaption are driving these foes to leverage disruptive technology towards the development or acquisition of fully-submersible vessels. Furthermore, there is a growing population of privately owned submersibles within the U. S. that policymakers have little visibility of. Homeland security policymakers lack adequate situational awareness regarding the vulnerabilities, threats, and consequences to the maritime transportation system from the malicious use of submersibles.
