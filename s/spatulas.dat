40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed {{finite element analysis}} of the adhesion of a gecko <b>spatula.</b> The gecko <b>spatulae</b> form {{the tips of the}} gecko foot hairs that transfer the adhesional and frictional forces between substrate and foot. The analysis is based on a parameterised description of the 3 D geometry of the <b>spatula</b> that only requires 12 parameters. The adhesion is described by a nonlinear computational contact formulation that accounts for the van der Waals interaction between <b>spatula</b> and substrate. The <b>spatula</b> adhesion model is implemented using an enriched contact finite element formulation recently developed by the first author. The finite element model is then used to simulate the peeling behaviour of the gecko <b>spatula</b> under applied vertical and rotational loading for various model parameters. Variations of the material stiffness, adhesional strength and range, stiction, <b>spatula</b> size and <b>spatula</b> inclination are considered to account for the natural variation of <b>spatula</b> properties. The study demonstrates that the <b>spatula</b> can function over a wide range of conditions. The computed pull-off forces are in agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. The study also examines the energy required for the <b>spatula</b> pull-off. The proposed model is ideal to study the influence of substrate roughness on the <b>spatula</b> adhesion, as is finally demonstrated...|$|R

25|$|The exact findspots of many objects {{retrieved}} {{during the}} 1920s excavations {{could no longer}} be reconstructed due to the poor publication standards, so that many can only be dated by comparing them with what has been found at other sites that do have a good stratigraphy and chronological control.

These included an adze, a fish-hook and a small pendant {{in the shape of a}} goose. A particular type of stone vessel with ledge handles and a rim decorated by incised rectangles has so far not been found at any other site. The function of a number of flat polished stones incised with lines forming a cross is uncertain, but it has been suggested that they were used as bolas. They are common in Uruk period sites. Because clay as a raw material is widely available around Jemdet Nasr, clay objects are very common. Clay objects included baked clay bricks, clay sickels, fragments of drain pipes, <b>spatulas,</b> spindle whorls and miniature wagon wheels.

Miniature boxes, flutes and other items are a speciality of a community called Nith in the Ixmiquuilpan municipality. Molango is noted for its guitars. Tenango is noted for the making of wooden utensils such as spoons and <b>spatulas.</b> Pottery production is categorized by the type of clay used. [...] In the Tulancingo Valley, the clay type is known as [...] "chapopote" [...] and is mostly worked into pots, comals and other cooking items. Huejutla is known for its [...] "barro blanco" [...] (white clay), also used to make items for cooking. In Huasca de Ocampo red clay is abundant. [...] In Chililico, the clay is ochre and typically painted with images of birds and flowers. The Mezquital Valley and the Comarca Minera area makes a type of pottery which is not glazed, mostly for utilitarian items. In some areas, such as Tulancingo and Chapantongo, Talavera type glazed pottery is also made. Metalworking comes from the state's mining past, where materials such as gold, silver, copper and iron are worked into jewelry, pots, jars, utensils, and railing. Areas best known for their metal working are Pachuca and Real del Monte (jewelry), The Sierra Alta and Tizapán (copper items) and the Mezquital Valley for ironwork.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} yield of different sampling devices used in cervical screening. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised and quasi-randomised studies. SETTING: All randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing the yield of cytological or histological abnormalities when {{two or more}} different sampling devices were used. SUBJECTS: 85, 000 patients included in 29 studies reported in 28 papers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pooled relative risk and 95 % confidence interval of the yield of mild dysplasia or worse in smears recovered by each sampling method versus each other method with which it was compared; sensitivity or positive predictive value, or both, of cytological versus histological results in six studies from which sufficient data were available.

This question is important due to lingering concerns over the value of EC detection to a satisfactory Pap test. Methods: 20, 125 SPPT vials were examined for the collection devices contained. The SPPT collection device combinations allowed were: Rovers Cervex-Brush (broom, FDA approved), Medscand Pap Perfect <b>Spatula</b> &#x 002 B; Medscand CytoBrush Plus GT (<b>spatula</b> &#x 002 B; GT brush, FDA approved) or Rovers Cervex-Brush &#x 002 B; Surgipath C-E Brush (broom &#x 002 B; CE brush, off label). Results: Examination of SPPT vials revealed 11, 130 collected with the broom, 4, 687 collected with the <b>spatula</b> &#x 002 B; GT brush and 2, 921 collected with the broom &#x 002 B; CE brush.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between nonspatula (cotton swab and Cytobrush) cervical sampling methods and <b>spatula</b> (wooden Ayre <b>spatula</b> and plastic extended-tip Szalay Cyto-Spatula) sampling methods {{was made in}} 109 cases. Based {{on the presence of}} endocervical cells, there were statistically significant qualitative differences between the nonspatula methods as well as between the <b>spatula</b> methods, but riot between the Cytobrush and Cyto-Spatula smears or the cotton swab and Ayrespatula smears. In all kinds of inflammatory lesions, the <b>spatula</b> samples were more accurate and diagnostic than the nonspatula ones. In all cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and in most cases of squamous metaplasia, the Cyto-Spatula sample was the most accurate. It is concluded that the Szalay Cyto-Spatula method is superior to the other cervical sampling methods because it provides well-preserved cells from both the endocervix and the ectocervix in one smear. The Cytobrush should be used in conjunction with <b>spatula</b> sampling (combination method) for effective sampling of the cervix.

2500|$|During the Middle Ages spathula {{was used}} to refer to the {{shoulder}} blade. Spathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad, two-edged sword without a point, broad, flat, wooden instrument for stirring any liquid, a spattle, <b>spatula</b> [...] or spathe of the palm tree [...] and its diminutive used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork [...] or a little palmbranch. The English word <b>spatula</b> is actually derived from Latin <b>spatula,</b> an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive spatha can be translated as English <b>spatula,</b> while its Latin diminutive <b>spatula</b> is not translated as English <b>spatula.</b> Latin spatha is derived from ancient Greek σπάθη. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin to its origin than <b>spatula.</b> Ancient Greek σπάθη has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer to a <b>spatula</b> or to the broad blade of a sword., but also to the blade of an oar. The aforementioned πλάται for shoulder blades was also used for blades of an oar. Concordantly σπάθη was also {{used to refer to}} the shoulder blade. Interestingly, the English word spade, as well as the Dutch equivalent spade [...] is cognate with σπάθη. Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. Pala is probably related to the Latin verb pandere, to spread out, [...] and to extend. This verb is thought to be derived from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. Σπάθη is actually derived from the similar root spē(i), that means to extend. It seems that os latum scapularum, ὠμοπλάτη, πλάται, pala, spathula and σπάθη all refer to the same aspect of the shoulder blade, i.e. being a flat, broad blade, with the latter three words etymological related to each other.|$|R
