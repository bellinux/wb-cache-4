5|$|While {{policies}} {{were brought in}} to improve the living conditions of the working classes, conversely many middle-class Bolivians {{felt that they had}} seen their social standing decline, with Morales personally mistrusting the middle-classes, deeming them fickle. A 2006 law reallocated state-owned lands, with this agrarian reform entailing distributing land to traditional communities rather than individuals. In 2010, a law was introduced permitting the formation of recognised indigenous territories, although the implementation of this was hampered by bureaucracy and contesting claims over ownership. Morales' regime also sought to improve women's rights in Bolivia. In 2010, it founded a Unit of Depatriarchalization to oversee this process. Further seeking to provide legal recognition and support to LGBT rights, it declared June 28 to be <b>Sexual</b> <b>Minority</b> Rights Day in the country, and encouraged the establishment of a gay-themed television show on the state channel.|$|E

2500|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} indicates that exposure to distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in <b>sexual</b> <b>minority</b> populations. While <b>sexual</b> <b>minority</b> stress and gender minority stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with gender minority stress, some researchers have suggested that <b>sexual</b> <b>minority</b> stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender non-binary individuals. [...] For example, LGB youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others. Concealing such personal information causes significant psychological distress, including intrusive thoughts about the secret, shame and guilt, anxiety, and isolation from other members of the minority group. Internalized homophobia is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals. [...] It refers to the internalization of negative social views about homosexuality, which leads to self-hatred and poor self-regard. As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGB individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward same-sex attraction. Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among <b>sexual</b> <b>minority</b> individuals. [...] Rejection sensitivity refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status. [...] Among <b>sexual</b> <b>minority</b> individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety. [...] Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGB individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.|$|E

2500|$|Proximal {{stressors}} are internal {{processes that}} are presumed to occur following exposure to distal stressors.

40|$|This {{theoretical}} {{study examines}} {{the causes and}} socio-historical factors behind male-perpetrated violence against <b>sexual</b> <b>minorities</b> in Uganda. Violence against <b>sexual</b> <b>minorities</b> is a widely overlooked societal problem in Uganda, {{as it is in}} many areas of the world where homosexual acts are criminalized. As <b>sexual</b> <b>minorities</b> gain visibility and seek basic human rights in their country, they are met with a violent backlash fueled by homophobia and heterosexist ideology. Most of these acts of violence are committed by males, and many go unreported. While various theorists have explored how homophobia, heterosexism and patriarchy play a role in violence against <b>sexual</b> <b>minorities,</b> I believe there is much more to the picture, especially in a country like Uganda with a complicated colonial past. In this study I examine factors that may cause this homophobic violence through two theoretical lenses: studies of masculinity, and studies of violence. Through both lenses I analyze why males are conditioned in patriarchal societies to commit acts of violence, why these acts of violence are often directed at <b>sexual</b> <b>minorities,</b> and how the long history of colonialism and the continued influences of neo-colonialism and international power dynamics continue to shape the situation in Uganda today...|$|R
