5|$|A key <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs {{not on the}} genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases {{the power of the}} study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{process of}} acceptance {{back into the}} Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much {{in tune with the}} Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E

5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han.

This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers {{are able to}} buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E

5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathway.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century.
