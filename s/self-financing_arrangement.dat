In the first stage the firms choose {{whether or not to}} engage in costly research that generates technological improvements that spill over to the other firms in the cluster. The more firms engaged in research the richer or more profitable is the pool of knowledge that spills over. In the second stage after the knowledge spillovers have occurred, firms compete in quantities. We solve for the symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium to the first stage of the game, and find that too low a degree of concentration in the cluster will destroy firmsâ€™ incentives to undertake research and so the cluster risks stagnation. We explore whether a merger can stimulate research activity by increasing concentration in the cluster. Finally, we consider a public policy response to stagnation and analyze whether a direct public subsidy to stimulate research is preferable to a <b>self-financing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 2004 Agglomeration, clusters, mergers, perfect spillovers,...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} index-based {{safety nets}} aimed at assuring participants a minimum income {{at the village}} level, set by a prespecified poverty line. The participating villages collectively manage a pooled budget, offering an index-based per capita indemnity to the villages financed from a uniform per hectare premium, possibly supplemented by an external subsidy. The scheme involves implicit cross-subsidies {{in favor of the}} poorest villages. Otherwise, it focuses on covariate risk, leaving it to mutual arrangements to deal with intravillage idiosyncratic risk. Its design is obtained from a risk-minimizing model for the collective of villages with constraints of two kinds. The first is the budget that ensures that payments receive adequate finances. The second concerns the set of admissible schedules requiring that payments are triggered by a flexible function of only a few variables. For this we propose a semiparametric form from kernel learning, noting its capacity to combine a priori on the impact of shocks via the parametric term, with a flexible fit to the data at hand via the nonparametric term. To test the approach, we estimate and simulate an index-based safety net for northern Ghana, constructing a pseudovillage panel from four rounds of household surveys and assembling all villages in a single risk pool. Results of a fully <b>self-financed</b> <b>arrangement</b> indicate a reduction by 20 percentage points of the poverty incidence from an initial level of 63 % and are robust under resampling. Yet, for the given typology of villages, this arrangement requires an unrealistically high premium and large cross-subsidies. We show that both can be reduced significantly when a moderate external subsidy is allowed for. Nonetheless, in all cases, the basis risk remains considerable, reflecting the limited capacity of the selected price and weather variables to eliminate poverty.
