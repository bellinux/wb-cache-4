500|$|The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch {{had little}} grass, {{perhaps as a}} result of earlier wet weather. [...] Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his {{spinning}} partner, Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459runs. [...] In reply, the Australians could not {{come to grips with the}} conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to follow-on. [...] A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170runs. [...] Laker's performance was historic. [...] He took 10/53, the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. [...] With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19wickets for the match, still a world record in first-class cricket. [...] Wisden reported that the Australians were [...] "extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> own purpose." [...] Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: [...] "When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain." [...] The media reported that Australia had been [...] "Lakered".|$|E
2500|$|... "A. {{tries to}} justify himself {{by saying that}} {{everyone}} did it, which doesn't {{seem to me to}} be a good defense at all. It is too much in the two-wrongs-make-a-right plan to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> humble servant." ...|$|E

60|$|Pray {{consult your}} own {{convenience}} {{in the matter}} of my little commission; whatever <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> engagements and prospects will best suit me.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is very good," [...] I replied. I {{could not}} {{resist the temptation to}} add, [...] "I had an idea Asquith rather <b>suited</b> <b>your</b> {{purposes}} just now." ...|$|R
2500|$|Laker {{dismissed}} Miller for six, {{his only}} scoring shot being a strike over the fence. Australia fell from 0/48 {{to be all}} out for 84, with Laker taking 9/37. Australia were forced to follow on and Miller was tormented for 15 minutes before being bowled for a duck by Laker, who took an unprecedented 10/53 at Test level to take a world record 19wickets as Australia lost by an innings and 170 runs. Australia's misery was compounded by regular rain interruptions during their innings, which turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Wisden reported that the Australians were said [...] "to be extremely bitter over {{the condition of the}} pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "This pitch is a complete disgrace" [...] while opening batsman Colin McDonald later said, [...] "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> own purpose." [...] During the Tests at Headingley and Old Trafford, Laker and Lock bowled two thirds of the overs and took 38 of the 40 Australian wickets.|$|E

60|$|There {{are more}} ways {{of running a}} horse to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> book than pulling his head off in the straight. Some men forget this.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you are an}} ape {{you will}} do as the apes would do--leave one of your kind {{to die in the}} jungle if it <b>suited</b> <b>your</b> whim to go elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "And we'll sail {{the first}} of the week, or any other time that <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> convenience, Mrs. Strong," [...] {{concluded}} the big-hearted Englishman, as though the thing were all arranged except the sailing date.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Ripon said sharply; [...] "a cane is {{the thing}} which <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> {{understanding}} best. Well, perhaps he will indulge you; obstinate idleness {{is one of the}} things he mentioned in the address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not an Irish name,” {{the captain}} snapped sharply. “O’Toole or McCarthy would <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> mug a damn sight better. Unless, very likely, there’s an Irishman in your mother’s woodpile.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "I {{suppose you}} feel quite certain that Miss Drane {{is a young}} woman who will <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> {{temperament}} and your general intellectual needs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{returned}} the massive gentleman, assuming {{with the help}} of a large umbrella a quite Johnsonian attitude, [...] "I decline to alter my manners to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> taste." ...|$|E
6000|$|Though modern {{practice}} sometimes differs quite, [...] 'Tis {{just as well}} {{to think}} before you write; [...] Let every book that <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> theme be read, [...] So shall you trace it to the fountain-head.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to my love, {{there can}} be no change in that. If it <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> mother to be disdainful to me, I can bear it. I always thought that it would come to be so some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he {{has been}} a kind master. He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but that would hardly have <b>suited</b> <b>your</b> plans, would it, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such doctrines may <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> present purposes," [...] said Wellmere, with a sneer; [...] "but I {{apprehend}} it {{is opposed}} to all the opinions and practices of civilized nations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{friends were}} here yesterday," [...] {{returned}} Miss Trotter dryly, [...] "but I did {{not interfere with}} them until I thought they had stayed long enough to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{preparation}} {{they find}} beneficial at sea, though I {{do not think}} it would <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> case," [...] he said, and Oliviera roused himself to a further effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my gallant young knight," [...] {{the king}} exclaimed, [...] "I am right {{glad to see}} you with me. We shall have more {{fighting}} before we have done, and I know that that <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> mood as well as my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, well," [...] said Miriam impatiently; [...] "but {{leave me}} now; for to speak plainly, my good friend, you grow a little wearisome. I walk this {{afternoon}} in the Borghese grounds. Meet me there, if it <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cannonading <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> spirits excellently; I {{remember}} your {{telling me that}} you had tried and liked it. But there is to be no more of it, I have other plans for you. Before I mention them tell me of the interview with Garibaldi." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CORINTHIA. Silence, woman. The {{position}} {{and functions of}} a wife may <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> gross nature. An Egeria is exactly what I desire to be. (To Balsquith.) Can you play accompaniments? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{premiums}} {{for such a}} sum, if any office would have you, which I very much doubt, would come to close on five hundred a year. That would hardly <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> book." ...|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL (smiling). If {{my nature}} {{had been made}} to <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> {{comprehension}} rather than my own requirements, I am afraid I would have made a very poor figure in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't," [...] she retorted. [...] "I {{never heard}} such nonsense! As if I could {{allow you to}} use the private door of this house just as it <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> fancy. If {{you want to come}} in to-night and say good-bye, you must come in by the front door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, weel, my lord--I {{speak it}} with humility;" [...] (never did Richie look with more starched dignity {{than when he}} uttered the word;) [...] "but {{do you think this}} dicing and card-shuffling, and {{haunting}} of taverns and playhouses, <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> lordship--for I am sure it does not suit me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look 'ee, Ned England," [...] says he, [...] "what I've {{got to say}} is this: you're {{carrying}} {{things with}} too high a hand to suit us easy-going fellows. D'ye think you're king or emperor, and that we're nigger slaves, that you knock us about as it <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> humor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{that will}} <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> complexion, you know, {{better than the}} old scarlet one. I know Mrs. Sharp will be more {{in love with you}} than ever when she sees you in the new one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no trouble, I assure you; but <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> own convenience," [...] {{said the}} thief, carelessly. Then he cast his eye toward {{the cave and}} asked: [...] "What will you do with all our treasure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whenever you please, monsieur. It {{is for you}} to {{say when}} it will <b>suit</b> <b>your</b> {{convenience}} to kill me. I think that was the intention you announced, was it not?" [...] Andre-Louis was suavity itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye are masters, gentlemen; help yourselves to {{whatever}} best <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> inclinations. My dwelling, my goods, and my wards, are alike at your disposal--or, perhaps Miss Alice here, good and kind Miss Alice Dunscombe, may suit {{the taste of}} some among ye! Ah! Edward Griffith! Edward Griffith! little did I ever--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Miss March should {{agree to}} come," [...] she said, [...] "it might be {{pleasant}} {{for you to}} make one of her party and ride over at the same time. However, I'll let you know if she is coming, and then you can join her or not, as <b>suits</b> <b>your</b> convenience." ...|$|R
5000|$|Apology close: {{in which}} the {{salesperson}} apologizes for not yet closing the sale. [...] "I owe you an apology.
