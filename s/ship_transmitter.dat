Previous studies considered radiation hazard safety assessment for marine vessels with {{a limited number of}} transmitters, such as very high-frequency (VHF) transceivers, radar and communication transmitters. In our investigation, EF levels from seven radio transmitters were measured, including: VHF, medium frequency/high frequency (MF/HF), satellite communication (Sat-Com C), AISnavigation, radar X-band and radar S-band. Measurements were carried out in a 40 m-long, three-level ship (upper deck, bridge deck and bridge roof) at 12 different locations. We developed a new data-collection protocol and performed it under 11 different scenarios to observe and measure the radiation emissions from all of the transmitters. In total, 528 EF field measurements were collected and averaged over all three levels of the marine ship with RF transmitters: the measured electric fields were the lowest on the upper deck (0. 82 – 0. 86 V/m), the highest on the bridge roof (2. 15 – 3. 70 V/m) and in between on th...|$|R

The measured EF levels were then assessed for compliance with the occupational and general public reference levels of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) standards. The ICNIRP and the ARPANSA limits for the general public were exceeded on the bridge roof; nevertheless, the occupational limits were respected everywhere. The measured EF levels, hence, complied with the ICNIRP guidelines and the ARPANSA standards. In this paper, we provide a new data collection model for future surveys, which could be conducted with larger samples to verify our observations. Furthermore, this new method could be useful as a reference for researchers and industry professionals without direct access to the necessary equipment. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

50|$|The ship {{stranded}} {{high up on}} {{the beach}} and it took until 7 April before they managed to turn the ship and get the bow pointing towards the sea. It had already been planned to organize a large demonstration on the Binnenhof in The Hague to convince members of parlement not to support new legislation that would outlaw off-shore radio stations. In support of this Radio Veronica needed to be on air during the demonstration the management of Veronica accepted an offer from competitor Radio Caroline to use her <b>ship</b> and <b>transmitter</b> if Veronica assisted in repairing the equipment on board of the ship Mi-Amigo.In the early hours of 18 April, exactly the day of the planned demonstration in The Hague, tugboats managed to get the Norderney back afloat and she was brought back to her original position, some 6 nautical miles from the coast - just outside the territorial waters. At around 16:00 that day the Norderney was back in service and Radio Veronica could be received via her own frequency on the 538 meter-band as well as on 259 meter via the transmitter of Radio Caroline.|$|R

2500|$|By 1957 {{there were}} 1,300 Norwegian <b>ships</b> with HF <b>transmitters</b> and Bergen Radio handled {{half a million}} telegrams per year. There were 5,000 {{telephone}} calls transmitted via the coast radio stations. The demand exceeded the capacity, so the Telegraphy Administration decided {{to build a new}} main HF telegraphy station. Rogaland Radio was located in Sandnes, south of Stavanger, with the receiver and offices located at Høyland and the sender located at Nærbø, [...] away. The facilities cost NOK6 million and also took over Stavanger Radio's MF services. Up to nineteen operators were on duty at any given time. Its traffic peaked at half a million annual telegrams during the first decade, but the experienced a significant drop. An important reason was the 1971 introduction of the radio telex, which could be handled automatically instead of by an operator. An important driver of the telex traffic was the petroleum industry in the North Sea. Telex traffic peaked at 550,000 sent minutes in the late 1970s. Radio telegraphy and radio telex was from then gradually replaced with Inmarsat, a communications satellite system, with Eik Earth Station in Rogaland being Europe's first ground station for Inmarsat.|$|R
40|$|International audience— This article {{presents}} the simulation {{structure for the}} MODENA project [1] and illustrates what should become an original dynamical model for the reflectivity map of the sea surface. From our point of view, MODENA challenges to find accurate models for simulating dynamically interaction between sea state, sonar, radar and ship, while keeping physical coherency during the whole observation scenario (several tens of minutes), including human participation in this virtual reality system. To deal with such a complexity, as it is impossible and inappropriate to compute dynamically hydrodynamic, electromagnetic and acoustic equations on an accurate grid of points or mesh, MODENA simulation structure aims to use an autonomy based approach: the model of each phenomenon (wave, breaking, group, <b>ship,</b> wind, stream, <b>transmitter,</b> receiver [...] .) involved in the simulation {{is seen as an}} autonomous entity, including an autonomy of time, space and scale. These models are combined and animated using enaction-based multi-agents simulation. In such simulation, computer activity is optimised at places where and when interaction occurs within revelant scale, according to choosen models. Furthermore, to add new phenomena or to modify existing models do not make previous work obsolete, as one has only to characterise interactions of new phenomena with previously defined models. This modeling approach facilitates interaction between research teams involved in the MODENA project, as the whole simulation results from the set of autono-mized models developed by each team in parallel. Such a virtual laboratory should help for example to better distinguish the signal of breaking from the signal of small boats, in the dynamical signature of sea-states. I. INTRODUCTION We present in this paper the simulation structure for the MODENA project [1] and illustrates what should become an original dynamical model for the reflectivity map of the sea surface. From our point of view, MODENA challenges to find accurate models for simulating dynamically interaction between sea state, sonar, radar and ship, while keeping physical coherency during the whole observation scenario (several tens of minutes), including human participation in such a virtual reality system [3]. In such a virtual laboratory, for example, one can easily compare a SAR " Omega-K " rebuilt image resulting from a lighning by a virtual X-band radar with a picture of the same virtual scene (Fig. 1). However most of classical simulations are based on a static sea surface description [4], thus can poorly deal with dynamical properties of the interacting localised phenomena involved, nor it can deal with unpredictable behaviour of human experimenters riding a boat or a plane in the scenario. Moreover, the computatio...|$|R

While awaiting clarification of the situation, he decided to seize Roda as a prize and move his own and the German ship to [...] further to the south. An eight-man prize crew was despatched to Roda with instructions to replace the German flag with the Norwegian naval ensign, disable the <b>ship's</b> radio <b>transmitter,</b> and order the German captain to move to Riskafjord. After the German captain had refused to follow the instructions of the prize crew, Bruun threatened him with opening fire, but the crew on Roda kept delaying while awaiting the coming German invasion.By 06:00 Bruun concluded that it was taking too long for Roda to start her engines, and decided to sink the German ship. Although still not certain about which warring party was attacking Norway, and out of contact with his superiors and other military units, Bruun wanted to end the situation and free up his ship for other tasks. After Bruun had recalled his prize crew and ordered the German crew to abandon ship in their lifeboats, he ordered his gunners to sink the German vessel. Æger first fired 25 [...] "cold" [...] 10 cm rounds (non-explosive shells intended for use as warning shots rather than warfare) into Rodas starboard side, then a further 25 cold rounds into the German ship's port side. Before Rodas captain abandoned ship, he radioed a message describing the situation. Picked up by another German ship in the area, , the message had been relayed to the invasion headquarters in Hamburg, Germany. The crew of Æger was stunned by Bruun's order to open fire, which he had to repeat three times before they carried it out. By 08:00 Roda was sinking slowly, finally disappearing beneath the surface by the afternoon of 9 April and settling at a depth of 50 m.Shortly after shelling Roda, Æger observed German aircraft, sightings which revealed the identity of the invaders. Æger opened fire at the aircraft with her anti-aircraft armament. The first wave of German aircraft avoided Æger, but soon after 8-10 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers from the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 4, thought by Bruun to have been called in by Rodas captain, attacked Æger with machine-gun fire and bombs. The Ju 88s had been attacking Sola Airport, before turning their attention to Æger. Although the German military headquarters in Germany knew of Æger, the Luftwaffe bombers off Stavanger most likely attacked because Æger had opened fire first. Bruun made evasive manoeuvres in the [...] off Stavanger and headed for the more open waters of the nearby Byfjorden. The anti-aircraft gunners on Æger returned fire at the German bombers, and claimed to have downed two of them. At 08:30 Æger was struck by a German 250 kg bomb midships, which wrecked the destroyer, killing eight crew members and wounding a further three. As the destroyer was dead in the water and appeared to be sinking, Bruun ordered his crew to man the lifeboats and abandon ship in order to {{make their way to the}} island of Hundvåg. The German bombers kept attacking the stationary Æger until Bruun ordered the ship's colours to be struck. The wreck of Æger later drifted ashore on Hundvåg. Following the loss of Æger, Bruun initially retained command of the 57 unwounded survivors of his crew, with the intent of bringing them as a unit to join up with other forces fighting the German invasion elsewhere in Norway. Initially Bruun tried to locate and join up with the local land forces commanded by Colonel Spørck. As German forces were in control of the Stavanger area and were blocking communications, Bruun eventually dismissed his crew on 11 April, instructing them to make their way in small groups out of the area to continue the fight. Some members of the crew managed to escape the Stavanger region and fight in other areas of South Norway.|$|R
