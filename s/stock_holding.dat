This would include the monitoring of material moved {{into and out of}} stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include ABC analysis, lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing <b>stock</b> <b>holding</b> and handling costs.|$|E

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{hemorrhage}} is {{a leading}} preventable cause of mortality following mass casualty events (MCEs). Improving outcomes requires adequate in-hospital provision of high volume red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. This study investigated strategies for optimizing RBC provision to casualties in MCEs using simulation modeling. Methods: A computerized simulation model of a UK major trauma centre (TC) transfusion system was developed. The model used input data from past MCEs, civilian and military trauma registries. We simulated the effect of varying on-shelf RBC <b>stock</b> <b>hold</b> and the timing of externally restocking RBC supplies on TC treatment capacity across increasing loads of priority one (P 1) and two (P 2) casualties from an event. Results: 35, 000 simulations were performed. A casualty load of 20 P 1 & 2 s under standard TC RBC stock conditions left 35 % (95 % CI 32 - 38) of P 1 s and 7 % (4 - 10) of P 2 s inadequately treated for hemorrhage. Additionally, exhaustion of type O emergency RBC stocks (a surrogate for reaching surge capacity) occurred in a median of 10 hours (IQR 5 -> 12). Doubling casualty load increased this to 60 % (57 - 63) and 30 % (26 - 34) respectively with capacity reached in 2 hours (1 - 3). The model identified a minimum requirement of 12 U of on-shelf RBCs per P 1 / 2 casualty received to prevent surge capacity being reached. Restocking supplies in an MCE versus greater permanent on-shelf RBC <b>stock</b> <b>holds</b> was considered at increasing hourly intervals. T-test analysis showed no difference between <b>stock</b> <b>hold</b> versus supply restocking in terms of overall outcomes for MCEs up to 80 P 1 & 2 s in size (p< 0. 05), provided the restock occurred within 6 hours. Conclusion: Even limited sized MCEs threaten to overwhelm TC transfusion systems. An earlyautomated push approach to restocking RBCs initiated by central suppliers can produce equivocal outcomes compared with <b>holding</b> excess <b>stock</b> permanently at TCs...|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, like Thailand, Vietnam uses minimum export prices. However, it {{does not}} subsidize the price the farmer receives for their rice {{which is what the}} pledging program essentially does. The absence of a program similar to the pledging program in Vietnam may explain why Vietnamese rice export prices are more related to other export rice markets than Thai prices according to the study’s results. This is because such a policy would require the government to distort trade volumes through holding on to vast sums of rice in public <b>stock</b> <b>holds.</b>|$|R

50|$|The risk-free {{interest}} rate is highly {{significant in the}} context of the general application of modern portfolio theory which is based on the capital asset pricing model.

In revenue ruling 94-28, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) explains that the principle behind §246(c)(4) is to deny credit toward the 45-day holding period for any period during which the taxpayer is protected from the risk of loss inherent in the ownership of an equity interest.|$|R
30|$|Lastly, {{we look at}} the {{correlation}} among assets.

On the other hand, {{the correlation}} is negative for the decision of <b>holding</b> <b>stock</b> and the decision of holding housing and between the decision of <b>holding</b> <b>stock</b> and the decision of holding debt. The decision of holding safe assets is negatively correlated with that of holding housing and positively correlated with that of holding debt. The decision of holding housing is positively correlated with that of holding debt, as they are the decisions of holding pension plans and debt.|$|R
