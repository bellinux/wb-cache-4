5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> daughter-in-law's behaviour; he {{sent the}} Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a {{solution}} to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's reminders that the book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns {{received}} significant {{praise from}} reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it [...] "a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan" [...] and USA Today describing the prose as [...] "achingly beautiful". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini [...] " [...] {{the power of}} emotion as few other popular writers do". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling {{a certain kind of}} story, in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't gloss over the horrors his characters live through, but <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> direct, explanatory style and the sense that you are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rocket Scientist Geoff Daly {{confirmed}} {{that he had}} written to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board in July 2013 urging them to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> safety concerns over SpaceShipTwo. [...] "Even the company's own engineers privately doubted that their venture was safe." [...] Daly's concerns centered around the use of nitrous oxide in the hybrid propulsion system, although the final NTSB report does not indicate the propulsion system contributed to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|He {{married his}} second wife, Yvonne Spenceley Gibb, on 17 October 1975. They had two children, Adam and Samantha Gibb, and their {{marriage}} lasted until his death. Maurice's alcoholic nadir came in 1991, {{when he pulled}} a gun on {{his wife and kids}} after a month-long bender. [...] She left him and immediately went over to brother Barry's house, refusing to come back until he had done <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> drinking. Maurice went into rehab, calling Yvonne telling her he was going to stay because he really wanted to stop drinking. [...] She said that was the call she had been waiting for.|$|E
2500|$|From Ankara, Yapıcıoğlu went to Çorlu, {{where his}} brother owned a shop. He set his brother's shop on fire {{because he did}} not give him pocket money. He also set the houses of two other {{relatives}} on fire. He raided his father's home in Silivri with intent to kill him, but his father defended himself with a pump-action shotgun. He fled from there to Edremit, where his maternal grandmother lived. Three days later, Yapıcıoğlu killed her by hitting her [...] head with a crystal ashtray, because she had told him <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> mother (her daughter) that he did not like. His mother {{died of a heart attack}} two days later, upon learning about this incident.|$|E

2500|$|Orbison determinedly pursued {{his second}} chance at stardom, but he {{expressed}} amazement at his success: [...] "It's {{very nice to}} be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it." [...] He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, {{as well as the}} newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave Rolling Stone magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted Martin Sheen to play him in a biopic. In November 1988, Mystery Girl was completed, and Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains and said he would have to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> health, but he never did. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in Antwerp, where footage for the video for [...] "You Got It" [...] was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E
