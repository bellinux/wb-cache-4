30|$|For {{energies}} {{lower than}} 600 eV, no dot-like patterns are observed. In other words, the threshold energy for GaAs nanoscale dots formation is near 600 eV for 300 s Ar+ <b>sputtering.</b> Even though the threshold energy {{has so far}} eluded theoretical proof, its existence and characteristic can still be predicted and justified based on current <b>sputtering</b> theory. From what has been reported by Facsko et al. [10] and Bobek et al. [19], there exists an onset time to let the <b>sputtered</b> surface enter the early time QD formation regime at a fixed <b>sputtering</b> energy. This can be interpreted as: for a given <b>sputtering</b> time and varying <b>sputtering</b> energy, there exists the possibility that this <b>sputtering</b> duration is not long enough for some low <b>sputtering</b> energies to initiate dot formation, or these energies are below the threshold energy. <b>Sputtering</b> time and energy are two relative concepts. A shorter <b>sputtering</b> time could need higher <b>sputtering</b> energy {{to achieve the same}} outcome as in longer <b>sputtering</b> time but lower <b>sputtering</b> energy. Furthermore, by putting this temporal concept into the energy dependency, {{it is not difficult to}} conclude that in the ion induced diffusion regime, the ion energy against characteristic wavelength profile can be shifted by the <b>sputtering</b> time. With the same ion energy, longer <b>sputtering</b> time leads to smaller threshold energy and longer characteristic wavelength, yet the profile moves upwards.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sputtering</b> {{observed}} to occur below the threshold energy of physical <b>sputtering</b> is also often called chemical <b>sputtering.</b> The mechanisms behind such <b>sputtering</b> {{are not always}} well understood, and {{may be hard to}} distinguish from chemical etching.
