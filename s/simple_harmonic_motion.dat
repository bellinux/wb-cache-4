2500|$|Flutter is {{a dynamic}} {{instability}} of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a linear system, 'flutter point' is {{the point at which}} the structure is undergoing <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>motion</b> - zero net damping - and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a self-oscillation and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: hard flutter, in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and soft flutter, in which the net damping decreases gradually. Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method.

40|$|An {{aeroelastic}} {{analysis is}} developed which has general application to {{all types of}} axial-flow turbomachinery blades. The approach is based on linear modal analysis, where the blade's dynamic response is represented as a linear combination of contributions from each of its in-vacuum free vibrational modes. A compressible linearized unsteady potential theory is used to model the flow over the oscillating blades. The two-dimensional unsteady flow is evaluated along several stacked axisymmetric strips along the span of the airfoil.

40|$|The planar {{transverse}} bending {{behavior of a}} uniform cantilevered beam with rigid tip body subject to constant axial base acceleration was analyzed. The beam is inextensible and capable of small elastic {{transverse bending}} deformations only. Two classes of tip bodies are recognized: (1) mass centers located along the beam tip tangent line; and (2) mass centers with arbitrary offset towards the beam attachment point. The steady state response is studied for the beam end condition cases: free, tip mass, tip body with restricted mass center offset, and tip body with arbitrary mass center offset. The first three cases constitute classical Euler buckling problems, and the characteristic equation for the critical loads/accelerations are determined. For the last case a unique steady state solution exists. The free vibration response is examined for the two classes of tip body. The characteristic equation, eigenfunctions and their orthogonality properties are obtained for the case of restricted mass center offset. The vibration problem is nonhomogeneous for the case of arbitrary mass center offset.

40|$|Abstract. A single-buoy {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) consisting of double hydraulic cylinders is designed to promote the conversion power of traditional oscillating buoy WEC by absorbing the energy of pitching motion. On the condition of linear, regular waves, the nonlinear coupled equations of the pitching-heaving motions of buoy and energy conversion expressions are deduced with a wave incident angle of zero. Then the motion characteristics and power responses are analyzed. Calculations indicate that the heaving and pitching motions can be expressed as approximate <b>simple</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>motions</b> with wave period. The wave circular frequency and draft of buoy have obvious influences on the amplitude-frequency responses. When the draft is larger than 1. 0 m, the curves of heaving motion exhibit single-peak patterns and the peak values are discovered at the circular frequency of about 2. 5 rad/s. The amplitude-frequency responses of pitching motion share the similar trends, and the peak amplitudes change regularly with draft and circular frequency. The heaving motion and pitching motion together influence the conversion power. For the cases in this paper, larger draft can increase the conversion power on the whole. According to the power contribution of pitching motion, the rates of conversion power of pitching motion usually exceed 20 %. Therefore, the conversion power of traditional oscillating buoy WEC {{is expected to be}} improved effectively by absorbing the energies of multiple freedoms. ...|$|R
