40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>reduction</b> {{strategies}} {{have proved to}} be useful to recover delay if air traffic flow management regulations are cancelled before initially planned. Considering that for short- haul flights the climb and descent phases usually account for a considerable percentage of the total trip distance, this paper extends previous works on <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> in cruise to the whole flight. A trajectory optimization software is used to compute the maximum airborne delay (or linear holding) that can be performed without extra fuel consumption if compared with the nominal flight. Three cases are studied: <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> only in cruise; <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> in the whole flight, but keeping the nominal cruise altitude; and <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> for the whole flight while also optimizing the cruise altitude to maximize delay. Three representative flights have been simulated, showing that the airborne delay increases significantly in the two last cases with nearly 3 -fold time for short-haul flights and 2 -fold for mid- hauls with the first case. Results also show that fuel and time are traded along different phases of flight in such a way the airborne delay is maximized while the total fuel burn is kept constant.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the speed polar of gliders by means of the so called <b>Speed</b> <b>Reduction</b> Method. The basic idea of this method is the assumption that the lift and drag coefficients calculated from the instationary measured data are equivalent to those corresponding to the stationary airspeeds and rates of sink. First investigations of <b>Speed</b> <b>Reduction</b> Method were conducted by Quellmann and Ortgies in 1984 / 85. New measuring and display equipment opens up improved possibilities to carry out several flight procedures using <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> and acceleration methods. Taking the flyability of the different procedures into account the evaluation of the measured data lead to the choice of the <b>Speed</b> <b>Reduction</b> Method. The <b>reduction</b> of the <b>speed</b> is carried out using a horizontal flight path. The evaluation of only eight flights lead to a polar which differs less than 5 % from the polar which is determined using the Partial Glide Method. The power of this method is the extended applicability compared to other methods. For example the <b>Speed</b> <b>Reduction</b> Method gives the opportunity of measuring the stall performance and the performance in rain as well. (orig.)

In {{order to}} ensure the safety of running train against the track {{buckling}} in a sultry weather, a <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> scheme has been implemented in railway operating companies.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{operating}} speed-profile is {{an important}} tool for the safety evaluations of new and existing roads. In particular, the operating speed-profile is useful to evaluate the consistency of an alignment identifying the excessive speed differential and to calculate the correct sight distance necessary along the road. Several models {{have been developed to}} predict the operating speed on curves and on tangents of two-lane rural roads. However, to trace an operating speed-profile close to the real speed-profile, it is necessary to join these speeds on successive elements using deceleration and acceleration rates that represent the real rates experienced by drivers. Therefore, to develop a deceleration model that could be effectively used in the operating speed-profile models, driver <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> behaviour and its dependence on the geometric characteristics of the road were investigated on 18 horizontal curves of two-lane rural roads. The results show that a single constant deceleration rate does not effectively describe the observed <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> behaviour. Therefore, its use in a speed-profile model results in a wrong estimation of the real distance used to decelerate before a curve. In fact, the deceleration rate observed varies significantly between the various curves. The data analysis revealed that the deceleration rate is correlated to the radius, the curve length, the approaching speed and the <b>speed</b> <b>reduction.</b> Therefore, two deceleration models were developed. The first one estimates the deceleration rate {{as a function of the}} radius of the impending curve and the second one as a function of the approaching speed and of the <b>speed</b> <b>reduction.</b> These models can be effectively used for the construction of the operating speed-profile because they predict deceleration rates consistent with the <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> behaviour observed and, consequently, deceleration lengths closer to the real distance travelled during the <b>speed</b> <b>reduction...</b>|$|R

30|$|It {{is noted}} that the SD is large {{in case of a}} camera system as {{compared}} to other sensors that makes HRC nearly impossible.

30|$|The {{effect of}} the {{automatic}} speed camera was localised {{to the position of}} the camera, resulting in a <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> stretching from a few hundred meters before the camera to a few hundred meters after the camera. There was a lack of significant <b>speed</b> <b>reductions</b> after 1  km and 2  km, which is in agreement with previous research [54]. This behaviour, with a rapid deceleration before the camera, followed by acceleration up to the desired speed, is commonly known as kangaroo driving [54]. Since there is generally no <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> upstream and downstream of the camera, the usefulness of automatic speed cameras to counter AVC is limited. Even if the camera is placed wisely, in locations where visibility is low and where wildlife crossings are common, the effect is probably limited since AVCs are more related to driver behaviour and road conditions than to animal movements [28].|$|R

40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>reduction</b> {{measures}} {{have become an}} increasingly popular way to increase traffic safety especially in urban areas. Recently many cities have converted entire districts into 30 km/h zones. In many European countries the maximum speed of haulage trucks is under discussion or review sometimes in combination with a ban on overtaking. Reducing the maximum speed is perceived and promoted by policy makers as beneficial to the environment because of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. These claims however have not been scientifically validated. They stem from the popular believe that the widely used Copert-approach, which is scientifically valid for average trip speeds, {{can be used to}} assess the environmental impact of speed management policies at a local scale.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of work zone signs on driver speeding behavior using a medium-fidelity driving simulator. A total of 264 simulation runs were conducted involving 66 participants from different socio-demographic backgrounds. The participants drove through a work zone with {{two out of three}} lanes closed on MD- 295 near Baltimore, Maryland, where the traffic was set at LOS B. In the post-simulation survey, 98 % of the participants agreed that the simulation session felt very realistic. An ANOVA showed that the initial signs {{before the start of the}} work zones are only effective if they are followed up by subsequent signs, which then cause a gradual decrease in speed. The average work zone speeds in the control scenario without any signs show that the signs tested in this study are indeed effective in reducing vehicle speeds in the work zone. Speed photo enforced signs were found to be the most effective (average <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> of 9.4  mph) compared to DSDS (average <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> of 4  mph) and reduced speed limit signs (average <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> of 3.4  mph), in terms of <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> in a work zone. Thus, speed photo enforced signs should be widely used in work zones to influence voluntary compliance of posted speed limits by motorists, thereby allowing them more time to react to changing conditions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{transport}} {{planners and}} land use practitioners, many are the qualitative guidelines provided regarding the location and quality of separated bicycle facilities. When separated bicycle facilities are poorly designed or placed in less than optimum locations, their intended use is less than anticipated. An interesting element {{in the evaluation of}} bicycle facilities that have received less attention revolve around the disturbance due to the presence of other users on cyclists way. Other users consists in cyclists and pedestrians for off-street bicycle facilities, and motorized vehicles on the roadway. This study focuses on quantifying the role of disturbances encountered on separated cycling facilities, compared to disturbances from cycling mixed with traffic, assuming cyclists speed as a performance measure and analysing the cyclist <b>speed</b> <b>reductions</b> from different types of disturbances. Collecting data on three segments of Bologna's cycling network (Italy), we measured the frequency, type, and <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> attributed to different types of disturbances. The data collected shows that pedestrian disturbances on the separated facility are highly frequent but associated with moderate <b>speed</b> <b>reductions,</b> while disturbances in the mixed traffic environment can be relatively fewer but have more severe <b>speed</b> <b>reductions.</b> Moreover, our results suggest that design elements of separated facilities can play a role in affecting the frequency, type, and severity of disturbances.
