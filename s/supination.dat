5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or <b>supination</b> (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
25|$|The tendon that {{attaches}} to the radial tuberosity is partially or completely surrounded by a bursa; the bicipitoradial bursa, which ensures frictionless motion between the biceps tendon and the proximal radius during pronation and <b>supination</b> of the forearm.|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion (extension) and plantar flexion occur {{around the}} {{transverse}} axis {{running through the}} ankle joint {{from the tip of}} the medial malleolus to the tip of the lateral malleolus. Pronation (eversion) and <b>supination</b> (inversion) occur along the oblique axis of the ankle joint.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for biceps-to-triceps transfer {{relate to}} the muscle balance surrounding the elbow. The m. supinator and m. brachialis function {{is a prerequisite for}} this surgery. If one of these muscles is nonfunctional the patient will lose forearm <b>supination</b> and elbow flexion if the tendon is transferred.|$|E
25|$|Even when fully {{extended}} (straightened) at the elbow, the forearm did not form a straight angle, falling short of this by 22°. Pronation (twisting {{to make the}} palmar side of the hand face downwards) of the forearm was impossible, because the radius and ulna lacked rolling surfaces, meaning the forearm was in a permanent state of <b>supination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Identification {{of major}} forces is {{critical}} to understanding insect flight. The first attempts to understand flapping wings assumed a quasi-steady state. This means that the air flow over the wing {{at any given time}} was assumed to be the same as how the flow would be over a non-flapping, steady-state wing at the same angle of attack. By dividing the flapping wing into a large number of motionless positions and then analyzing each position, {{it would be possible to}} create a timeline of the instantaneous forces on the wing at every moment. The calculated lift was found to be too small by a factor of three, so researchers realized that there must be unsteady phenomena providing aerodynamic forces. There were several developing analytical models attempting to approximate flow close to a flapping wing. Some researchers predicted force peaks at <b>supination.</b> With a dynamically scaled model of a fruit fly, these predicted forces later were confirmed. Others argued that the force peaks during <b>supination</b> and pronation are caused by an unknown rotational effect that fundamentally is different from the translational phenomena. There is some disagreement with this argument. Through computational fluid dynamics, some researchers argue that there is no rotational effect. They claim that the high forces are caused by an interaction with the wake shed by the previous stroke.|$|E
500|$|Pronation (...) and <b>supination</b> (...) refer most {{generally}} to assuming prone or supine positions, but {{often they are}} used in a specific sense referring to rotation of the forearm or foot {{so that in the}} standard anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (<b>supination)</b> or posteriorly (pronation).|$|E

2500|$|In Neanderthals, the radial bicipital tuberosities were {{larger than}} in modern humans, which {{suggests}} {{they were probably}} able to use their biceps for <b>supination</b> over {{a wider range of}} pronation-supination. [...] It is possible that they relied more on their biceps for forceful <b>supination</b> without the assistance of the supinator muscle like in modern humans, and thus that they used a different movement when throwing.|$|E
2500|$|... and [...] {{refer to}} {{rotation}} of the forearm or foot {{so that in the}} anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (<b>supination)</b> or posteriorly (pronation) {{rotation of the}} forearm. For example, if a person makes a [...] "thumbs up" [...] gesture, <b>supination</b> will cause the thumb to point away from the body midline and the fingers and plam to be upwards, while pronation will cause the thumb to point towards the body midline with the back of the hand upwards.|$|E
2500|$|First intermetacarpal {{ligament}} (IML): Connecting {{the bases}} of the second and first metacarpals, this ligament inserts onto the ulnopalmar tubercle of the first metacarpal where its fibers intermingle {{with those of the}} UCL. [...] It is taut in abduction, opposition, and <b>supination.</b> [...] It has been reported {{to be the most important}} restraining structure of the first CMC joint by several researchers. Some consider it too weak to be able to stabilize the joint by itself, yet accept that together with the UCL it represents an important restraining structure.|$|E
2500|$|In human anatomy, the biceps, also biceps brachii (...) , is a two-headed muscle {{that lies}} on the upper arm between the {{shoulder}} and the elbow. Both heads arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which {{is attached to the}} upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm. [...] Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (<b>supination),</b> then it pulls the cork out (flexion).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the deep}} layer, the tibialis {{posterior}} has its origin on the interosseus membrane and the neighbouring bone areas and runs {{down behind the}} medial malleolus. Under the foot it splits into a thick medial part attached to the navicular bone and a slightly weaker lateral part inserted to the three cuneiform bones. The muscle produces simultaneous plantar flexion and <b>supination</b> in the non-weight-bearing leg, and approximates the heel to the calf of the leg. The flexor hallucis longus arises distally on the fibula and on the interosseus membrane from where its relatively thick muscle belly extends far distally. Its tendon extends beneath the flexor retinaculum to the {{sole of the foot}} and finally attaches on the base of the last phalanx of the hallux. It plantarflexes the hallux and assists in <b>supination.</b> The flexor digitorum longus, finally, has its origin on {{the upper part of the}} tibia. Its tendon runs to the sole of the foot where it forks into four terminal tendon attached to the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. It crosses the tendon of the tibialis posterior distally on the tibia, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus in the sole. Distally to its division, the quadratus plantae radiates into it and near the middle phalanges its tendons penetrate the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it plantar flexes the toes and foot and supinates. In the weight-bearing leg it supports the plantar arch. (For the popliteus, see above.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Most insects use {{a method}} that creates a {{spiralling}} leading edge vortex. These flapping wings move through two basic half-strokes. The downstroke starts up and back and is plunged downward and forward. [...] Then the wing is quickly flipped over (<b>supination)</b> so that the leading edge is pointed backward. The upstroke then pushes the wing upward and backward. Then the wing is flipped again (pronation) and another downstroke can occur. The frequency range in insects with synchronous flight muscles typically is 5 to 200 hertz (Hz). In those with asynchronous flight muscles, wing beat frequency may exceed 1000Hz. When the insect is hovering, the two strokes take {{the same amount of}} time. A slower downstroke, however, provides thrust.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{design flaw}} of the stirrup affects {{the health of}} the human foot. [...] The rider's whole weight is at times {{supported}} entirely by the stirrups. [...] During these periods, excessive pressure can be exerted on the peroneus tertius tendon, which runs along the lateral side of the foot. In extreme cases, stirrups have been found to cause damage to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone. Over long periods of extreme use, this can cause various medical conditions ranging from simple impaired walking to severe pronation or <b>supination</b> of the foot. Normal riders, however, generally have no related problems, even over a lifetime of riding. [...] Disciplines that require long hours in the saddle, such as endurance riding and some types of western riding on a working ranch, often use a wider stirrup to provide more support to the foot.|$|E
2500|$|Proximal radioulnar joint (upper forearm) – Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the biceps brachii {{is not the}} most {{powerful}} flexor of the forearm, a role which actually belongs to the deeper brachialis muscle. The biceps brachii functions primarily as a powerful supinator of the forearm (turns the palm upwards). This action, which is aided by the supinator muscle, requires the elbow to be at least partially flexed. If the elbow, or humeroulnar joint, is fully extended, <b>supination</b> is then primarily carried out by the supinator muscle. The biceps is a particularly powerful supinator of the forearm due to the distal attachment of the muscle at the radial tuberosity, {{on the opposite side of}} the bone from the supinator muscle. When flexed, the biceps effectively pulls the radius back into its neutral supinated position in concert with the supinator muscle.|$|E
2500|$|Leonardo da Vinci {{expressed}} {{the original idea}} of the biceps acting as a supinator {{in a series of}} annotated drawings made between 1505 and 1510; in which the principle of the biceps as a supinator, as well as its role as a flexor to the elbow were devised. However, this function remained undiscovered by the medical community as da Vinci was not regarded as a teacher of anatomy, nor were his results publicly released. It was not until 1713 that this movement was re-discovered by William Cheselden and subsequently recorded for the medical community. It was rewritten several times by different authors wishing to present information to different audiences. The most notable recent expansion upon Cheselden's recordings was written by Guillaume Duchenne in 1867, in a journal named Physiology of Motion. To this day it remains one of the major references on <b>supination</b> action of the biceps brachii.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proximal}} tendons of the biceps brachii {{are commonly}} involved in pathological processes {{and are a}} frequent cause of anterior shoulder pain. Disorders of the distal biceps brachii tendon typically result from partial and complete tears of the muscle. [...] Partial tears are usually characterized by enlargement and abnormal contour of the tendon. Complete tears generate a soft-tissue mass in the anterior aspect of the arm, the so-called Popeye sign, which paradoxically leads to a decreased strength during flexion and <b>supination</b> of the forearm. Tears of the biceps brachii occur in athletic activities and corrective surgery repairs biceps brachii tendon tears. [...] Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically repaired by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis is resurfacing the tendon by screw fixation on the humerus and biceps tenotomy is trimming the long head of the biceps tendon promoting the muscle origination from the coracoid process. Preexisting degeneration in the tendon can cause partial tears called lesions and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. The most common symptom of a biceps tear is pain. It {{will be the most}} severe in the muscle, but may stretch to the shoulders and elbows as well. [...] Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. [...] In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.|$|E

Selina, do you know the movements of your own joints? Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, circumduction, pronation, <b>supination,</b> and the lateral movements. Be proud of those accomplishments, my dear, but beware of attempting to become a Masseuse. There are drawbacks in that vocation--and I am conscious of one of them at this moment." [...] She lifted her hands to her nose. [...] "Pah! my hands smell of other people's flesh. The delicious country air will blow it away--the luxury of purification!" [...] Her fingers twisted and quivered, and got crooked at one moment and straight again at another, and showed themselves in succession singly, and flew into each other fiercely interlaced, and then spread out again like the sticks of a fan, until it really made me giddy to look at them. As for Miss Jillgall, she lifted her poor little sunken eyes rapturously to the sky, as if she called the homiest sunlight to witness that this was the most lovable woman {{on the face of the}} earth.|$|E
50|$|Supinator always acts {{together}} with biceps, except when the elbow joint is extended.

50|$|Beneficial {{exercise}} will be {{any that}} strengthens the interosseous muscles and lumbricals. By exercising individual fingers and thumb in adduction and abduction motion in pronation position, interosseous muscles will gain strength. Exercises to strengthen lumbricals, strengthen flexion in the metacarpophalangeal joint, and extension in the interphalangeal joints are beneficial. Repetitive motion of pronation and <b>supination</b> are also effective exercises for rehabilitation. Exercising pronation and <b>supination</b> with a handle or screwdriver attachment will help stimulate the nerves. A lateral pinch and recurring grip can also be applied for <b>supination</b> and pronation.|$|E
