25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{caesarean}} section (CS). An important distinction lies {{in the type of}} incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse <b>suprapubic</b> approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but {{there is no way of}} knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and piloerection. Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or <b>suprapubic</b> scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, a retrodiagnosis of Marx's {{skin disease}} {{was made by}} {{dermatologist}} Sam Shuster of Newcastle University and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from hidradenitis suppurativa, a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of apocrine ducts opening into hair follicles. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence {{would not have been}} known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the Marx/Engels Collected Works. There, [...] "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, perianal, genital (penis and scrotum) and <b>suprapubic</b> regions and inner thighs, [...] "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis [...] "can now be made definitively".|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{diagnosis}} of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required. Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 105CFU/mL is used for a [...] "clean-catch" [...] mid stream sample, 104CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 102CFU/mL is used for <b>suprapubic</b> aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle). The use of [...] "urine bags" [...] to collect samples is discouraged by the World Health Organization due to {{the high rate of}} contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained. Some, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection. However, because {{there is a lack of}} effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings.|$|E
50|$|A <b>suprapubic</b> cystostomy or <b>suprapubic</b> {{catheter}} (also {{known as}} a vesicostomy or epicystostomy) is a surgically created connection between the urinary bladder and the skin used to drain urine from the bladder in individuals with obstruction of normal urinary flow. The connection does not go through the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5000|$|In anatomy, the hypogastrium (also {{called the}} hypogastric region or <b>suprapubic</b> region) is {{a region of}} the abdomen located below the {{umbilical}} region.

50|$|In an open {{prostate}}ctomy, {{the prostate}} is accessed {{through a large}} single incision through either the lower abdomen or the perineum. Further descriptive terms describe how the prostate is accessed anatomically through this incision (retropubic vs. <b>suprapubic</b> vs. perineal). A retropubic prostatectomy describes a procedure that accesses the prostate by going through the lower abdomen and behind the pubic bone. A <b>suprapubic</b> prostatectomy describes a procedure cuts through the lower abdomen and through the bladder to access the prostate. A perineal prostatectomy is done by making an incision between the rectum and scrotum {{on the underside of}} the abdomen.|$|E
