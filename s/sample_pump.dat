40|$|A {{hydraulically}} operated pump is described for in-ground filtering and monitoring of wells or other fluid sources, including a hollow cylindrical pump housing with an inlet and an outlet, filtering devices positioned in the inlet and the outlet, a piston that fits slidably within the pump housing, and an optical cell {{in fluid communication}} with the pump housing. A conduit within the piston allows fluid communication between the exterior and {{one end of the}} piston. A pair of O-rings form a seal between the inside of the pump housing and the exterior of the piston. A flow valve positioned within the piston inside the conduit allows fluid to flow in a single direction.

The piston then makes a downward stroke closing the valve, thus forcing the fluid out from the pump housing into the optical cell, which then takes spectrophotometric measurements of the fluid. A spring helps return the piston back to its starting position, so that a new supply of fluid may enter the pump housing and the downward stroke can begin again.

Our objectives were to quantify diurnal and seasonal variations and vertical gradients of [CO 2] and explore controlling factors. Methods A [CO 2] flux tower with an 8 -level [CO 2] profile system (at 0. 5, 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0, 16. 0, 20. 0, 28. 0 and 36. 0 m) was installed at the Maoershan Forest Ecosystem Research Station in Heilongjiang Province (45 ° 24 ′ N, 127 ° 40 ′ E) in 2007. [CO 2] at each level was measured with a LI-COR LI- 840 infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) by drawing it from each level with a <b>sample</b> <b>pump</b> through tubes of equal length. The IRGA was controlled and data were collected with a datalogger. Automatic calibration was done for the IRGA once a day. A Vaisala GMP 343 was installed at 36. 0 m to monitor ambient [CO 2] for quality control of the [CO 2] profile data. We simultaneously measured micrometeorological variables, including wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation, vapor pressure, soil temperature and water content. Important findings At a daily scale, maximum [CO 2] occurred at night or sun rise, while the minimum occurred in the afternoon at all levels. This pattern was predominant in the summer. The diurnal course of the [CO 2] was “V”-shaped in winter but “U”-shaped in other seasons. [CO 2] decreased with increasing height, particularly on summer nights. During the daytime of summer, daily mean [CO 2] within the canopy was substantially lower than the ambient [CO 2], suggesting that the vegetation acted as a CO 2 sink due to its photosynthesis. Daily mean [CO 2] above the canopy peaked in spring and autumn and reached a minimum in summer, while that near the forest floor showed a unimodal seasonal pattern with its maximum in summer. The diurnal dynamics of [CO 2] and their vertical gradients {{during the growing season}} were jointly controlled by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and forest carbon metabolism, while those during the dormant season were controlled mainly by ABL.

40|$|Automated water-level data {{collected}} using vented pressure transducers deployed in Hanford Site Central Plateau wells commonly display more variability than manual tape measurements {{in response to}} barometric pressure fluctuations. To explain this difference, {{it was hypothesized that}} vented pressure transducers installed in some wells are subject to barometric pressure effects that reduce water-level measurement accuracy. Vented pressure transducers use a vent tube, which is open to the atmosphere at land surface, to supply air pressure to the transducer housing for barometric compensation so the transducer measurements will represent only the water pressure. When using vented transducers, the assumption is made that the air pressure between land surface and the well bore is in equilibrium. By comparison, absolute pressure transducers directly measure the air pressure within the wellbore. Barometric compensation is achieved by subtracting the well bore air pressure measurement from the total pressure measured by a second transducer submerged in the water. Thus, no assumption of air pressure equilibrium is needed. In this study, water-level measurements were collected from the same Central Plateau wells using both vented and absolute pressure transducers to evaluate the different methods of barometric compensation. Manual tape measurements were also collected to evaluate the transducers. Measurements collected during this study demonstrated that the vented pressure transducers over-responded to barometric pressure fluctuations due to a pressure disequilibrium between the air within the wellbores and the atmosphere at land surface. The disequilibrium is thought to be caused by the relatively long time required for barometric pressure changes to equilibrate between land surface and the deep vadose zone and may be exacerbated by the restriction of air flow between the well bore and the atmosphere due to the presence of <b>sample</b> <b>pump</b> landing plates and well caps. The disequilibrium is likely limited to wells screened across the water table (i. e., open to the deep vadose zone) where the depth to water is large or a low-permeability layer occurs in the vadose zone. Such wells are a pathway for air movement between the deep vadose zone and land surface and this sustains the pressure disequilibrium between the well bore and the atmosphere for longer time periods. Barometric over-response was not observed with the absolute pressure transducers because barometric compensation was achieved by directly measuring the air pressure within the well. Users of vented pressure transducers {{should be aware of the}} over-response issue in certain Hanford Site wells and ascertain if it will affect the use of the data. Pressure disequilibrium between the well and the atmosphere can be identified by substantial air movement through the wellbore. In wells exhibiting pressure disequilibrium, it is recommended that absolute pressure transducers be used rather than vented transducers for applications that require precise automated determinations of well water-level changes in response to barometric pressure fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|National Research Council Canada (NRC) is {{collaborating with}} College of the North Atlantic (CNA) {{to develop an}} ocean wave-driven pump to supply the CNA shore-based {{aquaculture}} centre in Lord's Cove, Newfoundland. NRC provides a combination of physical model testing under controlled laboratory conditions and computer simulation using numerical modelling tools developed at NRC and commercial software. The CNA plans to demonstrate the sustainability of a shore-based aquaculture centre {{in the context of}} rural Newfoundland. The efficiency of the centre depends in part on its energy consumption, a major part of which is supplying seawater to a facility some distance from the ocean and above sea level. The development of a seawater supply pump driven by the power of ocean waves would reduce the electrical costs for the centre. The NRC is supporting a staged design program through numerical and physical model testing to select a robust design optimized for the local sea conditions at the Lord's Cove mooring site. The wave pump is inspired by designs for wave energy converters. But since wave energy converters have not converged on a single design, there are major risks and costs in designing a wave pump, from construction and testing of physical models for competing designs to mooring failure and potential loss of the device in the hurricane-force storms typical of southern Newfoundland. Using lessons learned in the energy sector, risks can be mitigated by systematically testing the behaviour and response of proposed concepts through a staged design program, starting from characterizing the hydrodynamic characteristics of a simplified model through progressively larger, more complex physical and numerical models used in functional tests. This approach systematically directs the design process toward a single prototype optimized for performance in specified wave conditions using scaled model tests in advance of the most costly stage of sea trials. The goals of the staged design program for the CNA wave-driven pump are to 2 ̆ 022 evaluate various design concepts 2 ̆ 022 select a design suited to the CNA mooring site 2 ̆ 022 optimize the design for a typical sea state and 2 ̆ 022 specify a mooring robust enough to keep the platform on station during the sometimes extreme sea states at Lord's Cove. The program began with characterization of the chosen mooring site outside Lord's Cove. Processed wave buoy data from this site informed the estimation of mooring line loads using numerical tools developed by NRC and typical sea states on which to focus design optimization. In the second stage, a numerical tool was developed to estimate pump output and validated against test results for a physical pump. In the third stage, various wave pump platform design concepts were evaluated based on estimation of hydrodynamic characteristics. The designs were characterized using a combination of physical model tests in the NRC 200 -metre wave tank in St. John's and computer simulations using Ansys Aqwa and Matlab. A <b>sample</b> <b>pump</b> platform design is shown as a scale model and a numerical mesh in Fig. 1. In the fourth stage, which will precede a full-scale prototype deployment at sea, a design has been selected and an operational scale model wave pump platform has been tested in the NRC wave facilities. Numerical modelling is used to choose a mooring for the full-scale deployment. In this staged design program, the use of physical model tests and computer simulation are complementary methods used alternatively to solve potentially costly and time-consuming problems. A selection of the problems encountered {{in the design of the}} wave pump platform is presented along with a critique of the solutions applied by NRC to build confidence in a wave-driven pump design tailored for the CNA site.

The selection of <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> and the ranges of back pressure were based on measurements obtained in the previous study (Lee et al., 2014 a). Among six medium-flow rate pumps, only the Gilian 5000 and the Apex IS conformed to the 10...|$|R
40|$|A {{trapping}} reagent for formaldehyde, {{based on}} the pararosaniline reaction, was evaluated {{as a method of}} determination of formaldehyde in the aqueous or vapour phase. Collection of formaldehyde vapour relied upon passive diffusion of formaldehyde into the trapping media and quantitative results were obtained without the need for liquid impingers, bubblers or active <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps.</b> Moreover, a novel, hand-held absorption spectrophotometric measurement device was designed to provide on-site, quantitative measurements. It is proposed that the full measurement system devised would be ideally suited to specific sampling applications such as those found in museum enclosures. (Abstract from: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we use {{steady-state}} measurements {{to obtain}} evidence of radiation trapping in an optically thick {{a cloud of}} cold rubidium atoms. We investigate the fluorescence properties of our <b>sample,</b> <b>pumped</b> on opened transitions. The intensity of fluorescence exhibits a non trivial dependence on the optical thickness of the media. A simplified model, based on rate equations self-consistently coupled to a diffusive model of light transport, is used to explain the experimental observations in terms of incoherent radiation trapping on one spectral line. Measurements of atomic populations and fluorescence spectrum qualitatively agree with this interpretation. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The chemiluminescent {{ozonesonde}} to {{be flown}} with the STRATCOM balloon flight {{consisted of two}} main parts: (1) A constant-volume <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> made from TEFLON {{was used for the}} intake of the air sample. Sample was drawn at a rate of 200 millimeters per minute. (2) Ozone was detected by the chemiluminescent process (Rhodamine - B). Ozone molecules in the air sample flowed over the detector and the photons produced by the destruction of ozone molecules on the chemiluminescent material were monitored by the photomultiplier tube, the output signal from which was transmitted to the ground receiver...|$|R
