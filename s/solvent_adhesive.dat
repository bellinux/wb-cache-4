40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} shear bond {{strength}} (SBS) of a <b>solvent</b> free self-etch <b>adhesive</b> with <b>solvent</b> containing <b>adhesives.</b> METHODS: Forty-five human teeth were sectioned longitudinally to expose superficial dentin and substrates polished with 600 -grit SiC paper. The adhesive area was isolated with a cylindrical Teflon mold 3 x 4 mm. Fifteen specimens {{were prepared for}} each material. Were evaluated a <b>solvent</b> free self-etch <b>adhesive</b> (Bond 1 SF), an ethanol self-etch adhesive (Futurabond M), and a water-acetone-ethanol self-etch adhesive (Optibond All-In-One). All specimens were subjected to an aging procedure by thermo-cycling (5000 cycles). Thirty-six specimens were stressed in shear {{at a rate of}} 0. 5 mm/min. Mean data values were analyzed statistically using the Welch robust analysis of variance and the Games-Howell statistic. Failure patterns were analyzed using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additional more dentin specimens were prepared for SEM. RESULTS: The Bond 1 SF showed the statistically significant lowest SBS to dentin (Welch statistic p< 0. 001). Failures for Bond 1 SF were mainly adhesive failures with partial cohesive failures in the adhesive resin, while for Futurabond M and Optibond All-In-One were mainly mixed.

Materials and methodsSixty caries free third molars were used to prepare specimens of dentin surfaces. The adhesives were applied on dentin surfaces according to the manufacturer's instructions then Grandio-SO Composite resin was condensed through a polyethylene tube with a one mm internal diameter and height attached firmly to dentin surfaces and light cured. The bonded specimens were stored in distilled water at 37  °C for 24  h before being tested. Half of the bonded specimens were tested for microshear bond strength without thermocycling and the other half were thermocycled in water baths held at 5 °c and 55 °c with a dwell time of 1  min each for 500 cycles prior to testing. The micro shears bond strength before and after thermocycling was calculated and statistically analyzed to show the interaction between different materials. ResultsWithout thermocycling, the bond strength of Futurabond DC and Adper Easy, were 22. 524  MPa and 23. 397  MPa respectively, while Bond- 1 SF solvent free one step at lowered mean value 22. 284  MPa and the difference was not statistically significant (p >  0. 05).

40|$|Abstract D-Xylonic acid is a {{versatile}} platform chemical with reported applications as complexing agent or chelator, in dispersal of concrete, {{and as a}} precursor for compounds such as co-polyamides, polyesters, hydrogels and 1, 2, 4 -butanetriol. With increasing glucose prices, D-xylonic acid may provide a cheap, non-food derived alternative for glu-conic acid, which is widely used (about 80 kton/year) in pharmaceuticals, food products, <b>solvents,</b> <b>adhesives,</b> dyes, paints and polishes. Large-scale production has not been developed, reflecting the current limited market for D-xylo-nate. D-Xylonic acid occurs naturally, being formed in {{the first step of}} oxidative metabolism of D-xylose by some archaea and bacteria via the action of D-xylose or D-glucose dehydrogenases. High extracellular concentrations of D-xyl-onate have been reported for various bacteria, in particular Gluconobacter oxydans and Pseudomonas putida. High yields of D-xylonate from D-xylose make G. oxydans an attractive choice for biotechnical production. G. oxydans is able to produce D-xylonate directly from plant biomass hydrolysates, but rates and yields are reduced because of sensitivity to hydrolysate inhibitors. Recently, D-xylonate has been produced by the genetically modified bacterium Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis. Expression of NAD+-dependent D-xylose dehydrogenase of Caulobacter crescentus in either E. coli or in a robust, hydrolysate-tolerant, industrial Sac-charomyces cerevisiae strain has resulted in D-xylonate titres, which are comparable to those seen with G. oxydans, at a volumetric rate approximately 30 % of that observed with G. oxydans. With further development, genetically modified microbes may soon provide an alternative for production of D-xylonate at industrial scale...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to develop a {{procedure}} {{for the analysis of}} trace concentration of phthalate esters (PEA) in coffee brew stored in plastic cups. Phthalates are esters of phthalic acid, generally have high boiling points, lowvolatility are insoluble in water andpredominantly fat-soluble. Phthalates with higher molecular weights, such as bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are largely used as additives and plasticizers in plastic material (PVC), while those with lower molecular weights are components of <b>solvents,</b> <b>adhesive,</b> wax, ink, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials and cosmetic. Dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate are present in plastics based on cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate and butyrate. The widespread use of these products resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food. Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties. Several studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. Considering that the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys. In the present work, considering the large daily consumption of coffee, we optimized a reliable analytical methodand investigated the levels, distribution of 17 analyte incoffee brew samples. This method is based on liquid–liquid extraction of brew; the determination is carried out by GC– MS using SIM acquisition data.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the developments {{that led to}} the first polymeric OSN membrane and modules for applications in harsh solvent environments (e. g. DMF and THF), commonly used in the pharmaceutical industries. The chemical crosslinking of integrally skinned asymmetric P 84 membranes has been shown to significantly enhance the chemical stability of the membrane thus allowing stable performance in these solvents that solubilise P 84. The main issues relating to the production of the membrane and membrane modules addressed in this thesis are: (i) The impact of drying on membrane performance It was concluded that air-drying of water- and solvent-wetted membranes is not desirable for maintaining functional performance and that they must be impregnated with a preserving agent to maintain their properties (chapter 3). (ii) Development of highly <b>solvent</b> resistant <b>adhesive</b> systems for spiral wound module It was found that the key parameters influencing solvent stability are the available free volume in the epoxy adhesive and the functional groups present in the final adhesive network (chapter 4). (iii) Optimising the adhesive curing conditions for P 84 OSN membrane modules A compromise need {{to be made in the}} curing conditions to achieve a highly <b>solvent</b> resistant <b>adhesive</b> whilst maintaining the membrane's performance, and a novel curing technique is also invented (chapter 5). Finally, chapter 6 describes how these solvent resistant P 84 modules prepared using the knowledge gained from previous chapters can be applied to classic purification processes in the pharmaceutical industries. Overall, this thesis demonstrates a significant step forward in the knowledge and understanding of the formation and use of P 84 based OSN membrane and membrane modules. This will open up more opportunities for applying this emerging separation technology in the pharmaceutical industry.

40|$|Drying of <b>solvent</b> from <b>adhesives</b> during {{adhesion}} {{procedure is}} significanlty important. However, every manufacturer recommends different methods. How can we achieve the best result in drying the adhesives?Q The solvent is the indispensable {{composition of the}} adhesives that is needed for tooth adhesion. In etch and Rinse (E&R) adhesives, {{the function of the}} solvent is to promote penetration of the monomers in the exposed collagen network of the demineralized dentin. 1 In self-etch <b>adhesives</b> (SEAs), the <b>solvent</b> (water) is used for the ionization medium of the acidic monomers. 2 The solvent is present within the primers (3 -step E&Rs and 2 -step SEAs) or the solvated resin blends (2 -step E&Rs and 1 -step SEAs). In dental adhesives, ethanol, water and acetone are the commonly used solvents. After application of adhesives, the evaporation of solvent is very important. Remaining solvents hamper the polymerization of adhesives and reduce its mechanical properties. 3 Also, the permeability and nanoleakage of adhesive layer may be increased by the hydrophilicity of remaining solvents. 4 On adhesion procedure, air-drying accelerate the removal of remaining <b>solvent</b> from the <b>adhesive.</b> Air-drying for 3 - 4 seconds advocated by manufacturers is too short to evaporate the solvent. Actually, air-drying for more than 10 seconds is recommended and it is longer than the instruction of manufacturers.
