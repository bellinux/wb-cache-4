50|$|During {{his time}} in the United States Navy, Dornbrand {{specialized}} in heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid flow research with NACA, at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. In 1946 he began work at Republic Aviation in Long Island, New York, where he was manager of space systems technology. During his 20 years there he held management positions on the FIRE system, Advanced Orbiting Solar Observatory, <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> and Manned Orbital Laboratory programs. Republic was purchased by Fairchild Hiller in 1965 and Dornbrand moved to Fairchild's Germantown, Maryland facility.|$|E
40|$|A general {{overview}} is presented {{of the spectrum}} utilization and frequency requirements of present and planned <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> programs. The sensors, and TIROS operational systems are discussed along with the Nimbus and <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellites.</b> STORMSAT, SEASAT, and the Spacelab are briefly described...|$|R
40|$|Imagery from ERTS or the <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellites,</b> {{because of}} its {{precisely}} repetitive nature, is ideally suited both for subjective enhancement by time-lapse display and for objective measurements of changes with time. A hybrid system providing both viewing and image-processing functions is described. A representative application involves the measurement {{of changes in the}} aerial extent of snow cover within specified mountain watersheds. Subjective viewing of time-lapse sequences of the snow scenes provides valuable insight into the nature of numerous extraneous signals, permitting the interim implementation of operationally useful snow-measuring systems and hopefully leading toward the design of fully objective classifiers...|$|R
5000|$|TIROS {{paved the}} way for the more {{advanced}} weather satellites of the TIROS Operational System (TOS). The ESSA National Environmental Satellite Center worked jointly with NASA to deploy the new TOS satellites, which constituted an operational experiment with early imaging and weather broadcast systems. Nine of ESSA′s TOS satellites were launched between 1966 and 1969, each named [...] "ESSA" [...] followed by a number from 1 to 9, beginning with the launch of ESSA-1 on 3 February 1966. The last of these satellites was decommissioned in 1977, but ESSA′s work with NASA laid the foundation for the deployment of the first geostationary weather <b>satellites,</b> the <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellites</b> of 1974 and 1975.|$|R
50|$|GOES 2, {{known as}} GOES-B before {{becoming}} operational, was a {{geostationary weather satellite}} which was operated by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{as part of the}} Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system. GOES 2 was built by Ford Aerospace, and was based on the satellite bus developed for the <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> programme. At launch it had a mass of 295 kg. It was positioned in geostationary orbit, from where it was used for weather forecasting in the United States. Following its retirement as a weather satellite, it was used as a communications satellite until its final decommissioning in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|McIDAS {{accepted}} {{data from}} a number of sources. Cloud imagery was buffered on tape and then fed in as needed, data from the <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> could be fed in directly from a satellite feed at 1.7 MB a second, FAA data at 75 bit/s, or National Weather Service radar at 1200 bit/s. All of this data could be overlaid on hand-drawn vector maps. The system was later extended to support data from the Earth Resources Technology Satellite and the Mariner planetary probes. A command line interpreter allowed the user to call up data with short commands, [...] would generate a display of the 500 mb temperature data from the 1200 UTC measurements over the USA.|$|E
40|$|The {{nickel-cadmium}} battery design {{developed for the}} <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> (SMS) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) provided background and guidelines for future development, manufacture, and application of spacecraft batteries.

40|$|A {{scanning}} mirror assembly {{which is part}} of a <b>Synchronous</b> Orbit <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Satellite</b> is an example where mission objectives required measurement and control of weight, mass center, principal moments of inertia, and products of inertia. The {{scanning mirror}} oscillates within the spin stabilized spacecraft, and both the scanning motor torque and perturbation of spacecraft attitude and spin rate have to be reduced to low levels. A theoretically ideal solution would be to make the mirror inertia constant about all axes in a plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis. A practically attainable compromise is to locate principal axes preferentially and make the difference between two of them acceptably small. Methods for making the necessary mass property measurements and deriving and applying minimum weight ballast correction to achieve the necessary mass distribution are discussed. It is noted that mass property control operations are typically subject to practical constraints such as geometry and functional operation of the system and capability of available measurement facilities and fixtures...|$|R
