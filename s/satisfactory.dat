5|$|Manganese has no <b>satisfactory</b> {{substitute}} in {{its major}} applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} stewards to be allowed to race, because he did not post a lap time during the first part of qualifying. They gave him permission to start based on his <b>satisfactory</b> practice times.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Pocock found {{errors in}} Tregelles' edition, but William Hatch thought it <b>satisfactory.</b> J. Harold Greenlee {{corrected}} Tregelles' errors and edited {{the list of}} corrections in 1957, which was examined by William Hatch. In 1959 Greenlee published a commentary. The codex probably needs another examination with modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get <b>satisfactory</b> radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|Static {{testing of}} the engine {{precooler}} began in June 2011, marking the start of Phase 3 in the Skylon development programme, In April 2012, REL announced that the first series of the precooler test programme had been successfully completed. ESA's propulsion division audited the precooler tests during mid-2012 and found the results <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The art of measuring, as {{precisely}} as possible, probabilities of things, {{with the goal}} {{that we would be}} able always to choose or follow in our judgments and actions that course, which will have been determined to be better, more <b>satisfactory,</b> safer or more advantageous.|$|E
5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were not <b>satisfactory,</b> as such objects would catch and stretch out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would go through the objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no <b>satisfactory</b> {{explanation}} for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggested}} that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva {{could no longer be}} understood as a <b>satisfactory</b> expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an acceptable official response to its intentional destruction in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to extend}} these {{functions}} {{to the general}} case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties. Either we define discontinuous functions or multivalued functions. Neither of these options is entirely <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook Primary is {{the only}} school in the village. Some {{children}} of primary school age attend Colegate Community Primary School, located {{on the fringe of}} Windy Nook at Colegate West in neighbouring Leam Lane. This too is a <b>satisfactory</b> school which suffers from inconsistent attainment among pupils. The nearest Roman Catholic school is St Augustine's Primary; a good school at Leam Lane Estate. Secondary school provision is at Thomas Hepburn Community Academy on Swards Road in Felling. This is a <b>satisfactory</b> but improving school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals is more than twice the national average.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{it may not}} be {{a logical}} deduction, but to my {{imagination}} it is far more <b>satisfactory</b> to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{maiden flight}} in March 1958, {{evaluation}} of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted. Although the test results were generally <b>satisfactory,</b> {{it was determined that}} the performance of the aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, Barrowclough {{was advised}} that his {{division}} was {{to participate in}} the Solomon Islands campaign. It would eventually participate in three major amphibious operations. The first of these was in September 1943, when the 14th Brigade conducted a series of landings around the coast of Vella Lavella during the Battle of Vella Lavella. It was a <b>satisfactory</b> performance by the New Zealanders and Barrowclough was congratulated by American commanders for the division's work.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program {{at the national level}} which offers technical assistance to the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a <b>satisfactory</b> way so far.|$|E
5|$|Other less <b>satisfactory</b> {{materials}} than horn {{have been}} used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than <b>satisfactory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} favorable reviews by critics. The Morning Telegraph {{said the}} story was too far-fetched to be believable, but {{it was done in}} an amusing way. The Moving Picture World stated that the acting and camerawork was <b>satisfactory.</b> The film was advertised in numerous states, sometimes as a comedy, by theaters in Indiana, Kansas, New York, and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely <b>satisfactory,</b> as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
5|$|The optimal {{crossing}} point ran over Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon {{in the middle}} of their area. The company offered the authorities free land on the condition that they received a <b>satisfactory</b> intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E
5|$|Van Rensselaer {{was quick}} {{to take part in}} the new endeavor: on January 13, 1629, he sent {{notification}} to the Directors of the Company that he, in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert, had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine <b>satisfactory</b> locations for settlement. This took place even before the Charter was ratified, but was done in accordance with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{system is}} used to rank {{practical}} work in the certain science department of Oxford University; however only with the grades S (<b>Satisfactory)</b> S+ (more than <b>satisfactory,</b> and {{may be used in}} the allocation of degree grades) and NS (Not <b>Satisfactory).</b>|$|E
