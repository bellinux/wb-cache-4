A covered concourse will replace the five island platforms, and the site will {{be linked to the}} Metrolink terminus. It will have new waiting areas, bicycle parking, and better access to travel information and tickets. Improved pedestrian routes will take people into the town centre. Construction is expected to take two years and the interchange <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> by the end of 2018.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{the owner}} of the club, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research gave the project of {{building}} a new sports city to the Spanish company TriArena. They are constructing a main football stadium with a capacity of 16,000 spectators and an area of 71,150 m². The project also includes two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a fustal pitch, a handball court, a hotel, restaurants, and a covered swimming pool. Al-Talaba is defined as a sports club, not just a football one, and it has supported other sports at minor level only in the past. The foundation stone was laid by the former minister of higher education and scientific research, Ali al-Adeeb, in February 2014. The cost of the project is estimated to be $84 million and the duration of construction was expected to be 30 months, meaning that by 2017 the Al-Talaba Sports City <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open.</b> Due to the financial crisis in Iraq, the project was scratched after spending $4 million on designs.|$|E

5|$|Two high-powered {{parliamentary}} commissions in 1852 issued {{recommendations for}} Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, {{was a key}} member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to {{all members of the}} University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.|$|E
5|$|Aston first gained {{full-time}} employment in 1970, {{working as a}} field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, {{he worked on the}} sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to all who were interested in it. As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, Landscape Archaeology. With archaeologist James Bond he authored The Landscape of Towns (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.|$|E

25|$|The Metro has a {{very large}} {{expansion}} plan for the next half century. The Pravoberezhnaya Line was split in early 2009, and the new fifth line (Frunzensko-Primorskaya) took the northern (Primorsky) radius away from Pravoberezhnaya and opened with a new section (Frunzensky) to the south. The Pravoberezhnaya line will extend to the west, and then north to Lakhta, and then to Yuntolovo. The two stations, Bukharestskaya and Mezhdunarodnaya of the Frunzensko-Primorskaya line, opened in December 2012, {{will be followed by}} another three heading southward - Prospekt Slavy, Dunayskaya and Shushary. These <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> by 2017-2018. Three new lines, Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya, Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya and Koltsevaya, will be opened. The first six stations of the Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya line are already under construction, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> by 2020. The Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya line should appear before 2025. The Koltsevaya line will be opened after 2025.|$|E

Lears received the interdict after attending an ordination ceremony, which the Church considers invalid, of a woman to the priesthood at a Jewish synagogue by the WomenPriests movement.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
25|$|As an Anglican and {{a regular}} church-goer, Wakley's {{opposition}} to aspects of the Lord's Day Observance legislation was based not on secularism but on his sympathy for the ordinary man. In his day, men worked a full six days each week and could not shop on pay nights. If all shops closed {{for the whole of}} Sunday, it was clearly unfair to working men. Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to all on Sundays. The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.|$|E

25|$|The ELCA ordains {{women as}} pastors, a {{practice}} that all three of its predecessor churches adopted in the 1970s. Some have become synod bishops. In 2013, Elizabeth Eaton {{became the first woman}} to be elected Presiding Bishop of the ELCA. The most recent ELCA hymnal, Evangelical Lutheran Worship, includes alternate gender-neutral invocations and benedictions in all settings. All of the psalms and many of the hymns and parts of the liturgy have been altered to remove masculine pronouns referring to God. In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project surveyed 681 ELCA pastors and found that 95% of ELCA clergy thought that all clergy positions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> to women, while 2% disagreed.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, the Senate may go {{into what}} is called a secret or closed session. During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the {{galleries}} are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session. Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials. A senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs beforehand. If the Senate does not approve release of a secret transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives. The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy. In 1973 the House adopted a rule that all committee sessions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> unless a majority on the committee voted for a closed session.|$|E
500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> and make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, saying when faced with difficult choices, one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E
