40|$|This paper {{studies the}} link between the degree of sector-concentration and the {{selectivity}} performance for 102 <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> and 408 diversified equity funds between January 1980 and December 2002 on the American market. The sample includes funds for which ten years of monthly returns are available. Our main result is that narrow-defined <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> perform significantly better than wide-spectrum ones. This result is not driven by specific categories of <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> and is robust to the benchmark/model specification. Sector expertise allows thus private information acquisition and significant value creation for <b>sector</b> <b>funds.</b> For equity funds, the relation is rather opposite: the best performers are funds diversifying the most across sectors. In other words, there is no middle way between diversification and specialisation. The cross-sectional analysis for <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> indicates that the best stock-pickers are recent, small, highly concentrated funds with low expense ratios. For equity funds, the best stock-pickers are rather large, diversified funds. In addition, we document a strong negative market-timing performance for <b>sector</b> <b>funds.</b> The market-timing activity is not deliberate but rather implied by high-unexpected cash flows at the fund. Our results are free of the survivorship bias {{to the extent that we}} use all funds (dead and alive) in the period of analysis. The survivorship bias does change our results fundamentally...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the existence}} of <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> (specialists) within a mutual fund family affects the performance and investment behavior of affiliated diversified equity funds (generalists). First of all, I show that specialists have stock picking skills. Second, information flows from the specialist to the generalist. The overlap in specialist and generalist industry sub-portfolios is positively related to the past track-record of the specialist in this industry and specialist work experience and negatively related to the overall work experience and the industry track-record of the generalist. Generally, stocks held by specialists appear in more diversified funds of the family than other stocks. As a result, diversified funds from <b>fund</b> families with <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> perform better, trade more, and hold more hard-to-value stocks than their peers from families without <b>sector</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Funds {{have become}} a more popular way for investments. After the {{financial}} crisis in 2008 there was some sectors that shown a better results than other depending if the sector was affected by the economic situation or not. Therefore can  investments in <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> {{be a good way}} to get a high return, but it also has a high risk. Problem: Has the risk any impact on the return considered <b>funds</b> in <b>sectors</b> that is affected by the economic situation relatively to sectors that isn’t affected by the situation in the economy? Purpose: Determine whether <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> risk has any impact on the return. Also if there are any differences between sectors depending if they are affected by the economic situation or not. The study target is private investors who want a deeper understanding for <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> regarding the different variables you have to consider before an investment. Method: The study is based on a deductive approach and ponders in current theories. Different methods have been used with both primary and secondary data. The qualitative data is based on interviews and the quantitative data is based on statistics. To estimate if there is any connection regarding risk and return a regression analysis has been formed. Conclusion: The study shows that there is a connection between risk and return for <b>sector</b> <b>funds,</b> but that the connection is not significant. Investing in <b>sector</b> <b>funds</b> is not a long term investment, but one should distinguish between sectors that are cyclically sensitive and sectors that are not sensitive cyclically and therefore investing over various economic cycles...|$|R

In response to these findings, and recognizing the potential educational benefits of these programs, the City of Dallas teamed with the Dallas Independent School District to create Dallas ArtsPartners.|$|E

50|$|The first {{introduction}} of a mutual fund in India occurred in 1963, when the Government of India launched Unit Trust of India (UTI).
