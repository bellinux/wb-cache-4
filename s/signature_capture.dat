50|$|A PDES {{is similar}} to a {{manufacturing}} execution systems (MES) in several ways. The key distinguishing factor of a PDES is that it is tailored for steering the development of a manufacturing process, while MES is tailored for executing the volume production using the developed process. Therefore, the toolset and focus of a PDES is on lower volume but higher flexibility and experimentation freedom. The tools of an MES are more focused on less variance, higher volumes, tighter control and logistics. Both types of application software increase traceability, productivity, and quality of the delivered result. For PDESs quality refers to the capability of the process to perform without failure under a wide range of conditions, i.e. the robustness of the developed manufacturing process. For MESs quality refers {{to the quality of the}} manufactured good/commodity. Additionally both software types share functions including equipment tracking, product genealogy, labour and item tracking, costing, electronic <b>signature</b> <b>capture,</b> defect and resolution monitoring, executive dashboards, and other various reporting solutions.|$|E
50|$|The retail {{industry}} {{is one of}} the predominant users of POS terminals.A retail point of sale system typically includes a cash register (which in recent times comprises a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner) and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader. It can also include a conveyor belt, weight scale, integrated credit card processing system, a <b>signature</b> <b>capture</b> device and a customer pin pad device. While the system may include a keyboard and mouse, more and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use, and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.|$|E
5000|$|Patient Tracking - the {{movement}} of the patient through an ER, surgery center, outpatient facility, ambulatory care facility, or throughout the entire hospital is often plagued with bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and poor handoff. The patient is often the one that suffers. When an electronic patient check-in process is implemented, patient tracking can start immediately when the patient enters the building. From there, the right staff can properly be contacted. As the patient progresses along their care path, say in a surgery center, patients can be assured the most prompt service when staff communicate effectively. In addition, patient tracking provides constant measuring using electronic time stamps allowing automatic, accurate, and constant feedback on performance. Waiting Room Optimization - since patient check-in typically starts the process for a customer, optimizing the waiting room experience significantly can improve customer satisfaction scores. For example, using pagers similar to those used in the restaurant business can allow patients to freely roam the hospital and stay in constant communications with the front desk. Time Use Study Data - this kind of data is traditionally gathered manually through spot checks. Staff typically have to document times for every step of the process for a given set of patients or all patients on a given day. Then this data is manually tabulated in order to identify bottlenecks. Improvements can then be identified and an action plan can be created. After implementing the action plan, staff then repeat the process over again to measure and gauge improvement. Co-Pay and Open Balance Collections - {{the movement}} to private insurance and the increase in co-pays has many patients carrying a balance. In addition, co-pays account for a higher percentage of the overall compensation than they once did making co-pay collection a more important part of the healthcare process. Electronic Forms and <b>Signature</b> <b>Capture</b> - patient intake forms, new patient forms, consent forms, health history forms, HIPAA portability forms, and other data-driven or signature captured forms are prevalent in today’s healthcare organizations. Unfortunately, the majority of them are paper-based as of the time this article was written. Patient check-in can give healthcare organizations a chance to feed electronic data into their operations with or without a newer EMR. Eligibility Verification - to ensure that a healthcare organization gets paid for its provided services, it is common for staff to do eligibility verification via telephone or through an interactive website. Newer patient check-in systems can offer in-line eligibility checking by leveraging services like eligibilityapi.com to send requests based on the orders scheduled for that day. [...] This can provide the most up-to-date verification to ensure the healthcare organization will get paid by the carrier such as Medicaid, Medicare, or the insurance provider for the services scheduled for the day. Integration with EMR - reading demographic, appointment, order and billing data from the EMR can help improve overall workflow around patient check-in systems by reducing time spent charting any data entered into the patient check-in system. HL7 is the primary method used to integrate with EMR systems. Communications - several communication enhancements can be realized through an electronic patient check-in system. [...] For example, in a dentistry, if a patient shows up for their cleaning and the hygienist is waiting for them, immediately upon arrival the hygienist can be alerted via e-mail, text, as well as a popup on the PC. This provides the fastest service possible while allowing other staff members to optimize their time while waiting for patients to arrive. In this example, that includes an office manager as well as the hygienist. The same goes for a larger organization such as a hospital. When the patient walks into the main entrance of the hospital, a greeter can assist them during the check-in process, at that point, the system can automatically know the services they are here for or the kiosk/staff can gather that info. The system can then alert the department that their patient is on their way up so they are fully prepared when the patient arrives. Similarly, if the patient needs to flow from medical imaging to labs, electronic communications, tracking, and alerting can help hand off a patient further allowing staff to prepare for the arriving patient.|$|E

40|$|Until recently, most 3 D {{graphics}} applications {{had been}} regarded as too computationally intensive for devices other than desktop computers and gaming consoles. This notion is rapidly changing due to improving screen resolutions and computing capabilities of mass-market handheld devices such as cellular phones and PDAs. As the mobile 3 D gaming industry is poised to expand, significant innovations are required to provide users with high-quality 3 D experience under limited processing, memory and energy budgets that are characteristic of the mobile domain. Energy saving schemes such as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), as well as system-level power and performance optimization methods for mobile devices require accurate and fast workload prediction. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} workload prediction for mobile 3 D graphics. We propose and describe a signature-based estimation technique for predicting 3 D graphics workloads. By analyzing a gaming benchmark, we show that monitoring specific parameters of the 3 D pipeline provides better prediction accuracy over conventional approaches. We describe how <b>signatures</b> <b>capture</b> such parameters concisely to make accurate workload predictions. Signature-based prediction is computationally efficient because first, signatures are compact, and second, they do not require elaborate model evaluations. Thus, they are amenable to efficient, real-time prediction. A fundamental difference between signatures and standard history-based predictors is that <b>signatures</b> <b>capture</b> previous outcomes as well as the cause that led to the outcome, and use both to predict future outcomes. We illustrate the utility of signature-based workload estimation technique by using it as a basis for DVFS in 3 D graphics pipelines...|$|R

There is abundance of all kinds of data for example biometrics based data, satellite images data, chip-seq data, social network data, sensor based data etc. from a variety of sources. This data abundance {{is the result of the}} fact that storage cost is getting cheaper day by day, so people as well as almost all business or scientific organizations are storing more and more data. Most of the real data is multi-dimensional, non-uniform, and big in size, such that it requires a unique pre-processing before analyzing it. In order to make data useful for any kind of analysis, pre-processing is a very important step. This paper presents a unique and novel pre-processing method for multi-dimensional and non-uniform data with the aim of making it uniform and reduced in size without losing much of its value. We have chosen biometric signature data to demonstrate the proposed method as it qualifies for the attributes of being multi-dimensional, non-uniform and big in size. Biometric signature data does not only captures the structural characteristics of a signature but also its behavioral characteristics that are captured using a dynamic <b>signature</b> <b>capture</b> device. These features like pen pressure, pen tilt angle, time taken to sign a document when collected in real-time turn out to be of varying dimensions. This feature data set along with the structural data needs to be pre-processed in order to use it to train a machine learning based model for signature verification purposes. We demonstrate the success of the proposed method over other methods using experimental results for biometric signature data but the same can be implemented for any other data with similar properties from a different domain.

Zetes wants to enhance the business performance of its customers by delivering solutions that increase the accuracy and security of data and to increases productivity, efficiency, cost savings and profitability. Zetes Burótica is the subsidiary of Zetes Industries in Portugal. One of the products they develop is proof of delivery solutions for bigger companies that have more specific requirements and need integration with existing software. A proof of delivery solution offers the customer the possibility to track and trace parcels. Smaller companies also have these demands but the solution they want needs to be less complex, because these companies {{do not have the}} time and money to analyze and design a mobile application. Zetes wants a standard solution and will offer this software on the "Cloud". This means the clients will pay a monthly subscription for the software. Our assignment is to develop this standard solution in customers are able to customize the product for their own needs. The name of our project is "Smart Proof". This consists of three business objects: The Mobile smart proof solution, Smart proof portal and Mobile communicator gateway. We implement the mobile Smart Proof solution. It enables the execution of services and consists of three major components. First we have the communication component, in which the upload and download process settings are saved. The login component makes it possible to identify the user operator and also the vehicle.
