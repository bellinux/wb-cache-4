50|$|One {{hundred years}} after the {{founding}} of the company, a factory in Esslingen began construction. At that time the company had 20 employees. In 1881, company's and Germany's first file production machine was commissioned. In 1889, Friedr. Dick built a new factory in Kollwitz/Fleischmannstrasse in Esslingen, employing 100 people and expanding the product line to include knives for butchers and chefs, cleavers and other specialized tools. Files manufactured ranged from the smallest watchmaker's file to the largest (over 45 cm in length) <b>square</b> <b>file.</b> In 1997, the F. Dick company moved to a new headquarters in Deizisau, Germany. The old factory in Esslingen is now a class listed monument and the town's landmark.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times <b>Square</b> <b>filed</b> for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt {{that it would not}} be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost of the extensive renovation required in order to make it suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|R

25|$|After {{graduating from}} Tokyo Zokei University, Hiroyuki Ito joined Square in 1987. He {{initially}} worked on Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II as a debugger but first became genuinely involved with game development while creating sound effects for Final Fantasy III. His next major role was as the {{designer of the}} Active Time Battle system for Final Fantasy IV. <b>Square</b> <b>filed</b> a Japanese patent application related to the ATB system on 16 July 1991 and a corresponding US application on 16 March 1992. One Japanese patent (JP2794230) and two US patents (US5390937 and US5649862) were granted based on these applications. For Final Fantasy V, Ito designed the fully customizable Job system. He also created the 'Chicken Knife or Brave Blade' choosing event. Final Fantasy VI {{marked the first time}} that Ito became a director on a game. For this title, {{he was in charge of}} all battle aspects. He was also responsible for the battle systems in Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy Tactics before he once more took on the role of director with Final Fantasy IX.

50|$|Even a defended piece can be vulnerable. If the {{defending}} piece is also defending something else, {{it is called}} an overworked piece, {{and may not be}} able to fulfill its task. When there is more than one attacking piece, the number of defenders must also be increased, and their values taken into account. In addition to defending pieces, it is also often necessary to defend key <b>squares,</b> open <b>files,</b> and the back rank. These situations can easily occur if the pawn structure is weak.|$|R

50|$|In numeric {{notation}} all the squares are numbered with a two-digit number. In this simple coordinate system the first digit describes the file {{and the second}} one the rank. A move is defined by pairing two of these two-digit coordinates together: the move that would be written 1. e4 in algebraic notation would be written 1. 5254 in {{numeric notation}}. The pawn starts from <b>square</b> (5,2) (<b>file</b> 5, rank 2) and moves to (5,4). Neither the type of the moving piece nor captures are specifically marked in Numeric notation - all moves, except for pawn promotion, consist of only four digits.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the Pension Fund building`s construction, academism, {{although}} still a steady constant in the architecture of the capital, gave way to the purified modernism. The Art Deco had already been established in Belgrade, {{under the influence of the}} western centres. The postulates of those styles are recognizable in the construction of the building. The Terazije-facing elevation displays a hierarchy typical for academism. It is perforated by the calm rhythm of windows. Double shallow pilasters with the simple base and capitals rise through the first four floors. In the highest zone there are two cartouches which accentuate the corner part. The ground floor with transparent shop windows is set back from the upper levels providing the deep, brightly-lit overhang. On the facade facing the Nikola Pašić Square there is a <b>square</b> <b>filed</b> intended for displaying former cinema repertoire, and nowadays for the theatre repertoire. Stone-clad facades are modernized, with no heavy decorative plastic. The most original element is the main entrance to the cinema in art deco style. The entrance hall in the form of a high-ceiling vestibule, with the mosaic floor, playbill display cases and ornamented portal represents the unique creation in Belgrade. The entrance is decorated with the bronze and wrought-iron grille gate, with the medallion in the middle, depicting a nude dancing couple. The author of the bronze sculpture of the dancing couple was the Russian artist Vladimir Zagorodnjuk.|$|R

After several years of litigation, the suit finally went to trial in May 1976.

First Wisconsin appealed the ruling, and in August 1977, a federal court ruled the case be retried due to the complexity of the original trial, along with the plaintiffs being allowed more time and the admission of hearsay testimony. Upon appeal, in June 1978 the court ruled in favor of First Wisconsin in clearing the company of all charges.|$|R
