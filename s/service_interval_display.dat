40|$|A problem {{attributed}} to first parity sows {{is the second}} litter syndrome (the number of piglets of the second litter is lower or similar to the first litter). The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the frequency of sows showing the second litter syndrome and to determine the effect of some risk factors on the drop of the liter size of second parity sows in a commercial farm in La Piedad Michoacan, Mexico. Data on 6809 sows were used. The data were analyzed by a binomial logistic regression model. The model included the fixed effect of year and season of farrowing, breed group, weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and pigs born alive at first parity. 48. 1 % of the sows showed the syndrome. Year of farrowing, weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and pigs born alive had effect (P< 0. 05) on the second-litter syndrome. Sows with more than 17 days weaning to <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> had lower odds, and sows with large litters born alive at first parity had higher odds of a drop in litter size at second parity. Therefore, greater attention should be given to first parity sows with large litters at first parity...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and several measures of reproductive performance were examined in 1738 lactation records from cows in 32 southern Ontario Holstein herds. Lactation records were divided into three separate health categories based on postpartal disease histories. Relationships between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and the first service conception rate, number of services per conception and open interval were similar for all three categories. The first service conception rate was lower and {{the average number of}} services per conception higher in cows first mated before 60 days when compared to cows first mated after 60 days. The relationship between the calving to first <b>service</b> <b>interval</b> and the open interval indicated that for each day that mating was delayed the open interval was extended by 0. 86 days. Overall conception rates may be lower for cows first mated very early or very late, but differences in the overall conception rate were only significant for cows with a reproductive tract infection. Unless very expensive semen is being used, it is suggested that disease free cows be mated at the first heat occurring after 40 days postpartum, and that cows with postpartal disease be mated at the first heat occurring after 60 days postpartum. ...|$|R
