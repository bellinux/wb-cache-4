Within this official framework, the Danish government engaged Somalia's constituent autonomous regions, including Puntland, Somaliland and South Central Somalia, through the Interpeace programmes on democratisation, peace and women's engagement. It also established and funded the Somaliland Fund for the Somaliland regional administration's key areas. Additionally, local governance accountability and transparency were supported through JPLG, as well as gender equality via the UNDP. In terms of growth and employment, Denmark supported enabling business sector environment and fisheries and gums/resins value chains via the World Bank PSD programme in Puntland and Somaliland. It likewise supported marketing and institutional development through Terra Nuova in both regions' livestock sectors. To strengthen living standards, the Danish authorities also engaged in humanitarian support through the CHF and NGOs. In total, the development budget for 2011-14 was DKK 364 million, with DKK 20 million reserved for peace initiatives in Somalia.|$|E
