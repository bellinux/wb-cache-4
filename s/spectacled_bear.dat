5|$|The New World short-faced bears (Tremarctinae) {{differentiated}} from Ursinae {{following a}} dispersal event into North America during the mid-Miocene (about 13 Mya). They invaded South America (≈1 Ma) following {{formation of the}} Isthmus of Panama. Their earliest fossil representative is Plionarctos in North America (~ 10–2 Ma). This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the North American short-faced bears (genus Arctodus), the South American short-faced bears (Arctotherium), and the spectacled bears, Tremarctos, represented by both an extinct North American species (T. floridanus), and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear</b> (T. ornatus).|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a woolen mask, the ukukus (<b>spectacled</b> <b>bear)</b> {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims. Some also {{go up to the}} glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of glacier ice and carry them on their backs to their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between early rearing experience and reproductive competence in captive adult giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears</b> (Tremarctos ornatus). Life history information of 52 giant pandas and 34 <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears</b> were obtained from the International Studbook and by interviewing staff at institutions housing the subjects. The early rearing experience variables included duration of mother rearing, social access within 1 -yr period following maternal separation, and birth origin. Correlation, Chi-square, and logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Contrary to findings from studies with other animals, the results generally suggest that early rearing experience is not related to adult reproductive success in giant pandas and <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears.</b> Alternative explanation and limitation of the study were discussed; suggestions were made for future study.

5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear,</b> which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E

40|$|Jersey Zoo, {{headquarters}} of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, currently maintains 1. 1 <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears</b> Tremarctos ornatus. During the 18 month building process for a new mixed species exhibit for our bears, the pair resided in temporary accommodation until their new exhibit was completed. In an effort to minimise expense and yet provide a large and complex environment for the temporary housing of our bears, we decided to convert a paddock enclosure previously occupied by Przewalski’s horses Equus przewalskii. The dilapidated chain link perimeter of the horse paddock was removed and replaced with a 1. 5 m high electric fence which formed the primary barrier for housing the <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears.</b> The bears were habituated to the fence and managed so successfully in this environment that {{the decision was made}} to modify the construction of the perimeter for our new enclosure to include electric fencing, resulting in a significant cost savings. This paper will describe our experiences managing <b>spectacled</b> <b>bears</b> using electric fence perimeters. It is intended to highlight the advantages of using electric fencing as a safe and inexpensive alternative to traditional “hard ” perimeters. Bear species have historicall...|$|R

25|$|The American {{black bear}} lived {{during the same}} period as short-faced bears (Arctodus simus and A. pristinus) and the Florida <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear</b> (Tremarctos floridanus). These Tremarctine bears evolved from bears that had emigrated from Asia to North America 7–8 ma. The short-faced bears are thought to have been heavily {{carnivorous}} and the Florida <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear</b> more herbivorous, while the American black bears remained arboreal omnivores, like their Asian ancestors. The black bear's generalist behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why, of these three genera, it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through the last ice age while the other more specialized North American predators became extinct. However, both Arctodus and Tremarctos had survived several other ice ages. After these prehistoric ursids became extinct during the last glacial period 10,000nbsp&years ago, black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the migration of brown bears {{to the rest of the}} continent.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of Panama {{was perhaps the}} most important geological event to occur in the last 60 million years. Atlantic and Pacific currents were closed off from each other, which caused the {{formation of}} the Gulf Stream, which made Europe warmer. The land bridge allowed the isolated creatures of South America to migrate over to North America, and vice versa. Various species migrated south, leading to the presence in South America of llamas, the <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear,</b> kinkajous and jaguars.|$|E
25|$|The short-faced bear {{belongs to}} a group of bears known as the Tremarctinae, which {{appeared}} in North America during the earliest parts of the late Miocene epoch in the form of Plionarctos, a genus considered ancestral to Arctodus. During the Great American Interchange that followed the joining of North and South America, tremarctines invaded South America, leading to the evolution of Arctotherium and the modern <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear</b> (Tremarctos ornatus). Although the early history of Arctodus is poorly known, it evidently became widespread in North America by the Kansan age about 800,000 years ago.|$|E

500|$|The family Ursidae {{is one of}} nine {{families}} in the suborder Caniformia, or [...] "doglike" [...] carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear),</b> and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the <b>spectacled</b> <b>bear</b> 52. These smaller numbers {{can be explained by}} the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.|$|E
