25|$|It is {{said that}} the city of Cholula has 365 churches, either one for {{each day of the}} year or one for each pre-Hispanic temple that used to be there. In reality, there are only thirty seven churches; 159, if all the small chapels {{including}} those on local haciendas and ranches are counted. One legend states that the first chapel to be built in Cholula was in the San Miguelito neighborhood on what is now the outskirts of the city. It was the first structure with a red tile roof, and it was dedicated to the Archangel Michael. It is said to have contained an image of the angel, which contained inside a small demon tied to a post. As people venerated the image of the archangel, they also acknowledged the demon, in case the angel decided not to hear their pleas. This eventually gave the chapel an evil reputation as more came to ask for favors from the demon, favors that one would not ask of a saint or angel. The demon began to be blamed for misfortunes that befell in the area, as, the legend <b>said,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> occurred, the demon image would be found untied. Eventually, the image of the archangel with the demon inside was taken away and eventually disappeared.|$|E
500|$|While {{not ideal}} for transcontinental travel, Iowa's dirt roads were of high quality. [...] Foreigners even {{compared}} {{them to the}} best roads in France. [...] However, the same could not be <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were wet. [...] The mud was so thick and viscous it was nicknamed [...] "". [...] To show travelers the obvious benefits of paved roads, the Lincoln Highway Association began {{the process of creating}} seedling miles of paved roads. [...] The idea, according to Henry B. Joy, then-president of the Lincoln Highway Association, was to show travelers, for , how fast and smooth their trip could be, only to bring them back to reality {{at the end of the}} mile. [...] Seedling miles were placed at least [...] from the nearest town and in areas where the terrain was rough. [...] Between August 1918 and June 1919, Iowa's first seedling mile was built in Linn County, west of Mount Vernon. [...] The ribbon of concrete, which was [...] wide, [...] thick, and crowned for drainage , cost nearly $35,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) to build.|$|E
500|$|Schafer {{credited}} both LucasArts and Disney {{for help}} in creating the remaster, which follows from a similar remastering of Grim Fandango, as well by Double Fine, in January 2015. Schafer <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> originally were about to secure the rights to Grim Fandango from LucasArts to make the remaster, {{they did not originally}} have plans to redo the other LucasArts adventure games, but with the passionate response they got on the news of the Grim Fandango remaster, they decided to continue these efforts. Schafer described getting the rights to Day of the Tentacle a [...] "miracle" [...] though aided by {{the fact that many of}} the executives in the legal rights chain had fond memories of playing these games and helped to secure the rights. Schafer has expressed interest in continuing to restore these older titles, listing Full Throttle as his next goal, which is also confirmed to release in the future. 2 Player Productions, which has worked before with Double Fine to document their game development process, also created a mini-documentary for Day of the Tentacle Remastered, which included a visit to the Skywalker Ranch, where LucasArts games were originally developed, where much of the original concept art and digital files for the game and other LucasArts adventure games were archived.|$|E
