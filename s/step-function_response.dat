40|$|The {{question}} of whether global warming affects phytopigments within Symbiodinium spp. of coral is central to understanding the process of coral bleaching. In this study, corals A cropora hyacinthus, Porites solida, and Favites complanata were exposed to elevated temperatures (28, 30, 32, and 34 o C) for 48 h and the responses of Symbiodinium chl a, chl c, total carotenoids, total phaeophytins, and fucoxanthins were examined. In A. hyacinthus, the phytopigment concentrations at 28 and 30 o C were significantly different from 32 and 34 o C, implying a <b>step-function</b> <b>response</b> initiated between 30 and 32 o C. In P. solida, all phytopigments varied significantly between the temperatures, except {{in the case of}} total carotenoids which had no significant response. In F. complanata, all phytopigments decreased linearly as temperature increased. Our results indicate that decreases in Symbiodinium phytopigments in response to heat stress may be a need to adapt while their host coral may already be adapted (or exapted) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of the composite superconducting transition edge bolometer. The temperature sensitive element is an aluminum strip evaporated onto the sapphire substrate. A bismuth film evaporated on the reverse side of the substrate is used to absorb the submillimeter radiation. The noise limitation of the bolometer is calculated. The fabrication and measured performance are described. The best electrical NEP (noise-equivalent-power) obtained is (1. 7 {+-} 0. 1) x 10 {sup - 15 } WHz{sup - 1 / 2 } at 2 Hz at an operating temperature of 1. 27 K. This NEP is within a factor of 2 of the thermal noise limit. The effective absorptivity of the bismuth film is measured to be 0. 47 {+-} 0. 05, and the corresponding detectivity D* is calculated to be (1. 1 {+-} 0. 1) x 10 {sup 14 } cm w{sup - 1 }Hz{sup 1 / 2 }. Suggestions are made for further improvements in sensitivity. The current-dependent noise in thin metal films at the superconducting transition has been further investigated. The measured noise power spectrum of the tin film on sapphire substrate at the superconducting transition is compared with the cosine transforms of the decay curves obtained from step-function and {delta}-function thermal perturbations. The nature of the noise driving term is found to be a random current flowing inside the sample, in agreement with the uncorrelated thermal fluctuation model. This result is consistent with the case of a freely suspended tin fiber at the superconducting transition, but in contrast to the room temperature measurement where the cosine transform of the <b>step-function</b> <b>response</b> gives the noise power spectrum, in agreement with the correlated fluctuation model...|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} of integrating and differentiating circuits to a pulse front time rises linearly up {{to a certain}} time and then flattens out have been studied, Generally, the analysis of such circuits is made by assuming the input pulse -to be a <b>step-function.</b> That the <b>responses</b> obtained by such an analysis are much different from those found {{in the case of a}} linearly rising pulse that flattens out after a certain time, has been shown clearly in both cases of cascaded differentiating and integrating circuits. When the rise time is very short, the output pulse shape becomes almost similar to that in the case of step-function input pulse. As the rise time and the number of cascaded sections increase, the magnitude as well as the rate of rise of the integrated output pulse sharply begins to diminish. In the case of differentiation, the maximum output voltage depends very much upon the rise time...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{radiocarbon}} bomb-pulse {{time histories}} of annually resolved archives from temperate regions have been underexploited. We present here series of Delta C- 14 excess from known-age annual increments of the long-lived bivalve mollusk Arctica islandica from 4 sites across the coastal North Atlantic (German Bight, North Sea; Tromso, north Norway; Siglufjordur, north Icelandic shelf; Grimsey, north Icelandic shelf) combined with published series from Georges Bank and Sable Bank (NW Atlantic) and the Oyster Ground (North Sea). The atmospheric bomb pulse {{is shown to}} be a <b>step-function</b> whose <b>response</b> in the marine environment is immediate but of smaller amplitude and which has a longer decay time {{as a result of the}} much larger marine carbon reservoir. Attenuation is determined by the regional hydrographic setting of the sites, vertical mixing, processes controlling the isotopic exchange of C- 14 at the air-sea boundary, C- 14 content of the freshwater flux, primary productivity, and the residence time of organic matter in the sediment mixed layer. The inventories form a sequence from high magnitude-early peak (German Bight) to low magnitude-late peak (Grimsey). All series show a rapid response to the increase in atmospheric Delta C- 14 excess but a slow response to the subsequent decline resulting from the succession of rapid isotopic air-sea exchange followed by the more gradual isotopic equilibration in the mixed layer due to the variable marine carbon reservoir and incorporation of organic carbon from the sediment mixed layer. The data constitute calibration series for the use of the bomb pulse as a high-resolution dating tool in the marine environment and as a tracer of coastal ocean water masses...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the length and {{diameter}} of the transmission lines between a pressure transducer and the pressure source can significantly affect the dynamic frequency response of the transducer. A new lumped parameter model has been developed to predict the time and frequency response of any number of different transducers connected in parallel in a manifold. While the model is simple to apply, it can provide quantitative information given the transducer and transmission line characteristic parameters. More importantly, the model can be used to evaluate the measured, in-situ response. this provides the natural frequency and the effective damping which can then be used to generate a frequency response curve. The model is also useful for designing a new pressure transmission system, which will have the required frequency response. The model was qualified by comparison to measurements of the <b>step-function</b> pressure <b>response</b> of a number of different transducers and test installations. With the aid of the model, the system resonant frequency and damping can be determined. Additional damping can be added if necessary to prevent ringing of the signal and to assure an accurate pressure measurement with a flat frequency response. For all of the experimental systems evaluated in this work, the response at the natural frequency was significantly underdamped and ringing was observed. This means that to perform accurate measurements damping needs {{to be added to the}} system. It was observed that the use of flexible pressure lines versus hard lines does increase the damping and may therefore be useful in certain situations. Equations were developed to permit sizing an orifice to be added to the system to provide the necessary damping...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Accompanying {{data file}} formats may be {{obsolete}} and not compatible with current technology. Presentation date: 1995 - 03 - 07 A {{change to a}} warmer, drier climate beginning as early as 1900 was responsible for triggering a dramatic, rapid retreat of Collier Glacier, Oregon, between 1924 and 1940. Although there was a dramatic decrease in precipitation contemporaneous with this observed "step-function" response of mass loss, it is unclear if climate was the primary cause. Two topographic factors resulting from the blockage of Collier Glacier's trough by a prominent volcanic cone (Collier Cone) may have further influenced this <b>step-function</b> <b>response</b> to climate change. Specifically, (1) an increase in equilibrium line altitude (ELA) sensitivity resulting from an abnormally low ice surface gradient in the lower trough may have served only to augment climatic forcing, and (2) {{the presence of a}} subglacial lake dammed by lower trough topography may have reduced bed resistance and increased ice-velocity in the lower trough, thus maintaining glacier length as the glacier thinned. Mass balance data collected from 1989 - 1994 indicate that the general form of the annual mass balance (be) curve did not change appreciably over this time; instead this curve translated back and forth along the net mass balance axis from balance year to balance year, as the ELA shifted up and down. There was considerable mass loss relative to previous years during the 199 1 - 1992 and 1993 - 1994 measurement years, and a considerable increase in mass during the 1992 - 1993 measurement year. Between 1989 and 1993 net mass balance averaged approximately - 0. 4 'm H 20 per year. Average summer temperature appears to be more important than annual winter accumulation in controlling annual net mass balance during the study period. Characteristic secondary fluctuations of the b curve in the ablation zone were also observed during the study period. These fluctuations are apparently reflecting the distribution of net ice-surface shortwave radiation, although wind direction may also play a role. Analysis of oblique photographs (1910 - 1960), and topographic mapping via photogrammetric methods (1967, 1973 and 1982) and land survey (1993 - 1994) has revealed the continued development (i. e. steepening) of a prominent icefall. Successive years of decreased net mass accumulation may have slowed the flux of ice from above this icefall, which has in turn caused a large reservoir of ice below the icefall to deflate. The presence of this reservoir may have bolstered ice flux to the ablation zone since 1973 as terminus location has remained relatively unchanged since this time. However, if future climatic conditions continue to be relatively warm and dry, the reservoir will continue to deflate, until this ice surplus is exhausted. This may result in an abrupt reduction of ice flux to the terminus, which could in turn cause a rapid terminus retreat towards the icefall...|$|E
