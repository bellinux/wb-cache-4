5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (<b>single</b> <b>frame,</b> four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|In {{one shot}} Guinness appears as seven of his {{characters}} at {{once in a}} <b>single</b> <b>frame.</b> This was accomplished by masking the lens. The film was re-exposed several times with Guinness in different positions over several days. Douglas Slocombe, the cinematographer {{in charge of the}} effect, recalled sleeping in the studio to make sure nobody touched the camera.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

25|$|Moving {{from east}} to west, Chang’an Boulevard {{traverses}} Beijing’s most iconic avenue. Along the boulevard’s 45-kilometer length, it recorded the changing densities of its far-flung suburbs, central business districts, and political core. At each 50-meter increment, the artist records a <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> for one minute. The work reveals the rhythm of Beijing as a capital city, its social structure, cityscape, socialist-planned economy, capitalist market, political power center, commercial buildings, and industrial units as pieces of a multi-layered urban collage.|$|E

Beijing: The Second Ring was entirely shot on cloudy days, while the segments for Beijing: The Third Ring were entirely shot on sunny days. The films document the historic aspects and modern development of {{a city with a}} population of nearly 11 million people.|$|E
25|$|Paul Langevin and von Laue {{showed that}} the twin paradox can be {{completely}} resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, {{and one of them}} is accelerating and coming back to the other, then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a <b>single</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1975 Davis {{travelled}} to Australia {{to compete}} in the World Championship, where he played Dennis Taylor in an ordinary club billiard room in which a large number of one-armed bandits were in constant use. Hampered by such conditions, an unhappy Davis lost by a <b>single</b> <b>frame,</b> 15–14. The 1975 Watney Open in Leeds provided some consolation, and Davis beat Patsy Fagan 13–9 and John Spencer 13–12 before losing 17–11 in the final to Alex Higgins. Davis stated that a win over Spencer convinced him that he could still compete at the highest level of tournament play.|$|E
25|$|A {{projection}} system with two CRTs {{was better than}} three, but still not practical for a home receiver. Baird continued to consider other solutions. One used a single conventional CRT with the two images displayed in a <b>single</b> <b>frame,</b> with {{the top half of}} the image containing the image for one color and the bottom the other. Lens systems focused on the display were positioned to see only the top or bottom image, passed them through filters, and then recombined them on a screen. There were drawings showing a similar system with three frames. Like many similar efforts from other experimenters, Baird abandoned this approach.|$|E
25|$|After Davis {{retired from}} world {{championship}} play, the next dominant force was {{his younger brother}} Fred Davis who had lost the 1940 final by a <b>single</b> <b>frame.</b> By 1947 he was deemed ready by his brother {{to take over the}} mantle but lost the world final to the Scotsman Walter Donaldson. After this setback, Fred and Walter contested the next four finals with Fred proving himself the stronger player. After the abandonment of the world championship in 1953, with the 1952 final boycotted by British professionals, the Professional Match Play Championship became the unofficial world championship in all but name. Fred won the event every year until its penultimate one, when in 1957 he did not enter.|$|E
50|$|A {{still video}} camera {{is a type}} of {{electronic}} camera that takes still images and stores them as <b>single</b> <b>frames</b> of video. They peaked in popularity in the late 1980s and {{can be seen as the}} predecessor to the digital camera. The best known models include the Sony Mavica and Canon's Ion and Xapshot cameras.|$|R

We also evaluated our implementation of CCF+SDt to compare to our temporal ConvNets.|$|R
25|$|Internet Explorer 8 {{introduces}} {{some major}} architectural changes, called Loosely Coupled IE (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, {{each of which}} can be of a different integrity level; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous Inter-Process Communication to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> process for all web sites. In Windows Vista with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.|$|E
25|$|Wide-field multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{refers to}} an optical non-linear imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or second harmonic generation. In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E
25|$|Higgins beat Michael Holt, Fergal O'Brien, Ronnie O'Sullivan, and Stephen Maguire {{en route}} to the final. His break of 122 in the 29th frame of his semi-final against Maguire, on {{recovering}} from a deficit of 10–14 in the final session to prevail 17–15, was the 1,000th century to be made at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield since the World Championship was first staged there in 1977. In the final, Higgins held a 12–4 advantage over Mark Selby overnight, but Selby reduced his arrears to a <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> on day two. However, at 14–13, Higgins rediscovered his form to win four consecutive frames to clinch the match 18–13 to secure his second World title at 12:54am, the latest finish to a World final (equalled when Neil Robertson beat Graeme Dott in 2010); and nine years after his first title– the longest time span between successes since Alex Higgins (1972, 1982), and the longest at The Crucible. He regained World no. 1 status.|$|E
