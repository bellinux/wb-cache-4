The [...] "Magnolia coincap" [...] (Strobilurus conigenoides) is smaller and grows on the cones of Magnolias.

C.cookei has roughly <b>spherical,</b> <b>light</b> brown to yellowish sclerotia, while C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. A microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. In contrast, C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E

40|$|Precomputed {{radiance}} transfer {{techniques have}} been broadly used for supporting complex illumination effects on diffuse and glossy objects. Although {{working with the}} wavelet domain is efficient in handling all-frequency illumination, the spherical harmonics domain is more convenient for interactively changing lights and views on the fly due to the rotational invariant nature of the spherical harmonic domain. For interactive lighting, however, the number of coefficients must be limited and the high orders of coefficients have to be eliminated. Therefore <b>spherical</b> harmonic <b>lighting</b> has been preferred and practiced only for interactive soft-diffuse lighting. In this paper, we propose a simple but practical filtering solution using locally adaptive products of high-order harmonic coefficients within the genuine <b>spherical</b> harmonic <b>lighting</b> framework. Our approach works out on the fly in two folds. We first conduct multi-level filtering on vertices {{in order to determine}} regions of interests, where the high orders of harmonics are necessary for high frequency lighting. The initially determined regions of interests are then refined through filling in the incomplete regions by traveling the neighboring vertices. Even not relying on graphics hardware, the proposed method allows to compute high order products of <b>spherical</b> harmonic <b>lighting</b> for both diffuse and specular lighting...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the image by the Lorentz {{transformation}} of a <b>spherical</b> (circular) <b>light</b> wave, emitted by a moving source, is not a <b>spherical</b> (circular) <b>light</b> wave but an ellipsoidal (elliptical) light wave. Poincare's ellipsoid (ellipse) is the direct geometrical representation of Poincare's relativity of simultaneity. Einstein's spheres (circles) are the direct geometrical representation of Einstein's convention of synchronisation. Poincare adopts another convention for the definition of space-time units involving that the Lorentz transformation of an unit of length is directly proportional to Lorentz transformation of an unit of time. Poincare's relativistic kinematics predicts both a dilation of time and an expansion of space as well.

Moreover, we prove that if the original distribution can be sampled and/or integrated over a spherical cap, then so can the transformed distribution.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a technique to}} visualize smoke and fire data generated from the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulation model using Monte-Carlo single and multiple scattering. I use established physics to extract the necessary data to visualize the smoke. The major challenge in smoke rendering with the fire simulation data is that the simulation resolution is not high enough for the visual effects of radiation occlusion. Standard volume lighting methods do not work well for fire since extensive areas can radiate as light sources, making the rendering prohibitively expensive. The proposed concepts of voxel <b>lighting</b> and <b>spherical</b> <b>lighting</b> mimic blackbody radiation in a unit area, approximating area diffuse lights with a sampling of point lights.
