5|$|A near-Earth <b>supernova</b> is a <b>supernova</b> {{close enough}} to the Earth to have {{noticeable}} effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the <b>supernova,</b> it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a <b>supernova</b> would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|First {{observed}} in September 2006, the <b>supernova</b> SN 2006gy, which {{occurred in a}} galaxy called NGC 1260 (240 million light-years away), is the largest and, until confirmation of luminosity of SN 2005ap in October 2007, the most luminous <b>supernova</b> ever observed. The explosion was at least 100 times more luminous than any previously observed <b>supernova,</b> with the progenitor star being estimated 150 times more massive than the Sun. Although this had some characteristics of a Type Ia <b>supernova,</b> Hydrogen {{was found in the}} spectrum. It is thought that SN 2006gy is a likely candidate for a pair-instability <b>supernova.</b> SN 2005ap, which was discovered by Robert Quimby who also discovered SN 2006gy, was about twice as bright as SN 2006gy and about 300 times as bright as a normal type II <b>supernova.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a <b>supernova</b> {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was {{certainly}} in the final stages of its life, and would die as a <b>supernova,</b> there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a <b>supernova</b> would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its <b>supernova</b> would not affect Earth.

5|$|The rate of <b>supernova</b> {{discovery}} steadily increased {{throughout the}} twentieth century. In the 1990s, several automated <b>supernova</b> search programs were initiated. The Leuschner Observatory <b>Supernova</b> Search program was begun in 1992 at Leuschner Observatory. It was joined {{the same year}} by the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope program. These were succeeded in 1996 by the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory, which was primarily used for the Lick Observatory <b>Supernova</b> Search (LOSS). By 2000, the Lick program resulted in the discovery of 96 supernovae, making it the world's most successful <b>Supernova</b> search program.|$|E
5|$|When the {{spectrum}} of a TypeII <b>supernova</b> is examined, it normally displays Balmer absorption lines – reduced flux at the characteristic frequencies where hydrogen atoms absorb energy.

5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a <b>supernova</b> remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II <b>supernova</b> explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the <b>supernova</b> reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the <b>supernova,</b> as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E
40|$|Stars {{more massive}} than $sim$ 20 - 25 ms form {{a black hole}} {{at the end of}} their evolution. Stars with {{non-rotating}} black holes are likely to collapse "quietly" ejecting a small amount of heavy elements (Faint <b>supernovae).</b> In contrast, stars with rotating black holes are likely to give rise to very energetic <b>supernovae</b> (Hypernovae). We present distinct nucleosynthesis features of these two types of "black-hole-forming" <b>supernovae.</b> Nucleosynthesis in Hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios (Zn,Co,V,Ti) /Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr) /Fe than normal <b>supernovae,</b> which can explain the observed trend of these ratios in extremely metal-poor stars. Nucleosynthesis in Faint <b>supernovae</b> is characterized by a large amount of fall-back. We show that the abundance pattern of the recently discovered most Fe-poor star, HE 0107 - 5240, and other extremely metal-poor carbon-rich stars are in good accord with those of black-hole-forming <b>supernovae,</b> but not pair-instability <b>supernovae.</b> This suggests that black-hole-forming <b>supernovae</b> made important contributions to the early Galactic (and cosmic) chemical evolution.

40|$|Long {{duration}} gamma-ray bursts are a rare subclass of stripped-envelope core-collapse <b>supernovae</b> that launch collimated relativistic outflows (jets).

5|$|A <b>supernova</b> is a cataclysmic {{explosion}} of a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, <b>supernova</b> explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a <b>supernova</b> react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A <b>supernova</b> explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a <b>supernova</b> explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 <b>supernova</b> explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

5|$|A type Ia <b>supernova</b> (type one-a) {{is a type}} of <b>supernova</b> {{that occurs}} in binary systems (two stars {{orbiting}} one another) in which one of the stars is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant star to an even smaller white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} <b>supernova</b> at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest <b>supernova</b> in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a <b>supernova,</b> which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical <b>supernova</b> to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a <b>supernova</b> of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
