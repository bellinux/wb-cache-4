With a beam of 17½ feet, the craft has enough room to carry four Combat Rubber Raiding Crafts with six outboard motors (2 spares) and fuel, to deploy forces from a clandestine distance.

50|$|The {{original}} Mk V SOC {{was designed}} to address {{the lack of any}} specifically conceived SEAL insertion craft. Prior to the Mk V SOC, SEALs traveled on any form of surface transport available, often resorting to taping lawn furniture to the deck of the available craft. The original Mk V competition included three different designs, one Kevlar composite monohull, one aluminum monohull and one aluminum catamaran hull; the aluminum monohull won. The Mk V SOC specifically incorporated a modular <b>shock</b> <b>mitigation</b> seating design to minimize injury. Experience gained during training and operational usage showed the aluminum monohull transmitted the impact with the water to the craft's occupants more readily than a composite hull. Even after modifications such as the addition of shock-absorbing seats, the boats are capable of generating up to 20 Gs of force while slamming across waves. This led to many cases of bruises, sprained ankles, chipped teeth, and back, neck and joint injuries. These injuries necessitated a replacement.|$|E

A 3 -D printer was modified for compatibility with a dual extruder and Diamond Hotend mixer.

40|$|International audienceMine {{fields and}} UneXploded Ordnances (UXO) become a danger {{regarding}} maritime activities. Since UXOs are strongly affected by marine corrosion after decades, they cannot be handled safely. A safe solution {{to get rid}} of them would be to explode them in their locations. However, this method generates noise pollution and damaging <b>shock</b> waves. <b>Mitigation</b> of <b>shocks</b> and noises is made possible by the use of a bubble curtain set around the explosive charge. Physical aspects of shock propagation in bubbly flows have been the subject of numerous investigations in the past decades and theoretical models of aerated liquids now reproduce main shock features with acceptable accuracy in the case of a uniform distribution of bubbles of the same size. However, the bubble distribution obtained by air blown in a porous pipe is far to be monodisperse. So the modeling of the interaction of a shock wave with a polydisperse medium still remains a challenge. In the present study, the transmission of a shock wave propagating through a bubble curtain is investigated experimentally on a water filled tank. A microporous pipe, connected to a compressed air supply system and a flowmeter, is placed on the floor in the tank. A dual-tip fiber optical probe is used to measure the gas fraction distribution, bubble rising velocity and bubble size distribution in the curtain. A calibrated shock wave is generated by plate impact, upstream of the bubble curtain, and recorded downstream with a hydrophone. The mitigation of the pressure peak by the bubbly medium is evidenced by recorded pressure signals with and without bubble curtain. Experimental gas fraction profiles and bubble size distributions, measured in the bubble curtains, are finally used as input parameters in the numerical model developed by Grandjean et al. (2011). This numerical model enables prediction of <b>shock</b> wave <b>mitigation</b> and allows calibrating a suitable bubble curtain...|$|R

40|$|Research on <b>shock</b> wave <b>mitigation</b> in {{channels}} {{has been}} a topic of much attention in the shock wave community. One approach to attenuate an incident shock wave is to use obstacles of various geometries arranged in different patterns. This work is inspired by the study from Chaudhuri et al. (2013), in which cylinders, squares and triangles placed in staggered and non-staggered subsequent columns were used to attenuate a planar incident shock wave. Here, we present numerical simulations using a different obstacle pattern. Instead of using a matrix of obstacles, an arrangement of square or cylindrical obstacles placed along a logarithmic spiral curve is investigated, which is motivated by our previous work on shock focusing using logarithmic spirals. Results show that obstacles placed along a logarithmic spiral can delay both the transmitted and the reflected shock wave. For different incident shock Mach numbers, away from the logarithmic spiral design Mach number, this shape is effective to either delay the transmitted or the reflected shock wave. Results also confirm {{that the degree of}} attenuation depends on the obstacle shape, effective flow area and obstacle arrangement, much like other obstacle configurations...|$|R
40|$|CIVINSUnited States Special Forces use {{high-speed}} planing {{boats in}} the performance of their missions. Operation of these boats, particularly in rough seas, exposes the occupants to severe mechanical shock exposure that has been linked to significant increase in the rates of acute and chronic injury. While many government and civilian organizations have researched various aspects of this problem over the past decade or more, no effective solution has yet been implemented in the fleet. In response to this problem, the Commander Naval Special Warfare Command in San Diego, CA forwarded a request to MIT's Ocean Engineering Department calling for a study of the problem. The object of this thesis is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the problem, to research methods by which the problem can be mitigated, and to develop and validate a method for laboratory design, test, and evaluation, of <b>shock</b> <b>mitigation</b> systems. First, a theoretical and empirical study is conducted of the hydrodynamic interaction between a boat's hull and the seaway, and how this interaction results in the generation of mechanical shock. Actual acceleration data is obtained from the boats while underway in typical operating conditions, and other similar data is obtained from previous studies. Second, the mechanisms by which exposure to mechanical shock and vibration causes acute and chronic injury are investigated. Past human and animal testing is reviewed, along with information on the transmissibility and mechanical impedance of the human body. Information of this type, along with other injury data compilation studies, have contributed to existing injury prediction.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports {{experimental}} results of planar shock waves interacting with aqueous foams in a horizontal conventional shock tube. Four incident shock wave Mach numbers are considered, ranging from 1. 07 to 1. 8, with two different foam columns of one meter thickness and expansion ratios of 30 and 80. High-speed flow visualizations are used along with pressure measurements to analyse the main physical mechanisms that govern <b>shock</b> wave <b>mitigation</b> in foams. During the shock/foam interaction, a precursor leading pressure jump {{was identified as}} the trace of the liquid film destruction stage in the foam fragmentation process. The corresponding pressure threshold {{is found to be}} invariant for a given foam. Regarding the mitigation effect, the results show that the speed of the shock is drastically reduced and that wetter is the foam, slower are the transmitted waves. The presence of the foam barrier attenuates the induced pressure impulse behind the transmitted shock, while the driest foam appears to be more effective, as it limits the pressure induced by the reflected shock off the foam front. Finally, {{it was found that the}} pressure histories in the two-phase gas-liquid mixture are different from those previously obtained within a cloud of droplets. The observed behavior is attributed to the process of foam fragmentation and to the modification of the flow topology past the shock. These physical phenomena occurring during the shock/foam interaction should be properly accounted for when elaborating new physical models. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} dissertation is to study various techniques for microstructural design of PCs for a desired elastodynamic response. A mixed variational formulation is studied for band structure calculation of PCs. Dynamic homogenization is studied for calculation of the frequency dependent effective properties of PCs. Optimization techniques are used together with mixed variational formulation and dynamic homogenization to make a computational platform for microstructural design of PCs. Several PCs are designed and fabricated, and various tests are performed for experimental verification. First, band-gap in one- and two-dimensional PCs is investigated experimentally. Mixed variational formulation is used to design samples with band-gaps at frequencies convenient to conduct experiment. Samples are fabricated and their transmission coefficient is measured. Experimental data are compared with theoretical results for evaluation of the band structure. Using constituent materials with temperature dependent material properties, it is also shown that band structure of PCs can be tuned by changing the ambient temperature. Furthermore, dynamic homogenization is used to design a one-dimensional PC for acoustic impedance matching. As a result, the reflection of stress waves at the interface of two impedance matched media becomes zero. Samples are fabricated and ultrasound tests are performed to measure the reflection coefficient for experimental verification. In addition, a one-dimensional PC with metamaterial response is designed to achieve a composite with both high stiffness-to-density ratio and high attenuation at low frequency regime. Samples are fabricated and the attenuation coefficient is measured for experimental verification. Moreover, optimal design of PCs for <b>shock</b> wave <b>mitigation</b> is investigated.

To this day, the knowledge {{in the fields of}} causes, effects and identification of traumatic brain injury is limited. The use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities from fragments observed in previous military operations, resulting in the increase of non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from shock waves. The purpose of this project is the advancement of the knowledge in the field of <b>shock</b> wave <b>mitigation</b> strategies {{and the development of a}} helmet liner for protection against blast induced trauma. The proposed helmet liner design is based on the introduction of solid and fluid filler materials inside channels opened in the interior of a foam liner in order to enhance the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Primary investigated attenuation mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches between the filler and foam material interfaces, viscous effects of fluid fillers, porosity and particle size of solid filler materials. Specific goals of this research project include the reduction of the peak pressure and pressure gradient of the transmitted wave through the helmet liner and the enhancement of the spatial distribution of the energy of the incoming shock wave. (cont.) This research effort employed both shock tube experiments and numerical studies in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed helmet liner design. Quantitative results have shown that the use of high density filler materials result in higher attenuation levels than low density materials while comparing to solid foam control samples. The peak transmitted overpressure and pressure gradient were significantly reduced with the use of high density materials while the duration of the positive phase was increased. This response resulted in lower overall impulse values of the transmitted wave. The use of high density filler materials also results in superior frequency distribution. by George Alexander Christou.

40|$|Developing stronger, {{safer and}} more {{cost-effective}} structural materials for the new generation naval ships {{is the focus of}} ongoing research at University of Mississippi. The light-weight nanoparticle reinforced glass/carbon polymeric based composites and structural foams for blast, <b>shock</b> and impact <b>mitigation</b> are emphasized in this research. Derakane 510 A- 40 brominated vinyl ester nanocomposite resin systems are considered {{to be used in the}} composite face sheets of sandwich structures with fire-resistant foam core to reduce flammability along with optimal flexural rigidity, vibrational damping and enhanced energy absorption. In this work, the viscoelastic performance of 1. 25 and 2. 5 weight percent exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet (xGnP) added with 10 weight percent Carboxy Terminated Butadiene Nitrile (CTBN) reinforced brominated vinyl ester nanocomposites are studied. A Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) - TA Instruments Model Q 800 was used to obtain the viscoelastic properties, modulus (stiffness), creep/stress relaxation, and damping (energy dissipation), of the exfoliated graphite platelet and CTBN reinforced brominated vinyl ester. Effects of frequency (time) on the viscoelastic behavior were investigated by sweeping the frequency over three decades: 0. 01, 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10 Hz, temperature range from 30 °C to 15 °C at 4 °C per minute step rate. Master curves were generated by time-temperature superpositioning (TTS) of the experimental data at 50 °C reference temperature. Addition of CTBN in xGnP reinforced brominated vinyl ester composites resulted in greater intrinsic material damping, indicating the possibility of higher energy absorption with the new configuration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is a truism that Cameroon's {{agricultural}} sector {{in general and}} the cocoa sector in particular has been hit by climatic vagaries with telling repercussions. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao Linn.) production remains one of the main cash crops in Cameroon with over 90 % of households in the cocoa producing areas depending on it for their income. Cameroon ranks fifth in the world in cocoa production which has a significant contribution to her economy. This important sector is exposed to climate-related <b>shocks</b> requiring <b>mitigation</b> and adaptation strategies. From an economic perspective, climate-insurance has been suggested as one of the solutions to this problem, as an option to reduce farmers’ vulnerability. However, {{there is little or no}} information on farmers’ preparedness and willingness to pay for climate –related insurance. This article therefore seeks to ascertain the level of preparedness of farmers to sue for climate insurance in cocoa producing areas in Cameroon. We randomly selected 10 cocoa farmer cooperatives drawn across the main cocoa producing divisions of the South West Region - a major cocoa producing region in Cameroon. We combine a structured questionnaire survey with focus group discussions to assess cocoa farmers’ awareness, knowledge, perception, level of preparedness and challenges to adopting climate insurance. Furthermore, we interview insurance authorities within the region on existing insurance policies. This information is complemented through field observations and review of relevant literature. We employ descriptive and correlation analysis to assess cocoa farmers’ perceptions and level of preparedness for climate insurance. We observe that there is a direct statistically significant relationship between farm sizes, level of diversification and awareness, and farmers’ preparedness (P≤ 0. 05). Income levels showed a significant but indirect relationship with level of preparedness. Poverty, uncertainty, and weak institutions operating with policies that do not consider farmers’ realities were key challenges to climate-insurance preparedness. Based on the results we recommend that (i) insurance bodies should undertake feasibility study on the possibilities of instituting friendlier policy for farmers, (ii) farmers should sensitized on the relevance of insurance policies to support cocoa farming in the face of climate vagaries, (iii) farmer groups should strengthen cooperative spirit to ease access to pro-poor insurance policies; and (iv) government should work in partnership with insurance bodies to support farmers through more climate-friendly insurance policies which can be accessed by farmers irrespective of their levels of diversification, income and farm sizes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to measure the effects of pulsed radiation loads {{on the front of}} small tubular structures, using as an energy source the X-ray fluence produced by a Z-pinch at the Sandia National Laboratories Z Facility. The project had two major goals: to establish the feasibility of using the Z machine to study the phenomenology associated with debris generation and propagation down tubular structures with partitions; and to use the resultant experimental data to validate numerical hydrocodes (shock physics codes) so that we have confidence in their use in analyzing these types of situations. Two tubular aluminum structures (5 and 10 cm long and 1 cm inside diameter) were prepared, with aluminum partitions located at the front, halfway down the pipe, and at the rear. Interferometry (VISARS) provided multiple velocity histories for all of the partitions. In both experiments, the first barrier, which was exposed directly to the x-ray fluence, was launched into the pipe at a velocity of {approximately} 2 km/s, accelerating to give a mean velocity of approximately 2. 6 km/s. Loss of plate integrity is inferred from the dispersed launch of the second partition at approx. 1 km/s. Wall shocks propagating at 4. 5 km/s were inferred, although strain gage measurements did not succeed. Post-test metallography showed evidence of melting and partial vaporization of the plates, and turbulent mixing with material from the walls. Calculations qualitatively agree with the observed results, but slightly overpredict debris velocity, possibly due to overestimates of total energy fluence. An application for this work is the study of techniques for line-of-sight <b>shock</b> and debris <b>mitigation</b> on high-power pulse-power facilities such as Z and its follow-on machines...|$|R
