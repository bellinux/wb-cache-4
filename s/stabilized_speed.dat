A technical solution {{to solve this problem}} is to generate an alert sound. This signal has to improve the interaction of the vehicle with its environment.

How translate this in term of signal processing and how define the level of emission? We propose to present the results of tests carried out with an aim of answering those questions...|$|E
40|$|Bipedal robots are {{difficult}} to analyze mathematically. However, successful control strategies can be discovered using simple physical intuition and {{can be described in}} simple terms. Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be <b>stabilized.</b> <b>Speed</b> has to be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these five objectives are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective which we have implemented on a bipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. The r [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} web {{winding system}} is a large-scale, complex interconnected dynamic system with numerous tension zones to transport the web while processing it. There are two control schemes for large-scale system control: the centralized scheme and the decentralized scheme. Centralized control is the traditional control method, which considers all {{the information about the}} system to be a single dynamic model and design a control system for this model. A speed synchronization control strategy for multiple induction motors, based on adjacent cross-coupling control structure, is developed by employing total sliding mode control method. The proposed control strategy is to <b>stabilize</b> <b>speed</b> tracking of each induction motor while synchronizing its speed with the speed of the other motors so as to make speed synchronization error amongst induction motors converge to zero. The global stability and the convergence of the designed controller are proved by using Lyapunov method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Dual-motor {{systems have}} been widely used in {{industrial}} applications, and speed synchronization of the motors can always be deteriorated by system parameter uncertainties and load torque perturbations. In this paper, a new robust control strategy for the dual-motor systems is developed by incorporating second order sliding mode control (2 -SMC) techniques. The strategy is to design chatting-free control laws to <b>stabilize</b> <b>speed</b> tracking of each motor while synchronizing their velocity. In the proposed scheme, firstly, speed controller for a single motor is designed to eliminate the effects of system parameter variations and load torque perturbations. Secondly, a cross-coupled architecture based synchronous controller is designed to reduce speed error of the motors caused by characteristic inconsistency and unbalanced load torque. Stability of the closed loop system is analyzed by Lyapunov theory; it is proven that both speed tracking errors and synchronous error can converge to zero. Finally, experiments are performed to examine the effectiveness of the developed controllers. Experimental results will show the good performance of the proposed control scheme...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle tire {{aquaplaning}} is {{a dangerous}} phenomenon, characterized in its hydrodynamic form by the tire to ground separation and the cancellation of steering or braking control possibilities. Its occurence is generally suspected only for high speeds in presence of water but the phenomenon can appear for rather low speeds. This work aim is to characterize aquaplaning occurence. Tests was carried out on a LCPC track comprising a water retention zone. An instrumented vehicle equipped with worn tires rolled through this zone for different <b>stabilized</b> <b>speeds.</b> As relevant indicators of the aquaplaning occurence we retained the rotation rates and forces of the traction wheels. At low speed, the wheel transmission moments increase while through the puddles because of the water hydrodynamic reaction. Conversely, starting from {{the realization of the}} process of aquaplaning these moments decrease whereas the rotation rates of the driving wheels increase simultaneously. With under-inflated tires the critical speed of aquaplaning was lowered to approximately 19 m/s while it is increased to more than 30 m/s in the event of over-inflation. Finally, phenomenon parameter have been verified by developing a visco-hydrodynamic model. The overall study confirms the risk of aquaplaning at low speed...|$|R

30|$|The {{increasing}} number of traffic accidents {{in the last years}} becomes a serious problem. The enhancement of traffic safety is a high-priority task for different government agencies over the world such as “National Transportation Safety Administration” (NTSA) in USA and “Observatoire National Interministériel de la Sécurité Routière” (ONISR) in France. In addition, automotive manufactures and researcher laboratories are also contributing to this important mission. Some preventive systems such as alcohol test and speed measurement radar are deployed {{to reduce the number of}} traffic accidents, but it is obvious that hypovigilance remains one of the most principal causes. In fact, hypovigilance is responsible for 20 – 30 % of road deaths and this statistic reaches 40 – 50 % in particular crash types, such as fatal single vehicle semi-trailer crashes [1]. Moreover, there are no standard rules to measure the driver vigilance level; the unique solution is to observe the signs. The first hypovigilance signs are itchy eyes, neck stiffness, back pain, yawning, difficulty to <b>stabilize</b> <b>speed</b> and to maintain trajectory, frequent position changes, and inattention to environment (road signs, pedestrian). Fatigue, sleep deprivation, soporific drugs, driving more than 2 h without break, and driving in a monotone road are the main causes of hypovigilance. The appropriate reactions when those signs appear are to stop driving immediately and take a break, but unfortunately, the drivers are not aware of their vigilance level and overestimate it. For this purpose, several studies have been conducted to develop intelligent systems for continuously estimating driver vigilance level and emitting visual and acoustic alarms to avert the driver against abnormal state. The warning signals could also activate the vibration of driver’s seat or even a mechanism that stops the car at the roadside.|$|R

GCR removes the process color inks that make up a dark tone and replaces them with black ink in both neutral and color regions of a reproduction.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of multivariate GARCH time series models {{is a difficult}} task mainly due to the significant overparameterization exhibited by the problem and usually {{referred to as the}} "curse of dimensionality". For example, {{in the case of the}} VEC family, the number of parameters involved in the model grows as a polynomial of order four on the dimensionality of the problem.

So far, this problem has been addressed in the literature only in low dimensional cases with strong parsimony constraints. In this paper we propose a general formulation of the estimation problem in any dimension and develop a Bregman-proximal trust-region method for its solution.
