The idea of low self-esteem and its many negative consequences led California assemblyman John Vasconcellos to work to create and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986.

He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life's challenges.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the survey}} {{required}} a short answer portion where participants could write a sentence or so to explain some answers given. Several said they also felt an extreme amount of shame or continued sadness because they had blamed themselves for their partner’s straying. “Because maybe it was my fault,” said one survey-taker, a female in her 20s, who experienced {{a high level of}} shame. The survey revealed that 72% of the participants <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> directly affected when their partners cheated on them (Johnson, 2017).|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{researchers}} Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa {{observed that}} studies repeatedly showed that Japanese {{people do not}} seek to maintain and enhance their self-esteem, unlike Europeans and Americans. Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average, that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures, and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them, studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies. In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem to be hurt more by failures than boosted by successes, {{the opposite of what}} was reported by Americans. All these studies involved participants being aware that their <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem. This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead implicit self-esteem. [...] Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts. The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name. The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).|$|E
50|$|When {{explicit}} <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> lower, it <b>is</b> called damaged <b>self-esteem.</b> When {{the implicit}} <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> lower it <b>is</b> called defensive <b>self-esteem.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, {{contingent}} <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> {{marked by}} instability, unreliability, and vulnerability. Persons lacking a non-contingent <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> [...] "predisposed to an incessant pursuit of self-value." [...] However, because {{the pursuit of}} contingent <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> based on receiving approval, it is doomed to fail. No one receives constant approval and disapproval often evokes depression. Furthermore, fear of disapproval inhibits activities in which failure is possible.|$|R
40|$|Implicit and Explicit Measures of Self-Esteem, 2 The {{assumption}} that implicit measures assess associations {{that are not}} accessible to consciousness abounds in current social cognition research. We question this assumption in the present research, {{and focus on the}} construct of implicit self-esteem as a case in point. While researchers often argue that implicitly measured <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> unconscious, we provide evidence that it is not, and that discrepancies between implicit and explicit measures of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> the result of reporting tendencies. In Study 1, we demonstrate that individuals for whom explicitly measured <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> relatively high and implicitly measured <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> relatively low admit to over-presenting themselves. In Study 2, implicit and explicit measures of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>were</b> related when participants were urged to avoid over- or under-presenting themselves when responding to the explicit measures.

[...] Branden's connection to Rand was also criticized by psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, who said the book wrongly ignores the work of those outside Rand's Objectivist movement, especially other psychologists and therapists besides Branden himself. He accuses Branden of [...] "an exaggerated sense of self-importance and an uncritical reverence for Rand as a psychologist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Psychology of <b>Self-Esteem</b> <b>was</b> largely written while Branden was {{associated}} with Ayn Rand. It was Branden's first solo book, although he had previously written essays for two of Rand's books and for Who Is Ayn Rand?, which he co-wrote with his then-wife Barbara Branden. Some of the material comes from Who Is Ayn Rand? and from articles he wrote for The Objectivist, a magazine he and Rand co-edited. Rand was Branden's mentor and former lover, but in 1968 she had broken off all relations with him. In his memoirs, Branden recalled that important parts of the book were written during the [...] "agonizing chaos" [...] {{of the collapse of}} their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of self-esteem has gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s, such {{that one can}} speak of a self-esteem movement. This movement {{can be used as}} an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming public policy. The underlying idea of the movement was that low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> {{the root of the problem}} for individuals, making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions. A leading figure of the movement was psychologist, Nathaniel Branden who was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] cannot think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem".|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. This thesis presents a literature review of self-esteem, primarily {{as it relates}} to organizations and management. Based on this literature review, <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> defined as the emotional valuation individuals have of themselves and the degree of certainty of this valuation. Several models of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>are</b> presented. The relationship of coping and avoidance to <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> considered. Coping is presented as being one of the primary sources for increased <b>self-esteem.</b> Likewise, <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> a major influence on one's choice of coping versus avoiding. This makes self-esteem of significant potential value to organizations. The distinction between global and situational <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> discussed, along with the behavioral correlates of these variables. Global <b>self-esteem</b> has <b>been</b> shown to be weakly related, or not related at all, to performance, in contrast to situational self-esteem. Implications for management are presented using the definition and models presented in the thesis. The implications present a process whereby the situational self-esteem of workers may be enhanced so that performance may be improved. Civilian, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (Pt.

40|$|East Asians report {{lower levels}} of {{self-esteem}} than North Americans and Western Europeans. These differences could mean that <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> a culturally bounded construct, experienced dif-ferently in different cultures, or they could mean that <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> a universally relevant construct whose average level is raised or lowered in different cultures.

50|$|Contingent <b>self-esteem</b> (CSE) <b>is</b> <b>self-esteem</b> {{based on}} the {{approval}} of others or on social comparisons. Certain events will shape one's self-esteem when the individual bases their self-worth {{on the outcome of}} those events. The success or failure of any situation can result in fluctuations of an individual's self-esteem. A manifestation of someone with contingent <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> excessive self-consciousness. Such excessive self-consciousness, as occurs with contingent self-esteem, involves extreme criticism of one's self, concern of how they are perceived by their peers, and feelings of discomfort in social settings. One's <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> directly affected when domains of contingencies are used to measure one's self worth. <b>Self-esteem</b> can also <b>be</b> affected when an individual compares their appearance or success to that of someone else or when their <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> contingent to the relationships around them.|$|R

[...] A hypnotist was called in, and Boliska's <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> restored. [...] Boliska left CHUM in late 1963 to go 'across the street' to CKEY. He was replaced by WKBW Buffalo radio & TV personality Jay Nelson, popularly known as [...] "Jungle Jay" [...] from his role as host of a children's show on Buffalo's Channel 7 which was also popular among Toronto youngsters.

40|$|Society {{has placed}} an {{unrealistic}} emphasis on self-esteem {{and its role}} in a person's behavior. Self-esteem, generally conceptualized {{as a part of the}} self-concept, has been the most commonly researched concept in social psychology (Baumeister, 1993; Mruk, 1995; Wells & Marwell, 1976; Wylie, 1979). A study in the self cannot be directly observed, and so measurement of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> difficult.

Yet he was as cowardly as he was powerful, and felt no shame in owning to the weakness. Something was once wanted from the crazy platform over the shaft, and he at once refused to venture there--"did not like," [...] as he said, [...] "foolen' round them kind o' places," [...] and let my wife go instead of him, looking on with a grin. Vanity, where it rules, is usually more heroic: but Irvine steadily approved himself, and expected others to approve him; rather looked down upon my wife, and decidedly expected her to look up to him, on the strength of his superior prudence.|$|E
60|$|Middleton was {{returning}} through {{the grounds of}} Don Augustin, from a visit of duty to his encampment, at that hour in which {{the light of the}} sun begins to melt into the shadows of evening, when a glimpse of a robe, similar to that in which Inez had accompanied him to the altar, caught his eye through the foliage of a retired arbour. He approached the spot, with a delicacy that was rather increased than diminished by the claim she had perhaps given him to intrude on her private moments; but the sounds of her soft voice, which was offering up prayers, in which he heard himself named by the dearest of all appellations, overcame his scruples, and induced him to take a position where he might listen without the fear of detection. It was certainly grateful to the feelings of a husband to be able in this manner to lay bare the spotless soul of his wife, and to find that his own image lay enshrined amid its purest and holiest aspirations. His <b>self-esteem</b> <b>was</b> too much flattered not to induce him to overlook the immediate object of the petitioner. While she prayed that she might become the humble instrument of bringing him into the flock of the faithful, she petitioned for forgiveness, on her own behalf, if presumption or indifference to the counsel of the church had caused her to set too high a value on her influence, and led her into the dangerous error of hazarding her own soul by espousing a heretic. There was so much of fervent piety, mingled with so strong a burst of natural feeling, so much of the woman blended with the angel, in her prayers, that Middleton could have forgiven her, had she termed him a Pagan, for the sweetness and interest with which she petitioned in his favour.|$|E
5000|$|Interestingly, {{the work}} of Penke & Denissen (2008) [...] was not {{applicable}} to those in a long-term relationship.

5000|$|<b>Self-esteem</b> can <b>be</b> {{defined as}} how favorably {{individuals}} evaluate themselves. According to Leary, <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> {{the relationship between}} one’s real self and one’s ideal self, feeding off of favorable behaviors. It refers to an individual's sense {{of his or her}} value or worth, or {{the extent to which a}} person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself. <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones. There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal includes to satisfy the inherent need to feel good about one self. Another one would be to minimize social rejection [...] <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> also known as A way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980). <b>Self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> known to protect people from fear that has potential of arising from the prospect of death- terror management theory.

40|$|Background Persistent {{auditory}} hallucinations are common, disabling {{and difficult to}} treat. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended in their treatment though there is limited empirical evidence {{of the role of}} cognitive factors in the formation and persistence of voices. Low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> thought to play a causal and maintaining role in a range of clinical disorders, particularly depression, which is prevalent and disabling in schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> prominent in, and contributes to, depression in voice hearers. Methods Beliefs about persistent {{auditory hallucinations}} were investigated in 82 patients using the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire - revised in a cross-sectional design. <b>Self-esteem</b> and depression <b>were</b> assessed using standardized measures. Results Depression and low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>were</b> prominent as were beliefs about the omnipotence and malevolence of auditory hallucinations. Beliefs about the uncontrollability and dominance of auditory hallucinations and low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>were</b> significantly correlated with depression. Low self-esteem did not mediate the effect of beliefs about auditory hallucinations- both acted independently to contribute to depression in this sample of patients with schizophrenia and persistent auditory hallucinations. Conclusions Low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>is</b> of fundamental importance to the understanding of affective disturbance in voice hearers. Therapeutic interventions need to address both the appraisal of self and hallucinations in schizophrenia. Measures which ameliorate low <b>self-esteem</b> can <b>be</b> expected to improve depressed mood in this patient group.
