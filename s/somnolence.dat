5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more <b>somnolence</b> than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and <b>somnolence</b> can result following recovery.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in <b>somnolence,</b> psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E
25|$|Inactivating effects – sedating effects such as drowsiness, <b>somnolence</b> and sedation.|$|E
25|$|Nausea, <b>somnolence,</b> insomnia, and {{dizziness}} are {{the main}} side effects, reported by about 10% to 20% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine is {{safe and}} well tolerated in both adults and {{children}} with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and <b>somnolence</b> are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date {{there have been no}} studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of <b>somnolence</b> (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{renal failure}} {{patients}} developed myoclonus while receiving pregabalin, apparently {{as a result}} of gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute overdosage may be manifested by <b>somnolence,</b> tachycardia and hypertonicity. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of pregabalin may be measured to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy, {{a chronic}} sleep {{disorder}} characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden need for sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance. Methylphenidate improves measures of <b>somnolence</b> on standardized tests, {{such as the}} Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy controls.|$|E
25|$|More {{common side}} effects may include: Central nervous system depression, {{including}} <b>somnolence,</b> dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, hangover {{feeling in the}} morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported.|$|E
25|$|Anti-convulsants reduce {{neuronal}} hyperexcitability, effectively targeting Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. Gabapentin and pregabalin are {{the most}} common anti-convulsants. They have significant efficacy in treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain. Treatments last 4–12 hours and in general are well tolerated, and the occurrence of adverse events does not differ significantly across patients. Commonly reported side-effects are dizziness, decreased intellectual performance, <b>somnolence,</b> and nausea.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl's {{most common}} side effects (more than 10% of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, <b>somnolence,</b> confusion, {{asthenia}} (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use {{has also been}} associated with aphasia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Somnolence</b> with {{or without}} vivid dreams or nightmares may occur in users with {{antihistamine}} sensitivities {{in combination with other}} CNS depressants. Hydroxyzine exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties in many psychiatric patients. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing sleep onset latency and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic response.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{side effects}} of {{oxycodone}} include reduced sensitivity to pain (beyond the pain the drug is taken to reduce), euphoria, anxiolysis, feelings of relaxation, and respiratory depression. Common {{side effects of}} oxycodone include constipation (23%), nausea (23%), vomiting (12%), <b>somnolence</b> (23%), dizziness (13%), itching (13%), dry mouth (6%), and sweating (5%). Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urine retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.|$|E
25|$|Central nervous system: Frequently {{occurring}} {{side effects}} are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, <b>somnolence,</b> fatigue, and vertigo {{have also been}} seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. It is strongly recommended that all patients with cerebral cysticercosis are hospitalized during treatment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates other {{drugs such as}} amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} range of different symptoms. Different compounds are used to improve some of these problems. Examples are the use of clozapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for day <b>somnolence.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with nearly}} all {{anesthetic}} drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea and airway obstruction. For these reasons, only suitably trained medical personnel should give thiopental {{in an environment}} suitably {{equipped to deal with}} these effects. Side effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged <b>somnolence,</b> and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by an odor and/or taste sensation, sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. The hangover from the side effects may last up to 36 hours.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate {{may be used}} in {{addition}} to an antidepressant for refractory major depressive disorder. It can also improve depression in several groups including stroke, cancer, and HIV-positive patients. However, the use of stimulants such as methylphenidate in cases of treatment-resistant depression is controversial. Stimulants may have fewer side-effects than tricyclic antidepressants in the elderly and medically ill. In individuals with terminal cancer, methylphenidate can be used to counteract opioid-induced <b>somnolence,</b> to increase the analgesic effects of opioids, to treat depression, and to improve cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is a {{subjective}} feeling of tiredness which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise. Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. It can manifest as <b>somnolence,</b> lethargy, or directed attention fatigue.|$|E
25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies narcolepsy without cataplexy as major <b>somnolence</b> disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low orexin concentrations, including idiopathic hypersomnia (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier easily and exerts {{effects in the}} central nervous system. A {{positron}} emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 67.6% for a single 30mg dose of hydroxyzine. In addition, subjective sleepiness correlated well with the brain H1 receptor occupancy. PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% {{is associated with a}} high prevalence of <b>somnolence</b> and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy has its typical onset in {{adolescence}} and young adulthood. There is an average 15-year delay between onset and correct diagnosis which {{may contribute substantially to}} the disabling {{features of the}} disorder. Cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the excessive daytime sleepiness of narcolepsy have been documented. For these to occur in the crucial teen years when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place is especially devastating. While cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime <b>somnolence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (<b>somnolence).</b> Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|Following {{an acute}} {{overdose}} of a benzodiazepine {{the onset of}} symptoms is typically rapid with most developing symptoms within 4 hours. Patients initially present with mild to moderate impairment of central nervous system function. Initial signs and symptoms include intoxication, <b>somnolence,</b> diplopia, impaired balance, impaired motor function, anterograde amnesia, ataxia, and slurred speech. Most patients with pure benzodiazepine overdose will usually only exhibit these mild CNS symptoms. Paradoxical reactions such as anxiety, delirium, combativeness, hallucinations, and aggression can also occur following benzodiazepine overdose. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have also been occasionally reported.|$|E
25|$|Anticonvulsants {{affect the}} bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants {{also contribute to the}} increased rate of fractures by causing <b>somnolence,</b> ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia.|$|E
25|$|Side effects {{typical of}} {{hypnotic}} benzodiazepines {{are related to}} CNS depression, and include <b>somnolence,</b> sedation, drunkenness, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (in higher doses), and inattention. Euphoria was rarely reported with its use. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, much more rarely reported than headaches and diarrhea. Anterograde amnesia may also develop, as may respiratory depression in higher doses.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of primidone overdose are coma with loss of deep tendon reflexes and, during the recovery period, {{if the patient}} survives, disorientation, dysarthria, nystagmus, and ataxia, lethargy, <b>somnolence,</b> vomiting, nausea, and occasionally, focal neurological deficits which lessen over time. Complete recovery comes within five to seven days of ingestion. The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital; however, primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive crystalluria that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. The crystals are white, needle-like, shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{is likely}} to be {{relatively}} safe in overdose. Levels of progesterone during pregnancy are up to 100-fold higher than during normal menstrual cycling, although levels increase gradually over the course of pregnancy. Oral dosages of progesterone of as high as 3,600mg/day have been assessed in clinical trials, with the main side effect being sedation. There is a case report of progesterone misuse with 6,400mg per day. Administration of as much as 1,000mg progesterone via intramuscular injection in humans was uneventful in terms of toxicity, but did induce extreme sedation and <b>somnolence</b> accompanied by nearly unarousable sleep, though the individuals were still able to be awakened with sufficient physical stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Agonists produce significant, {{although}} mild, {{side effects}} including <b>somnolence,</b> hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes, side effects appear {{even at the}} minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different agonist or kind of drug. When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms. Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years. They are also more expensive. Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients. All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter. Agonists at higher doses have also been related {{to a wide variety of}} impulse-control disorders.|$|E
25|$|NREM Stage 1 (N1 – light sleep, <b>somnolence,</b> drowsy sleep – 5–10% {{of total}} sleep in adults): This is {{a stage of}} sleep that usually occurs between sleep and wakefulness, and {{sometimes}} occurs between periods of deeper sleep and periods of REM. The muscles are active, and the eyes roll slowly, opening and closing moderately. The brain transitions from alpha waves having a frequency of 8–13Hz (common in the awake state) to theta waves having a frequency of 4–7Hz. Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks, also known as positive myoclonus, {{may be associated with}} the onset of sleep during N1. Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage. During Non-REM1, humans lose some muscle tone and most conscious awareness of the external environment.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine shares many of {{the common}} adverse effects of SSRIs, {{including}} (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), <b>somnolence</b> 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), hypomania 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), paraesthesia 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Mental fatigue is a {{temporary}} inability to maintain optimal cognitive performance. The onset of mental fatigue during any cognitive activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's cognitive ability, and also upon other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. Mental fatigue {{has also been shown}} to decrease physical performance. It can manifest as <b>somnolence,</b> lethargy, or directed attention fatigue. Decreased attention is known as ego depletion and occurs when the limited 'self-regulatory capacity' is depleted. It may also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep. However, objective cognitive testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain disease from those attributable to tiredness.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidepressant}} {{effects of}} clomipramine {{are thought to}} be due to reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine, while serotonin reuptake inhibition only is thought to be responsible for the effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. Conversely, antagonism of the H1, α1-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is thought to contribute to its side effects. Blockade of the H1 receptor is specifically responsible for the antihistamine effects of clomipramine and side effects like sedation and <b>somnolence</b> (sleepiness). Antagonism of the α1-adrenergic receptor is thought to cause orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. Inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is responsible for the anticholinergic side effects of clomipramine like dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive/memory impairment. In overdose, sodium channel blockade in the brain is believed to cause the coma and seizures associated with TCAs while blockade of sodium channels in the heart is considered to cause cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. On the other hand, sodium channel blockade is also thought to contribute to the analgesic effects of TCAs, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April, Berthold lost a dogfight. He made an {{emergency}} landing after enemy bullets crippled his Fokker's engine. He took off again in Pfalz E.IV serial number 803/15. Its engine quit as he climbed to about 100 meters altitude, and he crashed. When his limp body was pulled from the wreckage, he was believed dead until he revived momentarily with a fit of cursing. After a passing faint, Berthold awoke to find himself blind. He begged bystanders to shoot him, then again swooned. He reawakened two days later in Kriegslazarett 7 (Military Hospital 7) in Saint Quentin, in a room next to a British observer he had downed. Besides a badly broken left leg, Berthold had suffered a broken nose and upper jaw, with attendant damage to his optic nerves. He was prescribed narcotic painkillers for chronic pain. At that time, German military doctors used three narcotics as remedies—opium, morphine, and codeine. Cocaine was used to counteract the <b>somnolence</b> of these three depressant drugs. Berthold's exact prescription is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons. It {{is a reason}} for patient visits to sleep disorder centers, and with its onset in adolescence, {{it is also a}} major cause of learning difficulty and absenteeism from school. Normal teenagers often already experience excessive daytime sleepiness because of a maturational increase in physiological sleep tendency accentuated by multiple educational and social pressures; this may be disabling with the addition of narcolepsy symptoms in susceptible teenagers. In clinical practice, the differentiation between narcolepsy and other conditions characterized by excessive <b>somnolence</b> may be difficult. Treatment options are currently limited. There is a paucity in the literature of controlled double-blind studies of possible effective drugs or other forms of therapy. Mechanisms of action of some few available therapeutic agents have been explored but detailed studies of mechanisms of action are needed before new classes of therapeutic agents can be developed. Narcolepsy is an underdiagnosed condition in the general population. This is partly because its severity varies, so it can be mistaken for other illnesses very easily. Some people with narcolepsy do not suffer from loss of muscle control.|$|E
500|$|Grade 3 - <b>Somnolence</b> to semistupor, but {{responsive}} to verbal stimuli; confusion; gross disorientation ...|$|E
500|$|More severe {{forms of}} hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{lead to a}} worsening level of consciousness, from lethargy to <b>somnolence</b> and eventually coma. In the intermediate stages, a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed (asterixis, [...] "liver flap" [...] due to its flapping character); this disappears as the <b>somnolence</b> worsens. There is disorientation and amnesia, and uninhibited behaviour may occur. In the third stage, neurological examination may reveal clonus and positive Babinski sign. Coma and seizures represent the most advanced stage; cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain tissue) leads to death.|$|E
