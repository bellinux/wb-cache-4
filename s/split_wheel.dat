40|$|This article {{presents}} a braking control algorithm for electric vehicles endowed with redundant actuators, i. e. friction brakes and wheel-individual electric motors. This algorithm {{relies on a}} model predictive control framework {{and is able to}} optimally <b>split</b> the <b>wheel</b> braking torque among the redundant actuators, while providing anti-lock braking features (i. e. wheel slip regulation). It will be shown that, the integration of these two control functions together with energy metrics, actuator constraints and Dynamics improves the control performance compared to state-of-art control structures. Additionally, experimental measurements recorded with our prototype vehicle demonstrate a precise wheel slip regulation and high energy efficiency of the proposed braking control methodology...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} influence of various commonly used warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives on the physical, mechanical, and performance properties of WMA, a series of laboratory testing programs such as air void, voids in mineral aggregate, freeze-thaw <b>splitting,</b> <b>wheel</b> tracking test, and bending beam tests were performed. The experimental design of WMA mixtures included the use of three WMA additives of Sasobit, Evotherm and Rediset, two asphalt binders of SK- 70 base asphalt, and a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) -modified one. The testing results of WMA were also compared to that hot mix asphalt (HMA) as controls. Results from this study showed that: (1) volumetric properties (air voids and VMA) of WMAs did not have significant difference from the controls; (2) WMA with Sasobit had the greatest Marshall stability, followed by the WMA with Rediset, whereas all WMAs with Evotherm had the least, regardless {{of the types of}} asphalt; and (3) for WMA with modified asphalt, the dynamic stability of WMA with Rediset was a slightly greater than other two WMAs. For WMAs with base asphalt, the dynamic stability with Evotherm and Sasobit was similar to the control and greater than that with Rediset: (4) The WMAs with Sasobit have slightly greater indirect tensile strength (ITS) and tensile strength ratio (TSR) than the other two, regardless of the types of asphalt. (5) WMAs with Rediset had the greatest bending failure strain, regardless of the types of asphalt. Among all asphalt mixtures, most of WMAs had lower bending failure strain than the controls...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{years into}} the first open <b>wheel</b> <b>split,</b> the sport of Indy car racing began {{settling}} into a mostly stabilized environment by 1981. The upstart CART series sanctioned the season of races. The Indianapolis 500 itself became an invitation-only race sanctioned by USAC, involving the CART regulars and various one-off entries. USAC kept alive their own [...] "Gold Crown" [...] championship, running Indy and the Pocono 500 in June 1981.|$|R
25|$|The IS F Sport models include {{enhanced}} {{handling and}} performance, Adaptive Variable Suspension and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (IS 350). Not {{only does the}} F Sport handle differently, but its more aggressive styling certainly sets it apart from the basic production model. F-Sport styling includes an edition specific F-Sport pattern front grill, F-Sport logo badges, and five spoke <b>split</b> graphite <b>wheels.</b> Inside the cabin, you'll find bright, carbon fiber-like trim, extra bolstered performance seats, an all-black headliner, and an impressive moving vessel gauge cluster that displays navigation and audio information. The F-Sport models have an edition specific Ultra White exterior and vibrant, Rioja Red interior. The 2014 model year also served as the first year to offer all-wheel drive in the IS F Sport line up.|$|R
50|$|CART retired {{the use of}} #99 {{after the}} fatal {{accident}} of Greg Moore in 1999. However, since the IndyCar Series unification took place in 2008, that recognition has since been abandoned. For a brief time during the early-mid 1990s, CART unofficially retired #14 (in honor of A. J. Foyt), allowing it only to be carried only by an entry of A. J. Foyt Enterprises. After the open <b>wheel</b> <b>split</b> in 1996, the rule in CART competition was lifted.|$|R
5|$|The {{final game}} {{was a giant}} {{modified}} roulette <b>wheel</b> <b>split</b> into 36 alternately coloured sections (18 red and 18 black), awarding a £1m prize if the player chose the correct colour. Red or Black? made its first millionaire in the first show, with bricklayer Nathan Hageman, from Reading, winning on red. The following night the second millionaire was made, with carer Kevin Cartwright also winning on red. Two further millionaires, Darren Thompson and Gary Brocklesby, were made during the series.|$|R
2500|$|In 1978, Gurney {{wrote an}} open memo to other race car owners {{with what is}} now known as the [...] "White Letter" [...] in which Gurney called for a series {{controlled}} more by the owners or [...] "actual participants" [...] than under the USAC banner. After much debate, CART was formed with Gurney and other owners like Roger Penske, Pat Patrick, and Bob Fletcher. CART began its first full season of competition in March 1979 and thus the first <b>split</b> in open <b>wheel</b> racing began.|$|R

2500|$|The double Wheel of Steel {{was invented}} by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up {{together}} in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before {{coming up with the}} double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock's backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was {{to find a way to}} <b>split</b> the <b>wheels</b> while they were still spinning. [...] "There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments", Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like pneumatic cylinders. Wallenda's uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce.|$|R
40|$|Shaping of {{the surface}} {{roughness}} in traverse grinding is much more complex compared to plunge grinding. What significantly influences the roughness of the machined surfaces in traverse grinding is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} grinding wheel wear in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is <b>split</b> into the <b>wheel’s</b> different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps. The surface-roughness model presented, which includes parameters of the grinding wheel dressing with the single point diamond dresser and grinding parameters, allows us to estimate the size of surface roughness in the process of traverse grinding...|$|R
5000|$|De Vivie {{imported}} machines from England. In 1889 {{he made a}} bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had {{a diamond}} frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 {{when one of his}} readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two chain wheels on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. [...] In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a <b>split</b> chain <b>wheel.</b> Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the chain wheel open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his Cheminot in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed side moulding, turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new <b>split</b> 5-spoke alloy <b>wheels.</b> Memory seating, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard. The steering wheel controls now had hard touch buttons {{as opposed to the}} previous soft ones. The navigation system shared with the then current Lexus RX now included upgraded VoiceBox speech recognition, Bluetooth phone book downloading, and Lexus Insider, XM Weather, Sports, and Stocks reports, and switched from DVD based maps to an internal hard drive. Bluetooth streaming audio and a USB port that included iPod integration was now built into the stereo.|$|R
2500|$|Instead {{came the}} idea of having {{multiple}} groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one rigid frame. A [...] "duplex" [...] version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving <b>wheels</b> <b>split</b> into two groups of four, each with its own set of cylinders and valve gear. The reciprocating mass of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under less stress and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second set of cylinders had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.|$|R

5000|$|The Miles M.14 was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification T.40/36 and was first flown on 20 March 1937 by F.G. Miles and then christened 'Magister'. Based on Miles' Hawk Trainer, the Magister is an open-cockpit, low wing cantilever monoplane of spruce structure covered in plywood. The wing centre section has no dihedral and is of constant section with outer sections having dihedral and tapering towards the tip. It has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with spats on the main <b>wheels.</b> <b>Split</b> flaps are fitted as standard. [...] Early Magisters (including the first prototype) suffered a number of accidents when the aircraft could not be recovered from a spin. To solve this problem, the tailplane was raised by 6 in, anti-spin strakes fitted to the rear fuselage, and eventually, a new taller rudder. Thus modified, the aircraft became the definitive M.14A.|$|R

5000|$|After the {{decision}} was rendered, the reaction among fans, media, and competitors was split largely along party lines. CART supporters generally sided with Team Green and Paul Tracy denouncing {{the decision}}, while IRL supporters generally accepted the final result. Many Tracy supporters felt {{the decision was}} politically motivated, suggesting that Tony George favored Penske Racing (a full-time IRL team) and punished the part-time, rival CART-based effort of Team Green. The controversy was divisive, and worked to reopen wounds from the 1996 open <b>wheel</b> <b>split.</b> Robin Miller openly criticized the decision, and considered Tracy [...] "the unofficial 2002 Indy winner." [...] The day after the race, he presented video footage on RPM 2Night, which he claimed showed evidence the pass was completed under green. Shirts and hats were sold at CART events declaring Tracy the [...] "Real IRL 500 winner", which Tracy would be seen publicly wearing at times.|$|R
40|$|Mobility is {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} freedom to access more goods and services. However, in my view, mobility is also largely about personal freedom, i. e., the ability to exceed one's physical limitations, in essence, to become "more than human" in physical capabilities. This thesis explores novel designs for omni-directional motion in a mobility scooter, car and bus {{with the aim of}} increasing personal mobility and freedom. What links these designs is the use of <b>split</b> active caster <b>wheel</b> robot technology. In the first section, societal and technological impacts of omni-directional motion in the city are examined.

50|$|Miller {{worked for}} 33 years at The Indianapolis Star, {{becoming}} one of the nation's best known sports writers for Indy car racing. He started covering the Indianapolis 500 in 1969. During the month of May for the Indy 500, in addition to his daily columns, Miller would have side gigs on WIBC, WTHR, and The Bob & Tom Show. In the early 1990s, he also served as emcee of the popular Last Row Party. Miller also wrote and reported occasionally about NASCAR, including extensive coverage of the Brickyard 400. Following the 1996 open <b>wheel</b> <b>split,</b> Miller was highly critical of the Indy Racing League and Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George. For this, he drew considerable ire from many locals and from various city leaders, but likewise gained a considerable following from CART supporters. He lost his radio show on WIBC and television job at Channel 13 for his anti-George stance. Eventually, after the department reorganized, Miller's duties shifted from columnist to focus solely on auto racing.|$|R
60|$|Way {{was made}} for them, and the march went on. The {{trampling}} feet clashed rhythmically upon the stones, the rows of crowded windows and long white walls slid behind, and then while a blast of the bugles rang across the town Appleby found himself plodding into the smaller plaza. There was a long flash of sunlight on steel, the leading company <b>split</b> up and <b>wheeled,</b> and while the files tramped past he and the guard were left standing with a double rank of cazadores behind them {{at one end of}} the plaza. In another two or three moments it was lined two deep by men with bayonets holding back the crowd; but the church with the two towers closed the opposite end, and Appleby noticed vacantly how dazzlingly white the empty space shone in the sun, save where the long black shadow of the cross above fell athwart it. The church door was, as usual, open, and the sound of an organ came out from it dolefully. Except for that, there was for almost a minute a silence that grew horribly oppressive.|$|R
