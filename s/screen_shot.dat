25|$|This air {{of mystery}} was {{increased}} when CRASH magazine published a reader's photograph of Lunar Jetman featuring Jetman's moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible {{existence of a}} trailer (as depicted on the game's cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game's release, and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it. The Stampers shrugged off questions about whether this <b>screen</b> <b>shot</b> was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the <b>screen</b> <b>shot</b> to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that Lunar Jetman's 48K of code does not contain graphics for a trailer.|$|E
25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the <b>screen</b> <b>shot,</b> another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a <b>screen</b> <b>shot,</b> the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOnline medical information, when {{presented}} to clinicians, must be well-organized and intuitive to use, {{so that the}} clinicians can conduct their daily work efficiently and without error. It is essential to actively seek to produce good user interfaces that are acceptable to the user. This paper describes the methodology used to develop a simplified heuristic evaluation (HE) suitable {{for the evaluation of}} <b>screen</b> <b>shots</b> of Web pages, the development of an HE instrument used to conduct the evaluation, and the results of the evaluation of the aforementioned <b>screen</b> <b>shots.</b> In addition, this paper presents examples of the process of categorizing problems identified by the HE and the technological solutions identified to resolve these problems. Four usability experts reviewed 18 paper-based <b>screen</b> <b>shots</b> and made a total of 108 comments. Each expert completed the task in about an hour. We were able to implement solutions to approximately 70 % of the violations. Our study found that a heuristic evaluation using paper-based <b>screen</b> <b>shots</b> of a user interface was expeditious, inexpensive, and straightforward to implement...|$|R

[...] After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had [...] "shorthanded" [...] the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN's website, which began with the <b>screen</b> <b>shot</b> that read: [...] "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim's sister was trying to convey. She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere." ...|$|E
