5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{has become}} {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions {{of a second}} ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower at the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> through glass.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light).</b> From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for {{the diameter of the}} Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the above}} discussion, we {{consider}} the pseudorange measurements for mobile tracking from different DTV emitters. The pseudorange {{is the product of}} the estimated time delay with the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so the measured <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> would be a simple sum <b>of</b> its <b>speed</b> through the medium plus the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the medium.|$|R
40|$|Energy-dependent <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} an observable signature of quantum gravity effects. The two simplest dispersion relationships produce either linear or quadratic corrections, in particle energy, to the photon speed. The macroscopic limits of these theories [...] how objects with small energy per particle, but with large mass, behave [...] are not fully understood. We here briefly discuss some features of the macroscopic limit, that are necessary for understanding how detectors and emitters interact with the high-energy photons that probe spacetime.

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

We also find an acausal behavior for the electromagnetic field due to the presence in the theory <b>of</b> two different <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> This effect naturally arises even if only θ 12 is different from zero.

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of {{the motion of the}} source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it was not known whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is constant regardless of one's frame of reference.

5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is {{to measure the}} time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves at the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If {{the dimensions of the}} resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

We explored auditory–visual integration, cross modal causal attributions, and auditory–visual temporal order judgments. We observed timing shifts with viewing distance following loudspeaker, but not headphone, presentations. We were unable to find reliable evidence of perceptual compensation. Our findings suggest that auditory and visual signals of an event that reach an observer at the same point in time tend to become perceptually bound, even when the sources of those signals could not have occurred together...|$|R
