5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> her head {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
25|$|LST-32 {{spent the}} next 10 months {{carrying}} supplies and munitions between various ports in the Mediterranean. In January 1945, <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> British troops to Greece to help suppress a communist attempt {{to take over the}} government. On the return trip, the vessel rescued about 100 survivors from the Greek ship SS Ionia wrecked in a storm. She later transported prisoners, elements of the French Foreign Legion, railroad cars, and other vehicles between ports in Italy, France, and North Africa, before returning to the United States at New York, in July 1945. The ship then moved to Norfolk, to undergo repairs and alterations preparatory to her transfer to the war in the Pacific. However, the Japanese capitulation in mid-August caused both alterations and reassignment to be cancelled. Instead, LST-32 remained in the Atlantic Fleet until July 1946, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida.|$|E
25|$|England set {{themselves}} up well against Australia, {{but failed to}} hit out in the last over thanks to some accurate and fierce bowling from Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who had earlier hit 38 not out with the bat to lift Australia to 222 for 7 after three for 39 from Clare Connor. Arran Brindle continued on her magnificent form from the first Test, when she made a fifty and a hundred, and in partnerships with Jenny Gunn and Claire Taylor <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> the English to 198 for 4 with her score of 81. With only 25 runs left to hit {{for the last six}} wickets, it was there for the taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of Laura Newton earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 37 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Gerðr is {{introduced}} by the enthroned figure of High {{as the daughter of}} Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða, and is described as [...] "the most beautiful of all women". High reports that Freyr went into Hlidskjalf and looked over all worlds. When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building. A woman went to the building, and when <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> her arms and {{opened the door to the}} building [...] "light was shed from her arms over both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her". In punishment for [...] "his great presumption" [...] in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.|$|E
500|$|Hill was short, {{like all}} her family, and {{indifferent}} to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: [...] "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but {{the beauty of}} her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness." [...] Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her {{at a meeting of}} the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, [...] "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace Wimple (Thompson, using a {{voice he}} later {{employed}} for the MGM-animated Droopy) – Wimple was a soft-spoken {{man in the}} Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, [...] "Hello, folks!" [...] Wimple might recite a verse he'd written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with Sweetie-Face, his [...] "big old wife” who had the physique and demeanor of a drill sergeant on a bad day. Sweetie-Face was a regular unseen character (actually of course, this being radio, unheard character), appearing in the show only from Wallace's perspective. “Wimp,” as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge {{in a way that}} could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (03/09/48) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was [...] "practicing her weight-lifting." [...] Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, [...] "My goodness, you do that every time you get up out of a chair.” [...] “Uh oh,” fretted Molly. “And then when I regained consciousness,” continued Wimple, “she'd left the room.” With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard the next time <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> weights that she popped her girdle. Passive-aggressive behavior edging well over the line into domestic violence characterized Wimple's stories. Radio network censors in the 1940s blocked any reference to certain subjects including sex, but the dark humor about domestic violence that was allowed here and in The Honeymooners would likely not be written into a network-TV sitcom today. Though the term “wimp” as used to describe a weak-willed person predated Fibber McGee and Molly, the Wimple character and Fibber's nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use.|$|E
