40|$|New {{characters}} {{based on}} the arrangement and morphology of dermal denticles show that sawfishes {{can be divided into}} two distinctive groups. The first group, comprising the knifetooth sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata, is characterized by tricuspid denticles variably located on both dorsal and ventral parts of the body. The second group is represented by species of the genus Pristis, showing an uniform and homogenous dermal covering of monocuspidate denticles on both dorsal and ventral sides of the body and within the buccopharyngeal cavity. Pristis is further divided into two subgroups: the first comprises species with denticles lacking any keels and furrows (the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> <b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata,</b> the green sawfish Pristis zijsron and the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata); the second comprises species with denticles presenting keels and furrows well differentiated on their anterior part (the common sawfish Pristis pristis, the largetooth sawfish Pristis perotteti and the greattooth sawfish Pristis microdon).

Trends in Sr:Ca measured across vertebrae with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry corresponded well to annual salinity trends observed in sawfish estuarine nursery habitats in south Florida, thus serve as a chemical marker verifying annual formation of opaque bands. Based on that finding and assumptions about mean birth date and timing of opaque band formation, estimated age ranged from 0. 4 y for a 0. 60 m total length (TL) male to 14. 0 y for a 4. 35 m TL female.

40|$|Understanding how {{endangered}} {{marine species}} rely on coastal habitats {{is vital for}} population recovery planning. The <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (<b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata)</b> {{is one of several}} critically endangered sawfishes worldwide known to use estuaries and rivers during their early life history. In a Florida estuary designated as critical habitat by the USA government, juveniles were monitored to characterise seasonality, recruitment, and habitat use. Stretched total length ranged from 671 to 2172 mm (n = 137, mean = 1248 mm). Sawfish were captured year round. Captures of neonates with embryonic rostral sheaths allowed refinement of the size at birth (671 – 812 mm) and confirmed a protracted timing of parturition (November–July), which peaked between April and May. Although sampling occurred throughout the estuary, five locations had the greatest catch rates. Most juvenile sawfish had an affinity for water 30 °C, dissolved oxygen > 6 mg L– 1, and salinity between 18 and 30. Greater catch rates for sawfish > 1 year old were associated with shoreline habitats with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves.

40|$|In 2003, the U. S. {{distinct}} population {{segment of}} <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> <b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata</b> {{was listed as}} endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). At that time, little was known about its habitat use patterns and, although required {{as part of the}} ESA, critical habitat could not be officially designated. Subsequently, studies were conducted that identified some of the specific habitats and environmental conditions important for the species. Facilitating recruitment into the adult population by protecting the species’ nurseries was identified in the recovery plan as the key conservation objective, which would be supported by the designation of critical habitat. The location of nurseries was determined by applying published criteria developed for identifying elasmobranch nursery areas to a decade of encounter data. These largely nontraditional data were composed primarily of encounters voluntarily reported by the public to members of the recovery team. The nursery habitats essential to the conservation of the species were identified as those adjacent to red mangroves Rhizophora mangle and euryhaline habitats with water depths ≤ 0. 9 m. Ultimately, two broad areas in southwest Florida that contain these habitats were designated as critical habitat for juvenile smalltooth sawfish: the Charlotte Harbor Estuary unit (896 km 2) and the Ten Thousand Islands/Everglades unit (2, 505 km 2) ...|$|E
40|$|To aid {{recovery}} {{efforts of}} <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (<b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata)</b> populations in U.

Forty juvenile P. pectinata were fitted with acoustic tags and monitored within the lower 27 km of the Caloosahatchee River estuary, Florida, between 2005 and 2007. Sawfish were monitored within the study site from 1 to 473 days, {{and the number of}} consecutive days present ranged from 1 to 125. Residency index values for individuals varied considerably, with annual means highest in 2005 (0. 95) and lowest in 2007 (0. 73) when several P. pectinata moved upriver beyond detection range during drier conditions. Mean daily activity space was 1. 42 km of river distance. The distance between 30 -minute centers of activity was typically < 0. 1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 psu, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range. Thus, freshwater flow from Lake Okeechobee (and its effect on salinity) affects the location of individuals within the estuary, although it remains unclear whether or not these movements are threatening recovery...|$|E

Stretched total length (LST) data from 144 smalltooth sawfish (690 – 4960 mm) and 28 recaptures (775 – 2150 mm) {{were used for the}} analyses. Both methods indicated that growth was rapid during the first 2 years after birth. The LST increased by 650 – 850 mm in the first year, and by 480 – 680 mm in the second year. Data for animals > 2200 mm were limited, so growth beyond 2 years of age was uncertain. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from LST frequency data were L∞= 6000 mm, K= 0. 140 year− 1 and t 0 =− 0. 863 years. Growth rates over the size range for which tag-recapture data were available were similar to that from LST frequency data.

Between 2002 and 2006 a total of 12 individuals were actively tracked for periods of up to 24 h to provide detailed habitat use and movement parameters (distance moved, speed, and linearity). Smaller individuals (100 cm STL demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud or and sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish 130 cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3 months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations. The use of a combination of tracking and monitoring techniques provided an expanded range of information by generating both short and long term data on habitat use.

40|$|SummaryFacultative {{parthenogenesis}} — {{the ability}} of sexually reproducing species to sometimes produce offspring asexually — is known {{from a wide range}} of ordinarily sexually reproducing vertebrates in captivity, including some birds, reptiles and sharks [1 – 3]. Despite this, free-living parthenogens have never been observed in any of these taxa in the wild, although two free-living snakes were recently discovered each gestating a single parthenogen — one copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and one cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) [1]. Vertebrate parthenogens are characterized as being of the homogametic sex (e. g., females in sharks, males in birds) and by having elevated homozygosity compared to their mother [1 – 3], which may reduce their viability [4]. Although it is unknown if either of the parthenogenetic snakes would have been carried to term or survived in the wild, facultative parthenogenesis might have adaptive significance [1]. If this is true, it is reasonable to hypothesize that parthenogenesis would be found most often at low population density, when females risk reproductive failure because finding mates is difficult [5]. Here, we document the first examples of viable parthenogens living in a normally sexually reproducing wild vertebrate, the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (<b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata).</b> We also provide a simple approach to screen any microsatellite DNA database for parthenogens, which will enable hypothesis-driven research on the significance of vertebrate parthenogenesis in the wild...|$|E

In the US Atlantic, the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sawfish</b> (<b>Pristis</b> <b>pectinata)</b> has declined to 1 - 5 % of its abundance in the 1900 s, and its core distribution has contracted to southwest Florida.

Inbreeding is rare (mean individual internal relatedness = - 0. 02, SD 0. 14; FIS = - 0. 011, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 0. 039 to 0. 011), even though the estimated effective population size (Ne) is modest (250 - 350, 95 % CI = 142 - 955). Simulations suggest that the remnant smalltooth sawfish population will probably retain > 90 % of its current genetic diversity over the next century even at the lower estimate of Ne. There is no evidence of a genetic bottleneck accompanying last century's demographic bottleneck, and we discuss hypotheses that could explain this.
