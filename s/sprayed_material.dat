25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such <b>sprayed</b> <b>material</b> does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, a new coating technology, {{known as}} cold spraying, has been {{developed}} (Gärtner et al. 2006). In this process, spraying particles (1 to 50 μm in size) experiencing both a little change in microstructure and a little oxidation or decomposition are accelerated by a supersonic jet of a compressed gas stream passing through a Laval type nozzle to a very high velocity (300 to 1, 200 [*]m/s). The deposition system consists of a gas pressure regulator, a gas heater, a powder feeder and a spray gun. In this technique, the deposited calcium orthophosphate particles are always in a solid state and at temperatures below their melting point. Thus, all phenomena occurring at high temperatures, such as thermal decomposition and phase transformations (see section[*]Thermal spraying techniques above), are avoided. Deposition of calcium orthophosphate particles takes place through intensive plastic deformations (Zhang and Zhang 2011; Zhang et al. 2012 a, 2012 b).
