50|$|The AT was {{designed}} to support multitasking; the new SysRq (<b>System</b> <b>request</b> <b>key),</b> little noted and often overlooked, {{is part of this}} design, as is the 80286 itself, the first Intel 16-bit processor with multitasking features (i.e. the 80286 protected mode). IBM made some attempt at marketing the AT as a multi-user machine, but it sold mainly as a faster PC for power users. For the most part, IBM PC/ATs were used as more powerful DOS (single-tasking) personal computers, in the literal sense of the PC name.|$|E

In this process, the broker charges the amount of e-coins only at this moment or the charge could be made, at the end of some period established by the client and the broker (at the end of the day, the week, etc). At any subsequent moment, the client may need to <b>request</b> <b>keys</b> for communicating with new vendors, which is done by the client launching a vendor's <b>key</b> <b>request</b> (see step 2).|$|R

40|$|For a {{hands-free}} speech interface, it {{is important}} to detect com-mands in spontaneous utterances. To discriminate commands from human-human conversations by acoustic features, it is ef-ficient to consider the head and the tail of an utterance. The dif-ferent characteristics of <b>system</b> <b>requests</b> and spontaneous utter-ances appear on these parts of an utterance. Experiment shows that by separating the head and the tail of an utterance, the ac-curacy of detection was improved. And also, considering the al-ternation of speakers using two channel microphones improved the performance. Although detecting <b>system</b> <b>requests</b> using lin-guistic features shows high accuracy, combining acoustic and turn-taking features lift up the performance.
