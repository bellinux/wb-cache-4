Heywood ordered the Frederiksværn to halt and allow herself to be detained. War not having been declared, and Frederiksværn being a naval vessel, <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> Heywood's instructions. Heywood ordered a musket fired, to which Frederiksværn replied with a shot from her stern guns. Comus followed with a broadside.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1968, Saint Phalle sold Nana {{inflatable}} pool toys, amid {{criticism from}} the art world. <b>She</b> <b>ignored</b> the complaints, focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects. In the coming years, she would face more criticism for over-commercializing and popularizing her artwork, but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own. Over the years, she produced clothing, jewelry, perfume, glass or porcelain figures, furniture, and craft items, many with a Nana theme.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her {{performances}} in Kyoto that she also became {{known for her}} performances of nembutsu odori (or nembutsu dance) {{in honor of the}} Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call <b>she</b> <b>ignored,</b> though she continued to send money back.|$|E

25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E

He stated that Murray's conclusions were [...] "almost totally groundless" [...] because <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point.|$|E
500|$|In Frankfurt she met {{and married}} a white German man named Alexander. Her family and his {{attended}} the wedding, but several incidents illustrated once again how German society treated her as [...] "invisible". When she and Alexander went to get their marriage license, the registrar greeted Alexander, wrote down his name, and then asked [...] "Where is the bride?" [...] As they were descending the courthouse steps after their wedding, a passerby offered wedding congratulations to the maid of honor. <b>She</b> <b>ignored</b> the incidents even though [...] "I am troubled by this continual need {{to point out to}} others that it is I who am getting married." [...] After six years she and Alexander divorced.|$|E

About the case itself, she said her lawyer had instructed her not to discuss it with anyone; <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> a specific question about whether she had indeed run out of gas that morning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peace was}} then broken by Chilperic, who invaded Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert {{defeated}} Chilperic, who fled to Tournai. The people of Paris hailed Sigebert as a conqueror {{when he arrived}} with Brunhilda and their children. Bishop Germain wrote to Brunhilda, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of his life say that <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at Vitry-en-Artois with poisoned daggers (scramsaxi, according to Gregory). Brunhilda was captured and imprisoned at Rouen.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{her speech}} {{was met with}} much praise from the media, on August 17, it was {{announced}} that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting [...] "homosexual propaganda" [...] which was against the law, and allegedly [...] "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" [...] at the concert. According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, [...] "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders—for me it causes moral suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steele {{was born}} on October 19, 1958, at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's County, Maryland, and was adopted as an infant by William and Maebell Steele. His father died in 1962. His mother, who had been born into a {{sharecropping}} family in South Carolina, worked for minimum wage as a laundress to raise her children. After Steele's father died, <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> her friends' appeals to apply for public assistance, later telling Steele, [...] "I didn't want the government raising my children". She later married John Turner, a truck driver. Michael and his sister, Monica Turner, were raised in the Petworth neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, D.C., which Steele has described as a small, stable and racially integrated community that insulated him {{from some of the}} problems elsewhere in the city. Steele's sister later married and divorced former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1971 book Religion and the Decline of Magic, English {{historian}} Keith Thomas dismissed Murray's thesis when {{he asserted}} that scholarship on the Early Modern witch trials had established that there was [...] "very little {{evidence to suggest that}} the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult". Although accepting that when she first published her ideas, they were [...] "the best alternative" [...] to the dominant [...] "rationalist" [...] view of witchcraft as [...] "total delusion", he stated that her conclusions were [...] "almost totally groundless" [...] because <b>she</b> <b>ignored</b> the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point. In his 1975 book Europe's Inner Demons, English historian Norman Cohn commented on the [...] "extraordinary" [...] manner in which Murray's theory had come to [...] "exercise considerable influence" [...] within scholarship. Cohn was nevertheless highly critical; {{he asserted that}} Murray's [...] "knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non-existent." [...] Furthermore, he added that her ideas were [...] "firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould." [...] That same year, the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade, writing in the History of Religions journal, described Murray's work as [...] "hopelessly inadequate" [...] and full of [...] "numberless and appalling errors". He added that {{from the perspective of a}} historian of religion, [...] "her use of comparative materials and, in general, the methods of Religionswissenschaft have been unfortunate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel {{are still}} {{critical}} of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a [...] "fashionable trend" [...] being promoted due to [...] "sexual hedonism" [...] and broached {{the question of}} whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. She later admitted that [...] "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy" [...] and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. [...] "The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs {{and all the rest of}} it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...." [...] <b>She</b> <b>ignored</b> lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially but objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

She accepted lesbian sexuality, albeit not its politicization. In 1995, at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, she found advice given by Chinese authorities to taxi drivers that naked lesbians would be [...] "cavorting" [...] in their cars so that the drivers should hang sheets outside their cab windows, and that lesbians would have AIDS and so drivers should carry disinfectants, to be [...] "ridiculous", [...] "incredibly stupid" [...] and [...] "insulting".
