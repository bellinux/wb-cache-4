40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, guided implant surgery {{has been}} {{introduced}} and several studies verified its accuracy. While those studies reported on {{the accuracy of the}} entire procedure, this experiment wanted to evaluate the degree of deviation that can occur during the drilling procedure alone, due to the tolerance of the drill in the <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Drilling was executed in a plexi-glass box with a maximal inclination of the drills within the <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> Different sleeve inserts, sleeve positions, sleeve heights, <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert</b> heights and diameters were evaluated. RESULTS: The two tested sleeve inserts gave a maximum deviation in angulation of 5. 2 ° and a maximum horizontal deviation of 1. 3  mm at the implant shoulder and 2. 4  mm at the apex for a 13  mm implant. These deviations decreased if the distance of the sleeve above the plexi-glass box became smaller and hand hold sleeve inserts gave less deviation than drill hold sleeve inserts. The deviation increased by longer implant length, larger drill key diameter, shorter sleeves and/or drill key heights. CONCLUSIONS: For a minimal deviation during the surgery with a stereolithographic guide, {{it is very important to}} use the drill in a centric position, parallel to the cylinder. The use of longer drill keys and sleeves are critical for optimal accuracy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} that electrical currents in oil-transporting metal pipes cause corrosion {{of the pipe}} material by electrochemical activity. The problem of computing these currents is dependent upon knowing the effective resistance of the conducting pathway. Owing to the geometrical complexity of such systems, the problem of ascertaining these resistances in any exact manner is a formidable problem. For this reason we propose an analogue model for a particular configuration of interest, involving an electrolyte contained in a steel pipe having an insulated joint {{at one end and}} a movable insulating <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> The calculations, which involve only simple calculus, may readily be extended to fit other circumstances. The dependence of resistivity on temperature may be included in our final formulas for resistance. Experiments to test the model are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to measure the effective thermal conductivity {{of a number of}} materials (particle beds, and fluids) proposed for use in and around canisters for disposal of high level nuclear waste in deep boreholes. This information is required to insure that waste temperatures will not exceed tolerable limits. Such experimental verification is essential because analytical models and empirical correlations can not accurately predict effective thermal conductivities for complex configurations of poorly characterized media, such as beds of irregular particles of mixed sizes. The experimental apparatus consisted of a 2. 54 cm. diameter cylindrical heater (heated length = 0. 5 m), surrounded by a 5. 0 cm inner diameter steel tube. Six pairs of thermocouples were located axially {{on the inside of the}} heater sheath, and in grooves on the air-fan-cooled outer tube. Test media were used to fill the annular gap, and the temperature drop across the gap measured at several power levels covering the range of heat fluxes expected on a waste canister soon after emplacement. Values of effective thermal conductivity were measured for air, water; particle beds of sand, SiC, graphite and aluminum; and an air gap subdivided by a thin metal <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> Results are compared to literature values and analytical models for conduction, convection and radiation. Agreement within a factor of 2 was common, and the results confirm the adequacy, and reduce the uncertainty of prior borehole system design calculations. All particle bed data fell between 0. 3 and 0. 5 W/moC, hence other attributes can determine usage. by Samina Shaikh. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)
