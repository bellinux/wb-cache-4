40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> spacing on irrigation uniformity and efficiency. Laboratory and field experiments {{were conducted to}} obtain information on soil physical characteristics, furrow infiltration and water advance data in order to validate the theoretical results. A furrow infiltration model based on Richards' equation and a finite element technique is developed and used to predict infiltrated depths in the transverse and longitudinal directions relative to the furrow centerline and furrow inlet, respectively. The model predicted measured furrow infiltration in the field from the third irrigation but {{failed to do so}} for the first and second irrigations. Simulations <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation in a hypothetical soil with various furrow spacings showed that cumulative infiltration is not affected by furrow spacing until the lateral wetting front reaches the imaginary vertical boundary located midway between two <b>furrows.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> uniformity and efficiency from predicted water distribution profiles from field irrigated furrows are conclusive in that the use of longitudinal water distribution profile alone is not enough to assess the performance <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation. The transverse distribution of infiltrated depths which is a function <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> spacing must be included in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Cytokinesis by {{contraction}} {{of the base}} <b>of</b> the cleavage <b>furrow</b> and the dependence of the position <b>of</b> the future <b>furrow</b> on the arrangement of cytoplasm under it have been demon-strated at relatively earlier stages of cleavage in amphibian eggs. The following experiments and observations on dividing eggs of the newt Cynops pyrrhogaster indicated {{the presence of the}} contracting force at the base <b>of</b> the <b>furrow</b> and revealed that the above cleavage mechanisms occurred throughout cleavage. (1) Deformation of the animal surface induced conversion <b>of</b> an early <b>furrow</b> to a ridge, the base <b>of</b> the <b>furrow</b> forming the top of the ridge. (2) A needle placed in the path <b>of</b> the <b>furrow</b> blocked its deepening, not only at the point of contact but also in neighbouring regions. Any part of the plane of cleavage could be blocked in this way. (3) A microfilamentous band was found under the plasma membrane at the base <b>of</b> the <b>furrow</b> at a late stage of cleavage. (4) Alteration in the position <b>of</b> the <b>furrow</b> base could be induced in the middle of cleavage by outflow of egg cytoplasm...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} from furrow to sprinkler irrigation {{has reduced the}} transport of soil from irrigated cropland to surface waters. Both current conditions and historical trends reveal that decreasing use <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation reduces the soil loss. Lower concentrations of DDT in streambed sediment and fish tissue were detected in drainage basins with lower percentages <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation. Decreasing use <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation may reduce runoff losses of other pesticides and nitrogen from irrigated cropland. During 1993 - 94, scientists with the U. S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program collected samples of surface-water discharges at the outflows of nine drain-age basins containing irrigated cropland.

40|$|Signaling by the centrosomal asters and spindle midzone coordinately directs {{formation}} <b>of</b> the cytokinetic <b>furrow.</b> Here, {{we explore}} {{the contribution of}} the asters by analyzing the consequences of altering interaster distance during the first cytokinesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Delaying aster separation, by using TPXL- 1 depletion to shorten the metaphase spindle, leads to a corresponding delay in furrow formation, but results in a single furrow that ingresses at a normal rate. Preventing aster separation, by simultaneously inhibiting TPXL- 1 and G signaling-based cortical forces pulling on the asters, delays furrow formation and leads to the formation <b>of</b> multiple <b>furrows</b> that ingress toward the midzone. Disrupting midzone-based signaling, by depleting conserved midzone complexes, results in a converse phe-notype: neither the timing nor the number <b>of</b> <b>furrows</b> is affected, but the rate <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> ingression is decreased threefold. Simultaneously delaying aster separation and disrupting midzone-based signaling leads to complete failure <b>of</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. Based on these results, we propose that signaling by the separated asters executes two critical functions: 1) it couples furrow formation to anaphase onset by concentrating contractile ring proteins on the equatorial cortex in a midzone-independent manner and 2) it subsequently refines spindle midzone-based signaling to restrict furrowing to a single site...|$|R

Individual scales located on the horizontal rod of the profilometer provide data to plot furrow depth {{as a function of the}} lateral distance and the data can be numerically integrated.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the influence of wrinkles on facial age judgments. In Experiment 1, preadolescents, young adults, and middle-aged adults made categorical age judgments {{for male and female}} faces. The qualitative (type of wrinkle) and quantitative (density of wrinkles and depth <b>of</b> <b>furrows)</b> contributions <b>of</b> wrinkles were analyzed. Results indicated that the greater the number of wrinkles and the depth <b>of</b> <b>furrows,</b> the older a face was rated. The roles of the gender of the face and the age of the participants were discussed. In Experiment 2, participants performed relative age judgments by comparing pairs of faces. Results revealed that the number of wrinkles had more influence on the perceived facial age than the type of wrinkle. A MDS analysis showed the main dimensions on which participants based their judgments, namely, the number of wrinkles and the depth <b>of</b> <b>furrows.</b> We conclude that the quantitative component is more likely to increase perceived facial age. Nevertheless, other variables, such as the gender of the face and the age of the participants, also seem {{to be involved in the}} age estimation process...|$|R
