40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{empirical}} relationships between public capital and aggregate {{economic growth in the}} United States, and in particular {{the question of whether or}} not public capital is productive. It develops a theoretical framework which allows for full consideration of feedback among variables without imposing a priori dynamic structural constraints. Parameter estimates are obtained through a VARMA model. This approach departs from the current literature, which relies on a single equation approach to estimate production functions and implicitly assumes the absence of feedback relations. In this paper estimates for the period 1956 - 1989 suggest that public capital has a substantial effect on production as well as on private capital formation and on labor. Furthermore, decisions on public capital seem to follow a policy rule that relates the current stock of public capital positively with lagged output and negatively with lagged labor. Our results are shown to be compatible with different <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> functions, in which public capital mayor may or may not be present. Therefore, current interpretations of the importance of the effects of public capital in terms of the size of the estimated parameters in a production function framework are not conclusiv...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{describe}} the 1990 DEED, the most recently constructed matched employeremployee data {{set for the}} United States that contains detailed demographic information on workers (most notably, information on education). We then use the data from manufacturing establishments in the 1990 DEED to update and expand on previous findings, using a more limited data set, regarding the measurement of the labor input and theories of wage determination (Hellerstein, et al., 1999). We find that the productivity of women is {{less than that of}} men, but not by enough to fully explain the gap in wages, a result that is consistent with wage discrimination against women. In contrast, we find no evidence of wage discrimination against blacks. We estimate that both the wage and productivity profiles are rising but concave to the origin (consistent with profiles quadratic in age), but the estimated relative wage profile is steeper than the relative productivity profile, consistent with models of deferred wages. We find a productivity premium for marriage equal to that of the wage premium, and a productivity premium for education that somewhat exceeds the wage premium. Exploring the sensitivity of these results, we also find that different <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> functions do not have any qualitative effects on the these results. Finally, the results indicate that the returns to productive inputs (capital, materials, labor quality) as well as the residual variance are virtually unaffected by the choice of the construction of the labor quality input. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{new measure}} of bank service output to {{estimate}} various <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and cost functions for Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) {{over the period}} 1986 to 1999. The new output series is a true flow measure of bank service value added, and it follows from a unified model of bank operation that integrates risk and the measurement of bank services. The model also establishes separability between the production function of bank services and the funds borrowed and lent—a special intermediate input for banks. The preferred specification of the cost function estimates a large dispersion in productivity levels across BHCs. This implies that one potential benefit of bank mergers is the acquisition by more productive banks of less productive banks, thereby improving the targets ’ productivity. The cost function also yields an estimate of increasing returns to scale in banking, contrasting with the typical finding in the existing literature of constant returns to scale. On the other hand, the production function estimates decreasing returns to scale. But these estimates are shown to be potentially biased downward, whereas the estimates from the cost function {{are likely to be}} biased upward because of measurement errors in the imputed output. The paper tentatively concludes that there {{is likely to be a}} modest degree of increasing returns to scale in the production of bank services. If confirmed, this tentative conclusion implies that the cost savings from increased scale of banking institutions should be taken into account in the analysis of mergers and antitrust policy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we propose and solve a game-theoretic model of a rank-order tournament with private information. Using the {{contract}} settlement data from a poultry company, we estimate a fully structural model of a symmetric Nash equilibrium of this game. We show that growers ’ equilibrium effort depends on four factors: the spread in piece rates between the performance brackets, the number of players in each tournament, the number of performance brackets used, and the density of growers ’ private shocks. We use estimates to simulate how changes in the tournament characteristics affecting equilibrium effort impact the growers ’ and the integrator’s welfare. Key words: private information, production contracts, rank-order tournaments, structural estimation DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1467 - 8276. 2007. 01008. x In most sporting events, prizes are awarded not on basis of absolute performance but based on relative performance, or tournaments. Be sides sporting events, tournaments are also frequently used in labor contracts. The name “tournament ” typically suggests a rank-order (ordinal) scheme such as is considered by Lazear and Rosen (1981), whereas a broader definition applies to any compensation scheme based on relative performance (e. g., Nalebuff and Stiglitz 1983; Tsoulouhas and Vukina 1999). Despite the sizeable theoretical litera ture on tournaments, empirical work related to these models remains rather limited.

40|$|Abstract: Beginning with {{a series}} of {{pioneering}} work by Cobb and Douglas, estimation <b>of</b> <b>production</b> function {{has been one of the}} main issues in empirical economics and econometrics in various aspects. The functional form they used is called Cobb-Douglas production function. It is later generalized to so-called translog production function which has a more flexible form to describe the relation between the output and input levels. It is also analytically convenient for obtaining factor demand functions or cost function so that it has been widely used in both macroeconomic and microeconomic empirical studies. However, it is well known that statistical analysis leads to incorrect conclusions in general if the specified parametric model is wrong. This paper tests for the translog <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> function for Japanese manufacturing industry. We apply the nonparametric misspecification test by Hong and White [1995]. It is a consistent test having nontrivial power against local alternatives.

Unlike previous literature, we introduce a general <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that allows for disentangling the gains from specialization from the monopolistic markup. The consequences of separating both parameters on the equilibrium dynamics of the model are analyzed. We find that the long-run growth rate ceases {{to depend on the}} markup when it is disentangled from the returns to specialization, and the same happens with the conditions for saddle-path stability. Numerical simulations show that the steady-state equilibria are more prone to be stable in the model that disentangles parameters. Furthermore, the model is able to generate a rich variety of development scenarios, accounting for a number of stylized facts related to the development process of industrialized countries. Manuel A.
