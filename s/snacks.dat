40|$|Research into least {{fattening}} eating patterns {{indicates that}} in England 'a snack' {{is a term}} that refers to different eating habits from 'snacking' and that neither pattern of behaviour necessarily involves 'snack food'. These hypotheses were tested by randomised mailings to {{a convenience sample of}} university campus addressees with the subject heading of the message and the topic of questions in it being one of the terms, a <b>snack,</b> <b>snacking</b> or <b>snack</b> food. Responses to all three terms much more often referred to eating between mealtimes than eating at mealtimes but this contrast was less for a <b>snack,</b> especially at lunchtime. Previous and subsequent eating occasions therefore tended to be at mealtimes, but again less so for a <b>snack.</b> A <b>snack</b> also differed from <b>snacking</b> or eating <b>snack</b> food in eliciting more reports by women of eating in the home than out, and more eating alone than in company. However, reports by men contributed most to differences between <b>snack</b> terms in the foods reported: more men ate bread in a <b>snack</b> than when <b>snacking</b> but more ate sweet items when <b>snacking</b> than in a <b>snack.</b> More men reported savoury items (e. g. potato crisps) as <b>snack</b> food than in response to the other two terms; however, when savouries were combined with bread-containing items, the women were unlike the men in that more of them referred to such items when <b>snacking.</b> Thus, for these people in England, having a <b>snack</b> {{is not the same thing}} as <b>snacking</b> or eating <b>snack</b> food. Because of these ambiguities in use of the root word <b>snack,</b> it may be best to avoid all its derivatives in questions to research participants, discussion among investigators and educational messages...|$|R
