50|$|In <b>skein</b> <b>dyeing</b> the yarns are loosely wound into hanks or skein {{and then}} dyed. The yarns have good dye penetration, {{but the process}} is slow and {{comparatively}} more expensive.|$|E
50|$|In {{package dyeing}} yarns {{that have been}} wound on {{perforated}} spools are dyed in a pressurized tank. The process is comparatively faster, but the dye uniformity {{may not be as}} good as that of <b>skein</b> <b>dyed</b> yarn.|$|R

Listed by Wilson as cotton, tested by microscope to determine it is wool.; Somewhat dirty. Color is uneven in some places; varies from dark (almost purple) to undyed. The yarn is broken in many places...|$|R
2500|$|Yarn for crochet {{is usually}} sold as balls or skeins (hanks), {{although}} {{it may also be}} wound on spools or cones. [...] Skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc. [...] It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased. [...] Crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. [...] The dye lot specifies a group of <b>skeins</b> that were <b>dyed</b> together and thus have precisely the same color; <b>skeins</b> from different <b>dye</b> lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when added onto existing work. [...] If insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{artificial}} silk, {{which was not}} suitable for hemstitching, made its appearance in the textile industry. This caused Karl Friedrich to turn to how some tasks {{in the production of}} artificial silk, such as the tying up of the hanks of thread into <b>skeins</b> prior to <b>dyeing</b> - termed fitzing in German - might be accomplished by machines. He devised plans for a fitz machine and set up a new workshop for its construction. In 1926, shortly before the first machine could be produced, Karl Friedrich Gegauf died.|$|R
50|$|Yarn for hand-knitting {{is usually}} sold as balls or skeins (hanks), {{although}} {{it may also be}} wound on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn-band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc. It is common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased. Knitters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. The dye lot specifies a group of <b>skeins</b> that were <b>dyed</b> together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye-lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when knitted into the same project. If a knitter buys insufficient yarn of a single dye lot to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.|$|R

40|$|Molas are {{decorative}} {{panels that}} are sewn into the Kuna women 2 ̆ 7 s blouses {{and they are}} Panama 2 ̆ 7 s most famous native handicraft, dating one hundred twenty-five years ago (Anderson, 1977). They are one of a kind, entirely hand made, and their designs range from nature and geometry to fantasy. I challenged myself to take the craft of molas {{and give it a}} new updated life in today 2 ̆ 7 s fashion arena. The concept behind the look had to be a fantasy, dream like vision of something in nature that maybe Panama people could never see in their lifetime, such as an aurora borealis. The mola technique panel has six layers of silk dupioni, overdyed and hand embellished. The chunky wool hand knit sweater was <b>dyed</b> <b>skein</b> by skein in multiple colors. The isolating contrast of the waist area suggests fragility and it is meant to overemphasize the embellished mola technique. The creative exploration of the slow hand making process of molas resulted into a serendipitous modern ensemble, challenging the current notions of aesthetics and unique and opening up sustainable alternatives to preserving the vanishing artisanal industry...|$|R
