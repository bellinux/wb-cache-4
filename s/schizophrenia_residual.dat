Our therapeutic {{work and the}} results we are herewith presenting, reveal that the psychomotor deficiency by <b>Schizophrenia</b> <b>residual</b> conditions represent new and significant indication fields for specific rehabilitation treatment in psychiatry. Evaluation of efficacy after 6 weeks specific rehabilitation treatment with the Vilan method showed: very satisfactory results in correction of involuntary movements of the torso,   bradykinesia of the hands,  praxia  and the simple simultaneous movements; satisfactory correction of involuntary movements of the extremities, walking  and  the facial gestures.

40|$|Cognitive {{deficits in}} various domains {{have been shown}} in {{patients}} with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine if residual psychopathology explained the difference in cognitive function between clinically stable patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We compared the performance on tests of attention, visual and verbal memory and executive function of 25 patients with schizophrenia in remission and 25 euthymic bipolar disorder patients with that of 25 healthy controls. Mediation analysis was used to see if residual psychopathology could explain the difference in cognitive function between the patient groups. Both patient groups performed significantly worse than healthy controls on most cognitive tests. Patients with bipolar disorder displayed cognitive deficits that were milder but qualitatively similar to those of patients with <b>schizophrenia.</b> <b>Residual</b> negative symptoms mediated the difference in performance on cognitive tests between the two groups. Neither residual general psychotic symptoms nor greater antipsychotic doses explained this relationship. The shared variance explained by the residual negative and cognitive deficits that the difference between patient groups may be explained by greater frontal cortical neurophysiological deficits in patients with schizophrenia, compared to bipolar disorder. Further longitudinal work may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie these deficits...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Social Skills Training, Interpersonal Skills At Patients <b>Residual</b> <b>Schizophrenia</b> Schizophrenia is {{a chronic}} mental {{disorder}} {{which requires a}} long time to heal. Client's mental disorder requires a relatively long treatment for months or even years. It is intended to suppress the smallest possible recurrence (relapse). Treatment can be either medically or actions psychologically. Training social skills is one therapy {{that can be used to}} help patients with schizophrenia to improve the patient's condition so that they are not socially ostracized when they returned in society. One form of social skills are interpersonal skills such as opening a conversation, maintain eye contact, smiled and set the high and low voice when face to face with others. Based on problems, the purpose of research to see the role of social skills to interpersonal skills in patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> This research uses case study research design in clinical psychology (case study in clinical research). This design is used to determine the effect of an intervention or treatment or condition by comparing the performance of the subject from time to time. The subjects observed the behavior of the state before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. The subjects in this study were <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> patients as much as four people. Collecting data in this study using interviews and obervasi. Meanwhile, for the data analysis process involves four parts, namely how the condition before the given training in social skills, then how the process of implementation of social skills training, how the conditions on the exercise of social skills and finally how to follow up the current conditions. Based on these results, it shows the subject of interpersonal skills still can not be changed. This can be seen from the condition of interpersonal skills in the subject HM, SW and AK were unchanged. But on the subject of a little train which can change slightly keep eye contacts. Thus in general can be said that social skills training in this study still can not play a role in improving interpersonal skills in patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{underlying}} structure of neuropsychological tests involving working memory components and those not involving working memory components {{that contribute to}} the performance of the Tower of Hanoi task in schizophrenic patients. Participants and Methods: A total of 90 patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> received a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Working memory was assessed with Letter-Number Span and Visual Patterns tests. Executive function was assessed by the Tower of Hanoi task. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were performed including age, education, duration of illness, and all cognitive functions. Results: Principal component analysis was conducted and yielded a 4 -factor solution: auditory working memory, visual working memory, verbal working memory, and verbal fluency. Subsequent stepwise regression indicated that only visual working memory components and auditory working memory components were retained in the final model accounting, which explained 23. 5 % of the variance.

40|$|Background & objectives: Persons with {{schizophrenia}} use various {{coping strategies}} {{to adapt to}} distressing symptoms {{as well as to}} deal with daily stressors. Efforts have been made to explore alternative frameworks of coping using Ways of Coping Checklist (WCC) in persons with schizophrenia. This study aimed to re-analyze (factor analysis) the revised-WCC in Indian patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> The secondary aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the relationship of new framework of coping with psychopathology, disability and quality of life (QOL). Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 103 patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> were assessed on WCC. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was carried out to determine the factor structure of WCC. Results: Factor analysis yielded six factors which explained 51. 6 per cent of the total variance and had acceptable-to-good internal consistency. Based on the type of items loaded, the six factors were named as follows: active and growth-oriented coping, accepting and fantasizing, reflective and confrontative coping, detachment, seeking social support and negative emotional coping. Patients most often used coping strategy of seeking social support, followed by 'accepting and fantasizing' and 'active and growth-oriented coping'. Correlation analysis showed that those who more often used 'active and growth-oriented coping' had less negative symptoms, lower level of disability and higher spiritual and overall QOL. Interpretation & conclusions: The factor structure of revised-WCC was different among patients with schizophrenia when compared with individuals without mental illness, living in the community. It was evident that use of certain adaptive coping strategies was associated with better QOL and lower level of psychopathology. Our findings provided a framework of coping in patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> and suggested that promotion of certain coping strategies might be useful in improving the QOL and reduction of psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia...|$|R

In a study of patients with schizophrenia that had been previously admitted to a hospital, 24% had what the medical field refers to as religious delusions.|$|R
40|$|Movement {{disorders}} and motor deficiency is highly represented among patients in <b>Schizophrenia</b> – <b>residual</b> type (DSM IV) :  37 % of patients examined in our research had psycho‑motor disturbances. Dominant disturbances are the following: disturbed tonus among 65 % of patients, abnormal postural reactions among 90 %, abnormal voluntary movements among 75 %, disturbed speech among 85 %, disturbed static and dynamic postures among 90 %. Involuntary movements are present among 20 % of patients. Classic neurological diagnostics offers general {{assessment of the}} motor status. Standardized clinical motor scales only register the presence and intensity of the motor disturbance. Rehabilitation treatment requires individual and up to date functional diagnostics of the motor deficiency. We would like to stress that psychiatric patients in psychotic, (prepsychotic) and postpsychotic states, besides being mentally ill, also suffer from serious movement disorders  (psychomotor disturbances and deficits) which put them into the category of  disabled persons, who besides requiring psychiatric (neuropsychiatric) treatment, also require systematic psychomotor and speech  rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: The Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) {{has been}} {{recommended}} for assessment and certification of disability by the Government of India (GOI). However, {{the psychometric properties}} of IDEAS as adopted by GOI remain understudied. Our aim, thus, was to study the internal consistency and validity of IDEAS in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 103 consenting patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> were assessed for disability, quality of life (QOL) and psychopathology using the IDEAS, WHO QOL- 100 and Positive and Negative symptom scale (PANSS) respectively. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach′s alpha. For construct validity, relations between IDEAS, and psychopathology and QOL were studied. Results: The inter-item correlations for IDEAS were significant with a Cronbach′s alpha of 0. 721. All item scores other than score on communication and understanding; total and global IDEAS scores correlated significantly with the positive, negative and general sub-scales, and total PANSS scores. Communication and understanding was significantly related to negative sub-scale score only. Total and global disability scores correlated negatively with all the domains of WHOQOL- 100 (ρ< 0. 01). The individual IDEAS item scores correlated negatively with various WHOQOL- 100 domains (ρ 0 < 0. 01). Interpretation & conclusions: This study findings showed that the GOI-modified IDEAS had good internal consistency and construct validity as tested in patients with <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> Similar studies need to be done with other groups of patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundProgressive brain volume loss in {{schizophrenia}} {{has been}} reported in previous studies but its cause and regional distribution remains unclear. We investigated progressive regional brain reductions in schizophrenia and correlations with potential mediators. MethodParticipants were drawn from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. A total of 33 schizophrenia individuals and 71 controls were MRI scanned at baseline (mean age= 34. 7, SD= 0. 77) and at follow-up (mean age= 43. 4, SD= 0. 44). Regional brain change differences and associations with clinical mediators were examined using FSL voxelwise SIENA. ResultsSchizophrenia cases exhibited greater progressive brain reductions than controls, mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes. The degree of periventricular brain volume reductions were predicted by antipsychotic medication exposure at the fourth ventricular edge and by the number of days in hospital between the scans (a proxy measure of relapse duration) at the thalamic ventricular border. Decline in social and occupational functioning was associated with right supramarginal gyrus reduction. ConclusionOur findings are consistent with the possibility that antipsychotic medication exposure and time spent in relapse partially explain progressive brain reductions in <b>schizophrenia.</b> However, <b>residual</b> confounding could also account for the findings and caution must be applied before drawing causal inferences from associations demonstrated in observational studies of modest size. Less progressive brain volume loss in schizophrenia may indicate better preserved social and occupational functions...|$|R
40|$|Schizophrenia {{patients}} {{have been reported}} to be more impaired in comprehending non-literal than literal language since early studies on proverbs. Preference for literal rather than figurative interpretations continues to be documented. The main aim {{of this study was to}} establish whether patients are indeed able to use combinatorial semantic processing to comprehend literal sentences and both combinatorial analysis and retrieval of pre-stored meanings to comprehend idiomatic sentences. The study employed a sentence continuation task in which subjects were asked to decide whether a target word was a sensible continuation of a previous sentence fragment to investigate idiomatic and literal sentence comprehension in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Patients and healthy controls were faster in accepting sensible continuations than in rejecting non-sensible ones in both literal and idiomatic sentences. Patients were as accurate as controls in comprehending literal and idiomatic sentences, but they were overall slower than controls in all conditions. Once the contribution of cognitive covariates was partialled out, the response times to sensible idiomatic continuations of patients did not significantly differ from those of controls. This suggests that the state of <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> did not contribute to slower processing of sensible idioms above and beyond the cognitive deficits that are typically associated with schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Relapse {{prevention}} {{is the main}} goal of maintenance treatment in schizophrenia. This study aimed to determine the rate and the socio-demographic and clinical predictors of relapse in Chinese schizophrenia patients following treatment of the acute phase of the illness. Methods: In a multi-center, randomized, controlled, longitudinal study, 404 patients with schizophrenia who were clinically stabilized following an acute episode {{were randomly assigned to}} either the maintenance (i. e., initial optimal therapeutic doses continued throughout the study) or the dose-reduction group (i. e., initial optimal therapeutic doses continued for 4 or 26 weeks followed by a 50 % dose reduction that was maintained {{until the end of the}} study). Participants were interviewed at entry using standardized assessment instruments, and followed up for 12 - 26 months. Results: In univariate analyses, relapse was significantly associated with the membership of the dose-reduction group, poor medication adherence, and having a diagnosis of the paranoid type of schizophrenia. In Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis the membership of the dose-reduction group, poorer medication adherence, more severe drug-induced side effects and prominent paranoid symptoms independently predicted a higher risk of relapse. Conclusion: The study confirmed the importance of maintenance medication in preventing relapse in Chinese schizophrenia patients underscoring the risk of relapse associated with lack of treatment adherence, severe side effects and the patients' paranoid attitude. Socio-demographic characteristics were not associated with relapse in Chinese <b>schizophrenia</b> patients. Potential <b>residual</b> confounding caused by unmeasured variables should be fully considered in future studies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Object: In {{treatment}} of Schizophrenia the therapeutic response to antipsychotics {{is attributed to}} dopaminergic antagonism. A high interindividual variation of therapeutic response and occurence of extrapyramidal adverse effects (EPS) can be observed. Therefore therapeutic options are often limited. The dopaminergic receptor type 4 (DRD 4) represents a major therapeutic target espacially for atypical antipsychotics with high affinity to this receptor. Genetic variants of this DRD 4 receptor may modulate the therapeutic response and the severity of EPS. Method: In a multicenter prospective noninvasive study we investigated five known DRD 4 polymorphisms using PCR and PCR-RFLP (DRD 4 - 521 C>T, DRD 4 - 12 bpVNTR, DRD 4 - 13 bpDel/NonDel, DRD 4 -Val 194 Gly und DRD 4 - 48 bpVNTR) in 366 hospitalized schizophrenic patients (52, 2 % male, 47, 8 % female) with European Caucasian background (mean age 38, 7, SD= 12, 6). The intensity of EPS under antipsychotic treatment was compared between the carriers of different DRD 4 genotypes. The intensitiy of pseudoparkinsonism was measured by EPS scale, akathisia by BARS scale and tardive dyskinesia by AIMS scale at three points of investigation (at day of treatment 2 - 4, 12 - 16 and 26 - 30). Further we explored the relationship between DRD 4 genotypes and four subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid schizophrenia 219, schizoaffective disorder 65, <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> 29, katatonic schizophrenia 15) Results: We found significant differences between carriers of DRD 4 genotypes neither for pseudoparkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia nor akathisia (p T. Also catatonic schizophrenia could be observed more often in carriers of heterozygote genotype (13, 3 %, p= 0, 055). Conclusion: In conclusion the genetic variations in the DRD 4 gene showed no major influence in occurence of individually variable adverse effects from antipsychotic treatment in Caucasian schizophrenic patients. Further these data exclude a major role of the DRD 4 genotypes as a susceptibility factor for subtypes of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The author {{recalls the}} setting for the Rorschach test meets the {{conditions}} of validity to be interpreted in accordance to the Comprehensive System. Since the work of JE Exner consensus is established to identify two categories of invalid protocols: the protocols collected from subjects who are temporarily in a serious state of disarray for contextual reasons and the brief protocols. Regarding the brief protocols, the rule is clear and precise: research findings indicate {{that the overwhelming majority}} of records of less than 14 responses will not have the level of reliability prerequisite to the assumption of interpretive validity. The test will be considered invalid if the subject does not give at least one answer to each of the cards. For the presented protocol, it is not fair to detect any structural and psychopathology data. The author's hypothesis is to propose an unique and phenomenological study of the test and to formulate an hypothesis regarding the psychological functioning of the subject. The subject is a patient of 32 years old showing a paranoid schizophrenic disorder in symptomatic stabilization for six months. The patient receives a treatment with neuroleptics and follows therapy based on knowledge of the disorder and the recognition of associated symptoms. The patient's Rorschach is invalid (less than 14 answers and no response and 3 rejections of cards). Protocol analysis From the 10 responses, each perception is reviewed, either directly or during the inquiry. Finally, each answer was rejected by a perceptual justification that will give "evidence" to challenge the response ("but not a [...] . because [...] . ") or by a simple assertion ("because it does not look like", "it cannot be right" or "it's not that"). Cognitive mediation - the process between the information processing and ideation - can be analyzed in depth for this protocol. The cognitive mediation reflects the mental operations involved in the translation or the identification of the data collected. The process requires some reconciliation (mediation) between the image that has been stored and available items from the memory of the individual so as to accomplish the task of responding to the question "What might this be?". In this protocol, the cognitive mediation responds to a simple and repetitive logic which seems to reflect an idiosyncratic psychological functioning. In general, in the Rorschach’s situation, the subject must give a "wrong" answer because the only absolutely correct answer is "the inkblot". The Rorschach’s test requires that the person to "misperceive" the stimulus (to "violate reality"). For the protocol of this study, each response – each "false perception" - is systematically reviewed by the subject and ultimately rejected with contradictory perceptual justification or arguments unsophisticated. Discussion and hypothesis An idiographic hypothesis is formulated by the author from this tendency to systematic doubt. This means identifying, through this subject, the use of a form of "methodical doubt" in the cognitive mediation. This mechanism would fit in a paradoxical context that may reflect the state of the schizophrenic patient in a symptomatic stabilization situation. This hypothesis shows that the stabilization {{should not be confused with}} any remission or "cure" (suggesting a return to a previous state to psychosis). If the subject learns to explicitly doubting against ambiguous stimuli, it is hardly possible to tolerate a moderate degree of violation and therefore meet the paradigmatic principle of the Rorschach. Finally, the analysis of the Rorschach’s test gives us an interesting information about symptomatic stabilization situation and residual component of the schizophrenic disorder. These observations appear to be incompatible with homeostatic hypothesis and demonstrate the usefulness of <b>residual</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> diagnosis. The rule of "misperception" if it is tolerable and implicit for the non-psychosis individual, it is intolerable and always explicitly questioned by our schizophrenic patients. The relation between implicit and explicit is a complexed dialectical conflict that seems to characterize the psychological functioning on a continuum showing schizophrenic subject and non-psychosis person. Après avoir rediscuté les notions de protocoles « courts » et « non valides » au Rorschach selon le Système Intégré, l’auteur propose de réaliser une analyse du protocole d’un sujet schizophrène en phase de stabilisation. Le Rorschach présenté ne répond pas aux critères de validité (moins de 14 réponses et refus de planche à 3 reprises) et ne permet donc pas de réaliser une analyse structurale complète à portée psychopathologique. L’hypothèse de cette contribution est de réaliser une étude phénoménologique de ce protocole en centrant l’analyse sur le processus de médiation cognitive que le sujet semble employer de manière idiosyncrasique lorsqu’il est confronté à la consigne du test. La démarche implicite de « fausse perception » qui est suggérée au sujet (« qu’est-ce que cela pourrait-être ? ») semble difficilement tolérable et pourrait, en partie, expliquer les refus de planches mais aussi la remise en question systématique des réponses et finalement leur rejet lors de la phase d’administration ou lors de l’enquête. Le recours à ce « doute méthodique » est superposable aux exercices de remédiation cognitive basés sur la connaissance de la maladie et la reconnaissance des symptômes associés auxquels a été soumis le patient. Finalement, l’analyse du Rorschach nous donne des informations intéressantes sur la stabilisation symptomatologique de notre patient et sur la composante résiduelle de son trouble schizophrénique. Ces observations semblent incompatibles avec des hypothèses homéostatiques et la possibilité d’un retour à un état antérieur à la schizophrénie, et démontrent l’utilité du diagnostic de schizophrénie résiduelle.
