40|$|Wind Cave National Park {{is proposing}} the {{construction}} of a new structure to house the fire cache materials and administrative space for a seven person fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crew.</b> The fire cache provides gear for the park’s seven person fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crew</b> and engines, as well as approximately thirty additional red-carded park employees. The cache also provides the necessary equipment for the suppression of wildfires and the implementation of prescribed burns within the park and neighboring land management agencies. The current structure houses two type VI wildland fire engines, a type III water tender, 30 person fire cache, shop, fire tools, and limited administrative space for the park fire operations. The existing space is inadequate to house the necessary equipment and personnel needed for wildland fire protection for the park. The proposed structure would provide adequate work space and storage for the fire cache. This Environmental Assessment has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1508. 0). It analyzes the proposed action and alternatives, and their likely impacts on the environment. Less than 0. 1 acres adjacent to the existing structure would be disturbed for the project, with all of this area previously disturbed by {{the construction of}} the current fire cache, Building # 17, or by the construction for its current use, that of outdoor storage. No cultural resources would be adversely impacted by the proposed actions. The severity, duration and timing of impacts associated with this proposal, and their direct, indirect and cumulative effects do not constitute impairment of park resources and values.

30|$|More {{research}} is needed to determine the optimal canopy cover that reduces the risk of crown fire spread while not significantly increasing surface fire spread. Importantly, the analysis of tradeoffs between crown fire and surface fire risks and hazards in shaded fuelbreaks needs to factor in response times for <b>suppression</b> <b>crews,</b> because fuelbreaks alone cannot stop wildfires without firefighters actively using them. More modeling research using a variety of percentages and spatial arrangements of canopy cover would help provide land managers with more options to design fuelbreaks appropriate to site-specific environmental needs and conditions.|$|R

50|$|Wildfires {{often occur}} in remote areas, needing fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crews</b> to travel through {{pristine}} forest {{to reach the}} site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and wildland-urban interface areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.|$|R

30|$|Historically, {{our study}} sites burned frequently, {{with a median}} fire return {{interval}} ranging from 5 to 13  years (Stephens et al. 2003). The spatially heterogenous, patchy nature of fuels and forest structure described here and in previous studies is, in part, a consequence of an intact fire regime consisting of frequent, predominately low- to moderate-intensity fires. However, the current fire-free interval of 40 + years is unusual in the multi-century fire-scar record (Stephens et al. 2003, Skinner et al. 2008), and {{this is due to}} a policy of fire exclusion throughout the SSPM. Surface fuels in some conifer forests of the SSPM are higher than expected due to this policy and the efficiency at which the fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crews</b> are extinguishing all fires (Dunbar-Irwin and Safford 2016). Policies could be modified to incorporate both managed wildfire and prescribed fire to avoid forest management issues associated with over a century of fire suppression, similar to that of forests in the western US (Stephens et al. 2008, Dunbar-Irwin and Safford 2016, Rivera-Huerta et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Controlling {{wildfires}} {{within the}} wildland/urban interface {{has proven to}} be the most complex challenge facing wildland fire agen-cies. Although program improvements to increase the efficiency of interface suppression efforts have been suggested, the availability of information about the wildfire environment remains a critical re-source for wildland fire planning. Geographic Information Systems (GISs) can provide the technology to store, manipulate, analyze, and display spatially oriented information in a form necessary for effi-cient fire planning and incident decision making. Complex map and attribute information, including vegetation types, fuels models, weather patterns, topography, fire suppression environment, land-use characteristics, and microenvironmenta] features, can be rap-idly summarized and integrated. This integrated information can be used to create unique polygons useful in predicting fire behavior, allocating fire suppression resources, and as an aid in planning land use. Simplified user interfaces and the portability of new hardware systems will allow GISs to be used at every level of wildland fire planning. I n t r o d u c t i o n The U. S. Forest Service considers the urban/wildland interface fire problems to be the major challenge facing wildland fire agencies in the United States today. 1 Various actions and strategies have been sug-gested to ameliorate this ever-increasing fire problem, including im-proved training of <b>suppression</b> <b>crews,</b> more effective education of prop-erty owners, land developers, and local planners, and increased researc...|$|R
50|$|Plank and beam {{construction}} or framing {{is a type}} of framing with no joists but widely spaced beams spanned by heavy planks. This method developed in the early 19th century for industrial mill floors but may also be found in timber framed roofs. Also known as Slow burning construction, mill construction, and heavy timber {{construction or}}iginated in industrial mills in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The joists are eliminated by the use of heavy planks saving time and strength of the timbers because the joists notches were eliminated. The beams are spaced 4 ft to 18 ft apart and the planks are 2 in or more thick possibly with another layer of 1 in on the top as the finished flooring could span these distances. The planks may be laid flat and tongue and grooved or splined together or laid on edge called a laminated floor. The name slow burning construction was coined in 1870 by Factory Mutual insurance company because large, smooth timbers with chamfered edges ignite slower and last longer in a fire allowing fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crews</b> more time to extinguish a fire. These beams are designed to be self-releasing in case of fire, that is if they burn through and collapse the connection with the masonry wall and joint at the post should allow the beam to fall away without pulling the wall or post down. A common way to join a beam and a masonry wall in this regard is a fire cut, an angled cut {{on the end of the}} beam.|$|R
5000|$|It is the {{location}} of the recently restored Snowy Mountain Fire Observation Station, i.e. 'fire tower', listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In 1909, after the disastrous forest fires of 1903 and 1908, New York State began erecting observation towers on strategically located peaks, such as Snowy Mountain, as part of a comprehensive forest fire suppression program for the Adirondack Mountains. That year a fifteen foot high log tower and a small log cabin were erected on the summit of Snowy Mountain. A telephone line was strung from the tower to Indian Lake village, a distance of 11 1/2 miles. Upon sighting smoke, the observer would call in {{the location}} of a suspected forest fire. With reports from observers on other nearby mountains, the exact location of the fire could be calculated by triangulation and fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crews</b> dispatched most expeditiously. In 1917, a steel tower 22 feet high replaced the log tower. In 1933, the steel tower was raised 33 feet so observers could see over the surrounding trees (one must assume that Verplanck Colvin and his men cleared the summit of most, if not all, trees in 1872 for triangulation sightings to distant peaks during the Adirondack Survey). In 1971, the Snowy Mountain fire tower was closed when NYS decided that it was unnecessary for protecting the Adirondack Park from forest fires (airplanes could do the job equally well). [...] Several years later (it was there in 1986, but gone in 2006), the observer's cabin was removed.|$|R

50|$|Helicopters proved {{invaluable}} {{at all of}} the fires. It was so {{easy for}} fires to crown that it was consistently difficult for direct attack to succeed.

The fact that the winds held on WNW for so long made <b>suppression</b> easier for <b>crews.</b>|$|R
30|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the outbreak, managers and researchers have been concerned about heightened fire hazard in affected areas. Following MPB attack, needles turn from green to red over a period of approximately 1 year (Jolly et al. 2012 a), by which time their foliar moisture content can drop to 10 % to 12 % or lower (Jolly et al. 2012 a, Page et al. 2013). Dead needles typically remain in tree crowns in British Columbia for approximately 2 to 3 years following attack (Wulder et al. 2006). With reduced light and wind interception, remaining branches and stems become rapidly desiccated, in-stand wind speed increases, and increased sunlight promotes rapid drying of surface fuels. Managers and researchers have often assumed that fuel conditions during these early stages following beetle kill would induce crowning at lower fire intensity levels and lead to more rapidly spreading crown fires, compared with healthy pine stands (e.g., Romme et al. 2006). An earlier generation of research on fuels and fire danger, though lacking data or validation, identified forest areas with dead trees and dense, dead foliage as the highest category of crown fire hazard (Fahnestock 1970). In British Columbia, anecdotal reports from fire <b>suppression</b> <b>crews</b> and fire behaviour specialists suggested that personnel were frequently surprised by the rapid spread and high intensity of fires spreading in red-attack pine stands (B. Armitage, Ember Research Services, personal communication, 2004; M. Pritchard, British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range, personal communication 2010; Wildfire Management Branch, British Columbia Ministry of Forest and Range, unpublished field reports, 2002 – 2010). However, these hypotheses and observations had not been tested or quantified before now, and there are very few aids available for fire behaviour forecasting and planning in large areas of beetle-killed pine fuels.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, an interagency {{hotshot crew}} (IHC), or simply hotshot crew, is a Type 1 handcrew of 20 firefighters {{specially}} trained in wildfire <b>suppression</b> tactics. Hotshot <b>crews</b> are considered an elite group among wildland firefighters, {{due to their}} extensive training, high physical fitness standards, and ability to undertake difficult, dangerous, and stressful assignments. They often respond to large, high-priority fires and are trained and equipped to work in remote areas for {{extended periods of time}} with little logistical support.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the treatment effects wildfire <b>suppression</b> (fire <b>crew</b> response time) and fuel management (prescribed fire) have on wildfire size and intensity. Since wildfire management (suppression and fuel management) is likely endogenous to wildfire behavior, we develop instrumental variables (IV) and propensity score matching (PSM) methods to provide consistent estimations of the returns to management. The suitability of IV versus PSM methods {{depends largely on}} the assumptions made and the data available, {{and in the case}} of wildfire modeling, it seems PSM may be more appropriate. While the vast majority of PSM literature focuses on binary treatments, we explore the ability of recently developed continuous treatment propensity score models. We find that in general wildfire management does limit wildfire size and intensity. However, our results differ depending on the estimation strategy (OLS, IV, PSM) employed...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{wildland fire}} occurrence and size data from Sardinia, Italy, and Corsica, France, to examine spatiotemporal patterns of fire occurrence {{in relation to}} weather, land use, anthropogenic features, and time of year. Fires on these islands are largely human caused and {{can be attributed to}} negligence, agro-pastoral land use, and arson. Of particular interest was the predictive value of a fire weather index (FWI) that is widely used by fire managers to alert <b>suppression</b> <b>crews.</b> We found that an increase in the FWI from 30 to 60 produced on average an approximate eightfold increase in the odds of a large fire, regardless of the time of year during the fire season or land use type. Total area burned per fire season was positively correlated with the number of days with FWI>[*] 40 over the period studied. Strong interactions between time of year and land type were also observed for both the probability of ignition and large fire. For example, the estimated odds of a large fire on agricultural lands in southern Sardinia was approximately 10 times larger than the forest and shrubland land type for areas close to roads, early (May) in the fire season. Conversely, {{toward the end of the}} fire season (September), we estimated the odds of a large fire in these same areas at about half the value estimated for the forest land classes. Of the explanatory variables analyzed, only FWI had an effect on the probability of a large fire (P [*]< 0. 1). The results of the study can be used in several ways including the following: (1) allocating fire detection and suppression resources to specific locations during the fire season; (2) prioritizing fuel breaks along specific road segments that have high predicted ignition rates; (3) refining the current fire danger indices; and (4) parameterizing wildfire simulation models to test how changing land use and climate change may affect spatial patterns in burn probability and intensity...|$|R

500|$|... 1988 {{was a big}} {{year for}} {{wildfires}} in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major. Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, over 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire <b>suppression</b> efforts. <b>Crews</b> would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|R
5000|$|During the First (1994-1996) and Second Chechen Wars (1999-2009), Chechen rebels used RPGs {{to attack}} Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was {{effective}} because tank main guns {{could not be}} depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very {{top and bottom of}} tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on artillery <b>suppression,</b> good <b>crew</b> gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4, Tunguska-M1) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent [...] "cells" [...] that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG (RPG-7V or RPG-18, for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians' ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top). When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.|$|R
40|$|A module was {{developed}} to simulate the effects of suppression on fire growth in F ARSITE. This capability provides one component of a simulation system that could ultimately be used for analyzing fire management operations and planning alternatives. Both ground and air attack have been incorporated. An example application is described for the Camp Creek Watershed {{in the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada, California. This area is typical of the wildlandurban intermix, a situation with the greatest potential financial consequences of wildland fire. The effectiveness of suppression attack on a wildfire was simulated for two management scenarios: one with the current fuel conditions and one with a modest IS-year program of fuel treatments on public lands. Costs to both scenarios associated with fuel management and fire <b>suppression</b> were estimated. <b>Crew</b> availability and arrival times were estimated from experience in this area. The simulation showed that fuel treatments with the specified effects on fuel structure did slow fire growth and thereby allowed attack resources to contain the fire more quickly. The economic analysis supports the idea that a fuel management program can reduce costs of suppressing wildfires and damages in adjacent lands...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{fires are}} a common occurrence, yet few studies have {{reported}} exposures associated with burning vehicles. This article presents an assessment of firefighters' potential for ultrafine and respirable particle exposure during vehicle fire suppression training. Fires were initiated within the engine compartment and passenger cabins of three salvaged vehicles, with subsequent water <b>suppression</b> by fire <b>crews.</b> Firefighter exposures were monitored {{with an array of}} direct reading particle and air quality instruments. A flexible metallic duct and blower drew contaminants to the instrument array, positioned at a safe distance from the burning vehicles, with the duct inlet positioned at the nozzle operator's shoulder. The instruments measured the particle number, active surface area, respirable particle mass, photoelectric response, aerodynamic particle size distributions, and air quality parameters. Although vehicle fires were suppressed quickly (< 10 minutes), firefighters may be exposed to short duration, high particle concentration episodes during fire suppression, which are orders of magnitude greater than the ambient background concentration. A maximum transient particle concentration of 1. 21 32 ̆ 014 10 (7) particles per cm(3), 170 mg m(- 3) respirable particle mass, 4700 (2) cm(- 3) active surface area and 1400 (arbitrary units) in photoelectric response were attained throughout the series of six fires. Expressed as fifteen minute time-weighted averages, engine compartment fires averaged 5. 4 32 ̆ 014 10 (4) particles per cm(3), 0. 36 mg m(- 3) respirable particle mass, 92 (2) cm(- 3) active particle surface area and 29 (arbitrary units) in photoelectric response. Similarly, passenger cabin fires averaged 2. 04 32 ̆ 014 10 (5) particles per cm(3), 2. 7 mg m(- 3) respirable particle mass, 320 (2) cm(- 3) active particle surface area, and 34 (arbitrary units) in photoelectric response. Passenger cabin fires were a greater potential source of exposure than engine compartment fires. The wind direction and the relative position of the fire crew to the stationary burning vehicle played a primary role in fire crews' potential for exposure. We recommend that firefighters wear self-contained breathing apparatus during all phases of the vehicle fire response to significantly reduce their potential for particulate, vapor, and gaseous exposures.
