40|$|There is an {{increasing}} body of Western literature lamenting the loss of spiritual relationships and connection with the Earth, and numerous studies of wilderness spirituality. But what is wilderness spirituality? Do expert perceptions differ from public views {{of the meaning of}} the term? This paper explores these questions. Despite spirituality being an abstract topic, and spiritual values hard to define and measure, numerous authors have suggested definitions of nature-based and wilderness spirituality. A content analysis of a random sample of the general population in a preliminary study in Tasmania on wilderness spirituality meanings was compared to definitions supplied by experts on the topic. Strong commonalities between the two groups were the citation of words expressing connection and interrelationship, portrayals of transcending the self, and the quality of compassion. Weak commonalties were terms such as ‘peace’ and ‘harmony’, ‘respect’, ‘joy’, ‘elation’, ‘happiness’, ‘sacredness’ and ‘reverence’. Disparate elements were found to be a sense of awe and wonder, religiosity, humbleness, and altered states of consciousness. The defining characteristics of wilderness spirituality were found to be a feeling of connection and interrelationship with other people and nature; a heightened sense of awareness and elevated consciousness beyond the everyday and corporeal world; and cognitive and affective dimensions of human understandings embracing <b>peace,</b> <b>tranquillity,</b> harmony, happiness, awe, wonder, and humility.

In a passage already quoted, he says that [...] "the soil where Rome sits is worthy beyond what men preach and admit," [...] that is, as the birthplace of the Empire. Both in the Convito and the De Monarchia he affirms that the course of Roman history was providentially guided from the first. Rome was founded in the same year that brought into the world David, ancestor of the Redeemer after the flesh. St. Augustine said that [...] "God showed in the most opulent and illustrious Empire of the Romans how much the civil virtues might avail even without true religion, that it might be understood how, this added, men became citizens of another city whose king is truth, whose law charity, and whose measure eternity." [...] Dante goes further than this. He makes the Romans as well as the Jews a chosen people, the one as founders of civil society, the other as depositaries of the true faith.[213] One side of Dante's mind was so practical and positive, and his pride in the Romans so intense,[214] that he sometimes seems to regard their mission as the higher of the two.

For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors.

The sick were removed from it; the dead were not buried there; armed ships and armed men laid aside their hostility to each other when they approached it. Belligerent fleets rode at anchor, side by side, in peace, upon the smooth waters of its little port, and an enchanting picture of <b>peace,</b> <b>tranquillity,</b> and happiness was seen upon its shores. A large natural fountain, or spring, thirty feet in diameter, and inclosed partly by natural rocks and partly by an artificial wall, issued from the ground in the center of the island, and sent forth a beautiful and fertilizing rill into a rich and happy valley, through which it meandered, deviously, for several miles, seeking the sea. There was a large and populous city near the port, and the whole island was adorned with temples, palaces, colonnades, and other splendid architectural structures, which made it the admiration of all mankind. All this magnificence and beauty have, however, long since passed away.
