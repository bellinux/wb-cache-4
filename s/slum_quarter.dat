50|$|Gwanak District is densely {{populated}} with over 500,000 people. While {{it was once}} a rural area dominated {{by the presence of}} Gwanaksan (Mt. Gwanak), population booms in the late 1950s and early 1960s, accompanied by rapid industrialization of the capital area, quickly changed the town into a mosaic of dense residential and industrial areas. Large <b>slum</b> <b>quarters</b> were formed by migrant populations from all over Korea who sought jobs in industrialized Seoul. A series of redevelopment projects from 1970's, and the relocation of Seoul National University to the district, led to a reduction of <b>slum</b> <b>quarters</b> and indigent textile industries and transformed the town into a residential uptown neighborhood of Seoul. The area is also heavily populated by university students from surrounding provinces.|$|R

5000|$|The leading exponents of {{this style}} of music in the 1970s are pianist Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand) and saxophonists the late Basil Coetzee and Robbie Jansen. These three, {{together}} with bassist Paul Michaels, drummer the late Monty Weber and sax man Morris Goldberg, recorded the seminal Cape Jazz song, [...] "Mannenberg". Composed by Brand/Ibrahim, the song {{takes its name from}} the notoriously crime-ridden creole working-class township on the Cape Flats of Cape Town. The township was one of several created by the apartheid regime following the clearing of the urban <b>slum</b> <b>quarter</b> known as District Six, home to many artists and musicians. Their US American contemporaries in the jazz field were taking on board rock and funk influences. Brand and his group were still being influenced by the more ethnic blues music.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the factors}} that contributed {{to the success of the}} Dragonlance setting when it was {{published}} in 1984 was a popular series of concurrent novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Gary Gygax, the developer of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, realized that novels set in Greyhawk could have a similar benefit for his recently published World of Greyhawk boxed set, so he wrote Saga of Old City, the first in a series of novels that would be published under the banner Greyhawk Adventures. The protagonist was Gord the Rogue, and this first novel told of his rise from the <b>Slum</b> <b>Quarter</b> of the city of Greyhawk to become world traveller and thief extraordinaire. The novel was designed to promote sales of the boxed set by providing colourful details about the social customs and peoples of various cities and countries in a region called the Flanaess.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} {{eighteen}} he commenced his studies for the priesthood in Aversa {{on the recommendation of}} Bishop Agostino Tommasi who had been impressed with his zeal and his devotion to religious life. He continued with his studies even {{after the death of his}} benefactor Tommasi in 1821 and was later clothed in the Franciscan habit for the first time in Grumo Nevano in 1822. He later spent his novitiate in Naples and made his religious profession on 27 November 1824. After the completion of both his theological and philosophical education he was ordained to the priesthood in Avrersa on 22 December 1827. He spent his time preaching and hearing confessions; he would spend long hours in this latter task. In 1839 he was sent to a <b>slum</b> <b>quarter</b> of Naples and spent the remainder of his life there catering to the needs of the poor and sick. Mazzarella was also a friend of Pope Pius IX and he was also a collaborator of Cardinal Sisto Riario Sforza - future Venerable - and King Ferdinand II.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the Dragonlance series of modules and books pushed aside the World of Greyhawk setting, as TSR {{concentrated}} on expanding and defining the world of Krynn. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to the {{success of the}} Dragonlance setting when it was published in 1984 was a series of concurrent novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis.

40|$|The {{problem of}} housing, in the world's large cities, is appalling. It's our first duty to realize it. Many of the comfortably housed have {{never even been}} through the <b>slum</b> <b>quarters</b> of their city. We must speak out, for public opinion is a {{powerful}} weapon, and each of us helps to create it. There are many organizations that need our active help, or, at the very least, our support. If we love our brothers, we shall always find a way, wherever we are, {{to do something for}} them. Suppose a brother or a sister is in rags with not enough food for the day, and one ofyou says, Good luck to you, keep yourselves warm, and have plenty to eat, but does nothing to supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? (James 2, 15 - 16). Lord, I can't sleep; I have got up out of bed to pray. It is night outside, and the wind blows and the rain falls, And the lights of the city, signs of the living, pierce the darkness. They bother me, Lord, these lights- why are you showing them tome...|$|R
50|$|In a {{small town}} in the south of France, Dr. Valerio is {{committed}} to caring for the poor. His young wife, Angela, cannot stand the place and wants to move to Nice, but the doctor does not want to leave before finding a replacement. Valerio is sympathetic to the working poor of the area, particularly Sandro, a farm worker who maintains the trees belonging to Gorzone, a rich industrialist and the primary employer in the town. Angela becomes ill and wanders the town's <b>slum</b> <b>quarters</b> in a delirium, ultimately leaving the town for a holiday without her husband. The Commissioner of Police takes Valerio to a mountain village in order to sign medical reports for a little girl who had been raped by her grandfather. There, Valerio meets Clara, a rich young widow. He considers a menage a trois, but is rebuffed. Meanwhile, Sandro is dismissed by Gorzone, forcing Sandro and his tubercular wife, Magda, to leave their home, a move that results in Magda's death. Distracted by grief, Sandro shoots Gorzone. Valerio hides Sandro from the police, a decision that results in Angela leaving the doctor for good. Sandro leaves Valerio's protection and, when cornered by the authorities, shoots himself. Valerio refuses to shake hands with the Commissioner, and the last scene shows Valerio and Clara walking away at night, arm in arm on the quayside, followed by some of Sandro's cronies.|$|R
40|$|Estudo realizado sobre as cláusulas gerais da função social da posse, no qual foi iniciado com um breve retrospecto acerca dos pensamentos jurídicos, notadamente o jusnaturalismo e o positivismo jurídico, para, então, analisar-se alguns aspectos da codificação jurídica e estabelecer-se uma conexão entre a Escola Exegética e o Código de Napoleão de 1804. Foi abordada a característica {{principal}} dessa escola que era a vinculação do juiz a letra da lei. As normas casuísticas vieram como decorrência deste tipo de interpretação, visto que o aplicador da lei não possui muita margem para interpretação. As cláusulas gerais solucionam esse problema, de maneira que elas remetem o magistrado a juízo de valores a fim de que o mesmo pondere em termos axiológicos sua análise sobre o caso. Foi esboçado a função social da posse, bem como a cláusula geral a ela atinente para, então, analisar-se dois casos jurisprudenciais: a venda de terras públicas aos ocupantes da bacia de São Bartolomeu no Distrito federal e o caso da favela do Pullman em São Paulo. Study {{carried through}} on the general clauses of the social function of the ownership, in which retrospect concerning the legal thoughts was initiated with a briefing, mainly the jusnaturalismo and the legal positivism, for, then, to analyze {{some aspects of the}} legal codification and to establish a connection between the Exegetics School and the Code of Napoleon of 1804. The main characteristic of this school was boarded that was the entailing of the judge the letter of the law. The casuistically norms had come as result of this type of interpretation, since the applicator of the law does not possess much edge for interpretation. The general clauses solve this problem, thus they send to the magistrate the judgment of values so that the same she ponders in values terms its analysis on the case. The social function of the ownership was sketched, as well as the general clause in respect for, then, analyzing two jurisprudences cases: the sales of public lands to the occupants of the river of Bartolomeu Saint in the Federal District and the case of the <b>slum</b> <b>quarter</b> of the Pullman in São Paulo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{landslides}} along hillsides have increased considerably, especially in under-developed countries. The gravitational movements of land masses are worsened {{due to the}} constructions of habitations on steep hillsides, and so altering the urban scenery. The general objective {{of this research is}} to carry through a study on the landslides of hillsides in the <b>slum</b> <b>quarters</b> Brtitador and Vila Santo Antonio located in Campos do Jordão-SP. Besides these two slums, Campos do Jordão has three other slums witch are believed to be in high risk areas: Vila Albertina, Monte Carlo and Cachoeirinha, around 1200 people reside in this five slums. Its understood that these slums are of Brazilian urbanization are areas of social space segregation, and representations of the outskirts of Brazilian cities. The Geographic awareness of the landslides along the hillsides in the city of Campos do Jordão was founded due to the search of human answers to the problem. The perceptive approach given in this research will not only contribute to the adoption of strategies which could be made by the city's public council, but also to the acknowledgement by the individuals who dwell in this slums in relation to the landslides which take place along these hillsides. This study get started due to the presupposition that the people living in these areas of risk, are vulnerable to landslides and put themselves to the mercy of luck, and not even the experience acquired in past landslides will free them from the exposition to tragedy that a new landslides can brig about...|$|R
50|$|Mumbai {{has been}} one of the centers of India's {{urbanization}} for 200 years. At the middle of the 19th century, after decades of urban growth under East India Company and British Raj, the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time. Most parts of Mumbai faced an acute shortage of housing and serious problems with the provision of water, sanitation and drainage. Residential areas were segregated in Mumbai between European and 'native' residential <b>quarters.</b> <b>Slums</b> were heavily concentrated in areas meant for 'native' Indian population, and it attracted no planning or London-like investment for quality of life of its inhabitants. Unsanitary conditions plagued Mumbai, particularly in the so-called Native Town, the segregated section where Indians lived. In 1869, as with 19th century epidemics in European slums, bubonic plague spread in Mumbai and then across most of India. The epidemic killed nearly 200,000 people in Mumbai and 8 million in India. In 1880s, concerned about epidemics, the British colonial government expelled polluting industries and many Indian residents of the Native Town, away from the peninsular part of the city, to a distant edge of the city in the north in the village of Koliwadas. Thus was born Dharavi.|$|R
