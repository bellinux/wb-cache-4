40|$|Abstract: <b>Self-synchronisation</b> {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} modern Command and Control (C 2), and occurs when {{networked}} military units achieve the degree of alignment of their activities needed to accomplish their mission by exchanging information with each other, rather than being given detailed orders from above. The basic principles of <b>self-synchronisation</b> can be studied using models, and here we examine {{the ability of the}} “boids ” of Reynolds (1987) to self-synchronise their velocity vectors within four-dimensional space. As in past work, the average distance D in the network was the best predictor of the time required for agents to self-synchronise. For the case D ≥ 3, 87 % of the variance in synchronisation time was predicted by the power law 16. 4 D 2. 23. For the case D < 3 (consisting of Erdős-Rényi random networks), the synchronisation time peaked for networks of average degree 12. This results from the fact that densely connected subnetworks facilitate local <b>self-synchronisation,</b> but hinder global local <b>self-synchronisation.</b> This was confirmed by experiments on three highly connected networks, which showed that additional links within clusters actually slowed down <b>self-synchronisation.</b> These results indicate that reducing the average distance in military communication networks is generally beneficial. However, within joint, combined, and coalition forces, improving the internal communications o...|$|E

Classes of situation requiring force-level synchronisation are described, separating the conventional top-down campaign “planned ” synchronisation, from the bottom-up mode of “self-synchronisation”. This leads us to describe a model of agent behaviour required for <b>self-synchronisation.</b> We follow this up by presenting a discrete event network model to help to quantify the benefit of network warfare synchronisation, and close by considering organisation and communication structures to support <b>self-synchronisation</b> in a large-scale coalition information environment. 1...|$|E
40|$|Much NCW {{literature}} expounds {{the benefits}} of <b>self-synchronisation,</b> but does not clearly delineate {{the circumstances in which}} self-synchronised planning is effective. We investigate this question using agent-based simulation. Since such investigation requires an objective assessment of plan quality, we have constructed an experiment in which agents attempt to solve three well-understood computational problems of increasing difficulty: the selection problem, the target assignment problem, and the “travelling general ” problem. We compare performance with a centralised organisational structure (where one “command ” agent constructs a plan for solving the problem, as in the construction of a Air Tasking Order) against a decentralised organisational structure (where agents self-synchronise by exchanging messages across a network). Specifically, we examine performance under varying levels of time pressure, and varying network quality. Analysis of the experimental results provides general guidelines as to when centralised command and control is most effective, and when <b>self-synchronisation</b> is a more appropriate alternative...|$|E

40|$|T-codes are variable-length codes (VLC) {{generated}} by an iterative construction algorithm known as T-augmentation. All T-codes possess strong self-synchronising properties {{by virtue of}} T-augmentation, which spreads synchronisation information throughout the code construction. A number of applications have been reported that reference the T-codes for their desirable properties. However, further theoretical development is needed to realise their full benefits. The authors highlight important applications of self-synchronising codes and survey reported research on the decoding process of T-codes. Building on previous work, the authors present a thorough treatment of this process. Understanding the decoding process provides insight into the <b>self-synchronisation</b> process of T-codes. It also leads to an efficient method of determining the average synchronisation delay associated with each T-code, which is important for practical applications...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a range of}} novel and improved results {{in the area of}} source coding with T-Codes, based on a thorough review of the recursive structure of the T-Codes. T-Codes were introduced by Mark Titchener in 1984. They are variable-length codes, similar to the well-known Huffman codes and may thus be used for compression by source coding. T-Codes have also been noted for their <b>self-synchronisation</b> properties, which result from their recursive construction. This thesis reviews and formalises the theory of generalised T-Codes and their recursive construction. It extends an existing recursive storage concept, the binary depletion codes, as the "T-depletion codes". These are shown to provide a unique fixed-length representation for T-Codes, which may be used in a recursive encoder/decoder scheme for T-Codes. It is shown that the T-depletion code format accommodates unique representations for all proper pre xes of T-Code codewords, thus covering the complete stat...|$|E
40|$|T-Codes are a {{class of}} variable-length codes. Their <b>self-synchronisation</b> {{properties}} are useful in compression and communication applications where error recovery rather than error correction is at issue, for example, in digital telephony. T-Codes may be used without error correction or additional synchronisation mechanisms. Typically, the representation of variable-length codes {{is a problem in}} computers based on a fixed-length word architecture. This presents a problem in encoder and decoder applications. The present paper introduces a fixed-length format for storing and handling variable-length T-Code codewords, the T-depletion codewords, which are derived from the recursive construction of the T-Code codewords. The paper further proposes an algorithm for the conversion of T-Code codewords into T-depletion codewords that may be used as a decoder for generalized T-Codes. As well as representing all codewords of a T-Code set (the leaf nodes in the set's decoding tree), the T-depletion co [...] ...|$|E
40|$|First {{proposed}} in 1984, T-codes are {{a class of}} variable-length codes that exhibit exceptional tendency towards <b>self-synchronisation.</b> A number of industrial applications have been reported, ranging from moving-picture images to boundary markers. A number of {{attempts have been made}} to quantify the synchronisation performance of different T-codes. The first complete analytical method for calculating average synchronisation delays of T-codes was published in 1996 and refined in 1998. However, the computational efficiency of that algorithm is not optimal, notably when suffix conditions are encountered during the decoding process. The authors present a significant improvement on that algorithm. With the new method, computational efficiency is improved by reducing the average time required per code set. It produces average synchronisation delay values in less than one quarter of the time required by the original method to generate comparable results. Consequently, higher-degree code sets, which have wide-ranging practical applications, can have their sync performance analysed and compared...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{synchronisation}} {{properties of the}} Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators on a general network. Here we distinguish the ability of such a system to self-synchronise from the stability of this behaviour. While <b>self-synchronisation</b> {{is a consequence of}} genuine non-perturbative dynamics, the stability in dynamical systems is usually accessible by fluctuations about a fixed point, here taken to be the synchronised solution. We examine this problem in terms of modes of the graph Laplacian, by which the absolute Lyapunov stability of the synchronised fixed point is readily demonstrated. Departures from stability are seen to arise at the next order in fluctuations where the dynamical equations resemble those for species population models, the logistic and Lotka-Volterra equations. Methods from these systems are exploited to analytically derive new critical couplings signalling deviation from classical stability. We observe in some cases an intermediate regime of behaviour, between incoherence and synchronisation, where system wide periodic behaviours are exhibited. We discuss these results in light of simulations. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how Bayesian {{networks}} {{can be used}} to develop automated situation-assessment tools suitable for use as decision aids in a command and control system. Inevitably, the introduction of a new technology raises a number of validation, systems integration and human-factors questions. Those issues pertinent to Bayesian network decision aids are identified and their implications discussed. We then describe in detail the implementation of such a system capable of providing Combat-ID and Threat Assessment advisories in the naval anti-air warfare role and its assessment within a realistic (synthetic) human-in-the-loop experiment. We discuss the experimental system, the experimental design and protocol and the experimental results. In a controlled experiment using 14 subjects with relevant military experience we found that the Bayes ’ net decision aid system was preferred by the majority of the experimental subjects and led to a number of operator performance improvements which could directly contribute to improved operational effectiveness.

40|$|Broadband (multiline frequency) light combs {{present a}} wealth of applications, ranging from meteorology, sensing and {{measurements}} to those potentially {{in the domain of}} attosecond science. We report here on detailed investigations of, what we believe is, a novel Raman self-synchronous process that is accompanied by extreme enhancement of the bandwidth of the generated light frequencies. Over the last decade, there have been several reports of cavity contexts where efficient broadband multiline generation is possible. These contexts include spherical micro-cavities [1], monolithic microresonators [2] and so-called ‘bottle microresonators’ [3], in which the cavity quality to mode volume ratio (Q / V) plays a dominant role in the characteristics of the device and its constituent whispering gallery modes. Typically, maximum quality and low volume lead to the optimal condition of high Q / V. To illustrate distinctiveness from these well-known contexts, we highlight where bandwidth generation has local optimisation in either: low-Q resonators (with very moderate reflectivities), or; larger volume cavities (e. g. with longer cavity lengths). For example, such cavity-enhanced bandwidth regimes may result in 100 's of generated frequencies; maximum bandwidths of only up to 30 to 50 frequencies arise in the corresponding non-cavity contexts. We will summarise results from an exhaustive exploration of this new effect (in terms of cavity parameters) and compare these results with semi-analytical models that we have developed to lend insight into the origins of this bandwidth enhancement and its correspondence with <b>self-synchronisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of an {{offshore wind power}} network connected through a high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission line is a critical problem {{since there is no}} direct connection to a strong ac collection (ACC) bus. Field experience has shown that sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) and harmonic resonance can occur between the wind farms and the HVDC systems. The oscillations can appear in the presence of background harmonics and is arguably resulting from the controller interaction of the Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) converter controller and the HVDC converter controller. The design of the synchronization unit (Phase-Locked-Loop) has shown to have a significant impact in achieving satisfactory performance. However, both slow and very fast synchronization units could directly affect the control performance and degrade the system stability. This paper proposes a controller design without a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) for the WECS grid-side converter which does not have a dedicated synchronization unit (PLL) in the controller. This controller is implemented on the WECS converters of the ACC side to synchronize them to the Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) -based HVDC system. A detailed analysis is presented and the results are compared with the widely used decouple dq-frame control structure. The impedance frequency responses for both the dq-frame control and the synchronverter-based control are presented to show a comparison of the system performance. Time domain simulation results are presented to show how the <b>self-synchronisation</b> impacts on the system performance compared to the classical dq-frame control solution...|$|E
40|$|Local field {{potentials}} in {{the hippocampus}} {{are dominated by}} two different activity patterns - persistent gamma band (30 - 60 Hz) oscillations and intermittent sharp wave-ripple (200 Hz) complexes. The former are associated with exploratory behaviours in which information is acquired while the latter {{are believed to be}} involved in transfer and consolidation of information to long-term memory. Although there is a great wealth of knowledge about how neuronal networks maintain each oscillatory state, it is not entirely clear what cellular mechanisms mediate the switch between gamma to sharp wave-ripple activity. 	The goal of this thesis was to characterise this transition at the network and synaptic level. To this end, an in vitro model based on acute hippocampal slices was established in which both gamma rhythms and sharp wave-ripples could be evoked. This was achieved with a custom-built holographic illumination system granting targeted and selective optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal cells. Prolonged stimulation of the reduced hippocampal slice network elicited <b>self-synchronisation</b> to a gamma rhythm (50 Hz) with a resonance at theta frequency inputs (i. e. 4 - 5 Hz sinusoidal stimulation). This frequency preference was confirmed at the single unit level which revealed most precise coordination of single cell activity within the ongoing gamma rhythm at theta frequency inputs. Additionally, evoked gamma synchronisation emerged suddenly 200 ms after stimulus onset indicating a near instantaneous switch of hippocampal network states. This finding was reflected in whole-cell recordings of postsynaptic currents which displayed a sharp increase in both excitatory and inhibitory inputs around 200 - 300 ms after stimulus onset. On the other hand, applying short (5 ms) square pulses of low intensity stimulation evoked local field potential signatures closely resembling sharp wave-ripples. This implies that stimulus duration and profile are critical determinants of network output. 	The results presented here provide experimental evidence for prevailing models of different hippocampal network oscillations and extend the knowledge about how neuronal networks can maintain different oscillatory states and how the transition between these states is brought about...|$|E

40|$|Military {{command and}} control is not merely evolving, it is co-evolving. Technology is {{creating}} new opportunities for different types of {{command and control}}, and new types of command and control are creating new aspirations for technology. The {{question is how to}} manage this process, how to achieve a jointly optimised blend of socio and technical and create the kind of agility and <b>self-synchronisation</b> that modern forms of command and control promise. The answer put forward in this book is to re-visit sociotechnical systems theory. In doing so, the problems of 21 st century command and control can be approached from an alternative, multi-disciplinary and above all human-centred perspective. Human factors (HF) is also co-evolving. The traditional conception of the field is to serve as a conduit for knowledge between engineering and psychology yet 21 st century command and control presents an altogether different challenge. Viewing military command and control through the lens of sociotechnical theory forces us to confront difficult questions about the non-linear nature of people and technology: technology is changing, from platform centric to network centric; the interaction with that technology is changing, from prescribed to exploratory; and complexity is increasing, from behaviour that is linear to that which is emergent. The various chapters look at this transition and draw out ways in which sociotechnical systems theory can help to understand it. The sociotechnical perspective reveals itself as part of a conceptual toolkit through which military command and control can be transitioned, from notions of bureaucratic, hierarchical ways of operating to the devolved, agile, self-synchronising behaviour promised by modern forms of command and control like Network Enabled Capability (NEC). Sociotechnical system theory brings with it a sixty year legacy of practical application and this real-world grounding in business process re-engineering underlies the entire book. An attempt has been made to bring a set of sometimes abstract (but no less useful) principles down to the level of easy examples, design principles, evaluation criteria and actionable models. All of these are based on an extensive review of {{the current state of the}} art, new sociotechnical/NEC studies conducted by the authors, and insights derived from field studies of real-life command and control. Time and again, what emerges is a realisation that the most agile, self-synchronising component of all in command and control settings is the huma...|$|E
