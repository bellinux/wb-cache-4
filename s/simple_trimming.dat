40|$|Abstract: Innovative {{developments}} of hollow cellular mat for lightweight structure must satisfy sustainability, {{fit for purpose}} and optimize design concepts. However, such materials necessitate appropriate cutting technology to allow trimming and shaping operations to be easily carried out on an excessive porous and perhaps non uniformity nature. This paper presents a work that aims at studying the machinability of porous cellular mat using a newly innovative cutting technology. A large size of vertical bandsaw system was fabricated to cut the product {{with the size of}} 1 m (width) x 1 m (height) x 1 m (long). The system was also equipped with a feeding table and strong structure frame to avoid product shifting during the cutting operation. The surface integrity showed minimum deformation with uniformed direction of surface removal marks. The cutting technology developed in this study is suitable for the hollow cellular mat for its <b>simple</b> <b>trimming</b> and shaping process and fine surface profile...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a general-purpose method for computing radiosity on scenes made of parametric surfaces with arbitrary trimming curves. By contrast with past approaches {{that require a}} tessellation of the input surfaces (be it made up of triangles or patches with <b>simple</b> <b>trimming</b> curves) or some form of geometric approximation, our method takes fully advantage {{of the rich and}} compact mathematical representation of objects. At its core lies the virtual mesh, an abstraction of the input geometry that allows complex shapes to be illuminated as if they were simple primitives. The virtual mesh is a collection of normalized square domains to which the input surfaces are mapped while preserving their energy properties. Radiosity values are then computed on these supports before being lifted back to the original surfaces. To demonstrate the power of our method, we describe a high-order wavelet radiosity implementation that uses the virtual mesh. Examples of objects and environments, designed for interactive applications or virtual reality, are presented. They prove that, by exactly integrating curved surfaces in the resolution process, the virtual mesh allows complex scenes to be rendered more quickly, more accurately and much more naturally than with previously known methods...|$|E

40|$|The input {{impedance}} of UHF {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) inlay tags is analyzed when a thin material slab is placed between the antenna and a metal surface. The two-layer slab is made of a thin magneto-dielectric Emerson&Cuming Eccosorb MCS-U layer with high permeability/permittivity and a thin RohacellTM layer. Two common commercial UHF tag antennas are considered: the Alien ALN- 9640 SquiggleVR and the ALN- 9654 G inlays. The antenna impedance is evaluated both numerically and experimentally, and the power transmission coefficient is calculated in the whole UHF RFID frequency band. It is shown that a tag nonintrinsically suitable for onmetal applications (e. g. inlay tags) {{can be used on}} a conductive surface in a low-profile configuration. Indeed, when the above magnetic substrate is used, the antenna {{input impedance}} rises up from the very low values induced by the presence of a near conducting surface. Then, with a <b>simple</b> <b>trimming</b> applied to the antenna layout, it is possible to tune the antenna to achieve a conjugate impedance matching with the chip impedance. It is demonstrated how an effective tuning is possible through some simple straight cuts of some antenna parts, without requiring a redesign of a new optimized tag antenna...|$|E
