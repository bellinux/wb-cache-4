50|$|At the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (1959-1965) in La Jolla, CA, {{the need}} for {{mechanical}} services (air ducts, pipes, etc.) was so extensive that Kahn decided to create a separate <b>service</b> <b>floor</b> for them above each laboratory floor {{to make it easier}} to reconfigure individual laboratories in the future without disrupting neighboring spaces. He also designed each laboratory floor to be entirely free of internal support columns, making laboratory configuration easier. Komendant engineered the Vierendeel trusses that make this arrangement possible. These pre-stressed concrete trusses are about 62 ft long, spanning the full width of each floor and extending from the bottom of each <b>service</b> <b>floor</b> to the top. They are supported by steel cables embedded in the concrete in a curve similar to that of cables supporting a suspension bridge. Their rectangular openings, which are 6 ft high in the center and 5 ft at the ends, allow maintenance workers to move easily through the thicket of pipes and ducts on the service floors. The trusses impose strictly vertical loads on their support columns, to which they are attached not rigidly but with a system of slip plates and tension cables to permit small movements during moderate earthquakes.|$|E

In addition, a 300 kilowatt diesel engine located in the tower itself can provide a secondary source of emergency power.

In the novel, the famed myth of Siegel's creation of the Flamingo was utilized {{as a basis for}} the overall supernatural plot of the novel (rather than the true historic account of his acquiring it from the original founder). The Flamingo is supposedly founded on Siegel's mythical/mystical paranoia of being pursued and killed for his Archetypal position as the [...] "King of the West," [...] known mythologically as [...] "Fisher King." [...] Supposedly the Flamingo itself {{was meant to be a}} real-life personification of [...] "The Tower" [...] card amongst the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck, literally [...] "the King's Castle in the Wasteland." [...] In the book, it is believed Siegel kept in the Flamingo hotel's penthouse a deck of the fictional Lombardy Zeroth Tarot deck. Siegel's penthouse and office floor was reported to have, as referenced in the novel, a secret escape-hatch complete with ladder. The hatch allegedly led to a <b>service</b> <b>floor</b> where a car was always readied for his getaway in the event of being attacked in his chambers.

50|$|During the 16th century, Funchal was an {{important}} stop-over for caravels travelling between the Indies and the New World.The wine culture appeared during early settlement, through the incentives from Henry the Navigator. By 1455, the Venetian navigator, Luís de Cadamosto, on visiting Madeira, referred to the excellence of the Madeirense wines, principally the Malvasia castes from the island of Crete, which were being exported in greater numbers. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, the celebrated English poet and playwright, William Shakespeare, cited the important export and notoriety of the Madeiran Malvasia castes: in Richard III the Duke of Clarence, the brother of King Edward IV selected a death by drowning in a barrel of Madeira. Later, in Shakespeare's Henry IV he has Poins censure Falstaff for having sold his soul to the devil for a cup of Madeira wine. The growth of viticulture in Madeira expanded when the sugar industry was attacked by cheaper exports from the New World and Africa, but also from various epidemics and the after-effects of the 1566 privateer sacks. In the 17th century, commercial treaties with England brought increased investments to a business that was still insular. Many commercial wine-makers from England moved to the island, establishing a change in the commerce, the economy, the architectural morphology and the lifestyle of the community. This incremental growth expanded the city with new estates, and a new merchant class that populated the urban quarters. Generally, there were many new three-floor homes with an intermediary <b>service</b> <b>floor,</b> a floor for storage and wine-cellars, and in some cases a tower to watch the port and monitor shipping in the harbour. Various island governors and the convents participated in commercial viticulture. The Companhia de Jesus developed the vast estate of Campanário, which extended from the city to Fajã dos Padres {{into one of the most}} successful wines on the island, whereas the nuns of Santa Clara, owners of some large parcels of land, entered into the wine industry, financing the ships that would take their wines to Brazil (and exchanging them for sugar for their sweets business). But, during the 19th century there were epidemics, aggravating the economy and forcing some to return to sugar plantations. In order to maintain the level of development, many landowners tried to plant new more-resistant castes, but of an inferior quality, in order to support the industry.|$|E
