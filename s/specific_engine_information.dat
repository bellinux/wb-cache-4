40|$|Modern {{search engines}} like Google support domain-independent search over the vast {{information}} contained in web documents. However domain-specific information access, such as finding less well-known people, locations, and events are not performed efficiently without users developing sophisticated query strategies. This thesis describes the design and development of an application to support one such domain-specific information activity: for insurance (and related) companies to identify weather and natural disaster damage to better assess when and where personnel will be needed. The approach presented to supporting such activity combines information extraction with an interactive presentation of results. Previous domain <b>specific</b> search <b>engines</b> extract <b>information</b> about papers, people, and course information using rule-based or learningbased techniques. However they use the results of information extraction in a typical query and list of results interface. They fail to address the need for interaction based on the extracted document features. The domain specific web-based search application developed in this project combines information extraction with the interactive display of results to facilitate rapid information location. A heuristic evaluation was performed {{to determine whether the}} application met the design goals and to improve the design. Thus the final application has an unconventional but interactive presentation of the results with the use of tree based display. The application also allows options for user specific results caching and modification of the search and caching process. With a heuristic based search process it extracts information about place, date and damages regarding a specific disaster using a bank of search heuristics developed...|$|R

40|$|Domain <b>specific</b> search <b>engines</b> have pleased many Internet {{users and}} have been keeping some {{companies}} alive. Lately, universities and some non-IT companies have been adapting to this technology. These organizations very often allocate {{small amount of money}} and small number of computers to search engine projects. The YASE!

This paper reports the challenges and possible solutions of building a search engine in an environment with extremely limited computation power. 1. Introduction Some domain <b>specific</b> search <b>engines</b> have been shinning on the Internet. For instance, CNET. com [3] is a search engine on computer domain, the University of Pennsylvania provides its search engine on the University main page [12] and Lycos supports MP 3 search [7]. Generally speaking, there is an increase trend that organizations host a search engine for their sites. However, very often, doing such search eng [...] ...|$|R
