5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the <b>settler</b> grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a <b>settler,</b> and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E

50|$|Written {{sources say}} some <b>settlers</b> took land freely, others bought lands from earlier <b>settlers,</b> some were gifted land by earlier <b>settlers,</b> {{and that some}} <b>settlers</b> took lands from others {{through the use of}} force or threat of force. Lands were likely not rented during the Age of settlement. Medievalist Hans Kuhn argued that lands were given away or taken freely because earlier <b>settlers</b> had no need for such {{extensive}} lands. Historian Gunnar Karlsson notes that it could be rational for earlier <b>settlers</b> to encourage new <b>settlers</b> to settle lands nearby so as to ease maintenance of cattle and slaves, and as insurance in times of crisis.|$|R

5|$|Political {{boundaries}} {{drawn by}} the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding <b>settler</b> populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white <b>settler</b> populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white <b>settler</b> minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark {{in the form of}} divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of Indians emigrating {{to other parts of the}} empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies.|$|E

In both The <b>Settlers</b> and The <b>Settlers</b> II, <b>settlers</b> automatically emerged from the player's headquarters as required.
