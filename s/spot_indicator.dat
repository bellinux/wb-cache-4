Secondly, to identify the opportunities that could potentially improve the inspections and maintenance processes, being the satellite-based monitoring, using radar imagery, recognized as viable source of independent information products that may be used to remotely monitor the health of these specific man-made structures. By applying Multi-temporal InSAR processing techniques to a series of radar images over the same region, it is possible to detect vertical movements of structure systems {{on the ground in the}} millimeter range, and therefore, identify abnormal or excessive movement indicating potential problems requiring detailed ground investigation.

One of features of a condition of gathering of the information for such decision is the impossibility of reception the big statistical samples. Therefore development and research of optimum algorithms of distinction of the casual signals characterized by samples of limited volume, in conditions of parametrical aprioristic uncertainty are necessary. At present time there are many methods of recognition which are caused appreciably by variety of statements of concrete tasks. The feature of remote measurements is information acquisition, when the data of measurements, acquired during tracing of flying system along routes of survey, are directed to input of the processing system.

40|$|Introduction: Few {{studies have}} {{explored}} associations of long-term air pollution exposure with the prevalence and incidence of hypertension, or the joint relationships of neighborhood walkability, individual walking behavior, and social disadvantage. Methods: Air pollution, hypertension, walkability, walking, and covariate data were assessed for > 6, 000 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) between 2000 and 2007. These participants resided in six {{communities in the}} U. S and were aged 45 to 84 and without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. Particulate and gaseous air pollution levels (PM 2. 5, PM 10 - 2. 5, NOx) from MESA-generated spatio-temporal models and walkability from the Walk Score Research Services were estimated at participant homes {{as well as on}} the census block group level. Census block groups in the six communities having low air pollution and high walk score levels, and the reverse, were classified as “sweet spot” and “sour spot”, respectively. Population characteristics, including percent racial minority, low education level, and below poverty line at the census block group scale were collected from the American Community Survey. Logistic and Cox regressions were used to assess associations between air pollution and prevalent and incident of hypertension. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate associations between 1) population characteristics with the sweet/sour <b>spot</b> <b>indicators,</b> and 2) individual walking activity, neighborhood air pollution and walk score. Results: Long-term exposure to ambient PM 2. 5, NOx, PM 10 - 2. 5, and its composite chemicals were not associated with hypertension onset or prevalence at baseline. Geographical distributions of sweet- and sour-spot neighborhoods differed among the six communities. Socially deprived neighborhoods with lower education level populations were less likely to be sweet-spots. Finally, lower ambient PM 2. 5 levels were associated with more walking for leisure whereas higher walk scores were associated with more walking for transport. Conclusions: Long-term exposures to PM 2. 5, PM 10 - 2. 5 or NOx were not a main contributor to hypertension development in the MESA population, but in some communities, air pollution levels and walkability were associated with personal walking behavior. Socio-economic disadvantage in some communities was linked to higher likelihood of living in a more polluted and less walkable area, potentially contributing to health disparities...|$|R

It is crucial to develop analytical systems {{that allow us to}} follow the increase in oceanic pCO 2 and corresponding reduction in pH. Miniaturised sensor systems using immobilised fluorescence <b>indicator</b> <b>spots</b> are attractive for this purpose because of their simple design and low power requirements.

We present a detailed method on the use of immobilised fluorescence <b>indicator</b> <b>spots</b> to determine pH in ocean waters across the pH range 7. 6 – 8. 2. We characterised temperature (− 0. 046 pH/°C from 5 to 25 °C) and salinity dependences (− 0. 01 pH/psu over 5 – 35), and performed a preliminary investigation into the influence of chlorophyll on the pH measurement. The apparent pKa of the sensor spots was 6. 93 at 20 °C. A drift of 0. 00014 R (ca. 0. 0004 pH, at 25 °C, salinity 35) was observed over a 3 day period in a laboratory based drift experiment. We achieved a precision of 0. 0074 pH units, and observed a drift of 0. 06 pH units during a test deployment of 5 week duration in the Southern Ocean as an underway surface ocean sensor, which was corrected for using certified reference materials. The temperature and salinity dependences were accounted for with the algorithm, R= 0. 00034 − 0. 17 ·pH+ 0. 15 ·S 2 + 0. 0067 ·T− 0. 0084 ·S· 1. 075 R= 0. 00034 − 0. 17 ·pH+ 0. 15 ·S 2 + 0. 0067 ·T− 0. 0084 ·S· 1. 075. This study provides a first step towards a pH optode system suitable for autonomous deployment.

40|$|Natural {{olfaction}} {{suggests that}} numerous replicas of small sensors can achieve large sensitivity. This concept of sensor redundancy can be exploited {{by use of}} optical chemical sensors whose use of image sensors enables the simultaneous measurement of several spatially distributed indicators. Digital image sensors split the framed scene into {{hundreds of thousands of}} pixels each corresponding to a portion of the sensing layer. The signal from each pixel can be regarded as an independent sensor, which leads to a highly redundant sensor array. Such redundancy can eventually be exploited to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we report an algorithm for reduction of the noise of pixel signals. For this purpose, the algorithm processes the output of groups of pixels whose signals share the same time behavior, as is the case for signals related to the same indicator. To define these groups of pixels, unsupervised clustering, based on classification of the indicator colors, is proposed here. This approach to signal processing is tested in experiments on the chemical sensitivity of replicas of eight <b>indicators</b> <b>spotted</b> on to a plastic substrate. Results show that the groups of pixels can be defined independently of the geometrical arrangement of the sensing spots, and substantial improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is obtained, enabling the detection of volatile compounds at any location on the distributed sensing layer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLIM kinases (LIMK), {{including}} LIMK 1 and LIMK 2, {{are unique}} LIM-family proteins containing a catalytic (kinase) domain. These kinases phosphorylate an actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, {{involved in the}} regulation of actin-filament dynamics. An unanswered question is the in vivo function of LIMK and how they contribute to development. When we cloned Xenopus homologues of mammalian LIMK, Xlimk 1 and Xlimk 2, we found that their mRNA and products were abundantly expressed in oocytes. In addition, we obtained evidence for the functional involvement of Xlimk 1 / 2 during oocyte maturation. The microinjection of Xlimk 1 / 2 mRNA into progesterone-treated oocytes significantly inhibited {{the appearance of a}} white maturation <b>spot</b> (WMS), an <b>indicator</b> of entry into meiosis. In oocytes lacking a WMS, the organization and/or migration of the microtubule-derived precursor of the meiotic spindle was predominantly affected. We also found that the ectopic expression of Xlimk 1 / 2 clearly prevented dephosphorylation (activation) of Xenopus cofilin (XAC) during oocyte maturation. Furthermore, co-injection of Xlimk 1 / 2 with the constitutively active type of XAC overcame the inhibitory effects by Xlimk 1 / 2, suggesting that XLIMK-induced abnormality in oocyte maturation was mediated by XAC inactivation. Based on these findings, we propose that XLIMK is a putative regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements during oocyte maturation, and the interaction between XLIMK activity and microtubule dynamics seems highly likely...|$|R

Dependent variables included three measures of child health: (i) C-reactive protein, assayed in whole-blood <b>spots</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of immunostimulation; (ii) skinfold thickness, to estimate subcutaneous fat stores necessary to fuel growth and immune function; and (iii) height-for-age, to assess growth stunting. Each child health measure was associated with maternal ethnobotanical knowledge, independent {{of a wide range of}} potentially confounding variables. Each standard deviation of maternal ethnobotanical knowledge increased the likelihood of good child health by a factor of > 1. 5. Like many populations around the world, the Tsimane' are increasingly facing the challenges and opportunities of globalization. These results underscore the importance of local cultural factors to child health and document a potential cost if ethnobotanical knowledge is lost...|$|R
40|$|Two {{bacteriocin}} typing methods, {{based on}} bacteriocin production and bacteriocin sensitivity, {{were developed to}} aid in the separation of strains of Proteus mirabilis. One hundred sixty-two isolates of P. mirabilis and 10 Cradock-Watson bacteriocin producers were grown inproteose peptone no. 3 broth and induced with mitomycin C under culture conditions found optimum for bacteriocin production. Crude bacteriocin lysates were <b>spotted</b> on 186 <b>indicator</b> strains, and after incubation for 18 h at 35 °C, positive zones of inhibition were recorded. A cluster analysis computer program was used to select 16 bacteriocin-producing and 16 indicator strains for inclusion in two bacteriocin typing sets. One hundred clinical isolates of P. mirabilis were differentiated by bacteriocin sensitivity into 41 distinct patterns, with 72 % of the strains typable, whereas typing by bacteriocin production demonstrated 29 separate lysis patterns among the 80 % typable strains. Combining the results of each typing method resulted in 72 individual bacteriocin production-sensitivity patterns and 91 % of the isolates typed. Typing 14 epidemic strains by bacteriocin production revealed that 13 of 14 strains were identical, whereas only 2 of 14 strains were typable by bacteriocin sensitivity. Electron microscopy of partially purified bacteriocin revealed tail components of contractile bacteriophages. Standard bacteriocin lysates were destroyed by boiling for 1 h. In addition, all bacteriocin lysates tested were resistant to trypsin. The use of our bacteriocin production typing method against the presently selected 16 standard indicator strains is recommended for the investigation of any cases of suspected P. mirabilis cross-infections within hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The Hot Spot Analysis {{developed}} by the Wuppertal Institute is a screening tool focussing on the demand of reliable sustainability-oriented decision-making processes in complex value chains identifying high priority areas ("hot spots") for effective measures in companies. This paper aims to focus on this tool. Design/methodology/approach - The Hot Spot Analysis is a qualitative method following a cradle-to-cradle approach. With the examples of coffee and cream cheese hot <b>spots</b> of sustainability <b>indicators</b> throughout the entire life cycle are identified and evaluated with data from literature reviews and expert consultations or stakeholder statements. This paper focuses on the indicator resource efficiency {{as an example of}} how the methodology works. Findings - The identified hot spots for coffee are the raw material procurement phase in terms of abiotic material, water and energy consumption, the production phase concerning biotic material and the energy consumption in the use phase. For cream cheese relevant hot spots appear in the raw material procurement phase in terms of biotic materials and water as well as biotic materials and energy consumption during the production phase. Research limitations/implications - Life cycle analyses connected to indicators like resource efficiency need to be applied as consequent steps of a Hot Spot Analysis if a deeper level of analysis is eventually aimed at which is more cost and time intensive in the short term. The Hot Spot Analysis can be combined with other sustainability management instruments. Practical implications - Research and management can be directed to hot spots of sustainability potential quickly which pays off in the long term. Originality/value - The paper shows that companies can address sustainability potentials relatively cost moderately...|$|R
