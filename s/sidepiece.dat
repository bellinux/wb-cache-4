50|$|A romantic {{dinner at}} a luxurious mansion is ruined faster than a <b>sidepiece</b> who won’t stop calling her boyfriend's phone. So, Estelle gets {{fed up with the}} games and takes action. While giving a series of looks and a few {{intimate}} shots, Estelle searches for the strength to move on and move out. But she may have just been looking for the perfect outfit because she leaves her man high and dry while wearing a fur coat and slides him a message that keeps him thinking on her way out.|$|E
5000|$|The term shank is {{generally}} used interchangeably {{with the term}} [...] "cheek" [...] to describe the entire <b>sidepiece</b> of the bit, but shank also may refer just to the lever arm, {{the portion of the}} bit that extends from the mouthpiece to the rein ring. The purchase of the bit is the upper portion of the cheek that extends from the mouthpiece to the headstall rings. All shanks have a rein ring at the bottom for the curb rein and a cheek ring at the top to attach the headstall. Some shanks may also add rings or slots to attach a snaffle rein at the mouthpiece, allowing the bit to be used with two sets of reins, making it a pelham bit.|$|E
5000|$|Carriages may be {{enclosed}} or open, {{depending on}} the type. [...] The top cover for {{the body of a}} carriage, called the head or hood, is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a bellows top or calash. A hoopstick forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an imperial. A closed carriage may have side windows called quarter lights (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a [...] "glass coach". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a dashboard intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting <b>sidepiece</b> called a wing (British). A foot iron or footplate may serve as a carriage step.|$|E
50|$|Three point road graders can {{be viewed}} as a {{specific}} type of box blade, and are used to grade and maintain dirt and gravel roads. They usually have 2 parallel angled cutting edges, and long, low <b>sidepieces.</b> Manufacturers include Dura-Grader, Road Boss,and RoadRunner.|$|R
5000|$|Model 120 (1953) {{the plywood}} <b>sidepieces</b> were {{replaced}} with perforated three dimensionally turned plywood. The two extreme structural crosspieces {{on the front}} edge of the seat and the top of the back were removed and replaced by glued strips. The armrests were made of bent wood.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the curved}} <b>sidepieces</b> are set in the {{crosspiece}}s {{at the edges of}} the seat and the back panels; in this way the use of visible wood screws is avoided at the front of the chair. The crosspiece on the seat contributes to the chair’s greater comfort.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to quantitatively analyze medical knowledge of, and experience with, decision-making in preoperative virtual planning of mandibular reconstruction. Three shape descriptors were designed to evaluate local differences between reconstructed mandibles and patients' original mandibles. We targeted an asymmetrical, wide range of cutting areas including the mandibular <b>sidepiece,</b> and defined a unique three-dimensional coordinate system for each mandibular image. The generalized algorithms for computing the shape descriptors were integrated into interactive planning software, where the user can refine the preoperative plan using the spatial map of the local shape distance as a visual guide. A retrospective {{study was conducted with}} two oral surgeons and two dental technicians using the developed software. The obtained 120 reconstruction plans show that the participants preferred a moderate shape distance rather than optimization to the smallest. We observed that a visually plausible shape could be obtained when considering specific anatomical features (e. g., mental foramen. mandibular midline). The proposed descriptors can be used to multilaterally evaluate reconstruction plans and systematically learn surgical procedures...|$|E
25|$|The fixed village loom is used {{mainly in}} Iran and {{consists}} of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two <b>sidepieces.</b> The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} form of loom is a horizontal; {{one that}} can be staked to the ground or supported by <b>sidepieces</b> on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.|$|R

5000|$|All bits {{act with}} some {{combination}} of pressure and leverage, often in conjunction with pressure applied by {{other parts of the}} bridle such as the curb chain on the chin, noseband on the jaw and face, or pressure on the poll from the headstall. [...] Particular mouthpieces do not define the type of bit. It is the <b>sidepieces</b> and the leverage these rings or shanks use to act on a horse's mouth that determines whether a bit is in the curb or snaffle family, and has a great impact on the severity of the mouthpiece.|$|R
50|$|From their inception, {{eyeglasses}} posed {{a dilemma}} that wasn't solved for almost 350 years: {{how to keep}} them {{on the bridge of}} the nose without falling. Spanish spectacle makers of the 17th century experimented with ribbons of silk that could be attached to the frames and then looped over the ears. Spanish and Italian missionaries carried the new models to spectacle wearers in China. The Chinese attached little ceramic or metal weights to the strings instead of making loops. In 1730 a London optician named Edward Scarlett perfected the use of rigid <b>sidepieces</b> that rested atop the ears. This perfection rapidly spread across the continent.In 1752 James Ayscough publicized his latest invention, spectacles with double hinged side pieces. These became very popular and appear more often than any other kind in paintings and prints of the period. Lenses were fabricated of tinted glass as well as clear. Ayscough felt that the clear glass lenses gave an unpleasant glare. In Spain in 1763 Pablo Minguet recommended turquoise, green, or yellow lenses but not amber or red.|$|R
40|$|International audienceShape {{does not}} induce function. That {{is what this}} paper first tries to demonstrate. Affordances must be {{perceived}} to link a structure to a function, to make an object look like what it is designed for. It takes palaeontologists the understanding of a hybrid socio-technical context to interpret the structure of an artefact. A brief backward look at historical simple optical systems bears it out: structure must be replaced in a larger network to understand why it is like it is, why rivet spectacles had no <b>sidepieces.</b> Then if function has a systemic nature, if {{it has never been}} inscribed on shape, but on the sociotechnical context of objects, it necessary has implications for design. Recommended methods as value analysis involve socio-technical networks in function identification; they follow designers in building a compulsory and forecasted set of connections to surrounding actants, embodying concepts in unspoken scripts of use. Still, what this paper illustrates is the enormous significance given to those implicit and hardly discussed representations. Mentioning the case of axiomatic design, it is shown how then functions are translated into functional requirements, distinct design parameters, and independent teams: unspoken scripts are behind product's and organisation's structures, behind 'indisputable' dominant designs. Moreover, original 'big pictures of use' fade out during the breakdown, creating numerous short-sighted (and still implicit) models of use. What this paper suggests is the need for intermediary objects (scenarios?) that could consider use representations as an influential parameter of design, and maintain throughout the design process shared, partially-explicit, and discussed visions of socio-technical contexts where artefacts are imagine...|$|R
