5000|$|In 1974 the Chief of the Polizia di Stato Anti-Terrorism Bureau, Emilio Santillo, {{announced}} {{the necessity to}} establish a tactical unit with the capability to arrest known terrorists and to support the local counter-terrorism field office. Personnel were selected from Police Sports Group [...] "Fiamme Oro ("Gold Flames"), particularly trained in martial arts. The 35-man team was denominated [...] "counter-commando unit" [...] and commanded by Maj. Andrea Sgandurra, an officer with counter-insurgency experiences, and a skilled proponent of hand-to-hand combat skills. After one year of training (offensive driving, sniping, various shooting skills, and a tactical assault course) in 1975 the unit became operational and immediately started mission against the left wing terrorist organization NAP ("Nuclei Armati Proletari", Proletarian Armed Service). Later they operated against the right wing group [...] "New Order", {{which resulted in the}} arrests of well-known terrorists Gentile Schiavone and Pierluigi Concutelli. In 1978, the Italian government decided to modify the structure of the Anti-Terrorist Bureau to improve its capabilities. This change resulted in the formation of SISMI (military intelligence), SISDE (civilian intelligence), and a police counter-terrorism agency (UCIGOS, General Investigations and Special Operations Central Office). This office was the only responsible for Italian counter-terrorism. The UCIGOS's tactical unit became the NOCS (Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza, Central <b>Security</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Service),</b> the old counter-commando unit with far more operatives, training, and responsibilities. During its 22 years of existence, NOCS has performed more than 4,500 missions and 205 arrests. The 25-42 operatives studied terrorist methodology and created innovative tactics procedures. Their motto is Sicut Nox Silentes (As Silent as Night).|$|E

50|$|The Department of Corrections and Judicial Services {{is divided}} into six divisions: Court Services and Transportation, Administrative Services/Intake, <b>Security</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Services,</b> Inmate Healthcare Services, Probation and Probation Certificates. The Court Services and Transportation Division {{includes}} full law enforcement services for the three judicial facilities within Seminole County: the Criminal Justice Center, Juvenile Justice Center and Civil Courthouse as well as prisoner transport. The Division is charged with ensuring these facilities are secure and able to conduct court-related functions for the 18th Judicial Circuit of Florida. The division also houses the The Civil Section who carry out the sheriff’s statutory responsibility for the service of process and execution of writs. This department is responsible for detention services and manages the care, custody and control of inmates incarcerated at the county jail which {{is known as the}} John E. Polk Correctional Facility (JEPCF). The mission of JEPCF is to provide a secure facility that ensures the safety of the public, provides a safe working climate for employees, and offers humane and safe living conditions for inmates. Within the JEPCF is the Administrative Services/Intake Division which includes inmate classification, inmate programs and reentry, and intake/release, the <b>Security</b> <b>Operations</b> division which includes security, special management, food services, and laundry, as well as the Inmate Healthcare Services Division which includes all inmate medical and mental health services.

40|$|Recent {{military}} conflicts {{reveal that}} the ability to assess and improve the health of a society contributes more to a successful counterinsurgency (COIN) than direct military engagement. In COIN, a military commander requires maximum situational awareness not only with regard to the enemy but also to the status of logistical support concerning civil <b>security</b> <b>operations,</b> governance, essential <b>services,</b> economic development, and the host nation's security forces. Although current Brigade level Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can provide critical unadulterated views of progress with respect to these Logistical Lines of Operation (LLO), the majority of units continue to employ UASs for strictly conventional combat support missions. By incorporating these LLO targets into the mission planning cycle with a collective UAS effort, commanders can gain a decisive advantage in COIN. Based on the type of LLO, some of these target...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of <b>security,</b> <b>operations</b> and <b>services</b> in large scale enterprise networks {{is becoming more}} difficult due to complex security policies of the organizations and also due to dynamic changes in network topologies. Typically, the global security policy of an enterprise network is implemented in a distributed fashion through appropriate sets of access control rules (ACL rules) across various interface switches (layer 3 switches) in the network. In such networks, verification of the ACL implementations {{with respect to the}} security policies is a major technical challenge to the network administrators. This is difficult to achieve manually, because of the complex policy constraints (temporal access constraints) and the presence of hidden access paths in the network which may in turn violate one or more policy rules implicitly. The inconsistent hidden access paths may be formed due to transitive relationships between implemented service access paths in the network. Moreover, the complexity of the problem is compounded due to dynamic changes in network topologies. In any point of time, the failure of the network interfaces or links may change the network topology as a result alternative routing paths can be formed for forwarding various service packets. Hence, the existing security implementation (distribution of ACL rules) may not satisfy the policies. In this paper, a fault analysis module is incorporated alon...|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Security Service {{became a}} {{separate}} agency January 1, 2015, and is directly organised under the Ministry of Justice. Similar to {{other government agencies}} in Sweden, it is essentially autonomous. Under the 1974 Instrument of Government, neither the Government nor individual ministers {{have the right to}} influence how an agency decide in a particular case or on the application of legislation. This also applies to the Security Service, which instead is governed by general policy instruments. What sets the Security Service apart from other agencies is that most directives guiding the Service are classified on the grounds of national security, along with the bulk of the reports it produces. The Service is led by a Director-General, Anders Thornberg, who is titled Head of the Swedish <b>Security</b> <b>Service.</b> <b>Operations</b> are led by a Chief Operating Officer, reporting directly the Head of the Security Service. He is in turn assisted by a Deputy Chief Operating Officer and an Office for <b>Operations.</b> The <b>Service</b> is organised into four departments and a secretariat, each led by a Head of Department.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} conceptual issues, {{basic requirements}} and practical suggestions for designing dynamically configured security infrastructure provisioned on demand {{as part of}} the cloud-based infrastructure. This chapter describes general use cases for provisioning cloud infrastructure services and the proposed architectural framework that provides a basis for defining the security infrastructure requirements. The proposed security services lifecycle management (SSLM) model addresses specific on-demand infrastructure service provisioning security problems that can be solved by introducing special security mechanisms to allow security services synchronisation and their binding to the virtualisation platforms’ run-time environment. This chapter describes the proposed dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure (DACI) architecture and defines the necessary security mechanisms to ensure consistent <b>security</b> <b>services</b> <b>operation</b> in the provisioned virtual infrastructure. In particular, this chapter discusses the design and use of a security token service for federated access control and security context management in the generically multi-domain and multi-provider cloud environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — FACTS {{devices have}} shown {{effective}} functionalities {{in promoting the}} system <b>operation</b> <b>security</b> and <b>service</b> reliability. UPFC Versatile of FACTS controllers, yield simultaneous control of all basic power system parameters. Subsynchronous Resonance {{has been identified as}} a serious problem for conventional turbine Generators due to the application of series capacitors. Moreover Wind turbine generators are also susceptible to Subsynchronous oscillations and other resonant interactions. Artifical Neural Network(ANN) using Back propagation Algorithm can be used with promising results as it has good ability of Non-linear mapping with self organization and self learning capability,it also requires less computational time and ANN is trained to store solution without excessive memory storage requirements. UPFC joined with artificial neural network could respond and damp both Subsynchronous resonance and Subsynchronous oscillations respectively. It has been demonstrated in MATLAB/Simulink and shown with better damping of oscillations. ...|$|R
