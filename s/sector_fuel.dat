Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) {{not only}} aims to readdress the racial {{imbalances}} of the apartheid era, but also seeks to promote social responsibility and empowerment of historically disadvantaged South African (HDSA) communities (Esser & Dekker, 2008). The transformation journey within the South African Liquid <b>Fuels</b> <b>Sector</b> {{has been a}} difficult and lengthy one. The South African Liquid <b>Fuels</b> <b>Sector</b> was amongst the first to receive its own Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) <b>sector</b> charter (Liquid <b>Fuels</b> Charter) in 2000. Although numerous transformation milestones have been achieved, the sector has been criticised for its slow pace in advancing transformation, which has in part contributed to the amendment of the B-BBEE Codes in 2013. The argument of slow transformation {{can be attributed to}} obstacles faced by those in industry tasked with implementing B-BBEE. There has been a deficiency in studies that have investigated transformation and the implementation of B-BBEE within the sector. As a result, the central objective {{of this study was to}} explore the B-BBEE implementation challenges faced by companies within the liquid <b>fuels</b> <b>sector.</b> A qualitative approach was employed for the collection of primary data and involved interviews with eight top and senior management representatives of Chevron South Africa (Pty) Ltd. The results emanating from the study revealed numerous implementation challenges. The study together with literature reviewed, highlights the need to address these challenges in order for B-BBEE implementation to yield the desired results for all stakeholders within the South African Liquid <b>Fuels</b> <b>Sector.</b> The study concludes that a lack of understanding of B-BBEE policy; alignment of internal party interests; overcoming internal biases; skills shortages and lack of experience by Black individuals; involvement of senior management in implementation process; co-ordination and structure required in B-BBEE implementation execution; communication within organisations; diversity/cultural awareness; and B-BBEE policy issues and skills attraction and retention are some of the issues impacting B-BBEE implementation within the South African Liquid <b>Fuels</b> <b>Sector...</b>|$|R

To support more evidence-based dialogue on energy development, allocation, and pricing reform, this study uses a computable general equilibrium model to evaluate major energy policy issues facing Bangladesh. A relatively small negative growth impact of increased energy prices can be easily counteracted by an economy-wide increase in energy efficiency or subsidized gas for fertilizer production. A gas price increase does not lead to significant inflationary pressures in the country's economy. Diversification of the power <b>sector</b> <b>fuel</b> mix by introducing coal provides good macroeconomic indicators but results in higher carbon emissions. Investing the gas revenue in physical and social infrastructure provides the best macroeconomic indicators. This best policy option, however, further increases carbon emissions.

Most of the attractive policy options have the drawback of higher carbon emissions, and supplementary policies and suitable technology adoption should play a balancing role...|$|E

Two different indicators (energy intensity and fuel economy) were initially taken into account to select the most suitable for evaluating vehicles' efficiency. Fuel economy was then adopted and measured according to two different methodologies (top-down and bottom-up). We then considered all the possible sources of distortion (data sources employed, methods of data detection, speed of detection, power enhancement, size factor) with the aim of accomplishing a sound estimation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{researched}} under which conditions bio-energy technologies with {{carbon capture and storage}} can be competitive with {{conventional fossil fuel}} powered technologies for the production of electricity and transport fuels in northwestern Europe in the year 2030. In the power sector the options of combustion, gasification and co-firing are researched. The results show that gasification has the highest mitigation potential, and can compete with the fossil reference technologies at a CO 2 credit price of 44 € 2010 /tonne CO 2. When CO 2 credit prices do not compensate negative biogenic emissions, BECCS cannot compete with the fossil fueled technologies. The results also show that at CO 2 credit prices above 70 € 2010 /tonne CO 2, and biomass prices below 6 € 2010 /GJ, the CO 2 credit price outweighs the biomass price. This means that technologies with lower efficiencies, such as dedicated biomass combustion with CCS have lower cost of electricity than gasification. The total negative emissions for dedicated biomass combustion with CCS are - 929 kg CO 2 /MWh, for gasification with CCS - 789 kg CO 2 /MWh and for co-firing with CCS - 175 kg CO 2 /MWh. The results for the liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>sector</b> show that the Fischer-Tropsch diesel and DME technologies are able to compete with diesel and gasoline without the introduction of a CO 2 price. The emission reduction potential for the liquid fuel technologies are - 97 kg CO 2 /GJ for Fischer-Tropsch diesel and - 69 kg CO 2 /GJ for DME production. DME has lower production cost than FT, which makes DME the best option in the liquid transport <b>fuel</b> <b>sector.</b> In the gaseous <b>fuel</b> <b>sector</b> we see that Substitute natural gas is dependent on compensation of at least 53. 3 € 2010 /tonne CO 2 for stored emissions to be able to compete with natural gas. The emission reduction potential of SNG is - 59 kg CO 2 /GJ. The conclusion of this research is that BECCS technologies are highly dependent on low biomass prices, and compensation of negative biogenic emission by means of the introduction of sellable CO 2 credits of at least 44 € 2010 /tonne CO 2 in the electricity sector, and 68 € 2010 /tonne CO 2 in the gaseous <b>fuel</b> <b>sector.</b> The liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>sector</b> is not dependent on introduction of sellable CO 2 credits...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in European energy policy reveal an increasing interest {{in implementing the}} so-called ‘Tradable White Certificate’ (TWC) schemes to improve energy efficiency. Based on three evaluation criteria (cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness and distributional equity) this paper analyses the implications of implementing a European-wide TWC scheme targeting the household and commercial sectors. Using a bottom-up model, quantitative results show significant cost-effective potentials for improvements (ca. 1400 TWh in cumulative energy savings by 2020), with the household sector, gas and space heating representing most of the TWC supply in terms of eligible <b>sector,</b> <b>fuel</b> and energy service demand, respectively. If a single market price of negative externalities is considered, a societal costeffective potential of energy savings above 30 % (compared to the baseline) is observed. In environmental terms, the resulting greenhouse gas emission reductions are around 200 Mt CO 2 -eq by 2010, representing nearly 60 % of the EU-Kyoto-target. From the qualitative perspective, several embedded ancillary benefits are identified (e. g. employment generation, improved comfort level, reduced ‘fuel poverty’, security of energy supply). Whereas an EU-wide TWC increases liquidity and reduces the risks ofmarket power, autarky compliance strategies may be expected in order to capture co-benefits nationally. Cross subsidies could occur due to investment recovery mechanisms {{and there is a}} risk that effects may be regressive for low-income households. Assumptions undertaken by the modelling approach strongly indicate that high effectiveness of other policy instruments is needed for an EU-wide TWC scheme to be cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|Bio-energy is {{expected}} to become increasingly attractive in the future owing to its potential to contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing rural and regional employment and improving energy security through substituting for oil imports. The volume of sustainable biomass resources that are economically competitive but do not significantly impact on food production {{is expected}} to slowly expand as new feedstock varieties and refining pathways are developed. However, these volumes will remain limited relative to total energy and transport <b>sector</b> <b>fuel</b> demand. Limited biomass resources will be allocated to the sector that is most able to afford them. This {{will depend on the}} price of existing fossil fuel products and the relative cost of converting biomass into substitute final fuels such as bio-derived electricity, ethanol blends, biodiesel and bio-derived jet fuel. It will also depend on factors such as the availability and cost of alternative fuel and energy sources, government policies including excise rates, and the emission intensity of each sector. This paper presents a number of alternative cost curves for bio-energy resource to final energy costs and applies a partial equilibrium model of the electricity and transport sectors, called the Energy Sector Model (ESM), to determine where the limited biomass resources are likely to be allocated under various scenarios.
