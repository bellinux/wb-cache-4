40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{simulation}} model for lab-on-a-chip systems, the three approaches of <b>sample</b> <b>loop,</b> hydraulic focusing and dielectrophoretic focusing were investigated with a view to increasing sensitivity. The bonding rate can be increased significantly using <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> and hydraulic focusing. Both approaches involve a considerable extension of the measurement period, though the target bonding rate can be achieved more quickly with <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> than with hydraulic focusing. By using suitable analytes which can be deflected using dielectrophoresis, the bonding rate can be significantly increased without any extension of the measurement period...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{adsorption}} of analytes in the <b>sampling</b> <b>loop,</b> a time-resolved dynamic dilution introduction {{method was}} developed for negative ion mobility spectrometry to continuously monitor end-tidal propofol without other sample pre-separation. The dynamic dilution characteristics of propofol and moisture in the Teflon <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> (4 mm o. d. and 2. 4 mm i. d., 150 cm length) were both theoretically and experimentally investigated. The prominent absorption differences between propofol and moisture on the inwall of the <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> allowed their concentrations to be time-resolved during the injection process, realizing sensitive measurement of end-tidal propofol with a response time of 2 s. At the optimized carrier gas flow rate of 700 mL min(- 1), the linear response range for propofol was achieved to be 0. 2 to 20 ppbv with a limit of detection (LOD) of 65 pptv. Finally, this method was performed on a patient undergoing mastectomy surgery to continuously monitor the end-tidal propofol with an interval of five respirations and the result nicely demonstrated its fast response to the propofol changes...|$|R
