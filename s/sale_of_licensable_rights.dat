This paper describes how a virtual reality 'tour of the human digestive system' was created for the Omniplex Science Museum of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The customers main objectives were: (1) to educate; (2) to entertain; (3) to draw visitors; and (4) to generate revenue. The 'Edutainment' system ultimately delivered met these goals.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to regulate and control the export <b>of</b> <b>licensable,</b> United States’ manufactured commodities in an ethical manner which maintains national security, {{but at the same}} time allows the United States to stay competitive in the global market? This thesis will explore what gives the United States the right to restrict its exports, define what the current export restrictions are and how they function, and then briefly explain globalization and how it plays into this subject. Case studies will be presented which exemplify how violating US laws could possibly weaken national security. Also, investigate how has the world changed in the past century with regards to Nongovernmental Organizations aiding in trade related economics. Lastly, as a unique alternative view, the ethical thinking into this dilemma will stem from a look at some of western philosophy’s most popular thinkers and apply their ethical viewpoints to the problem of export control.
