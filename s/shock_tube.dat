He decided not to steal any of the [...] of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as {{he did not believe}} it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeenbags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate prills, liquid nitromethane, a piece of Tovex sausage, and a blasting cap. The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.|$|E
50|$|Both compression-driven and blast-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{currently}} used for scientific {{as well as}} military applications. Compressed-gas driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, {{the shape of the}} pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven <b>shock</b> <b>tubes.</b> To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.|$|R

2500|$|The HFFAF has a {{test section}} {{equipped}} with 16 shadowgraph-imaging stations. Each station {{can be used}} to capture an orthogonal pair of images of a hypervelocity model in flight.

2500|$|The Voitenko {{compressor}} initially separates a {{test gas}} from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, {{most of its}} energy {{is focused on the}} steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying <b>shock</b> <b>tube.</b> A [...] shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal [...] The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.|$|E

40|$|Journal articleA large set of {{experimental}} data was accumulated for syngas combustion: ignition studies in <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> (732 data points in 62 datasets) and in rapid compression machines (492 / 47), flame velocity determinations (2116 / 217) and species concentration measurements from flow reactors (1104 / 58), <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> (436 / 21) and jet-stirred reactors (90 / 3). In total, 4970 data points in 408 datasets from 52 publications were collected covering wide ranges of temperature T, pressure p, equivalence ratio phi, CO/H- 2 ratio and diluent concentration X-dil. 16 recent syngas combustion mechanisms were tested against these experimental data, and {{the dependence of}} their predictions on the types of experiment and the experimental conditions was investigated. Several clear trends were found. Ignition delay times measured in rapid compression machines (RCM) and in <b>shock</b> <b>tubes</b> (ST) at temperatures below 1000 K could not be well-predicted. Particularly for <b>shock</b> <b>tubes,</b> facility effects at temperatures below 1000 K could not be excluded. The accuracy of the reproduction of ignition delay times did not change significantly with pressure. The agreement of measured and simulated laminar flame velocities is better at low initial (i. e. cold side) temperatures, at fuel-lean conditions, for CO-rich and highly diluted mixtures. The reproduction of the experimental flame velocities is better when these were measured using the heat flux method or the counterflow twin-flame technique, compared to the flame cone method and the outwardly propagating spherical flame approach. With respect to all data used in this comparison, five mechanisms were identified that reproduce the experimental data similarly well. These are the NUIG-NGM- 2010, Keromnes- 2013, Davis- 2005, Li- 2007 and USC-II- 2007 mechanisms, in decreasing order of their overall performance. The influence of poorly reproduced experiments and weighting {{on the performance of}} the mechanisms was investigated. Furthermore, an analysis of local sensitivity coefficients was carried out to determine the influence of selected reactions at the given experimental conditions and to identify those reactions that require more attention in future development of syngas combustion models.
