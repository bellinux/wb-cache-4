However, Tweets are short, personalized and noisy, thus raises more challenges <b>for</b> <b>event</b> extraction and representation. Extracting events out of Arabic tweets {{is a new}} research domain where few examples – if any – of previous work can be found. This paper describes a knowledge-based approach <b>for</b> fostering <b>event</b> extraction out of Arabic tweets. The approach uses an unsupervised rule-based technique <b>for</b> <b>event</b> extraction and provides a named entity disambiguation of event related entities (i. e. person, organization, and location). Extracted events and their related entities are populated to the event knowledge base where tagged tweets’ entities are linked to their corresponding entities represented in the knowledge base. Proposed approach was evaluated on a dataset of 1 K Arabic tweets covering different types of events (i. e. instant events and interval events). Results show that the approach has an accuracy of, 75. 9 % <b>for</b> <b>event</b> trigger extraction, 87. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>event</b> time extraction, and 97. 7 % <b>for</b> <b>event</b> type identification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of event information from diverse event notification sources is, as with meta-searching over heterogeneous search engines, a challenging task. Due {{to the complexity}} of event filter languages, known solutions for heterogeneous searching cannot be applied <b>for</b> <b>event</b> notification In this paper, we propose the concept and design of a Meta Service <b>for</b> <b>Event</b> Notification. We define transformation rules <b>for</b> exchanging <b>event</b> filter definitions and event notifications between various event services and sources. We transform each filter defined at a meta-service into a filter expressed in the language of each event notification source. Due to unavoidable asymmetry in the semantics of different langues, some superfluous information may be delivered to the meta-service. These notifications are then post-processed {{to reduce the number of}} spurious messages. We present a survey and classification of filter languages <b>for</b> <b>event</b> notification, which serves as basis for the transformation rules. The proposed rules are implemented in a prototype transformation module for a Meta Service <b>for</b> <b>Event</b> Notification. ...|$|R

We propose novel approaches to text analysis <b>for</b> <b>event</b> detection and semantics extraction, video analysis <b>for</b> <b>event</b> structure modeling and event moment detection, and text/video alignment <b>for</b> <b>event</b> boundary detection in the video. Compared with existing approaches to event detection in sports video which rely heavily on low-level features directly extracted from video itself, our approach aims to bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level events and facilitates personalization of the sports video. Promising results are reported on real-world video clips by using text analysis, video analysis and text/video alignment. 1...|$|R
