40|$|The {{non-contact}} {{mechanical seal}} of a high-speed turbopump in a liquid rocket engine operates under very harsh conditions (such as rapid start-up, cryogenic, high-speed, high-pressure and low-viscosity <b>sealing</b> <b>fluid).</b> The {{performance of the}} seal is very different to the performance under normal running conditions. In this paper, {{for the sake of}} safety, an experiment is carried out with liquid nitrogen as the <b>sealing</b> <b>fluid.</b> The experimental results with liquid nitrogen are expected to provide an equivalent seal performance as would be experienced with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen rocket engine. The main performance parameters, including face temperatures, leakage, face friction force, and friction coefficients, are measured in the speed-up, stable, and speed-down stages. The results show that in the speed-up stage, with rapidly increasing speed, the local face temperature rises dramatically to even higher than the vaporization temperature of liquid nitrogen, and a two-phase flow phenomenon occurs. In the start-up and stable stages, the friction coefficients are 0. 25 and 0. 13, respectively. After the test, {{it was found that the}} wear thickness of the rotor was 0. 2  mm, and serious point corrosion appeared on the surface of the stator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The correct {{behaviour}} of a non-contacting {{face seal}} {{depends on a}} number of parameters and physical phenomena occurring in the clearance between the sliding rings. The hydrodynamic and thermodynamic phenomena in the clearance of a face seal, on the other hand, are dependent on pressure, flow speed and temperature of the <b>sealing</b> <b>fluid,</b> clearance dimensions, material of the sliding rings and operation parameters of the fluidflow machine. Under normal operating conditions fluid friction is observed in a noncontacting face seal. The work discusses the effect of a temperature change in a noncontacting face seal under fluid friction and boundary dry friction conditions. Key words: face seal, temperature identification, thermodynamics effect. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geothermal systems {{involve the}} dynamic {{interaction}} among ro~ks, fluids, and fractures. Some aspects {{of these systems}} are typi~al of the upper crust be~ause they involve water-rock reac tions resulting in cementation, diagenesis, or even low-grade meta morphism. Other aspects are atypi~al of the crust because of their speed, specifi ~ reactions, environment, and dependence on structure, particularly fractures. Reactions between fluids and rocks depend on fractures for fluid conduction and reaction surfaces. The mor phologies of the fractures are dependent on the cementing, sealing, and alteration reactions. Core samples from several geothermal areas show repeated episodes of fracturing and <b>sealing.</b> <b>Fluid</b> flow and ele~tri ~ ~urrents depend on the conduction paths provided by frac tures. Cementation and sealing can lower permeability and raise resistivity by 3 - 5 orders of magnitude. On the other hand, fluid flow is restricted by sealed fractures. The sealed fractures are occasionally the boundaries between regions of signifi~antly dif ferent physical characteristics. Despite the many episodes of fracturing, the sealing processes usually result in low fracture porosity...|$|E

Here, breakthrough curves (BTCs) were obtained {{to quantify the}} transport of the ureolytic bacterium, Sporosarcina pasteurii, through sandstone cores, {{as a function of}} core length (1. 8 – 7. 5 cm), bacterial density (4 × 106 to 9 × 107 cells/ml) and flow rate (5. 8 – 17. 5 m/s). S. pasteurii was easily immobilised within the homogeneous sandstone matrix (> 80 %) in comparison to a packed sand column (< 20 %; under similar experimental conditions), and percentage recovery decreased almost linearly with increasing rock core length. Moreover, a decrease in bacterial density or flow rate enhanced bacterial retention. A numerical model based on 1 D advection dispersion models used for unconsolidated sand was fitted to the BTC data obtained here for sandstone. Good agreement between data and model was obtained at shorter rock core lengths (< 4 cm), suggesting that physicochemical filtration processes are similar in homogeneous packed sand and sandstones at these lengths. Discrepancies were, however observed at longer core lengths and with varying flow rates, indicating that the attributes of consolidated rock might impact bacterial transport progressively more with increasing core length.

40|$|Direct cycle {{boiling water}} reactor (BWR) plants have {{redundant}} quick-acting isola-tion valves on each main steam line from the reactor to the turbine. In {{the event of a}} loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), any leakage of contaminated steam through these valves is controlled by a leakage control system. The leakage control system must satisfy the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 4, and 54. The review of the main steam isolation valve leakage control system (MSIVLCS) covers the entire leakage control system including the source of the sealing medium, if any, and pumps, valves, and piping to the points of connection or interface with the main steam supply system. Emphasis is placed on the components of the leakage control system that are required to remain functional following a design basis LOCA. 1.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{hydrostatic}} and hydrodynamic non-contacting face seals {{has been designed to}} meet the requirements of lower leakage, longer life and more repeatedly start and stop on shaft seals raised by liquid rocket engine turbopumps. And an experimental study on the performance of the face seal in the actual liquid oxygen turbopump was completed where low-viscosity water was selected as the <b>seal</b> <b>fluid</b> for the sake of safety. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Different performances of face seals under preset conditions were obtained by repeatedly running tests, and the main performance parameters encompass leakage, fluid film pressure between the faces, operating power, face temperature, and so on. The results indicate that the designed face seal has a smaller amount of leakage, with a minimum value of 3 ?ml/s. Furthermore, the designed face seal has been proved to demand lower operating power. Since its operating power changes slightly with different <b>sealed</b> <b>fluid</b> pressures, the new seal can be deployed in the harsh working condition with high pressure or with high speed (greater than 20, 000 ?rpm). However, one proviso is that when liquid is employed as the <b>seal</b> <b>fluid,</b> the groove depth should be relatively deeper (greater than 10 ?µm). In response to future engineering requirements, study on the controllable spiral-groove face seals to improve the current design is being conducted. The advancement of such non-contacting face seals proffers important insights to the design of turbo-pump shaft seal in a new generation of liquid rocket engine with regard to the requirement of frequent start and stop as well as long life on it...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic <b>fluid</b> from the <b>seal</b> clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer.

As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|R

The cuff also has a deflated profile that may allow for easier insertion through the stoma site. This unique design {{is known as the}} TaperGuard™ cuff. The purpose of the observational, in vitro study reported here was to compare the TaperGuard™ taper-shaped cuff to a conventional high-volume low-pressure cylindrical-shaped cuff (Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy Tube [DCT]) with respect to applied tracheal wall pressure, air and <b>fluid</b> <b>sealing</b> efficacy, and insertion force. Methods: Three sizes of {{tracheostomy tube}}s with the two cuff types were placed in appropriately sized tracheal models and lateral wall pressure was measured via pressure-sensing elements on the inner surface. <b>Fluid</b> <b>sealing</b> performance was assessed by inflating the cuffs within the tracheal models (25 cmH 2 O), instilling water above the cuff, and measuring fluid leakage past the cuff. To measure air leak, tubes were attached to a test lung and ventilator, and leak was calculated by subtracting the average exhaled tidal volume from the average delivered tidal volume. A tensile test machine was used to measure insertion force for each tube with the cuff deflated to simulate clinical insertion through a stoma site. Results: The average pressure exerted on the lateral wall of the model trachea was lower for the taper-shaped cuff than for the cylindrical cuff under all test conditions (P< 0. 05). The taper-shaped cuff also demonstrated a more even, lower pressure distribution along the lateral wall of the model trachea. The average air and <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance with the taper-shaped cuff was significantly improved, when compared to the cylindrical-shaped cuff, for each tube size tested (P< 0. 05). The insertion force for the taper-shaped cuff was ~ 40 % less than that for the cylindrical-shaped cuff. Conclusion: In a model trachea, the Shiley™ Flexible Adult tracheostomy tube with TaperGuard™ cuff, when compared to the Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy tube with cylindrical cuff, exerted a lower average lateral wall pressure and a more evenly distributed pressure.
