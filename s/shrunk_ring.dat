40|$|A {{new system}} of coil {{compression}} [1] has been designed which uses iron laminations to transfer the pressure from an outer <b>shrink</b> <b>ring</b> to the coil. The laminations are simple circular discs around the coil with the peculiarity that the rim is slightly eccentric {{as compared to the}} coil. Successive laminations are mounted with different angular orientations to oppose their eccentricities. The <b>shrink</b> <b>ring</b> pushes these discs inwards against the coil creating compression by a scissor movement. Tests on mechanical models of single as well as multiple aperture magnets have shown it to work as expected. The system has already successfully been applied to several corrector magnets for LHC. The advantages are low cost (suppression of the usual collars), increased coil compression in particular from cooling down, and field enhancement from having the iron close to the coil. ...|$|R

On large industrial machines (say, from several kilowatts to thousands of kilowatts in rating) it is economical to replace individual damaged segments, and so the end-wedge can be unscrewed and individual segments removed and replaced. Replacing the copper and mica segments is {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "refilling".

40|$|Permissible {{internal}} pressure in dies for cold extrusion {{may be increased}} {{by the use of}} one or two <b>shrink</b> <b>rings.</b> The design essentially boils down to defining the diametrical interference fit of the die/ring assembly. There are two methods of design: analytical one based on Lame’s solution and numerical one based on finite element modelling (FEM). None of these methods includes roughness of the interface surfaces of the die insert and the <b>shrink</b> <b>ring.</b> However, when designing the pre-stressed micro-dies, the interface roughness cannot be disregarded and the classical design of the diameter interference must be corrected. In this paper, a semi-physical modelling of interface roughness (SPMIR) is used as novel method which determines the interference correction value. A set of FEM models created on the base of Abbot-Firestone curves, determined from the roughness profile, enables determination of a contact surface stiffness curve and further the interference correction. Relative correction of the die diameter interference increases with the diameter decrease, which might be recognized as a pre-stressed micro-die assembling scale effect. In the experimental part, three miniature dies, with interface diameter 2. 8 mm and different levels of interface surface roughness, Ra= 0. 16, Ra= 0. 43, Ra= 0. 60, have been manufactured by WEDM. Relative interference corrections calculated by the SPMIR method reached respectively 17. 6, 27. 9 and 43. 3 %. A practical design advice has been formulated as follows: interference correction based on the interface surface topology is recommended for micro-dies with the interface diameter less than 10, 15 and 25 mm, for the three levels of the surface roughness investigated...|$|R

40|$|The thixoforging {{technology}} offers a large technical and economical {{potential for the}} production of highly stressed parts with complex shaped geometries. While thixoforming is an established process for aluminum parts, the efforts described below focus on the development of this technology for steel applications. Another focus is put on ceramic tool materials since these are required to enable such a high temperature process. Thixoforging of high-melting metals (e. g. forging steels) demands a sophisticated process control and adapted tool materials as well as suitable ingoing material. A large need for research is still required in this field. Possible products made by means of thixoforging are e. g. running and driving gear components which are produced by multiple conventional forging step operations today. In this paper first experiments concerning the use of ceramic tool materials for thixoforging of steel discussed. Therefore a hybrid die that consists of a steel <b>shrink</b> <b>ring</b> with a ceramic insert was developed and built up. Different monolithic and composite ceramics, based on nitrides, carbides, borides and oxides have been evaluated, with respect to the interfacial reactions between solids and melts by means of thermodynamical calculations and the method of sessile drop in combination with investigations by electron microscope (SEM, EDX). Due to the separation of the heating process of the slug from the tool system an encapsulated transport of the heated slug is needed to prevent unwanted cooling and high temperature oxidation (scale). This transfer is carried out inside high temperature resistant containers. The suitability (e. g. thermo shock resistance) of different materials for the use as transport containers was also subject of this research work. The forming experiments were carried out with the institute's hydraulic press (AP&T LPS 4000). The process logic controller (PLC, Type SINUMERIK 840 D) of this press offers the appropriate flexibility and various control modes needed for a sophisticated and reproducible filling of the die. Furthermore, all relevant process parameters such as force, velocity and displacement of the stamp can be recorded by a built-in process computer...|$|R

30|$|Mohamed-Kassim and Longmire [5] {{conducted}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{experiments to}} study the coalescence of single drops through planar liquid/liquid interfaces. Sequences of velocity vector fields were obtained with a high-speed video camera and the subsequent PIV analysis. Two ambient liquids with different viscosities but similar densities were examined. After rupture, the free edge of the thin film receded rapidly, allowing the drop fluid to sink into the bulk liquid below. The vorticity generated in the collapsing fluid developed into a vortex ring, straddling the upper drop surface. The inertia of the collapse deflected the interface downward before it rebounded upward. During this time, the vortex core split so that part of its initial vorticity moved inside the drop fluid while part of it remained in the ambient fluid above it. The velocity of the receding free edge was smaller for higher ambient viscosity, and the pinching of the upper drop surface caused by the <b>shrinking</b> capillary <b>ring</b> wave was stronger when the ambient viscosity was lower.

40|$|Summary The ADF/cofilins are {{a family}} of actin-binding {{proteins}} expressed in all eukaryotic cells so far examined. Members of this family remodel the actin cytoskeleton, for example during cytokinesis, when the actin-rich contractile <b>ring</b> <b>shrinks</b> as it contracts through the interaction of ADF/cofilins with both monomeric and filamentous actin. The depolymerizing activity is twofold: ADF/cofilins sever actin filaments and also increase {{the rate at which}} monomers leave the filament’s pointed end. The threedimensional structure of ADF/cofilins is similar to a fold in members of the gelsolin family of actinbinding proteins in which this fold is typically repeated three or six times; although both families bind polyphosphoinositide lipids and actin in a pH-dependent manner, they share no obvious sequence similarity. Plants and animals have multiple ADF/cofilin genes, belonging in vertebrates to two types, ADF and cofilins. Other eukaryotes (such as yeast, Acanthamoeba and slime moulds) have a single ADF/cofilin gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the ADF/cofilins reveals that, with few exceptions, their relationships reflect conventional views of the relationships between the major groups of organisms.

To investigate both the fatigue behavior of the whole component and wear mechanisms a full scale fatigue test has to be carried out.
