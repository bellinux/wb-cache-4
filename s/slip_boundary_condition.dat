Numerical solutions indicate that the numerical solutions of TWEF with and without the coordinate transformation are in good agreement, while CTM effectively improves stability and convergence rate of the numerical solution, and saves computational cost. It is found that the averaged flow velocity of TWEF in a micro-channel strongly depends on frequency of the electric field. Flow rate achieves a maximum around the charge frequency of the electric double layer.

40|$|A {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{combined with}} a linear <b>slip</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>condition</b> is proposed to calculate SH wave scattering from fractures.

Comparisons between results obtained using our model with those obtained using a computationally expensive finite difference method (FDM) (Coates and Schoenberg, 1995; Kruger et al., 2005) are performed to show the validity and accuracy of our approach.
