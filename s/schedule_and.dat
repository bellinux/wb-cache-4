40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{discusses the}} state-of-the-art {{and the current}} limitations in the modeling, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control of flexible automation. To model flexible automation, {{it is argued that}} the simulation tools must provide enhanced capabilities to consider both controller interactions and the flow of resources that support production. It is also dem-onstrated that <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control must be considered concurrently in real-time to effectively manage flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). The complexity of the modem FMS further requires that the integrated <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control function must be distributed among several coordinators with the system. The second part of the paper presents several research developments pertaining to the modeling, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control of flexible automation including: a Recursive, Object-Oriented Control Hierarchy for the integrated dis-tribution of <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control; a Hierarchical Object-Oriented Programmable Logic Simulator €or the detailed modeling of FMSs; and a Hierarchical System Coordinator for implementing real-time <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control.

40|$|High-level {{synthesis}} is {{the process}} of automatically translating abstract behavioral models of digital systems to implementable hardware. Operation <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> hardware allocation are the two most important phases in the synthesis of circuits from behavioral specification. <b>Scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation can be formulated as an optimization problem. In this work, a unique approach to <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation problem using the genetic algorithm (GA) is described. This approach is different from a previous attempt using GA (Wehn et al., IFIP Working Conference on Logic and Architecture Synthesis, Paris, 1990, pp. 47 – 56) in many respects. The main contributions include: (1) a new chromosomal representation for <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> for two subproblems of allocation; and (2) two novel crossover operators to generate legal schedules. In addition the application of tabu search (TS) to <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation is also implemented and studied. Two implementations of TS are reported and compared. Both genetic <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation (GSA) <b>and</b> tabu <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation (TSA) have been tested on various benchmarks and results obtained for data-oriented control-data flow graphs are compared with other implementations in the literature.

40|$|Instruction <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> {{register}} allocation play {{very important}} roles in compilation techniques for high-performance computers. In this thesis we study different analyses and transformations that may affect the performance of instruction <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> register allocation. An important technique for increasing code parallelism is alias analysis. Alias analysis can {{reduce the number of}} dependences in a Data Dependence Graph (DDG) by disambiguating address references. Our study shows that points-to analysis, the alias analysis method implemented in the McCAT compiler, can substantially increase parallelism in benchmarks with indirect memory references.

An integrated approach [...] IPS (Integrated Prepass Scheduling) is implemented in the McCAT compiler.
