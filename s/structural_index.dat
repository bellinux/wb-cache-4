However, these estimates are unstable even {{in the presence of}} a weak amount of noise, and Euler deconvolution of noisy data leads to an under{{estimation of}} <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and depth. We have studied how the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and depth estimates are affected by applying low-pass filtering to the data. Physically based low-pass filters, such as upward continuation and integration, have been shown to be the best choice over a range of altitudes (upward continuation) or orders (integration filters), mainly because their outputs have a well-defined physical meaning. In contrast, mathematical low-pass filters require that the filter parameters be tuned carefully by means of several trial tests to produce optimally smoothed fields. The C-norm criterion is a reliable strategy to produce a stabilized vertical derivative, and we discourage Butterworth filters because they tend to a vertical integral filter, for a high cutoff wavenumber, thus complicating the interpretation of the estimated <b>structural</b> <b>index.</b> We found that the estimated <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and depth to source increase proportionally with the amount of smoothing, unless in the case of overfiltering.

Homogeneity is necessary to satisfy the Euler deconvolution equation itself, whereas harmonicity is required to compute the vertical derivative from data collected on a horizontal plane, according to potential-field theory. The analytic signal modulus of a potential field is a homogeneous function but is not a harmonic function. Hence, the vertical derivative of the analytic signal is incorrect when computed by the usual techniques for harmonic functions and so also is the consequent Euler deconvolution. We show that the resulting errors primarily affect the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and that the estimated values are always notably lower than the correct ones. The consequences of this error in the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> are equally important whether the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> is given as input (as in standard Euler deconvolution) or represents an unknown to be solved for.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I tried {{to develop new}} {{automatic}} imaging methods, aiming at improving the interpretation of potential field anomalies related to mining and environmental studies. The major improvements, which I obtained, are the stability, which is normally low for methods such as the local wavenumber, and the full automaticity in retrieving the source parameters (depth and <b>structural</b> <b>index).</b> Starting from {{the theory of the}} Depth from Extreme Points (DEXP) method, I first applied it to the self-potential data related to mineralization and to groundwater flow. DEXP is a fast imaging method transforming the field data, or its derivatives, into a quantity proportional to the source distribution. The method is particularly suited to handle at high-resolution noisy data, as it is stable even using high-order derivatives. DEXP imaging depends on the knowledge of the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> of the source. While this parameter may be a priori determined by the method itself, i. e., by a preliminary application of related multiscale methods based on the study of the scaling function, it may also assumed a priori, as done for other imaging methods such as migration, correlation or the sandwich model. I showed the usefulness of DEXP method to self-potential datasets, regarding mineral exploration at Malachite mine, Colorado, (USA), Sariyer area (Turkey) and Bender area (India) and water-table depth estimation in a pumping well and in sinkholes at the area of San Vittorino Plain (Rieti, central Italy). The estimated depths well agree with the known information about the sources. 	As any imaging method (DEXP, correlation, migration and others) needs to assume, inherently or explicitly, a value for the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and that it is valid throughout the whole explored source volume, I tried to develop new imaging methods to estimate the depth to the sources of potential fields independent from value of the <b>structural</b> <b>index.</b> The first of them consists of applying the DEXP transformation to the ratio () between two different-order partial derivatives of the field. While the scaling function used in the DEXP transformation depends on the <b>structural</b> <b>index,</b> I showed that the scaling function of merely depends on {{the difference between the two}} used orders of differentiation. This allows three main features to be established for the DEXP transformation of : a) it is independent from the structural index; b) the estimation of the source depths is fully automatic, simply consisting in the search of position of the extreme points of the DEXP image; c) the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> of each source is finally determined from the scaling function or the extreme points using the estimated depth. Besides the well known characteristics of the DEXP transformation, such as high-resolution and stability, the DEXP transformation of enjoys one more relevant feature: it can be applied to multi-source cases, yielding simultaneously correct estimations of <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> and depth for each source in the same image. However, while the DEXP transformation is a linear transformation of the field, the DEXP transformation of is nonlinear, and a procedure is described to circumvent the nonlinear effects. 	The method is tested with synthetic examples and applied to real magnetic data for mineral exploration from the Pima copper mine, Arizona, USA, Hamrawien area, Egypt and Cataldere, Bala district of Turkey. The results are consistent with the known information about the causative sources. 	I developed also a method for source parameter estimation, based on the local wavenumber function. Even in this case I made use of the stable properties of the DEXP method, so to deal with local wavenumber of high-order, as DEXP is able to overcome its known instability caused by the use of high-order derivatives. Also in this case, i. e., the DEXP transformation of the local wavenumber, the scaling-law is independent of the <b>structural</b> <b>index,</b> is fully automatic and may be implemented as a very fast imaging method, mapping different-kind sources at their own correct depth. The method was demonstrated to synthetic cases and applied to real-data examples from Bulgaria and from a test site for buried drums in Italy. I also developed a new method to analyze the local wavenumber, based on the fractional-order differentiation of potential fields, to the end of applying it in a more stable way. Such kind of differentiation allows a fractional-order local wavenumber to be defined, whose usefulness is two-fold: a) the positions of the peaks of the two different-order local wavenumber are essentially the same; b) the well known instability of the method, due to the noise-enhancement related to the field standard differentiation, may be kept to a minimum, if a fractional-order field differentiation is used.

This demonstrates that Pantelides ’ algorithm applied to DAEs of index 1 may perform an arbitrarily high number of iterations and differentiations...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{multiscale}} {{approach as}} a semi-automated interpreting tool of potential fields. The depth {{to the source}} and the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> are estimated in two steps: first the depth to the source, as {{the intersection of the}} field ridges (lines built joining the extrema of the field at various altitudes) and secondly, the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> by the scale function. We introduce a new criterion, called ‘ridge consistency’ in this strategy. The criterion is based on the principle that the <b>structural</b> <b>index</b> estimations on all the ridges converging towards the same source should be consistent. If these estimates are significantly different, field differentiation is used to lessen the interference effects from nearby sources or regional fields, to obtain a consistent set of estimates. In our multiscale framework, vertical differentiation is naturally joint to the low-pass filtering properties of the upward continuation, so is a stable process. Before applying our criterion, we studied carefully the errors on upward continuation caused by the finite size of the survey area. To this end, we analysed the complex magnetic synthetic case, known as Bishop model, and evaluated the best extrapolation algorithm and the optimal width of the area extension, needed to obtain accurate upward continuation. Afterwards, we applied the method to the depth estimation of the whole Bishop basement bathymetry. The result is a good reconstruction of the complex basement and of the shape properties of the source at the estimated points...|$|E
40|$|Searching for all {{occurrences of}} a twig pattern in an XML {{document}} {{is an important}} operation in XML query processing. Recently a holistic method T wigStack [2] has been proposed. The method avoids generating large intermediate results which do {{not contribute to the}} final answer and is CPU and I/O optimal when twig patterns only have ancestor-descendant relationships. Another important direction of XML query processing is to build <b>structural</b> <b>indexes</b> [3][8][13][15] over XML documents to avoid unnecessary scanning of source documents. We regard XML <b>structural</b> <b>indexing</b> as a technique to partition XML documents and call it streaming scheme in our paper. In this paper we develop a method to perform holistic twig pattern matching on XML documents partitioned using various streaming schemes. Our method avoids unnecessary scanning of irrelevant portion of XML documents. More importantly, depending on different streaming schemes used, it can process a large class of twig patterns consisting of both ancestordescendant and parent-child relationships and avoid generating redundant intermediate results. Our experiments demonstrate the applicability and the performance advantages of our approach. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} family of graph <b>structural</b> <b>indices</b> related to the Matrix-forest theorem. The {{properties}} of the basic index that expresses the mutual connectivity of two vertices are studied in detail. The derivative indices that measure "dissociation," "solitariness," and "provinciality" of vertices are also considered. A nonstandard metric {{on the set of}} vertices is introduced, which is determined by their connectivity. The application of these indices in sociometry is discussed. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
40|$|Basic aspects in the {{handling}} of fatty acid-data have remained largely underexposed. Of these, we aimed to address three statistical methodological issues, by quantitatively exemplifying their imminent confounding impact on analytical outcomes: (1) presenting results as relative percentages or absolute concentrations, (2) handling of missing/non-detectable values, and (3) using <b>structural</b> <b>indices</b> for data-reduction. Therefore, we reanalyzed an example dataset containing erythrocyte fatty acid-concentrations of 137 recurrently depressed patients and 73 controls. First, correlations between data presented as percentages and concentrations varied for different fatty acids, depending on their correlation with the total fatty acid-concentration. Second, multiple imputation of non-detects resulted in differences in significance compared to zero-substitution or omission of non-detects. Third, patients' chain length-, unsaturation-, and peroxidation-indices were significantly lower compared to controls, which corresponded with patterns interpreted from individual fatty acid tests. In conclusion, results from our example dataset show that statistical methodological choices can have a significant influence on outcomes of fatty acid analysis, which emphasizes the relevance of: (1) hypothesis-based fatty acid-presentation (percentages or concentrations), (2) multiple imputation, preventing bias introduced by non-detects; and (3) {{the possibility of using}} (<b>structural)</b> <b>indices,</b> to delineate fatty acid-patterns thereby preventing multiple testin...|$|R
