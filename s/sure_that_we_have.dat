Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times, [...] "It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start. What we have done is we've really tried to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not directed our fire at anyone in particular." [...] He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics, [...] "One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — politics, religion, nationalism. Fringe faiths, fringe nationalities." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that is to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E

Circulating throughout several Internet blogs, the music video was received with controversy and a divided reaction from fans, Internet critics, and media outlets. On March 30, 2010, {{it became the}} ninth most popular search on Google. The music video also prompted attention from Dallas city officials for Badu's public nudity and filming without city permits. Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating [...] "None {{of this would have}} occurred had she stayed clothed.

5000|$|Forum Gallery - Located on {{the first}} floor of the museum just inside the Forbes Avenue entrance, this single room is {{dedicated}} to temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It opened November 3, 1990 with support from the National Endowment of the Arts. The first exhibition, Forum 1, was a solo show of Jeff Wall. Subsequent exhibitions were numbered sequentially (for example, Forum 40 featured Felix de la Concha). Unlike larger museum exhibitions, which can take up to three years to plan and execute, Forum shows come together relatively quickly, and are open to any curatorial staff's vision. In the words of Vicky Clark, a longtime curator at the museum, [...] "The idea was to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> an exhibition of contemporary art set up at all times." ...|$|R
