40|$|When varying {{amounts of}} {{phosphorus}} from inorganic sources {{were added to}} a basal ration of ground yellow corn, wheat middlings and dry skimmilk, in which the amount of calcium in the various rations was held practically constant, the incidence of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> increased as the phosphorus increased. Though the trend was very definite, {{the relation between the}} amount of phosphorus in the ration and the percentage of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> was not exactly linear, indicating that factors other than the amount of phosphorus in the ration may have been operating to influence the incidence of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon.</b> Two groups of chicks fed on the same ration at different times gave very similar growth responses, and though the incidence of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> was not of the same magnitude, the relation between the numbers of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> on the various rations remained the same. The lowest amount of phosphorus in this ration which produced <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> was 0. 9 percent. When the amount of phosphorus in the ration was held practically constant at about 1. 4 percent and the calcium was fed at levels of 0. 34 percent, 1. 40 percent and 2. 26 percent there were fewer slipped tendons on the low level of calcium than on the medium and high levels. The percentage of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> on the medium and high levels of calcium was practically the same. When a basal ration of ground yellow corn, alfalfa leaf meal, dry skimmilk and ground oyster shell was fed about 24 percent of the chicks developed <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon,</b> though the phosphorus content of the ration was only 0. 43 percent. With this base, when the phosphorus content of the ration was increased to 1. 33 percent by the addition of inorganic phosphorus, the incidence of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> increased 78 percent. With nearly the same amount of phosphorus, 1. 43 percent, a ration containing 20 percent of wheat middlings in place of the alfalfa leaf meal and part of the corn in the above base produced only about 45 percent of <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon.</b> A ration in which the wheat middlings were replaced by rice bran produced no <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> at all. The percentage of ash in the dry, fat-free femurs, tibiae and metatarsi of chicks afflicted with <b>slipped</b> <b>tendon</b> did not differ significantly from that of the corresponding bones of chicks of the same age on a control ration. The ash of femurs of chicks 10 weeks of age on a ration containing only 0. 36 percent of calcium and 0. 59 percent of phosphorus was significantly lower than that of chicks of the same age on a control ration, but was not as low as the figures generally given for the ash content of the bones of rachitic chicks.

Their toes curled inwardly and frequently the birds walked upon the distal end of the tarso-metatarsus. In a few apparently more advanced cases the chicks lay upon the floor with legs extended in opposite di-rections. The leg muscles appeared to have lost part of their tonicity. In some cases the skin of the legs and toes of the af-fected chicks was dry and rough. No enlargement, or flattening of the hock joint, bowing of the legs, or a displacement of the Achilles tendon was noted.

40|$|Concrete bridges with {{corrugated}} steel web(s) and prestressed by {{both internal and}} external tendons have {{emerged as one of the}} promising bridge forms. In view of the different behaviour of components and the large shear deformation of webs with negligible flexural stiffness, the assumption that plane sections remain plane may no longer be valid and therefore the classical Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko models may not be applicable. In the design of this type of bridges, both the flexural strength and ductility need to be carefully examined, which requires the estimation of full-range behaviour. In the study of this type of bridges, an analytical sandwich model and its finite element model for geometric and material nonlinear analysis are developed. The model accounts for the interaction between the axial and flexural deformations of the beam. The model uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials (i. e. steel bars, prestressing tendons, steel web and concrete) and considers the path-dependence of these materials. With a nonlinear kinematical theory, a complete description of the nonlinear interaction between the external <b>slipping</b> <b>tendons</b> and the beam is obtained. Different rotations are assigned to the flanges and {{corrugated steel}} web(s). The numerical results obtained are compared with experimental results for verification.

In this study, the effects of the finger posture on the tendon force transmission within the finger extensor apparatus were investigated. In five cadaver specimens, a constant force was applied sequentially to the two extrinsic extensor tendons in the index finger, extensor digitorum communis and extensor indicis proprius. The responses to this loading, i. e. fingertip force/moment and regional strains of the extensor apparatus, were measured and analyzed to estimate the tendon force transmission into the terminal and central slips of the extensor hood. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that the amount of tendon force transmitted to each <b>tendon</b> <b>slip</b> was significantly affected by finger posture, specifically by the interphalangeal (IP) joint angles (p 30 %) when the IP joints were extended. The ratio of terminal slip force: central slip force remained relatively constant across postures at approximately 1. 7 : 1.

In this rare situation operative treatment is indicated. We describe a new intra articular reconstruction that utilises a <b>slip</b> of triceps <b>tendon</b> to provide immediate stability to the elbow. 				 					Methods: We assessed 20 cadaveric elbows, measuring the length of triceps tendon available and required to complete the reconstruction. We then sequentially sectioned the ligamentous stabilisers of an elbow before performing the new technique. We measured the displacement and angulation possible at the elbow {{before and after the}} reconstruction. 				 					Results: All 20 elbows had sufficient triceps tendon length to complete the new technique. Prior to the reconstruction greater than 30  mm of joint distraction and 90 degrees varus or valgus angulation was possible.

The flexion contractures were released and pulleys reconstructed over the A 2 and A 4 areas of the index and middle fingers. The FDS tendon of the index finger was sectioned at the MP joint level. The radial slip was used to reconstruct the A 2 pulley and the ulnar slip used to reconstruct the A 4 pulley. The distal attachments were still intact.

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} segmental bridges (PCSBs) {{have been}} the most common design technology used in the last decades. It is widely recognized that segmental bridges have better durability, lower life-cycle costs and higher quality for maintenance than other types of bridges. PCSBs with externally prestressed tendons have become very popular in construction because of economical and safety reasons, fast and practical construction, and outstanding serviceability. Moreover, external tendons technique is widely used because it allows to inspect the cables and to replace them or to reinforce the tendons in case of damage while such kinds of actions are difficult to be taken in case of internal prestressing. Therefore, box section is the most common solution due to its aesthetic appeal and elegance that reduces the environmental impact as well due to the convenient maintenance for the tendons. Besides, the hollow concrete box segment can be used for service/electrical cable ducts for bridges.
