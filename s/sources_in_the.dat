5|$|Ground-based radio {{images taken}} using the VLA {{revealed}} seven radio <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HDF, {{all of which}} correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E

5|$|After 1900, the {{financial}} and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the pipe rolls, court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests. Thomas Tout made extensive use of these new <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties. This wave of research culminated in Sir Maurice Powicke's two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E

The 15 most significant sources have discharges of between 29,200 liters per minute and 680 liters per minute. The pHs {{of the sources}} range from 3.9 to 6.7. The iron concentrations at these sites ranges from 2.1 to 18 milligrams per liter. The concentrations of manganese ranges from 0.95 to 6.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky.

5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some public funding, but received criticism for its financial ties to the Church of Scientology, for exposing rescue workers to potential medical dangers, and for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine. <b>Sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fire Department told a reporter that several participants had joined Scientology, even disconnecting from their families.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{bitterness}} of the campaign and {{the timing of the}} murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private <b>sources.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1825 session of the General Assembly, a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E
5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{happened}} to many prominent {{individuals in the}} Athenian democracy, Themistocles's fellow citizens grew jealous of his success, and possibly tired of his boasting. It is probable that in early 479 BC, Themistocles was stripped of his command; instead, Xanthippus was to command the Athenian fleet, and Aristides the land forces. Though Themistocles was no doubt politically and militarily active {{for the rest of}} the campaign, no mention of his activities in 479 BC is made in the ancient <b>sources.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of that year, after receiving an Athenian ultimatum, the Peloponnesians finally agreed to assemble an army and march to confront Mardonius, who had reoccupied Athens in June. At the decisive Battle of Plataea, the Allies destroyed the Persian army, while apparently on the same day, the Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale. These twin victories completed the Allied triumph, and ended the Persian threat to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It {{is one of the}} brightest radio <b>sources</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E
