Two complete sets are cast in an eight-cavity die with a 2000 t cold chamber high pressure die casting machine. The initial die configuration used a <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> assembly with stationary pins to core a through hole in a thick section of the front cam caps. This configuration resulted in high post machining scrap rates, primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate. The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover. Density measurements and visual inspection confirmed the substantial improvement in porosity levels in the critical region of the castings. <br /...|$|R

Because the <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> does not touch the inside of the tube, it can move without friction, making the LVDT a highly reliable device.

500|$|Other die {{components}} include <b>cores</b> and <b>slides.</b> <b>Cores</b> are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable <b>cores</b> and <b>slides</b> greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.|$|R

5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a <b>sliding</b> inductor <b>core,</b> increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue MicroArrays (TMAs) {{represent}} a potential high-throughput {{platform for the}} analysis and discovery of tissue biomarkers. As TMA slides are produced manually and subject to processing and sectioning artefacts, the layout of TMA cores on the final slide and subsequent digital scan (TMA digital slide) is often disturbed {{making it difficult to}} associate cores with their original position in the planned TMA map. Additionally, the individual cores can be greatly altered and contain numerous irregularities such as missing cores, grid rotation and stretching. These factors demand the development of a robust method for de-arraying TMAs which identifies each TMA core, and assigns them to their appropriate coordinates on the constructed TMA slide. METHODOLOGY: This study presents a robust TMA de-arraying method consisting of three functional phases: TMA core segmentation, gridding and mapping. The segmentation of TMA cores uses a set of morphological operations to identify each TMA core. Gridding then utilises a Delaunay Triangulation based method to find the row and column indices of each TMA core. Finally, mapping correlates each TMA core from a high resolution TMA whole slide image with its name within a TMAMap. CONCLUSION: This study describes a genuine robust TMA de-arraying algorithm for the rapid identification of TMA <b>cores</b> from digital <b>slides.</b> The result of this de-arraying algorithm allows the easy partition of each TMA core for further processing. Based on a test group of 19 TMA <b>slides</b> (3129 <b>cores),</b> 99. 84 % of cores were segmented successfully, 99. 81 % of cores were gridded correctly and 99. 96 % of cores were mapped with their correct names via TMAMaps.

40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting {{is one of the}} most cost-effective methods for mass producing aluminium components. Thus, for example, die casting is used to currently manufacture a large volume of all aluminium engines. However, besides the undisputed advantages, the restricted freedom in mould design largely limits the applications of high {{pressure die}} casting. Although in the past it was possible to significantly improve this situation by means of <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> technologies, it is however still not possible to represent complex internal geometries. This can only be achieved by using lost cores. Conventional core systems made of sand, i. e. for low {{pressure die casting}}, only partially endure the high mechanical loading. However, continuously increasing component and material requirements necessitate constructions having internal contours. An example are crankcases which can currently be high pressure die cast using mass production technology only in an open-deck construction. By using an operational coring system, the motors could also be cast as a single piece in a closed-deck. In relation to this, there are commercial endeavours to implement suitable sand and salt coring systems. Another application which is considered in this work is a combination of lost cores for die casting partially liquid metal suspensions. Rheocast processes are a particularly cost-effective alternative to conventional high pressure die casting and provide, moreover, advantages intrinsic to the process such as, for example, lower shrinkage, pressure tightness, near-net shapes as well as the possibility of carrying out heat treatments or welding thick-walled components. A decisive advantage for implementing lost cores is a significantly slower and, in the ideal case, a non-turbulent flow. By using the cooling channel process, which was developed at the Foundry Institute of RWTH Aachen, different coring systems based on sand, salt, zinc and plastic are well proven in tests with respect to their suitability for rheocasting. Furthermore, the parameters influencing the material and the process are determined and thoroughly investigated for the cooling channel process. Here, the aim is both to provide a reproducible input material, which is as homogeneous as possible, for subsequently high pressure die casting using lost cores as well as to assess the suitability of the cores and the cooling channel process for possible industrial applications. Moreover, the knowledge gained about both rheocasting as well as highly reactive alloys, which can be employed due to the lower processing temperatures, is firstly verified by means of the alloy AlLi 2. 1 Mg 5. 5. Secondly, the influences of processing the partial-liquid in the Rheo-Container-Process on the morphology and phase formation are analysed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 of {{this thesis}} reviews the known {{dynamical}} processes of DNA, histories and nucleosomes. Part 2 presents research on salt-induced nucleosome dissociation. In elevated [NaCl], dissociation occurs within minutes to hours, to generate free DNA. Dissociation is reversible (or nearly so), and {{is enhanced by}} nucleosome dilution; thus {{it appears to be}} an equilibrium phenomenon. Upon exposure of nucleosome core particles to 0. 35 - 0. 75 M NaC 1, a second reversible transition is observed, on a much faster time-scale (thesis, part 3). This fast transition results in a 15 % decrease in s g 0. It also involves an increase in circular dichroism around 280 nm, amounting to 35 - 40 % of the difference in CD between free DNA and native core particles. The fast transition is interpreted in terms of a two-state model: the core particle is envisioned to move from the native state into a new state, where some portion of its DNA is now more like the solution "B " form. The CD increase (assayed in 0. 65 M Nadi) is temperature independent over 5 - 35 C. This is interpreted (via the two-state model) to mean that the fast transition is entropy-driven. From a consideration of both these data and published studies, we suggest that the fast transition involves the release of two 25 - 30 by DNA "termini " from the histone core. Under this model, we calculate that 5 - 7 DNA/histone bonds are broken in the release of each terminus. From oligopeptide/DNA binding data, we calculate these bonds to be at least as strong as oligoarginine/DNA bonds; thus they probably have substantial non-electrostatic character.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The current {{cervical}} disc arthroplasty {{is limited}} by postoperative facet joint arthritis, heterotopic ossification and segmental kyphosis. The total Frisbee disc, which has an upper convex/concave non-spherical surface and a lower flat sliding surface, is a new approach for improved outcomes. Prior to clinical application, safety and suitability tests are required. METHODS: The Frisbee is the first 3 rd generation disc {{according to a new}} classification of total disc because it can precisely mimic the segmental ROM, including the soft limitation of axial rotation. The ISO 18192 - 1 test was carried out to determine the rate of wear debris. A FE model was used to assess the safety of prosthetic components. In the sagittal plane several variables to determine the most favorable lordotic angle were evaluated. RESULTS: Two angled prosthetic plates are safer than one <b>sliding</b> angled <b>core</b> to prevent the displacement. The lordosis of 7 &# 176; of the Frisbee leads to kyphosis of no more than 2 &# 176; without reduction of the ROM. The wear rate of the Frisbee is five times smaller compared to an FDA-approved disc with a spherical sliding surface. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the test results, the clinical application of Frisbee can now be studied. The postoperative kyphosis observed with other devices is not an issue with the Frisbee design. Physiological ROM is combined with the significant reduction of wear debris. For these reasons the Frisbee has the potential to provide a better balanced segmental loading reducing the degeneration of the joint surface and heterotopic ossification...|$|R

Thick sequences of underconsolidated muds and mudstones are present, which are severely overpressured. In the Ursa Basin, Site U 1322 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) provided an excellent coring record of interleaved fine-grained turbidites and hemipelagic sediments, in part severely affected by submarine slumping and <b>sliding</b> after deposition. <b>Cores</b> were continuously sampled and analyzed for anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), to elucidate the effects of different transport mechanisms and degree of settling and consolidation on magnetic fabric properties. Generally AMS ellipticity increases with depth irrespective of transport mode, due to loss of porosity. Samples from slumped mass transport deposits (MTD), however, have higher AMS if compared to immediately overlying nonslumped material. MTD samples dominantly show triaxial magnetic fabrics whereas those found in nonslumped sediments are much more oblate. Long axes of the fabric ellipsoid reflect the direction of eastward to southward suspension transport in samples not overprinted by sliding or slumping. Short ellipsoid axes in non-slumped material are vertical, and thus parallel to the axis of maximum uniaxial shortening. In the MTD samples, many short ellipsoid axes are inclined, reflecting an overprint of the uniaxial shortening by bedparallel shearing induced by the slumping.

This work aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the behavior of buckling restrained braces, the final objective is to foster its mass use in developing countries (in earthquake prone regions), particulary for reinforced concrete building frames. The research approach consists of designing, producing and testing (in Argentina) five reduced scale dissipators (about 400 mm long) and of taking profit of the gained experience to design, to produce and to test (in Spain) four full size (near 3000 mm long) prototype devices. All these tests are a individual, i. e. no subassemblies (accounting for the building frames) are considered. The main conclusion is that it is possible to obtain a reasonably cheap (about 1000 US$ per unit; this amount corresponds to production in Spain (summer 2006) without optimizing the fabrication process), efficient, robust, low maintenance and durable prototype device requiring only a low-tech production process (suitable for developing countries). Moreover, the results show that the fatigue life of buckling restrained braces, even highly uncertain, can be significantly bigger than expected (according to some previously published results); it might allow extending the life of these devices after a number of strong seismic inputs. A numerical analysis of the buckling behavior of these devices is performed; it allows formulating some design recommendations. Further research needs are identified.

40|$|Nanoelectrospray {{ionisation}} (nanoESI) {{coupled with}} quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has developed {{to the point}} that noncovalent complexes of biomolecules can be analysed. In this work, current MS technology was used to analyse protein assemblies of tobacco rubisco and rubisco activase and their interactions with nucleotides and sugar phosphates. The first nanoESI mass spectra of rubisco and rubisco activase are presented. Rubisco activase was determined to have a higher relative binding affinity for ADP over AMP-PNP (and by inference, ATP) and the addition of ATP-Mg revealed a possible second nucleotide binding site. This is the first clear evidence of a second nucleotide binding site on rubisco activase and binding at the first site potentiated binding at the second site. Further, an interaction between rubisco activase and RuBP, but not CABP was observed. While this observation should be treated with caution, the binding of RuBP to rubisco activase suggests direct involvement of rubisco activase in removing RuBP from the inactive rubisco-RuBP complex. The inability to observe a rubisco activase-CABP complex suggests a specific interaction of rubisco activase with RuBP. The addition of rubisco activase to the inactive rubisco-RuBP complex led to removal of RuBP from rubisco, though no direct complex between rubisco and rubisco activase was observed by ESI-MS. In addition, the oligomeric assembly of an archaeal rubisco from Methanococcoides burtonii was investigated. In the presence of substrates, RuBP or CABP, or divalent metal cofactors, M. burtonii rubisco assembled from dimers into decamers. The nanoESI mass spectra confirmed results observed using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results suggest a re-examination of the classification of the rubisco superfamily since the M. burtonii rubisco has catalytic and structural similarities with other archaeal rubiscos, but closer sequence homology to bacterial type II rubiscos. NanoESI-MS was also used to investigate protein subassemblies of the DNA polymerase III of the E. coli replisome. This molecular machine is responsible for the replication of chromosomal DNA prior to cell division. The interaction between the 2 sliding clamp and the polymerase subunit was the focus of this investigation, in particular, characterisation of the two 2 -binding sites on the subunit, as well as preliminary work to determine conditions toward the assembly of larger subassemblies of the replisome. Complexes of the core () subassembly with the 2 <b>sliding</b> clamp, and <b>core</b> with the truncated subunit, c 16, were observed. Determination of the conditions for observation of these complexes has set the scene for more detailed analysis of the order of assembly of the replication machinery and for an understanding of the protein binding partners involved in key interactions. Based on the observations made in this work, evidence has recently been obtained using nanoESI-MS to show that the proofreading subunit interacts directly with the 2 sliding clamp. Finally, travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS) is a relatively new type of IMS. In IMS, ions are separated not only on the basis of mass/charge, but also by their size and shape. Since this a newly commercially available technology, it was of interest to determine the resolving power of the Synapt™ HDMS™ instrument for protein conformers. A mixture of 2 and transferrin, proteins of similar mass but different shape, was resolved using TWIMS. TWIMS was also used to confirm that changes in charge state distribution can correspond to protein unfolding, where the unfolded form of DnaB-N was separated from the folded conformation. Differences in collisional cross section were determined from TWIMS data of complexes of calmodulin in positive or negative ion mode. In these studies, mass spectrometry provided information that is not readily available from other techniques...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{described}} here base mainly on sedimentary material {{collected during the}} "Indian Ocean Expedition" of the German research vessel "Meteor" {{in the region of}} the Indian-Pakistan continental margin in February and March 1965. Moreover,samples {{from the mouth of the}} Indus-River were available, which were collected by the Pakistan fishing vessel "Machhera" in March 1965. Altogether, the following quantities of sedimentary material were collected: 59. 73 m piston cores. 54. 52 m gravity cores. 33 box grab samples. 68 bottom grab samples Component analyses of the coarse fraction were made of these samples and the sedimentary fabric was examined. Moreover, the CaCO 3 and Corg contents were discussed. From these investigations the following history of sedimentation can be derived: Recent sedimentation on the shelf is mainly characterized by hydrodynamic processes and terrigenous supply of material. In the shallow water wave action and currents running parallel to the coast, imply a repeated reworking which induces a sorting of the grains and layering of the sediments as well as a lack of bioturbation. The sedimentation rate is very high here. From the coast-line down to appr. 50 m the sediment becomes progressively finer, the conditions of deposition become less turbulent. On the outer shelf the sediment is again considerably coarser. It contains many relicts of planktonic organisms and it shows traces of burrowing. Indications for redeposition are nearly missing, a considerable part of the fine fraction of the sediments is, however, whirled up and carried away. In wide areas of the outer shelf this stirring has gained such a degree that recent deposits are nearly completely missing. Here, coarse relict sands rich in ooids are exposed, which were formed in very shallow stirred water during the time when the sea reached its lowest level, i. e. at the turn of the Pleistocene to the Holocene. Below the relict sand white, very fine-grained aragonite mud was found at one location (core 228). This aragonite mud was obviously deposited in very calm water of some greater depth, possibly behind a reef barrier. Biochemic carbonate precipitation played an important part in the formation of relict sands and aragonite muds. In postglacial times the relict sands were exposed for long periods to violent wave action and to areal erosion. In the present days they are gradually covered by recent sediments proceeding from the sides. On the continental margin beyond the shelf edge the distribution of the sediments is to a considerable extent determined by the morphology of the sea bottom. The material originating from the continent and/or the shelf, is less transported by action of the water than by the force of gravity. Within the range of the uppermost part of the continental slope recent sedimentation reaches its maximum. Here the fine material is deposited which has been whirled up in the zone of the relict sands. A laminated fine-grained sediment is formed here due to the very high sedimentation rate as well as to the extremely low O 2 -content in the bottom water, which prevents life on the bottom of the sea and impedes thus also bioturbation. The lamination probaly reflects annual variation in deposition and can be attributed to the rhythm of the monsoon with its effects on the water and the weather conditions. In the lower part of the upper continental slope sediments are to be found which show in varying intensity, intercalations of fine material (silt) from the shelf, in large sections of the core. These fine intercalations of allochthonous material are closely related to the autochthonous normal sediment, so that a great number of small individual depositional processes can be inferred. In general the intercalations are missing in the uppermost part of the cores; in the lower part they can be met in different quantities, and they reach their maximum frequency in the upper part of the lower core section. The depositions {{described here}} were designated as turbid layer sediments, since they get their material from turbid layers, which transport components to the continental slope which have been whirled up from the shelf. Turbidites are missing in this zone. Since the whole upper continental slope shows a low oxygen-content of the bottom water the structure of the turbid layer sediments is more or less preserved. The lenticular-phacoidal fine structure does, however, not reflect annual rhythms, but sporadic individual events, as e. g. tsunamis. At the lower part of the continental slope and on the continental rise the majority of turbidites was deposited, which, during glacial times and particularly at the beginning of the post-glacial period, transported material from the zone of relict sands. The Laccadive Ridge represented a natural obstacle for the transport of suspended sediments into the deep sea. Core SIC- 181 from the Arabian Basin shows some intercalations of turbidites; their material, however, does not originate from the Indian Shelf, but from the Laccadive Ridge. Within the range of the Indus Cone it is surprising that distinct turbidites are nearly completely missing; on the other hand, turbid layer sediments are to be found. The bottom of the sea is showing still a slight slope here, so that the turbidites funneled through the Canyon of the Swatch probably rush down to greater water depths. Due to the particularly large supply of suspended material by theIndus River the turbid layer sediments show farther extension than in other regions. In general the terrigenous components are concentrated on the Indus Cone. It is within the range of the lower continental slope that the only discovery of a <b>sliding</b> mass (<b>core</b> 186) has been located. It can be assumed that this was set in motion during the Holocene. During the period of time discussed here the following development of kind and intensity of the deposition of allochthonous material can be observed on the Indian-Pakistan continental margin: At the time of the lowest sea level the shelf was only very narrow, and the zone in which bottom currents were able to stir up material by oscillating motion, was considerably confined. The rivers flowed into the sea near to the edge of the shelf. For this reason the percentage of terrigenous material, quartz and mica is higher in the lower part of many cores (e. g. cores 210 and 219) than in the upper part. The transition from glacial to postglacial times caused a series of environmental changes. Among them the rise of the sea level (in the area of investigation appr. 150 m) had the most important influence on the sedimentation process. In connection with this event many river valleys became canyons, which sucked sedimentary material away from the shelf and transported it in form of turbidites into the deep sea. During the rise of the sea level a situation can be expected with a maximum area of the comparatively plane shelf being exposed to wave action. During this time the process of stirring up of sediments and formation of turbid layers will reach a maximum. Accordingly, the formation of turbidites and turbid layer sediments are most frequent at the same time. This happened in general in the older polstglacial period. The present day high water level results in a reduced supply of sediments into the canyons. The stirring up of sediments from the shelf by wave action is restricted to the finest material. The missing of shelf material in the uppermost core sections can thus be explained. The laminated muds reflect these calm sedimentation conditions as well. In the southwestern part of the area of investigation fine volcanic glass was blown in during the Pleistocene, probably from the southeast. It has thus become possible to correlate the cores 181, 182, 202. Eolian dust from the Indian subcontinent represents probably an important component of the deep sea sediments. The chemism of the bottom as well as of the pore water has a considerable influence on the development of the sediments. Of particular importance in this connection is a layer with a minimum content of oxygen in the sea water (200 - 1500 m), which today touches the upper part of the continental slope. Above and beyond this oxygen minimum layer somewhat higher O 2 -values are to be observed at the sea bottom. During the Pleistocene the oxygen minimum layer has obviously been locatedin greater depth as is indicated by the facies of laminated mud occuring in the lower part of core 219. The type of bioturbation is mainly determined by the chemism. Moreover, the chemism is responsible for a considerable selective dissolution, either complete or partial, of the sedimentary components. Within the range of the oxygen minimum layer an alkaline milieu is developed at the bottom. This causes a complete or partial dissolution of the siliceous organisms. Here, bioturbation is in general completely missing; sometimes small pyrite-filled burrowing racks are found. In the areas rich in O 2 high pH-values result in a partial dissolution of the calcareous shells. Large, non-pyritized burrowing tracks characterize the type of bioturbation in this environment. A study of the "lebensspuren" in the cores supports the assumption that, particularly within the region of the Laccadive Basin, the oxygen content in the bottom sediments was lower than during the Holocene. This may be attributed to a high sedimentation rate and to a lower O 2 -content of the bottom water. The composition of the allochthonous sedimentary components, detritus and/or volcanic glass may locally change the chemism to a considerable extent for a certain time; under such special circumstances the type of bioturbation and the state of preservation of the components may be different from those of the normal sediment...|$|R
