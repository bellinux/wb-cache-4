40|$|Symptoms {{of motor}} {{disintegration}} in presenile dementia (Pick's and Alzheimer's diseases) are presented. The paper {{is based in}} the study of 58 cases collected during a period of almost 24 years. Motor oral responses (<b>sucking,</b> <b>rooting</b> and pouting), motor rigidity (paratonic rigidity, pelvicrural flexion contraction), restless or quiescent positive motor responses (instinctive grasp reaction, grasp reflex) are related with frontal lesions. On the other hand, hypermetamorphosis and excessive oral tendency are believed to be in relation with temporal lobe lesions...|$|R

40|$|Climatic changes, {{especially}} {{increase in}} the air temperature, decrease of precipitation totals and increase in potential evapotranspiration can be observed at high altitudes, too. This results in alternation of variously long humid and dry periods, which in case of the mountain spruce stands reduces or even disables the transport of available water and nutrients for plants. Moisture regime with a very good available water supply is generally limited only to winter season and {{for a short time}} {{to the beginning of the}} vegetation season, too. The greatest changes in moisture can be observed especially in summer (July, August). In case of dry and warm periods occurrence, in consequence of increased evapotranspiration (> 5 mm. day- 1), mainly in the process of water use by trees, the intensive loss in the soil water in a relatively short time can be observed. Consequently, the hydropedological cycles with limited available water storage take part. The biggest danger threatens the spruce resulting from the insufficient available water supply in the upper layers of the soil, where the occurrence of <b>sucking</b> <b>roots</b> is the highest. In the case of a long contact loss of roots and capillary water the physiological weakening, worsening of the health conditions or even liquidation of the spruce stands can be observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{intestinal}} histopathology and in situ postures of Gymnophalloides seoi (Digenea: Gymnophallidae) {{were studied}} using C 3 H/HeN and C 57 BL/ 6 mice as experimental hosts; {{the effects of}} immunosuppression were also observed. The metacercariae isolated from naturally infected oysters, 300 or 1, 000 in number, were infected orally to each mouse, and the mice were killed at days 3 - 21 post-infection (PI). In immunocompetent (IC) mice, {{only a small number}} of flukes were found in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum during days 3 - 7 PI, with their large oral suckers pinching and <b>sucking</b> the <b>root</b> of villi. The intestinal mucosa showed mild villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and inflammations in the villous stroma and crypt, with remarkable goblet cell hyperplasia. These mucosal changes were almost restored after days 14 - 21 PI. In immunosuppressed (IS) mice, displacement as well as complete loss of villi adjacent to the flukes was frequently encountered, otherwise the histopathology was generally mild, with minimal goblet cell hyperplasia. In these mice, numerous flukes were found, and it seemed that they were actively moving and rotating in situ. Several flukes were found to have invaded into the submucosa, almost facing the serosa. These results indicate that in IC mice the intestinal histopathology caused by G. seoi is generally mild, and the flukes do not penetrate beyond the mucosa, however, in IS mice, the flukes can cause severe destruction of neighboring villi, and some of them invade into the submucosa...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} trees to <b>suck</b> water from <b>roots</b> to leaves, {{sometimes}} to heights of {{over a hundred}} meters, is remarkable given {{the absence of any}} mechanical pump. This study deals with a number of issues, of both an historical and conceptual nature, in the orthodox ``Cohesion-Tension'' theory of the ascent of sap in trees. The theory relies chiefly on the exceptional cohesive and adhesive properties of water, the structural properties of trees, and the role of evaporation (``transpiration'') from leaves. But it is not the whole story. Plant scientists have been aware since the inception of the theory in the late 19 th century that further processes are at work in order to “prime” the trees, the main such process [...] growth itself [...] being so obvious to them that it is often omitted from the story. Other factors depend largely on the type of tree, and are not always fully understood. For physicists, in particular, it may be helpful to see the fuller picture, which is what this study attempts to provide in non-technical terms...|$|R
40|$|Studies on Gymnophalloides seoi (Digenea: Gymnophallidae) {{and human}} infections are briefly reviewed. This minute {{intestinal}} fluke was first discovered from a Korean woman suffering from acute pancreatitis and gastrointestinal troubles. It {{was described as}} a new species by Lee, Chai and Hong in 1993. The southwestern coastal village where the patient resided was found to be a highly endemic area, and additional endemic areas have been identified. The parasite is very small, 0. 33 - 0. 50 mm long and 0. 23 - 0. 33 mm wide, and characterized by the presence of a ventral pit. The first intermediate host remains unknown, but the second intermediate host {{has been found to be}} the oyster Crassostrea gigas. Man and the Palearctic oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus have been shown to be natural definitive hosts, and wading birds including the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus are highly susceptible to experimental infection. Gerbils, hamsters, cats, and several strains of mice were also susceptible laboratory hosts. In experimentally infected mice, the parasites inhabit the small intestine, pinching and <b>sucking</b> the <b>root</b> of villi with their large oral suckers, but they did not invade beyond the mucosa in immunocompetent mice. However, they were found to invade the submucosa in immunosuppressed mice. Human G. seoi infections have been found in at least 25 localities; 23 islands on the Yellow Sea or the South Sea, and 2 western coastal villages. The highest prevalence was found in a village on Aphaedo, Shinan-gun (49 % egg positive rate); other areas showed 0. 8 - 25. 3 % prevalence. Infected people complained of variable degrees of gastrointestinal troubles and indigestion. The infection can be diagnosed by recovery of eggs in the feces; however, an expert is needed to identify the eggs. Praziquantel, 10 mg/kg in single dose, is effective for treatment of human infections. Eating raw oysters in endemic areas should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study how early {{breast-feeding}} would be influenced by pethidine given during labour and by an emergency Caesarean section. Eighteen mother-infant pairs which were exposed and 26 which were not exposed to pethidine during labour were observed the first two hours after birth. The infants were put skin-to-skin on their mothers' chest. The developing breast-feeding behaviour was observed. It {{was found that the}} pethidine exposed infants had a delayed and depressed <b>sucking</b> and <b>rooting</b> behaviour. Infants with a short dose-to-delivery interval had the most depressed sucking behaviour and infants with high concentration of pethidine in the umbilical cord did not suck the breast at all during the observation. Seventeen primiparous women who had had an emergency Caesarean section and 20 women who had had a vaginal delivery were blood sampled during a breast-feeding two days after childbirth and oxytocin, prolactin and cortisol levels were measured with RIA. Women who had had vaginal delivery had a pulsatile oxytocin the first ten minutes of breast-feeding (ranging from 1 - 5 pulses) pattern and elevated levels of prolactin 20 - 30 mimltes after the onset of breast-feeding. The number of pulses was related to the amount of milk the infant ingested during the studied breast-feed and the duration of exclusive breast-feeding. Women who had had a Caesarean section had significantly fewer pulses of oxytocin (ranging from 0 - 3) and no elevation of prolactin. The number of pulses was related to the amount of milk the infant ingested during the studied breast-feeding in both groups. Regression analysis showed two factors to be of importance for for the differences in oxytocin patterns between the groups and that was the absence of a second stage of labour and a delayed first suckling occasion. Cortisol decreased significantly in both groups. The personality inventory, the Karolinska Scales of personality, were filled in on the second day by the mothers described above and on the day of partus by 13 primiparae and 16 multiparae and were compared with a normative group of women. The results showed that women who had had a vaginal delivery scored lower in anxiety variables and higher in socialisation than the normative group. In addition the multiparous women but not the primiparous women showed similar differences on the day of partus. The women who had had a Caesarean section did not show these differences. Basal levels of oxytocin were inversely correlated with anxiety scores in mothers with a Caesarean section and the number of pulses of oxytocin were correlated with social desirability in the women who had had a vaginal delivery. The data give further support for the importance of early breast-feeding for some maternal adaptations, such as milk production and behaviour. Furthermore, early interaction may together with labour influence maternal oxytocin secretion which may underlie some maternal adaptations. Two routines were found to disturb early suckling -pethidine given during labour and Caesarean section. Some suggestions as how to compensate for this are given.

6000|$|This is a {{troublesome}} world enough, {{but thanks}} to that mitigating fate which now and again interferes to our advantage, there do come {{to most of us}} times and periods of existence which, if they do not quite fulfil all the conditions of ideal happiness, yet go near enough to that end to permit in after days of our imagining that they did so. I say to most of us, but in doing so I allude chiefly to those classes commonly known as the [...] "upper," [...] by which is understood those who have enough bread to put into their mouths and clothes to warm them; those, too, who are not the present subjects of remorseless and hideous ailments, who are not daily agonised by the sight of their famished offspring; who are not doomed to beat out their lives against the madhouse bars, or to see their hearts' beloved and their most cherished hope wither towards that cold space from whence no message comes. For such unfortunates, and for their million-numbered kin upon the globe--the victims of war, famine, slave trade, oppression, usury, over-population, and the curse of competition, the rays of light must be few indeed; few and far between, only just enough to save them from utter hopelessness. And even to the favoured ones, the well warmed and well fed, who are to a great extent lifted by fortune or by their native strength and wit above the degradations of the world, this light of happiness is but as the gleam of stars, uncertain, fitful, and continually lost in clouds. Only the utterly selfish or the utterly ignorant can be happy with the happiness of savages or children, however prosperous their own affairs, for to the rest, to those who think and have hearts to feel, and imagination to realise, and a redeeming human sympathy to be touched, the mere weight of the world's misery pressing round them like an atmosphere, the mere echoes of the groans of the dying and the cries of the children are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to dull, aye, to destroy the promise of their joys. But, even to this finer sort there do come rare periods of almost complete happiness--little summers in the tempestuous climate of our years, green-fringed wells of water in our desert, pure northern lights breaking in upon our gloom. And strange as it may seem, these breadths of happy days, when the old questions cease to torment, and a man can trust in Providence and without one qualifying thought bless the day that he was born, are very frequently connected with the passion which is known as love; that mysterious symbol of our double nature, that strange tree of life which, with its <b>roots</b> <b>sucking</b> their strength from the dust-heap of humanity, yet springs aloft above our level and bears its blooms in the face of heaven.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} environmental and genetic factors influencing {{the development of}} belly nosing in the early-weaned pig. The first experiment investigated the effects of gender, duration of liquid milk replacer supplementation, breed line and environmental enrichment designed to simulate components of a sow's udder, on the incidence of belly nosing and its associated behaviours in pigs weaned at 7 days-of-age. Both breed line and environmental enrichment were found to affect the incidence of oralnasal behavioural vices related to belly nosing. Differences between breed lines {{were found in the}} types of behavioural vices performed and whether these vices were generally focused or directed at specific regions of the body of penmates. Enrichment devices, designed for nosing, <b>rooting,</b> <b>sucking,</b> and biting were also found to be specific in the types of behavioural vices they effectively alleviated. Significant breed line by environmental enrichment interactions were found, with Yorkshire pigs more responsive to environmental enrichment than Duroc pigs. The second study documented the ontogeny of belly nosing from weaning into the grow-finish period in pigs weaned at 12 - 14 days-of-age and determined whether early belly nosing correlated with behavioural vices observed during the grow-finish period. The results of the study suggest that after belly nosing subsides, a number of other oralnasal behaviours take its place. Pigs that progressed from belly nosing to belly sucking, tended to continue to perform belly sucking behaviour into the grow-finish phase. In contrast, piglets which exhibited generalized nosing and sucking behaviours during the grow-finish period were more likely to tail bite and to engage in generalized biting of penmates. A direct correlation between belly nosing during the nursery phase and tail biting during the grow-finish period was not found. The third {{study investigated}} the effects of sire breed and individual sires within breed on belly nosing. Breed of sire affected whether nosing and sucking behaviours were generally focused or directed towards the belly of penmates. Specifically, Large White-sired pigs performed more belly nosing and belly sucking behaviour, while Duroc-sired pigs performed more generally directed nosing and sucking behaviours. The fourth study investigated the use of 'relevant' environmental enrichment devices to further clarify the underlying motivation for belly nosing. A second objective was to investigate the provision of such enrichment at two different developmental stages to determine whether a sensitive period exists for the introduction of environmental enrichment. While providing any type of environmental enrichment during the nursery phase reduced belly nosing, providing nosing enrichment in particular had the most significant effect, despite it being the least utilized. The sensitive period for providing environmental enrichment to reduce belly nosing was found to be during the early nursery phase, within the first two weeks following weaning. The final study investigated the thermal preference of early-weaned pigs as it relates to activity levels, huddling and belly nosing. Early-weaned pigs preferred cooler temperatures during the night, when they huddled to keep warm, and warmer temperatures during the day. Activity levels and belly nosing also demonstrated a diurnal pattern, with the highest incidence of belly nosing occurring during the transition from piglets being more active during the day to spending more time lying at night. Belly nosing is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Recognizing the circumstances in which belly nosing occurs will help in designing strategies to reduce the incidence of the behaviour, while still keeping the practice of early weaning as a viable option in disease eradication programs...|$|R
