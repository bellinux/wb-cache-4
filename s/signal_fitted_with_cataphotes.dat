40|$|The Himalayan endemic alpine genus Roscoea, {{like other}} members of ginger family, {{exhibits}} the combination of floral traits that would fit pollination by long distant foragers such as bees, birds or flies. We studied the pollination biology of Roscoea alpina, observed potential floral visitors and determined their foraging behaviour, visitation frequency and pollination efficiency, to seek {{evidence in support of}} the pollination syndrome hypothesis. We also measured the floral spectra of R. alpina flowers to evaluate if <b>signals</b> <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the currently known framework for observed floral visitors. We found that R. alpina have autonomous selfing and pollinator-mediated crossing, but lack apomixis. We observed that a beetle (Mylabris sp.), and a moth (Macroglossum nycteris) visit the flowers of R. alpina for pollen and nectar feeding respectively. Our field observations, the stigmatic pollen count and fruit set data indicated that the visit by the beetle was legitimate, while that of the moth was illegitimate. Emasculated flowers visited by beetles set as many fruits and seeds/fruit as auto-selfed and naturally pollinated flowers, while emasculated flowers excluded from beetle visits did not set fruit and seed; indicating that a single visit of a beetle to the flowers of R. alpina can facilitate pollination. We found that flower spectral signal of R. alpina does not fit typical spectra previously reported for beetle or bee-visited flowers. Our results suggest that, to ensure reproductive success in alpine habitat, R. alpina has evolved autonomous selfing as a predominant mode of reproduction, while beetle pollination would promote genetic diversity of this plant species. The visitation of beetles to the flowers of R. alpina, despite floral signal mismatch with the classically associated beetle vision, suggests that a different visual processing may operate in this plant-pollinator interaction at high altitudes...|$|R

Nowadays, there are various techniques to detect lightning signals and to determine various parameters produced by a lightning flash. Each technique provides its own claimed performances. In this paper, the characteristics of captured broadband electric fields generated by cloud-to-ground lightning discharges in South of Malaysia are analyzed. A total of 130 cloud-to-ground lightning flashes from 3 separate thunderstorm events (each event lasts for about 4 – 5 hours) were examined. Statistical analyses of the following signal parameters were presented: preliminary breakdown pulse train time duration, time interval between preliminary breakdowns and return stroke, multiplicity of stroke, and percentages of single stroke only.

It is well known that when dealing instead with the complex valued signal, the real and imaginary parts are affected by Gaussian distributed noise and their modeling can thus benefit from any estimation technique suitable for this noise distribution. We present a quantitative analysis of the difference between the modeling of {{the magnitude}} diffusion signal and the modeling in the complex domain. The noisy complex and magnitude diffusion signals are obtained for a physically realistic sce-nario in a region close to a restricting boundary.

We discuss the performance of the reconstructions as function of the Signal to Noise Ra-tio (SNR) and the sampling resolution of the diffusion signal. We show that fitting in the complex domain generally allows for quantitatively better signal reconstruction, also with a poor SNR, provided that the sampling resolution of the signal is ade-quate.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the large}} number of in situ, plot-level phenological {{measurements}} and satellite-derived phenological studies, there has been little success to date in merging these records temporally or spatially. In this research, we bridge this scale gap through higher resolution satellite records (Landsat) and quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived metrics with direct field measurements. We compiled fifty-seven Landsat scenes from southern New England (P 12 R 51) from 1984 to 2002. Green vegetation areal abundance for each scene was derived from spectral mixture analysis and a single set of endmembers. The leaf area <b>signal</b> was <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> a logistic-growth simulating sigmoid curve to derive phenological markers (half-maximum leaf-onset and offset). Spring leaf-onset dates in homogenous stands of deciduous forests displayed significant and persistent local variability. The local variability was validated with multiple springtime ground observations (r 2 = 0. 91). The highest degree of verified small-scale variation occurred where contiguous forests displayed leaf-onset gradients of 10 – 14 days over short distances (3 ̆c 500 m). These dramatic gradients occur in of low-relief (3 ̆c 40 m) upland regions. The patterns suggest that microclimates resulting from springtime cold-air drainage may be influential in governing the start of leaf growth; every 4. 16 m loss in elevation delayed spring leaf onset by 1 day. These microclimates may be of crucial importance in interpreting in situ records and interpolating phenology from satellite data. Regional patterns from the Landsat analyses suggest topographic, coastal, and land-use controls on phenology. Our results indicate that deciduous forests in the Providence, RI metropolitan area leaf out 5 – 7 days earlier than comparable rural areas. The platform-independent curve-fit methodology may be extended across platforms and field data. The methodologically consistent approach, in tandem with Landsat data, allows an effective scaling from plot to satellite phenological observations...|$|R

To characterize further these kinetic phases, {{we have developed}} a methodology whereby fluorescence total intensity and anisotropy stopped-flow data can be combined in a single analysis. Fluorescence total intensity and anisotropy are highly interrelated and contain two very complementary forms of information. Total-intensity changes are useful in determining changes in populations with differing quantum yields, whereas anisotropy changes contain additional contributions caused by the rotational dynamics of the species. For {{cases in which the}} fluorescence quantum yield increases, the observed rate of anisotropy change will be more rapid than the total-intensity change, whereas in cases in which the total intensity decreases, the observed change in anisotropy will lag behind. In all cases, with quantum yield changes the stopped-flow anisotropy <b>signals</b> cannot be <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> models consisting of exponentials.

In all of these cases, combined analysis of both data types revealed insights into reaction mechanism, which could not be obtained by either data type in isolation.

Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0. 33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R(2) [*]=[*] 0. 987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom.
