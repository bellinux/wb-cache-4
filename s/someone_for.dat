5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Drew (Drew Carey) {{and his friends}} Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) in their local bar, the Warsaw Tavern, {{discussing}} Brad Pitt. The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak) asks him to hire <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries to be polite, but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to Mr. Bell about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E

A young chandala boy may be intoxicated and then killed by the tantrika by deceit. However, Professor McDaniel notes that tantrikas she met in Tarapith disagreed. They believed that the appropriate corpse is chosen by the Goddess herself and murdering <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> the ritual is interfering with the Goddess' work.|$|E
25|$|The form of {{reasoning}} used in common law {{is known as}} casuistry or case-based reasoning. The common law, as applied in civil cases (as distinct from criminal cases), was devised {{as a means of}} compensating <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> wrongful acts known as torts, including both intentional torts and torts caused by negligence, and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating contracts. The type of procedure practiced in common law courts is known as the adversarial system; this is also a development of the common law.|$|E

Growth in library use and opening hours continued, so that by 1968 there were 3 fulltimers and a part-timer to help on Friday nights.|$|E

The storyline where an uke is reluctant to have anal sex with a seme {{is considered to be}} similar to the reader's reluctance to have sexual contact with <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than in the 'doggy style.' Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely fellates the seme, but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the seme.|$|E

In 2013 there were 3 cases of liver donation by live donors and 58 cases of kidney donation by live donors.

He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge <b>someone</b> <b>for</b> allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.|$|E

25|$|Article 7 {{prohibits the}} {{retroactive}} criminalisation of acts and omissions. No {{person may be}} punished for an act {{that was not a}} criminal offence {{at the time of its}} commission.
