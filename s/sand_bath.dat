40|$|In 1998, 30 {{juvenile}} elephants {{were captured}} in Botswana and transported to a holding facility in South Africa {{to be trained}} and sold to zoos and safari parks. The welfare of the 'Tuli Elephants' as they became known, became the source of acrimonious dispute between a number of conservation and animal groups. The case highlighted concerns over the welfare of elephants during capture, transport and confinement. Questions asked were: can an objective assessment of the effect on juvenile elephants on the removal from matriarchal group be made. This study was aimed to take an objective approach to assessing the welfare of captive juvenile elephants using behavioural and physiological methods of investigation. A behavioural study to identify indicators of stress was conducted in five groups of elephants subject to various husbandry systems. Thirteen behavioural indicators of stress were identified. A group of two elephants held in an enclosure 70 m 2 that was devoid of mud and <b>sand</b> <b>baths</b> showed {{the highest number of}} behavioural indicators of stress. Elephants in larger enclosures with mud and <b>sand</b> <b>baths</b> showed fewer indicators of stress. The group able to range freely during the day showed the least number of stress¬related indicators. Conventionally the physiological assessment of adrenal responses to stress relies upon blood sample collection and the measurement of glucocorticoids but this is impossible without immobilisation or restraint that influences results. This study validated a recently established enzyme immunoassay (EtA) measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in elephants. A preliminary investigation into the biological relevance of this non-invasive method was made for use in assessing welfare in elephants. Four juvenile elephants were injected i. m. with synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (Synacthen, Novartis; 2. 15 mg). Blood and faecal samples were collected over 4 hand 7 days respectively. Concentrations of serum cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites were determined using immunoassay. Variability of basal and peak values in blood and faeces were observed among the elephants. After ACTH injection, serum cortisol concentrations increased by 400 - 700 %. When compared to cortisol and corticosterone EIAs, 11 -oxoaetiocholanolone EIA proved best suited to measure cortisol metabolites. Concentrations of faecal 11, 17 ¬dioxoandrostanes increased by 570 - 1070 % reaching peak levels after 20 - 25. 5 h. Samples left outside could be collected up to 8 hrs after defecation without a significant effect on metabolite concentrations. A correlation between enclosure size, presence of stress-related behaviour and faecal 11, 17 -DOAs was observed. Elephants kept in small enclosures exhibited more stress-related behaviour and had higher levels of glucocorticoid metabolites than those ranging in a larger area. The results of the study suggest that non-invasive faecal monitoring of glucocorticoid metabolites is useful in investigating adrenal activity in African elephants.

40|$|Human induced {{climate change}} and {{dependence}} on non-renewable resources {{are two of the}} most serious issues facing society today. Substitution of renewable fuels produced from biomass addresses both of these issues. In the production of biofuels, {{it is important to know}} the biochemical make-up of the biomass feedstock. A high throughput assay developed by Murphy et al., provides a faster method than traditional methods and the standard developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships of biomass quality to process variables in the production of ethanol and to pyrolysis products. Corn stover samples from Iowa and Wisconsin with varying biomass quality were used for the study. The samples were pretreated with dilute acid liquid hot water in stainless steel reactors and <b>sand</b> <b>baths</b> at four severity levels and two solids loadings. Samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis using Genencor 2 ̆ 7 s Accellerase 1500 and XY at three different loadings. Combined sugar yields were determined at 0 hr and 24 hr hydrolysis time. These results were correlated to biomass quality as determined by the HTP assay. The result of correlation showed that severity is the most important factor in combined sugar yield, enzyme loading the second most important factor, and solids loading is not important. In the correlation to biomass quality, this study showed no strong correlations exist. The same corn stover samples were pyrolyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and flame ionization detection. Twenty four compounds were found and these were correlated to biomass quality parameters. Important compounds were shown to be levoglucosan, acetaldehyde, and multiple phenols (lignin derived compounds). Important correlations were found between biologically available carbohydrates and levoglucosan and acetaldehyde, along with unavailable carbohydrates and lignin with phenols. Biologically available carbohydrates correlated negatively to levoglucosan, the primary product of pyrolyzed cellulose, and positively to acetaldehyde, a secondary product. Unavailable carbohydrates and lignin correlated with various lignin derived products, including phenol, 4 -vinylphenol, and vanillin. ...|$|R

Jedna od najbitnijih prednosti te neklasične metode sinteze u odnosu na klasično zagrijavanje je znatno skraćenje reakcijskog vremena (s nekoliko sati, dana na nekoliko sekundi, minuta). Iz tih se razloga ta tehnika sve više upotrebljava u znanstveno-akademskim institucijama i u industriji. U ovom članku opisani su temeljni principi interakcije mikrovalnog zračenja i materije, djelovanje mikrovalova na reakcijsku smjesu te pregled uređaja i sintetskih metoda koje se primjenjuju u mikrovalnoj organskoj sintezi. Many chemists {{have been}} {{attracted}} by high-speed synthesis with microwaves in recent years. More than 2000 articles {{have been published}} in the area of microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) since the first reports on the use of microwave heating to accelerate organic chemical reactions by Gedye at el in 1986. 2 One of the advantages of MW over classical heating is reduction of reaction times from hours to minutes, but it is also known to reduce side reactions, increase yields, and improve reproducibility. Microwave-enhanced chemistry is based on the efficient heating of materials by "microwave dielectric heating" effects. This phenomenon is dependent on ability of a specific material (solvent or reagent) to absorb microwave energy and convert it into heat. Traditionally, organic reactions have been heated using an external heat source (oil <b>baths,</b> <b>sand</b> <b>baths</b> and heating jackets). These heating techniques are, however, rather slow and a temperature gradient can develop within the sample. In additional, local overheating can lead to product, substrate and reagent decomposition. In contrast, in microwave dielectric heating, the microwave energy is introduced into the chemical reactor remotely and direct access by the energy source to the reaction vessel is obtained. The microwave radiation passes through the walls of the vessel (borosilicate glass, quartz or teflon) and heats only the reactants and solvent, not the reaction vessel itself. If the apparaturs is properly designed, the temperature increase will be uniform throughout the sample, which can lead to less by-products and/or decomposition products. In pressurized systems, it is possible to rapidly increase the temperature far above the conventional boiling point of the solvent used. Since the introduction of microwave assisted organic synthesis in 1986, the main debate has dealt with the question of what actually alters the outcome of the synthesis. Is it an effect of the thermal heat generated by the microwaves or is it an effect specific for microwave heating? Today, it is thought that in the most cases the observed rate enhancements is purely thermal/kinetic effect due to the high instantaneous heating of the substance(s) above the normal bulk temperature when irradiating polar materials in a microwave field. The early stage experiments in MAOS were carried out in domestic, sometimes modified, kitchen microwave ovens, while the current trend is to use dedicated instruments which have only become available {{in the last few years}} for chemical synthesis. MAOS can be performed in standard organic solvent either under open- or sealed vessel conditions or as solventless ("dry-media") procedures where the reagents are preadsorbed onto either a more or less microwave transparent (silica, aluminia, or clay) or strongly absorbing (graphite) inorganic support, which can additionally be doped with a catalyst or reagent. The solvent-free approach was very popular particularly in the early days of MAOS since it allowed the safe use of domestic household microwave ovens and standard open-vessel technology. Many academic and industrial research groups are already using MAOS as a forefront technology for rapid optimization of reactions, for the efficient synthesis of new chemical entities, and for discovering and probing new chemical reactivity. ...|$|R
