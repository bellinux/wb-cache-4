25|$|Construction of two modern bridges at Stratford and Kamerunga, in 1977 and 1980 respectively, helped {{alleviate}} serious {{traffic disruption}} between Cairns and the Northern Beaches during the wet season when the Barron River's lengthy Tableland catchment area is inundated. In 1979, the Cairns public library opened. The opening of Ruth's Women's Shelter <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> shop in November 1980 was a {{practical way to}} provide a vital independent community service. Staffed by volunteers, and relying {{on the sale of}} donated stock, the shelter provided funds for setting up and running a women and children's crises accommodation shelter.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the city}} centre's {{buildings}} date from the early 20th century and before, the oldest buildings being St Peter's Church (which {{was built in the}} 13th century but has been largely extended and refurbished since the 15th century, situated on Lichfield Street) and a framed timber 17th-century building on Victoria Street which is now one of just two remaining in the area which was heavily populated by them until the turn of the 20th century. This building was originally a residential property, but later became the Hand Inn public house. It was completely restored in 1981 after a two-year refurbishment project and has been used by various businesses since then – currently as a <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> shop.|$|E
25|$|All of the novella's {{simple but}} elegant {{watercolour}} illustrations, which were {{integral to the}} story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist — which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted {{on the wrong side}} of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice. As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew. Two or three original Little Prince drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell. One rare original Little Prince watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Maxwell {{earned a}} B.A. in English {{literature}} from the University of California, Riverside in 1966. Shortly thereafter, she married Evan Maxwell, a now former newspaper reporter who spent over fifteen years {{working for the}} LA Times, covering international crime. Early in their marriage, Maxwell became very bored. Her husband worked from 4:00 PM to midnight, and as there was no bus service near their house and Evan needed the car for work, Maxwell found herself alone {{at home with their}} toddler son. Maxwell did not like television and claims to have read all of the science fiction books in the local public library, in addition to everything science fiction in a local <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> store. After having exhausted all of her local Science Fiction options, she seated herself in front of her ancient manual typewriter and began to write a book she would enjoy, even though she had no training in creative writing.|$|E
25|$|Kadıköy is a busy {{shopping}} district, with a {{wide variety}} of atmospheres and architectural styles. The streets are varied, some being narrow alleyways and others, such as Bahariye Caddesi, being pedestrian zones. Turkey's biggest food market is there, starting next to the Osman Ağa Mosque, and has an immense turnover of fresh foods and other products from all around Turkey, including a wide range of fresh fish and seafood, olive oil soap, and so on. There are also modern shopping centres, most notably the large Tepe Nautilus Shopping Mall behind the center of Kadıköy, and pavements crowded with street vendors selling socks, unlicensed copies of popular novels, and other products. In the streets behind the main post office, there is a large number of well-known bookshops selling both new and second-hand books, craft-shops and picture-framers, and a number of shops selling music CDs and related ephemera such as film posters and T-shirts. Hard Rock and Heavy Metal music is sold in the arcade named Akmar Pasajı, where associated items are also sold. On Sundays this area becomes a large <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> and music street market. Being a crowded shopping district, Kadıköy has many buskers, shoe shine boys, glue sniffers and schoolchildren in the streets selling flowers, chewing gum and packets of tissues.|$|E

500|$|Baen was {{replaced}} by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. [...] Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce [...] "clearly loved {{what he did and}} knew what he was talking about". [...] Pierce's replacement was Hank Stine, who took over in late 1978, though because of Galaxys irregular schedule Pierce's last issue was March–April 1979. [...] Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD's financial problems spelled the end. [...] Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. [...] Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, Galileo, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. [...] One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. [...] A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 April 1977, {{bibliophile}} Richard Booth conceived {{a publicity}} stunt in which he declared Hay-on-Wye to be an 'independent kingdom' with himself as its monarch and a National Anthem written by Les Penning. The tongue-in-cheek micronation of Hay-on-Wye has subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests for which some credit Booth. [...] In 2005, Booth announced plans to sell his bookshop and move to Germany; on this occasion local MP Roger Williams {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "His legacy will be that Hay changed from a small market town into a mecca for <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> lovers and this transformed the local economy".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{the area had}} several establishments that made Manchester, in Lee's description, a rival to Hamburg as the [...] "fun city of Europe". Unlicensed coffee bars where people listened to live and {{recorded}} music did not serve alcohol were effectively outside police control. A 1965 police report by plain-clothes cadets known as the [...] "mod squad", described them as unsanitary, dimly-lit drug dens, run by [...] "men of colour", where young men would be fleeced of their money and young women trapped into prostitution. The Manchester Corporation Act 1965 was passed after the report and closed most of them. The Cinephone Cinema {{was the first in}} Manchester to show 'continental' X-rated films mostly erotica. <b>Second-hand</b> <b>book</b> stalls and what Lee described as [...] "Manchester's very own Carnaby Street" [...] had opened by the early 1970s.

60|$|I was {{conscious}} of still another creative need, that of dramatizing my ideas, of converting them into action. And this need was to lead me farther than ever afield from the path of righteousness. The concrete realization of ideas, as many geniuses will testify, is an expensive undertaking, requiring a little pocket money; and I have already touched upon that subject. My father {{did not believe in}} pocket money. A sea story that my Cousin Donald Ewan gave me at Christmas inspired me to compose one of a somewhat different nature; incidentally, I deemed it a vast improvement on Cousin Donald's book. Now, if I only had a boat, with the assistance of Ham Durrett and Tom Peters, Gene Hollister and Perry Blackwood and other friends, this story of mine might be staged. There were, however, as usual, certain seemingly insuperable difficulties: in the first place, it was winter time; in the second, no facilities existed in the city for operations of a nautical character; and, lastly, my Christmas money amounted only to five dollars. It was my father who pointed out these and other objections. For, after a careful perusal of the price lists I had sent for, I had been forced to appeal to him to supply additional funds with which to purchase a row-boat. Incidentally, he read me a lecture on extravagance, referred to my last month's report at the Academy, and finished by declaring that he would not permit me to have a boat even in the highly improbable case of somebody's presenting me with one. Let it not be imagined that my ardour or my determination were extinguished. Shortly after I had retired from his presence {{it occurred to me that}} he had said nothing to forbid my making a boat, and the first thing I did after school that day was to procure, for twenty-five cents, a <b>second-hand</b> <b>book</b> on boat construction. The woodshed was chosen as a shipbuilding establishment. It was convenient--and my father never went into the back yard in cold weather. Inquiries of lumber-yards developing the disconcerting fact that four dollars and seventy-five cents was inadequate to buy the material itself, to say nothing of the cost of steaming and bending the ribs, I reluctantly abandoned the ideal of the graceful craft I had sketched, and compromised on a flat bottom. Observe how the ways of deception lead to transgression: I recalled the cast-off lumber pile of Jarvis, the carpenter, a good-natured Englishman, coarse and fat: in our neighbourhood his reputation for obscenity was so well known to mothers that I had been forbidden to go near him or his shop. Grits Jarvis, his son, who had inherited the talent, was also contraband. I can see now the huge bulk of the elder Jarvis as he stood in the melting, soot-powdered snow in front of his shop, and hear his comments on my pertinacity.|$|E
