50|$|While Amadio is {{the leading}} {{authority}} on unconscionable dealing in Australia, courts have frequently relied upon other cases to help define what constitutes <b>special</b> <b>disability.</b> Courts have extended the scope of what is <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> to include infatuation causing vulnerability and mental disorder. In Louth v Diprose, the Respondent, a solicitor, was infatuated with Louth. He provided her with a multitude of gratuitous gifts and a marriage proposal, which Louth declined. Louth suffered from depression and threatened to commit suicide {{if she were to}} become evicted. In response, the Respondent bought her a house and put it in Louth’s name. Following a deterioration of the relationship, the Respondent requested Louth to transfer the property in his name, which Louth refused. The Respondent initiated legal proceedings to recover the property, alleging he had suffered a <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> entitling rescission of the contract. Deane J, in the majority, held that Diprose’s infatuation placed him in a position of emotional dependence which placed Louth in a position of ascendancy and influence. Louth was found {{to be aware of the}} <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> she had deliberately created and exploited it for her benefit, even though Louth articulated her lack of romantic interest in Diprose on numerous occasions.|$|E

50|$|Intoxication is {{generally}} not regarded as a <b>special</b> <b>disability,</b> although in Blomley v Ryan {{it was found that}} the severity of Ryan's drunkenness, in combination with Blomley's knowledge of his alcoholism, was enough to warrant <b>special</b> <b>disability.</b> In Blomley v Ryan, the Plaintiff purchased a property from the Defendant at a very low price. During the transaction, the Defendant was of old age and heavily intoxicated which was conspicuous to the Plaintiff. After the transaction, the Defendant refused to perform the transfer of property and so the Plaintiff sought specific performance while the Defendant sought to set aside the contract. The Court ruled that ‘mere drunkenness’ is not a defence to resist a contract. However, it stated that where there is knowledge of one party that the other party is seriously inebriated and that party takes advantage of such inebriation, equity will intervene to refuse specific performance.|$|E

5000|$|Aptitude, {{measured}} by standard aptitude tests, {{in this context}} is interpreted as [...] "the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of a learning task".Several studies show that majority of students can achieve mastery in a learning task, but the time that they need to spend on is different.Bloom argues that there are 1 to 5 percent of students who have special talent for learning a subject (especially music and foreign languages) and there are also around five percent of students who have <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> for learning a subject. For other 90% of students, aptitude is merely an indicator of the rate of learning.Additionally, Bloom argues that attitude for a learning task is not constant and can be changed by environmental conditions or learning experience at school or home.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study was to compare the perceptions of principals, special education administrators, and mild <b>disabilities</b> <b>special</b> education teachers about how special education teachers are used within the elementary school setting across Indiana.

Statistical analysis indicated {{there were significant differences}} among participants for the constructs of support, time/scheduling, and professional development issues facing mild <b>disabilities</b> <b>special</b> education teachers. Further factor analysis showed significant differences among participants for specific survey items from the roles, support, time/scheduling, and professional development data sets. Qualitative analysis revealed participants noted the following as barriers: time/scheduling, caseload, and building level expectations. Results also indicated mild <b>disabilities</b> <b>special</b> education teachers were used as: an interventionist, a team member, or a consultant. Mild <b>disabilities</b> <b>special</b> education teachers have an expanded role and there may be barriers to using them effectively.

5000|$|When the son's {{business}} failed, the Amadios had {{the contract}} set aside due to unconscionable dealing by the bank. The {{court held that}} the bank manager knew about the “special disability” of Amadios, referring to their advanced age, lack of business acumen, lack of fluency in written English, and their reliance on their son's inadequate disclosure of his finances. A <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> is one which seriously affects the ability of the person subject to it to make sensible decisions of their own best interest. This [...] "disability" [...] was sufficiently evident to the bank, as the stronger party, to make their acceptance of the weaker party's assent to the transaction manifestly unfair. The bank did not ensure that the Amadios fully understood the nature of the transaction; therefore the bank’s taking advantage of the opportunity that presented itself was unconscionable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{judgment}} of Deane J, {{was referred to}} by other judges. He said, [...] "In the present case ... it was ... evident to the bank that Mr. and Mrs. Amadio stood in need of advice as to the nature and effect of the transaction into which they were entering. It is apparent that any such advice would have included the importance to a guarantor of ascertaining from the bank {{the state of the}} customer's account which was being guaranteed and any unusual features of the account. If such information had been obtained by Mr. and Mrs. Amadio, they would not, on the evidence and {{in the light of the}} learned trial judge's finding, have entered into the guarantee/mortgage at all. The whole transaction should properly be seen as flowing from the <b>special</b> <b>disability</b> which was evident to the bank and as being unfair, unjust and unreasonable." [...] The customer's account stated here is that of their son who brought the bank guarantee documents to his parents. The bank knew of the poor state of the son's business accounts, and the bank and the son had a history of closely linked business relations with each other. Wilson J agreed with Deane J.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{though many}} of their views overlapped, the two did {{disagree}} on a major point. Terman, again, believed that intelligence was an inheritable trait and focused only on defining and describing it. Hollingworth did acknowledge the role of inheritance, but also believed that environmental and educational factors {{had an effect on}} intelligence's potential. As a result of this belief, she was more interested in how to properly nurture gifted children and their education. Her work of administering Binet intelligence tests at the Clearing House primed her for work with the gifted, and naturally with the mentally defective as well. Hollingworth also performed research on this other side of the intelligence spectrum as well. She learned, through working with mentally defective children, that many of them actually had normal intelligence. Yet, these children were suffering from adjustment problems during adolescence. From this discovery she began to focus more on this population. She published several books on the topic: The Psychology of Subnormal Children (1920, Special Talents and Defects (1923) and The Psychology of the Adolescent (1928). The last of these became a leading textbook for the following two decades. It even replaced one written by G. Stanley Hall. Several magazines noted the importance of the book and published excerpts from the chapter, [...] "Psychology Weaning." [...] The book gives several examples of this psychological process in which it is successfully completed in order to guide puzzled parents and aid them with their children. She describes it as similar to the [...] "physical weaning from infantile methods of taking food, it may be attended by emotional outbursts or depressions, which are likely to come upon people whenever habits have to be broken." [...] Additional writing done on children with mental defects can be found in her books, The Problem of Mental Disorder (1934) and in Psychology of <b>Special</b> <b>Disability</b> in Spelling (1918). She even wrote her own textbooks for the classes she taught at Columbia.|$|E

40|$|The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has {{released}} a Specialist Disability Accommodation Position Paper on Draft Pricing and Payments. This is the NDIA’s strategy {{to increase the}} long-term supply of housing for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants. It aims to foster the development of innovative housing solutions. Young people with disability living in nursing homes {{are one of the}} most marginalised and isolated groups of people in our society. More than 6, 200 people under the age of 65 are stuck in nursing homes. Another 200 people under 50 are admitted to nursing homes each year. This is a serious social issue that can and must be fixed. The NDIS will provide crucial funding for the support that these people need to live in the community. However, the NDIS cannot on its own stop the inappropriate placement of young people in nursing homes. More accessible and affordable housing needs to be built. The policy outlined in NDIA <b>Special</b> <b>Disability</b> Accommodation position paper is designed to pay for the cost of housing for 28, 000 NDIS participants with high support needs. The housing payment rates set by the NDIA cover the high costs of development and ongoing maintenance required by people with disability. After decades of underinvestment, governments have made the funding available to replicate and scale a range of innovative housing and support options.  For people with disability who have the highest need for support and accessibility, the NDIS housing payment will bridge the gap between what people with disability can reasonably afford and the cost of building highly accessible housing. This policy lays the foundation for developing the range and scale of housing needed. The NDIS housing payment and policy provides a unique opportunity to trial some innovative, transformative financing models that could be used to fund social housing for other disadvantaged people, including a broader group of people with disability. The next step is for investors and the housing sector to come together and create the revolution in housing that young people in nursing homes have been waiting for...|$|E
40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>Disability</b> Trusts (SDTs) were {{introduced}} in September 2006 to assist parents and immediate family members wishing to make private financial provision for the current or future accommodation and care of a family member with a severe disability. SDTs were designed to enable families to make these provisions without reducing the person 2 ̆ 7 s entitlement to disability support pensions, age pensions, veteran pensions or related benefits. Only {{a small number of}} SDTs have been established and there are substantial concerns about the effectiveness of the current arrangements. The eligibility requirements for SDTs are overly restrictive, such that many people with severe disabilities, including intellectual disabilities and disability resulting from mental illnesses, are not able to benefit from the trusts. The concessional limit on trust assets is too low and does not allow families and carers to effectively provide for the future. The tax arrangements which currently apply to SDTs diminish their value for carers and people with disabilities. The application of capital gains tax to the sale of a beneficiary 2 ̆ 7 s primary residence and the high rate of tax applied to trust earnings are a particular disincentive to investing in the trusts. The tight restriction on eligible uses of SDTs is a major shortcoming in the current arrangements. People see little point in setting aside funds if those funds cannot be used to provide the accommodation, care and support that their loved one needs to live as independently as possible. The committee has made several focussed recommendations which will significantly improve the operation of SDTs and fulfil the original intention of assisting families that are able to make private financial provision for a member with severe disability. These recommendations can be implemented quickly through legislative changes. The committee has also made a number of wider recommendations to increase awareness of the trusts and reduce the complexity and costs of establishing and maintaining a SDT.  ...|$|E
