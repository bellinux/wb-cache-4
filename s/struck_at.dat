5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Knowing {{that the}} Byzantine army was {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the right flank of the Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the Byzantines left center at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had {{at the start of}} the battle.|$|E

5|$|The act {{provided}} for {{a maximum of}} 40,000 medals, to be <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the Philadelphia Mint, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would {{be turned over to}} a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873. That section permitted medals of a national character to be <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854.|$|E

5|$|Ashina She'er's {{soldiers}} were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> Kucha {{from the north}} by moving through the Dzungarian Basin, which was {{the territory of the}} Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a defensible position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Further {{missions}} by II./KG 54 to RAF Croydon were cancelled. I./KG 54 <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) base at Gosport. ZG 2 {{was supposed}} to provide escort during one these attacks, and in a breakdown of communications, arrived over the target without their Ju 88s, which had been ordered to stand down. One Bf 110 was shot down by No. 238 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> {{the heart of}} American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor. It raised doubts about {{the reliability of the}} Afghan forces that are being trained by the United States and its allies, and on the practicality of Western exit strategies that involve training the Afghan army and policy with the aim of enabling them to fight the Taliban on their own.|$|E
5|$|Most {{units of}} Luftflotte 2 {{received}} {{the order to}} abandon morning operations, but some began their attacks aimed at airfields and ports in southern Britain.kg 76 abandoned its attack on Debden but <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> RAF Kenley and other airfields in Kent and Essex. Losses and results are unknown. KG 27 also abandoned most of its operations. III./KG 27 did attempt {{to make it through}} to the Bristol docks, losing one He 111 to No. 87 Squadron RAF in the attempt. Little damage was done.|$|E

With renewed attacks on Kansong {{and near the}} Chang-San-Got Peninsula 11 and 13 November, New Jersey completed her first {{tour of duty in}} Korea.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, {{the workers}} of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton {{proposed}} that their wages be restored to that prior to the recently imposed 10% reduction. On July 24 at 12:00 P.M., 1,000 employees of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, unaffiliated with the railroad, peacefully walked out due to their own wage reduction. The railroad workers <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> 6:00 P.M. that same day.|$|E
5|$|Public {{and artistic}} {{opinion of the}} new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint {{officials}} began plans to replace them, after the design's minimum term expired in 1916. The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand, but {{before the end of}} the year, the Mercury dime, Standing Liberty quarter, and Walking Liberty half dollar had begun production. Most dates in the Barber coin series are not difficult to obtain, but the 1894 dime <b>struck</b> <b>at</b> the San Francisco Mint (1894-S), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.|$|E
