The status of radiometric source standards in the far ultraviolet is briefly reviewed, and the hydrogen arc and NBS calibration facility are described in detail.

40|$|This {{work has}} {{established}} uncertainty limits for the EUO filament pyrometers, digital pyrometers, two-color automatic pyrometers, and the standards used to certify these instruments (Table 1). If symmetrical limits are used, filament pyrometers calibrated in Production have certification uncertainties of {{not more than}} {+-} 20. 5 C traceable to NIST over the certification period. Uncertainties of these pyrometers were roughly {+-} 14. 7 C before introduction of the working standard that allowed certification in the field. Digital pyrometers addressed in this report have symmetrical uncertainties of not more than {+-} 12. 7 C or {+-} 18. 1 C when certified on a Y- 12 Standards Laboratory <b>strip</b> <b>lamp</b> or in a production area tube furnace, respectively. Uncertainty estimates for automatic two-color pyrometers certified in Production are {+-} 16. 7 C. Additional uncertainty and bias are introduced when measuring production melt temperatures. A - 19. 4 C bias was measured in a large 1987 data set which {{is believed to be}} caused primarily by use of Pyrex{trademark} windows (not present in current configuration) and window fogging. Large variability (2 {sigma} = 28. 6 C) exists in the first 10 m of the hold period. This variability is attributed to emissivity variation across the melt and reflection from hot surfaces. For runs with hold periods extending to 20 m, the uncertainty approaches the calibration uncertainty of the pyrometers. When certifying pyrometers on a <b>strip</b> <b>lamp</b> at the Y- 12 Standards Laboratory, it is important to limit ambient temperature variation (23 {+-} 4 C), to order calibration points from high to low temperatures, to allow 6 m for the lamp to reach thermal equilibrium (12 m for certifications below 1200 C) to minimize pyrometer bias, and to calibrate the pyrometer if error exceeds vendor specifications. A procedure has been written to assure conformance...|$|E

30|$|To {{monitor the}} plasma {{properties}} the optical emission spectrometer (OES) was coupled {{to the process}} chamber via a glass fiber. The entire system was calibrated with a tungsten <b>strip</b> <b>lamp.</b> The influence of the process parameters on the carbon dimer d 3 Π → a 3 Π Swan band emission at 516  nm was investigated and a correlation with the film properties (quality of the graphene, nucleation density of diamond, growth rate of diamond) was made. A linear correlation between {{the intensity of the}} C 2 -line and the actual C 2 concentration in the plasma has been proved (Goyette et al. 1998) and therefore the measurement of a C 2 /Hα-ratio provides quantitative information about the plasma and thus can be considered to be a reasonable measure for the plasma chemistry.|$|E
40|$|After reconstruction, {{the ruby}} Thomson {{scattering}} diagnostic for the W 7 -AS stellarator {{is now in}} operation to again cover the complete plasma cross section (420 mm), where the former photomultiplier-based polychromator system {{has been replaced by}} two individual Littrow-type polychromator setups (focal length 50 cm), using intensified charge coupled device cameras for light detection. A single-pulse ruby laser with high pulse energy is used as a light source. The light scattered by the plasma electrons is imaged upon a set of 45 fiber bundles. 30 bundles provide a high spatial resolution of 4 mm at the inner edge of the plasma. The remaining part of the view chord is observed with a spatial resolution of 20 mm. At the output, the fiber bundles form the entrance slits of the Littrow-type spectrometers. The spectral resolution of the edge spectrometer can be modified by exchanging the diffraction grating. Depending on the installed diffraction grating (600 or 1800 lines/mm) a total wavelength range of 80 nm (suitable for plasma edge investigations) or 320 nm (suitable for gradient investigations) can be surveyed. The spectral intensity and geometrical calibration of the presented diagnostic setup can be done in situ by means of a neon spectral lamp and a calibrated tungsten <b>strip</b> <b>lamp.</b> The absolute sensitivity calibration for the system is achieved using either Raman (at 723. 8 nm) or Rayleigh (at laser wavelength) scattering as hydrogen gas filled up in the vacuum vessel (up to 100 mbar).

40|$|Calibration {{procedures}} for Thomson scattering systems based on television-like cameras, so-called TVTS systems, are described. The TVTS {{systems of the}} Rijnhuizen Tokamak Project (RTP), the TJ-II stellarator, and the Torus Experiment for Technology Oriented Research (TEXTOR) tokamak combine a 10 - 15 J ruby laser as a source with an intensified charge coupled device camera as a detector. A tungsten <b>strip</b> <b>lamp</b> in combination with an integrating sphere is used to calibrate all similar to 10 (5) pixels of the camera relatively to each other. Rayleigh scattering on hydrogen or nitrogen is used to perform an absolute calibration of the complete detection system. Great {{emphasis is placed on}} possible systematic errors on the determination of the electron temperature T-e and density n(e) due to the calibration, such as tungsten lamp temperature, detoriation of the detection window, long term stability, laser beam alignment, and detector linearity. The long term stability of the system was tested by comparing different sets of calibration factors. Over a period of 1 / 2 yr the values of the calibration factors varied by less than 5 %. Using the same Thomson scattering data but different sets of calibration factors the T-e values varied even less than 1 %. A two camera technique was used to search for possible unknown systematic errors in the determination of T-e profiles. It appears that these systematic errors are about half of the observational error on T-e. Density fluctuations can be determined with an accuracy equal to the statistical error of similar to 3 %, while the systematic error on n(e) appeared to be similar to 10 %, which can be corrected for using interferometer data. As a result, these TVTS systems can measure T-e and n(e) profiles with similar to 100 (RTP) or 120 (TEXTOR) spatial elements along the full plasma diameter with observational errors on T-e of similar to 6 % in the range of 25 eV- 6 keV, at n(e) = 2 x 10 (19) m(- 3) and 10 J laser energy.

40|$|Pyrotechnic {{mixtures}} mostly {{consist of}} systems {{of fuel and}} oxidizer particles with defined mixture ratios and particle sizes. After ignition by a defined energy input, they react highly exothermic with a high energy release in a combustion process and produce a bright shining reaction zone with light emission from UV till the far MIR. Especially for colorful emission and high temperatures, metals or metal compounds are used. Emission spectroscopy is a well-known experimental measurement technique to examine the reaction zone and burning behavior of such mixtures. By analyzing the resulting emission spectra, valuable information can be obtained: the intermediate and end product occurrence, the particles' surface and gas phase temperature, the emissivity, the radiation of energy, the ClE-color, and the reaction mechanism. In the case of pyrotechnic mixtures, most of this information can be received from the emitted light in the UV NIS wavelength range. In the gas phase of the reaction, the intermediate products, e. g. atoms and diatomic molecules, emit because of a stimulated electronic transition. In the UV NlS wavelength range, they show atomic lines and diatomic molecule band systems. The background emission is usually gray body radiation of the solid particles. Because of the high temperature, the maximum of the gray body function is in the near-infrared wavelength range and therefore, it is still visible in the UV NIS range. A valuable experimental device to investigate pyrotechnic mixtures is a window bomb. At lCT, a color high-speed camera and a fast grating UV NIS spectrometer are used to monitor the reaction process. The window bomb is a chimney type high pressure autoclave, which can be operated with different gases and pressured up to 15 MPa. For the correction of the intensity ratios of atomic lines and diatomic molecule band systems and to obtain information about the radiated energy, an intensity calibration is necessary. It corrects for different sensitivities of the detector and correlates the measured intensities with the radiance. The calibration was realized using a calibrated light source with known radiation, in our case a Tungsten <b>strip</b> <b>lamp.</b> In addition, the optical setup was adapted to limit the view angle. By analyzing the received UV NIS spectra of the experiments, the chronological occurrence of different species can be reconstructed. The gas phase temperature and the molecules emissivity {{can be obtained by}} modeling the spectrum from the atomic lines and the diatomic molecule band systems. In this work, we present how emission spectra are obtained in the UV /VIS range, as well as how the spectra are analyzed. We demonstrate the technique in various examples...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Part I. Absolute gf-values for 21 lines of singly ionized chromium (Cr II) in the spectral region 3118 - 4559 [angstroms] are presented. Mixtures of Cr(CO) [subscript 6] and argon, heated by reflected shock waves to {{temperatures in the}} range 7920 [degrees]K to 8730 [degrees]K, were {{used to measure the}} emission intensity of ionized chromium lines. A three inch diameter shock tube was employed, with the light being observed along the shock tube axis in order to observe directly the curve of growth of each spectral line. The emitted intensities observed were converted to gf-values by means of a comparison with a calibrated tungsten <b>strip</b> <b>lamp.</b> Results are compared with values obtained from arc spectra by Corliss and Bozman[superscript 1] at the National Bureau of Standards. In general, our results are a factor of 9 below the latter measurements. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Part II. An experimental investigation of the approach to equilibrium ionization and electronic excitation for chromium behind shock waves in Cr(CO) [subscript 6]-argon mixtures is described. Mixtures composed of from 0. 0043 % to 0. 036 %o Cr(CO) [subscript 6] were heated by reflected shock waves to temperatures between 6170 [degrees]K and 8600 [degrees]K, and the emission from excited states of Cr I and Cr II was simultaneously measured by photoelectric means with a time resolution of about 3 microseconds. Relaxation toward equilibrium ionization and excited state population was observed to occur within from 12 to 60 microseconds, depending upon the temperature and chromium concentration behind the reflected shock. In measurements in which equilibrium ionization is 95 % or more, the populations of excited states of Cr I show a pronounced "overshoot" as these states become populated before ionization has depleted the supply of neutral chromium. From a study of the relaxation of Cr I and Cr II upper state populations, it is concluded that ionization proceeds by a multistep autocatalytic process dominated by collisions between chromium atoms and electrons released in prior ionization of chromium. The dependence of the relaxation rates upon the temperature behind the reflected shock wave and upon the concentration of chromium was determined. If it is assumed that the electron and atom temperatures did not differ appreciably during the relaxation period, the variation in the relaxation rate with temperature indicates a 3. 1 [plus or minus] 0. 3 ev activation energy for chromium ionization, which is significantly less than the ionization potential (6. 74 ev). A simplified reaction mechanism is proposed which qualitatively explains the observed relaxation behavior of Cr I and Cr II. Part III. The spectral absorption coefficients in electronic band systems of diatomic emitters have been computed in the past by models that may be described as "the just overlapping line model" and a model "utilizing a smeared out rotational structure". Although the basic relations are obtained by utilizing somewhat different physical arguments, the resulting equations are, in fact, identical. Spectral absorption coefficients have been calculated for the NO [ [...] . ]-bands at 2000 [degrees]K by using the approximate theoretical relations. The calculated results are in good agreement with estimates derived by numerical calculations in which, however, the absorption coefficient data were averaged over intervals of 2000 cm.

50|$|A major {{difference}} with the Glaspaleis {{is that the}} outer wall is not made of glass. Apart from the top floors, there are even hardly any windows. The traditional natural light solution of having a large central hall, cutting through all the floors, with a glass roof, wasn't chosen either because that would take up too much (expensive) space. This means that almost all the light {{has to come from}} lamps. The outer wall (except for the two upper floors) is made of marble, interspaced with horizontal <b>strips</b> of <b>lamps</b> that are lit at night. This gives the building a very horizontal visual aspect. Here too, functionality was sought, with no unnecessary decoration, but without giving the building the 'cold' appearance that many new buildings of the time had. As with the Glaspaleis, the floors are supported by columns, interspaced 8 m, with the outer columns 2.5 m from the outer wall. The roof of the top floor is steel construction. The gross floor height is 4.15 m on all floors, with a net height of 3.3 m. The building is heated with city heating ('stadsverwarming'), using mostly heated air, with a capacity of 2.5 MW. Air conditioning in the souterrain has a capacity of 35,000 m³ per hour, meaning the air is refreshed (and cooled) six times per hour. For the other floors that is 4 times per hour, except in the lunchroom and kitchen, where it is eight respectively eighteen times per hour (and not cooled). In total, every hour 304,000 m³ of air is transported through 3.5 km of ducts. The main entrance has an 'air curtain' with a capacity of 63,000 m³ per hour.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} optimum time at which {{fluorescein}} patterns of gas permeable lenses (GPs) should be evaluated. METHODS: Aligned, 0. 2 mm steep and 0. 2 mm flat GPs were fitted to 17 patients (aged 20. 6 ± 1. 1 years, 10 male). Fluorescein {{was applied to}} their upper temporal bulbar conjunctiva with a moistened fluorescein <b>strip.</b> Digital slit <b>lamp</b> images (CSO, Italy) at 10 × magnification of the fluorescein pattern viewed with blue light through a yellow filter were captured every 15 s. Fluorescein intensity in central, mid peripheral and edge regions of the superior, inferior, temporal and nasal quadrants of the lens were graded subjectively using a + 2 to - 2 scale and using ImageJ software on the simultaneously captured images. RESULTS: Subjectively graded and objectively image analysed fluorescein intensity changed with time (p< 0. 001), lens region (centre, mid-periphery and edge: p< 0. 05) and there was interaction between lens region with lens fit (p< 0. 001). For edge band width, {{there was a significant}} effect of time (F= 118. 503, p< 0. 001) and lens fit (F= 5. 1249, p= 0. 012). The expected alignment, flat and steep fitting patterns could be seen from approximately after 30 to 180 s subjectively and 15 to 105 s in captured images. CONCLUSION: Although the stability of fluorescein intensity can start to decline in as little as 45 s post fluorescein instillation, the diagnostic pattern of alignment, steep or flat fit is seen in each meridian by subjective observation from about 30 s to 3 min indicating this is the most appropriate time window to evaluate GP lenses in clinical practice...|$|R

6000|$|A little fellow, called Craik and nicknamed Belfast, abused {{the ship}} violently, romancing on principle, {{just to give}} the new hands {{something}} to think over. Archie, sitting aslant on his sea-chest, kept his knees out of the way, and pushed the needle steadily through a white patch {{in a pair of}} blue trousers. Men in black jackets and stand-up collars, mixed with men bare-footed, bare-armed, with coloured shirts open on hairy chests, pushed against one another {{in the middle of the}} forecastle. The group swayed, reeled, turning upon itself with the motion of a scrimmage, in a haze of tobacco smoke. All were speaking together, swearing at every second word. A Russian Finn, wearing a yellow shirt with pink stripes, stared upwards, dreamy-eyed, from under a mop of tumbled hair. Two young giants with smooth, baby faces--two Scandinavians--helped each other to spread their bedding, silent, and smiling placidly at the tempest of good-humoured and meaningless curses. Old Singleton, the oldest able seaman in the ship, set apart on the deck right under the <b>lamps,</b> <b>stripped</b> to the waist, tattooed like a cannibal chief all over his powerful chest and enormous biceps. Between the blue and red patterns his white skin gleamed like satin; his bare back was propped against the heel of the bowsprit, and he held a book at arm's length before his big, sunburnt face. With his spectacles and a venerable white beard, he resembled a learned and savage patriarch, the incarnation of barbarian wisdom serene in the blasphemous turmoil of the world. He was intensely absorbed, and as he turned the pages an expression of grave surprise would pass over his rugged features. He was reading [...] "Pelham." [...] The popularity of Bulwer Lytton in the forecastles of Southern-going ships is a wonderful and bizarre phenomenon. What ideas do his polished and so curiously insincere sentences awaken in the simple minds of the big children who people those dark and wandering places of the earth? What meaning can their rough, inexperienced souls find in the elegant verbiage of his pages? What excitement?--what forgetfulness?--what appeasement? Mystery! Is it the fascination of the incomprehensible?--is it the charm of the impossible? Or are those beings who exist beyond the pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical disclosure of a resplendent world that exists within the frontier of infamy and filth, within that border of dirt and hunger, of misery and dissipation, that comes down on all sides to the water's edge of the incorruptible ocean, and is the only thing they know of life, the only thing they see of surrounding land--those life-long prisoners of the sea? Mystery! Singleton, who had sailed to the southward since the age of twelve, who in the last forty-five years had lived (as we had calculated from his papers) no more than forty months ashore--old Singleton, who boasted, with the mild composure of long years well spent, that generally from the day he was paid off from one ship till the day he shipped in another he seldom was in a condition to distinguish daylight--old Singleton sat unmoved in the clash of voices and cries, spelling through [...] "Pelham" [...] with slow labour, and lost in an absorption profound enough to resemble a trance. He breathed regularly. Every time he turned the book in his enormous and blackened hands the muscles of his big white arms rolled slightly under the smooth skin. Hidden by the white moustache, his lips, stained with tobacco-juice that trickled down the long beard, moved in inward whisper. His bleared eyes gazed fixedly from behind the glitter of black-rimmed glasses. Opposite to him, and on a level with his face, the ship's cat sat on the barrel of the windlass in the pose of a crouching chimera, blinking its green eyes at its old friend. It seemed to meditate a leap on to the old man's lap over the bent back of the ordinary seaman who sat at Singleton's feet. Young Charley was lean and long-necked. The ridge of his backbone made a chain of small hills under the old shirt. His face of a street-boy--a face precocious, sagacious, and ironic, with deep downward folds on each side of the thin, wide mouth--hung low over his bony knees. He was learning to make a lanyard knot with a bit of an old rope. Small drops of perspiration stood out on his bulging forehead; he sniffed strongly from time to time, glancing out of the corners of his restless eyes at the old seaman, who took no notice of the puzzled youngster muttering at his work.|$|R
