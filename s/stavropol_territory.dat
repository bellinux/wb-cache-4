50|$|Since the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, many have begun seeing Russian Cossacks as defenders of Russian sovereignty. Cossacks have not only reestablished all of their hosts, they have also taken over police and even administrative duties in their homelands. The Russian military also took advantage of the patriotic feelings among the Cossacks and as the hosts become larger and more organised; it has in the past turned over some of its surplus technology to them. On par with that, the Cossacks also play a large cultural role in the South of Russia. Since the rural ethnic Russian inhabitants of the Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and <b>Stavropol</b> <b>territories,</b> {{as well as of the}} Autonomous republics of the Northern Caucasus, regard themselves as consisting almost exclusively of at least spiritual Cossack descendants, the region has had a reputation, even in the Soviet times, for its high discipline, low crime and conservative views.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} data of {{an empirical}} {{study of the}} relationship between aggressive manifestations and self-regulatory personality characteristics of teachers. It is assumed that the features of aggressive manifestations are determined by personal characteristics and the cultural context of the teachers' lives. The level of self-regulation development is also shaped by sociocultural conditions. The study involved 278 teachers aged 20 — 72 years from the <b>Stavropol</b> and Krasnodar <b>territories</b> and from the republics of North Ossetia-Alania, Karachaevo-Cherkessia, and Kabardino-Balkaria. The system of research methods was based on the integration of nomothetic and ideographic approaches and included observation and psychological testing. The study revealed certain differences in aggressive manifestations among the respondents from different regions of southern Russia. It was found that the level of conscious self-regulation development is not an invariant and has its cross-cultural specifics. Indicators of conscious self-regulation (planning, evaluation of results), racial tolerance and restraint in risk situations are significant predictors of aggression management...|$|R

40|$|Rational use of raw {{materials}} and waste {{is one of the}} most important factors determining the effectiveness of any processing enterprise. Industrial wastes of mining and metallurgical industries are a valuable source of many elements. However, little activity of the mineral and inconsistent chemical and phase composition of the waste reduce their attractiveness for use as a secondary raw material, and the presence of heavy metals and water-soluble compounds is a serious environmental threat. Fractional excretion of elements that make up the slag can be carried out with the help of their recovery by disintegration-wave method. The paper presents a machine-hardware circuits for the implementation of recovery process of slag and disintegrator design. In conducting research on the example of slag samples of the enterprises in <b>Stavropol</b> and Krasnoyarsk <b>territories,</b> it was found out that the observed enrichment of slags on the composition of iron takes place, its physical and chemical activity increases and persists for a long period of time. These facts were noted in the study of the microstructure and the results of spectral analysis of the initial slags and subjected to recovery by disintegration-wave method. The results analysis led to the conclusion about the possibility of waste recovery of mining and metallurgical industries with by disintegration-wave method. Resulting in the processing materials with enhanced activity of the mineral part and certain chemical and phase composition, can be used as raw material for the production of metallurgical, cement and other industries. </p...|$|R
