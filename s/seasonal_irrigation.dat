Sensor based treatments used a soil moisture sensor buried 10 cm deep within the crop root zone to maintain soil moisture at a set level. The two sensor based irrigation treatments with the largest <b>seasonal</b> <b>irrigation</b> volume resulted in yields similar to the two largest seasonal volume daily irrigation treatments (marketable yields ranged between 17, 000 and 20, 000 kg/ha for these treatments), but used approximately 50 % less <b>seasonal</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. This resulted in irrigation water use efficiencies of 1209 - 2316 kg/ha/m 3 for the sensor based treatments while those of daily treatments ranged from 703 to 1612 kg/ha/m 3. Sensor based irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher soil volumetric moisture levels at the 15 and 30 cm depths.

Fitting Mitscherlich&rsquo;s equation modified by Giardini and Borin to the experimental data of each crop, the curve response parameters have been calculated: A = maximum achievable yield in the considered area (t ha- 1); b = extra-irrigation water used by the crop (m 3 ha- 1); c = water action factor (ha m- 3); K, calculated only for tomato crop.,decreasing factor due to the water exceeding the optimal <b>seasonal</b> <b>irrigation</b> volume (100 % of the Crop Maximum Evapotranspiration less effective rainfall, ETMlr). The A values, using the prices of the agricultural produces and the irrigation water tariffs applied by the Consorzio Irriguo della Capitanata, have been converted in Value of Production (VP) less the fixed and variable irrigation costs (VPlic). The equation parameters were used in a non linear mathematical model written in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System), in order to define the best irrigation water allocation amongst the 9 crops across {{the entire range of}} water availability and the volume of maximum economical advantage, hypothesising that each crop occupied the same surface (1 ha).

The objective of the paper is to propose a methodology to evaluate the optimal <b>seasonal</b> <b>irrigation</b> depth based on the crop {{production function}}, the field distribution uniformity, and economic considerations. An extended unpublished database experimentally obtained on the onion crop on the island of Kula, Hawaii, was initially used to assess the crop WPF. The combination between the crop WPF and the model representing the field distribution uniformity allowed determining the area subjected to underirrigation and overirrigation, as well as the corresponding yield, that were finally averaged across the field. An economic comparison was also carried out in order to evaluate the optimal seasonal water depth aimed at maximizing the farmer's gross margin under different irrigation system distribution uniformities and water prices. According to the experimental data, it was observed that the onion crop is more sensitive to deficit than overirrigation, as well as that a quadratic model, valid for the entire range of the seasonal applied irrigation depths fitted better than a two-slope linear model, representing separately the conditions of deficit and over-irrigation. Moreover, the maximum yield, as well as maximum gross margin, can be obtained by applying average irrigation depths lower than those which correspond to the maximum yield, with percentages that declined at decreasing of water distribution coefficient and at increasing of water price. The proposed methodology can be applied even for other crops once the corresponding WPFs aree known, thus providing interesting evaluations that are useful for irrigation planning...|$|E

Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the involvement of berry hormonal status in fruit composition in response to regulated deficit irrigation applied during different phenological stages in two grapevine cultivars. Methods and Results The study was carried out on fruiting cuttings of two cultivars of Vitis vinifera L., Tempranillo and Graciano. Treatments were: (i) early water deficit from fruitset to onset of veraison (early deficit); (ii) late water deficit from onset of veraison to harvest (late deficit); and (iii) plants regularly irrigated (Control). Both early water deficit and late water-deficit strategies modified evolution of indole- 3 -acetic acid, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, which was related to changes in berry size, increases in phenolic substances and accumulation of amines. Conclusions Differential sensitivity of Tempranillo and Graciano grapevines to seasonal water stress was mediated, at least in part, by alterations in hormonal status of berries at the time of water stress imposition.
