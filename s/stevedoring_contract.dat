Marie Leonides Galiber Ffrench and her husband Gustav Augustus Ffrench operated a commercial warehouse and <b>stevedoring</b> <b>contracting</b> firm. Ffrenches second wife was Esther Levy-Maduro who, though a Catholic herself, was of an illustrious Sephardic Jewish family. The Gereau and Ffrench families have been in communication since that time.

50|$|An early {{example of}} {{criminal}} {{use of the}} weapon in the United States was {{the assassination of the}} New Orleans chief of police, David Hennessy, in October 1890. The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company <b>stevedores</b> whose <b>contracts</b> did not fall {{under the auspices of the}} local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. Anti-Italian provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the New Orleans Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.|$|R

50|$|Although it {{is assumed}} that all the {{branches}} under the separation of powers do not overlap, for example like the US, there is sometimes a ‘common ground’ between all three levels. In Australia there is little separation between the executive and the legislature, with the executive required to be drawn from, and maintain the confidence of, the legislature. In Victorian <b>Stevedoring</b> & General <b>Contracting</b> Co Pty Ltd & Meakes v Dignan the High Court of Australia held that a strict division between these two levels was not practical and re-affirmed the Constitution to outline this (German, 2012).|$|R
5000|$|In Victorian <b>Stevedoring</b> & General <b>Contracting</b> Co Pty Ltd v Dignan, the High Court of Australia {{held that}} it was impossible, {{consistent}} with the British tradition, to insist upon a strict separation between legislative and executive powers. It was found that legislative power may be delegated to the executive, {{and as a result}} upheld the validity of delegated legislation. By contrast, in its insistence on a strict separation of [...] "judicial power", the High Court has been less willing to compromise. Furthermore, the role of the courts was discussed in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), whereby a NSW statute was invalidated since it purported to confer not-judicial functions to court. The principle that a State Court cannot be assigned powers that are incompatible with its constitutionally protected independence was extended to Territory Courts in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the life of}} Norris Wright Cuney (1846 - 1898), a Negro who became <b>contracting</b> <b>stevedore</b> on the Galveston wharves, collector of customs, alderman on the Galveston City Council, and a principal leader of the Republican party in Texas from 1884 to 1896. His leadership of the party in Texas covered a period when the party was declining from its Reconstruction heights and it was largely controlled by Negroes. Cuney, through his leadership and organizational abilities welded the Negroes into a coherent force, {{making it possible for}} them to dominate the party after 1884. Although the Republican party was not able to win elections on the state level, the Negroes used it to give a political voice against racial prejudice and violations of civil rights [...] a stronger voice than they would have had in the Democratic party. Cuney made his way up in Republican party ranks after the Civil War and during Radical Reconstruction in Texas under Governor Edmund J. Davis. He acquired more power in the party after Davis' death in 1883, when the whites were divided and the Negroes especially willing to follow a man of their own color. Cuney's power in the party reached its apogee when he was collector of customs between 1888 and 1892. In some ways, Cuney was a precursor of today's Negro leaders. He would not push for legislated social equality, but he did demand equal job opportunities for himself as well as other Negroes, equal educational opportunities, and equal social benefits for Negroes. Coney's life is an interesting study because he gained power when most other Negroes in the South had lost theirs. His life might be viewed as a transition between the relative freedom accorded Negroes during Reconstruction and the Jim Crow period of the early twentieth century. The Jim Crow laws of the 1890 s in Texas, the increased violence toward Negroes, and the lily-white movement in the Texas Republican party were reflections of a trend throughout the South and the United States as a whole. The Negro was not to see a revival of political power on any significant scale until the Franklin Roosevelt era...|$|R
