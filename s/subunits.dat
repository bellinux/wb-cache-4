5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c <b>subunits</b> causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c <b>subunits</b> past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β <b>subunits.</b> The α and β <b>subunits</b> are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β <b>subunits</b> provides the energy for the active sites in the β <b>subunits</b> to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β <b>subunits</b> diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α <b>subunits.</b> In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β <b>subunits</b> have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β <b>subunits,</b> whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the diversification of <b>subunits</b> among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of <b>subunits</b> contained in the 20S core particle depends on the organism; the number of distinct and specialized <b>subunits</b> is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. All 20S particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of {{two different types of}} subunits; α <b>subunits</b> are structural in nature, whereas β <b>subunits</b> are predominantly catalytic. The outer two rings in the stack consist of seven α <b>subunits</b> each, which serve as docking domains for the regulatory particles and the alpha <b>subunits</b> N-termini form a gate that blocks unregulated access of substrates to the interior cavity. The inner two rings each consist of seven β <b>subunits</b> and contain the protease active sites that perform the proteolysis reactions. Three distinct catalytic activities were identified in the purified complex: chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing. The size of the proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 angstroms (Å) by 115Å. The interior chamber is at most 53Å wide, though the entrance can be as narrow as 13Å, suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The <b>subunits</b> Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among themselves and to <b>subunits</b> of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI <b>subunits)</b> assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S.

5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain.

The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 <b>subunits</b> out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of <b>subunits</b> have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E

The former is comprised of four transmembrane alpha-helices, whilst the latter has an extra transmembrane domain at its N-terminus. In addition, the fungal form of V(0) contains a minor <b>subunit</b> c-related polypeptide, <b>subunit</b> c'. All three are required for activity of the proton pump in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have introduced cysteine residues in the N-terminal extension of <b>subunit</b> c" in a cysteine-free form. All mutant forms are active in the V-ATPase from S. cerevisiae.

Also, <b>subunit</b> c oligomeric complexes are present in vacuolar membranes in the absence of <b>subunit</b> c", consistent with previous observations showing hexameric arrangements of <b>subunit</b> c in gap-junction-like membranes.
