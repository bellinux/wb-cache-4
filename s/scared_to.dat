Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> remain still.

5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E

5|$|As North Korean {{soldiers}} advanced, {{they began}} to envelop both A and B Companies, and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired, both companies were ordered to withdraw, one platoon at a time. C Company, kept in reserve during the engagement, retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces. A Company, under the heaviest attack, attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly, as men ran from the hill, some without weapons and ammunition, being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time. Panic quickly overtook {{many of the men}} of the battalion, and they started running past the designated rally points, all the way to Pyongtaek. Others, too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> retreat, remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces. One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors, before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces. Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south, though one-fourth of 1st Battalion was killed, missing or captured immediately after the brief fight. The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind, littering the road back to Pyongtaek with ammunition, helmets, and rain gear. In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind, and had to retreat through a railway for cover.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June, Gasparotto {{was brought}} in for {{interrogation}} again. This time he admitted to being a benandante, claiming {{that he had been}} too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> do so in the previous interrogation lest the witches beat him in punishment. Gasparotto went on to accuse two individuals, one from Gorizia and the other from Chiana, of being witches, and was subsequently released by Montefalco on the proviso that he return for further questioning at a later date. This eventually came about on 26 September, taking place at the monastery of San Francesco in Udine. This time, Gasparotto added an extra element to his tale, claiming that an angel had summoned him to join the benandanti. For Montefalco, the introduction of this element led him to suspect that the actions of Gasparotto were themselves heretical and satanic, and his method of interrogation became openly suggestive, putting forward the idea that the angel was actually a demon in disguise.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> reach out to the government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies to see if any of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot. The lady claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for death of their comrades.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{military}} intelligence officials in 2007, there were many key reasons why the Uzbeks had been dominating the area. Military intelligence reports testified that the locals were <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> mobilize the opposition against the Uzbek militants due to their reputations as fierce fighters with long memories and very strong military backgrounds. Some of these fighters used to be soldiers and officers in the Soviet Army during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, {{and some of them}} had military training given by the CIA during the 1990s; hence they were experts in guerrilla warfare. The IMU fighters had little to lose and it was difficult for them to escape somewhere else. They couldn't go back to Uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to Afghanistan also started becoming more difficult. Thus, they made Waziristan their home. Local militants allied to the tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the IMU's private jail in Azam Warsak. The Pakistan Army intelligence said it did not intend to step in, but witnesses say government artillery fired on the Uzbek fighters they set up to fight the tribesmen.|$|E

25|$|Sex Trafficking/San Antonio: On June 1, 2007, a San Antonio {{woman and}} her two daughters were ordered {{detained}} without bond for engaging in sex trafficking of children. The woman, age 59, and her daughters, ages 32 and 29, were {{arrested and charged with}} sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion. Based on the ongoing investigation and the victims’ statements, it is alleged that the defendants traveled to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to recruit young girls to work as prostitutes in the San Antonio area. The victims in this case were 15, 17, and 22 years old. After arriving in the United States, the victims were told they would have to work as prostitutes for five years to repay the money the defendants had spent. Allegedly the money was spent on smuggling and other expenses they incurred to prepare the young women to be prostitutes. The victims told ICE agents that they were <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> leave because a male associate of the Ochoa’s had threatened them with a gun; he also stated that he could find them and their families back in Mexico, and he would have them killed. The female violators in this case received sentences of time served to 18 months in prison for their convictions for harboring and transporting aliens for financial gain. One of the male defendants was sentenced to 120 months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for financial gain and for aiding and abetting sex trafficking of a child. One remaining defendant is scheduled for jury trial in February 2009.|$|E
25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E
25|$|After Sora defeats Ansem, all the {{previously}} attacked worlds are restored, including Beast's Castle. Afterwards, Beast and Belle {{return to their}} home to carry on with their lives. However, the peace is shattered once again when Beast is approached by Xaldin of Organization XIII to do his bidding. Xaldin is determined to manipulate Beast into becoming a Heartless. If that happens, Beast will not only become a strong Heartless which Sora would have to destroy and feed to Kingdom Hearts, but also leave behind a powerful Nobody for Xaldin to use as he wishes (just like what happened to Xehanort). Manipulated and controlled, Beast is forced to allow the Heartless into the castle and lock the entire servant staff in the dungeons, with Belle too <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> intervene. Beast starts mistreating Belle. When Sora, Donald and Goofy arrive, they are encountered by Beast, who attacks them without hesitation. Sora wins the battle, and Beast comes back to his senses thanks to his servants who were released by Sora. Xaldin appears to flee. Later on, during a ball, Xaldin returns and steals the rose, throwing Beast into a depression and causing him to ask Belle and Sora to leave his castle. However a pep talk from Sora spurs him back into action. Xaldin confronts them and sends his Nobodies at them. They fight the Nobodies off, but Xaldin escapes to the castle drawbridge with Belle and the rose. Belle manages to escape from Xaldin's clutches with the rose, and Xaldin is then killed by Beast, Sora, Donald and Goofy. Belle gives Beast the rose but he is more relieved that she wasn't hurt. Beast then bids a grateful farewell to Sora, and returns to a normal life with Belle, until the spell is finally broken and Beast turns back into a human {{at the end of}} the game (a scene witnessed during the game's credits following completion). Beast's Limit attack for Kingdom Hearts II is Twin Howl, where he and Sora violently roar together and slash at enemies furiously.|$|E
