The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

However, , the exemption has not gone into effect because the Minister of Finance decided to defer the measure, pending a formal consultation with the EFTA <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> (ESA) to ensure that the VAT exemption for leasing was not in violation of the European Economic Area Agreement. The government's loss of revenue due to the still not implemented leasing exemption is estimated at about 47 million krone (around [...] ) per year. One Member of Parliament has criticized the government for the delay. He had argued that the initial VAT exemption for all electric vehicles was never approved in ESA. In addition, an ESA spokesman confirmed that the Government has not sent any request , nor has ESA received any complaints about Norway's original EV tax exemption. The MP said he will demand that the decision be implemented when Parliament meets in October 2014.|$|E

The investigation is aiming at {{an understanding of}} how potential consequences of a dam failure are taken into account when classifying dams. Furthermore, the significance of the classification, regarding the requirements on the dam owner and <b>surveillance</b> <b>authorities</b> concerning dam safety is considered and reviewed. The thesis is pointing out similarities and differences in the line of dam safety. The survey of dam safety is firstly based upon legal requirements in the different countries and secondly on guidelines regarding dam safety. Dam owners generally are ultimately responsible for the safety of their dam, and often have their own routines regarding how this safety is to be achieved. In this thesis, however, the legal requirements are mainly focused upon. The investigation has resulted in an outlining of eight areas, where the classification systems in the various countries have been compared. The result has shown that although the consequence based classification systems of dams generally are based on similar parameters, the evaluation and determination of consequences due to dam failure differ, as do the system of responsibility regarding <b>surveillance</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|R
