5|$|Between {{the newly}} conquered Mongol {{territory}} and Pagan were a wide <b>swath</b> of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan {{as well as}} the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long <b>swath</b> of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway55, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway55 and historically as the Niagara Stone Road and Black Swamp Road, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, which connected the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with Niagara-on-the-Lake, following Niagara Stone Road. The route divided a <b>swath</b> of wineries {{at the foot of the}} Niagara Escarpment, passing at an oblique angle to the concession road grid.|$|E

Debris from the land was deposited on the nearby reefs {{as a result of}} the tsunami. In 2005, about 14,400mangrove seedlings were replanted to save the mangrove forest.|$|E
5|$|The Latter Day Saint {{settlers}} of modern-day Utah {{had established}} a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous <b>swath</b> of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory. To alleviate the Mormon population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.|$|E

5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} a <b>swath</b> of new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme system {{of military and}} administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height in nearly five centuries, and indeed {{for the next four}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane {{moved to the}} northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western Florida. At its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced across a wide <b>swath</b> of the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged by strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E
5|$|In 1590, {{under the}} headship of Yoshishige's son Satake Yoshinobu, the Satake clan pledged fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara. After {{the fall of}} Odawara, Hideyoshi {{accepted}} them as vassals, and guaranteed their lordship of a 540,000 koku <b>swath</b> of territory in Hitachi Province. Having received recognition from Hideyoshi as the ruler of Hitachi Province, Yoshinobu's drive for unifying the province under his rule was strengthened. He brought {{nearly all of the}} province under his control, {{with the exception of the}} Tsuchiura and Shimodate areas, the control of which Hideyoshi had assured to the Yūki clan.|$|E

5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. This {{would make the}} storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide <b>swath</b> of damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The low number of fatalities is attributable to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{initially}} {{formed in}} a neighborhood {{just south of the}} downtown area; after demolishing a section of the downtown area, it moved on to the schools. The tornado then continued northeast crossing the Holly Hill and Dixie Drive areas. A quarter-mile-wide (400m) <b>swath</b> was devastated, with enormous damage reported to many houses and businesses, some of which were flattened. Several other schools and the local YMCA were among the damaged buildings. According to the Red Cross, 239 homes were destroyed, 374 sustained major damage, 529 sustained minor damage, and 251 homes were affected.|$|E
5|$|Well {{in advance}} of Vera's landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} ahead of the typhoon occurred across the Tōkai region of Japan starting on September23, when the storm reached peak intensity over open waters. In Nagoya, rainfall totals reached 10cm (4in). In {{other parts of the}} Tōkai region, nearly 20cm (8in) of rain was reported. The precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in the <b>swath</b> of rain. Steady rainfall occurred throughout Vera's passage of Honshu, though the worst of the rain-induced flooding occurred well after the typhoon's initial landfall. In Kawakami, Nara, a landslide killed 60people after crushing 12homes.|$|E

There, he points the tank's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a <b>swath</b> of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the bridge}} and exit18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward course through Queensbury quickly brings it to the {{outskirts}} of Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another <b>swath</b> of residential neighborhoods. Exits18 and19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY254 near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is Aviation Mall, located on NY254 just west of the route's junction with US9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit20 and NY149. Past exit20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY9N via exits21 and22.|$|E
