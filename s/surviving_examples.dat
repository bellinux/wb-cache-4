5|$|The Museum of Aviation in Belgrade {{has more}} than 200 aircraft, of which about 50 are on display, {{and a few of}} which are the only <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of their type, such as the Fiat G.50. This museum also {{displays}} parts of shot down US and NATO aircraft, such as the F-117 and F-16.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of the Liao dynasty on subsequent culture includes a large legacy of statuary art works, with important <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> in painted wood, metal, and three-color glazed sancai ceramics. The music and songs of the Liao dynasty are also known to have indirectly or directly influenced Mongol, Jurchen, and Chinese musical traditions.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of Spanish {{architecture}} in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's wildly popular 1884 novel Ramona. The Casa de Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that were closely tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of the heathland, carr woodland and marshy grassland habitats {{that have developed}} on the acidic soils overlying the Greensand and Keuper Marls of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is regionally important for birds which favour heathland habitats.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort is {{exceptionally}} well-preserved; {{it provides}} {{one of the}} finest <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E
5|$|Spoken English {{south of}} the Danelaw became, from at least the 11th century onwards, characterised by a {{pronunciation}} known as Southern Voicing, such as vrog for frog, or zummer for summer. Vainites or vains, variants of fainites or fains, are <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of this on {{the borders of the}} Danelaw to the north of London. Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw.|$|E

5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers that there are many <b>surviving</b> <b>examples.</b> This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's {{architecture}} is the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. <b>Surviving</b> <b>examples</b> include the Colston Hall, the Granary on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultural}} sphere, {{there were some}} Mongol elements in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> are from the 14th century, after {{the chance of a}} military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn by soldiers, typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones brought back from Outremer.|$|E
5|$|In the {{north-east}} are two {{homes of}} early wealthy merchants and shipowners connected with Kirkcaldy's harbour. The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; {{once owned by}} the Law family, {{is one of the}} best <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of a sixteenth-century town house in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E

5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Dornier {{ended in}} mid-1940, {{in favour of}} the newer and more {{powerful}} Junkers Ju 88. The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in strength in 1942. Even so, the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles {{until the end of}} the war, as a glider tug, research and trainer aircraft. A considerable number of <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> were sent to other Axis nations as well as countries like Finland. Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Allenville Mill Storehouse {{was long}} {{considered}} to be the Allenville Mill, including in the 1937 Federal Writer's Project book, but records indicate this was the storehouse of the mill constructed in 1813. Despite not being the mill complex, the storehouse is the earliest surviving example of the 19th-century company storehouses in Rhode Island, and one of only a few <b>surviving</b> <b>examples</b> of company storehouses remaining from the 19th century. Furthermore, the property was erected and owned by the Governor of Rhode Island and later United States Senator Phillip Allen. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E
