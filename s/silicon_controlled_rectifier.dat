50|$|The benistor {{was invented}} in 1995 by Beniamin Acatrinei, a Romanian born {{inventor}} living in Silicon Valley, California. Acatrineiâ€™s intention was to improve upon the thyristor or <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (SCR) which has certain limitations. The benistor concept was initially published in two US patents issued in 1997 and 1999. The benistor received significant recognition for its originality and versatility, {{but there have been}} limited product applications to date. However, the LED Lighting power management market is an excellent application for the benistor, because LEDs are non-linear devices that require constant current in a limited maximum voltage supply range. Providing constant current in a limited maximum voltage range is necessary to achieve minimum dissipation and maximum efficiency, and is a technical challenge which is an ideal application for benistor.|$|E
50|$|Plasma cutters use {{a number}} of methods to start the arc. In some units, the arc is created by putting the torch {{in contact with the}} work piece. Some cutters use a high voltage, high {{frequency}} circuit to start the arc. This method has {{a number of}} disadvantages, including risk of electrocution, difficulty of repair, spark gap maintenance, and the large amount of radio frequency emissions. Plasma cutters working near sensitive electronics, such as CNC hardware or computers, start the pilot arc by other means. The nozzle and electrode are in contact. The nozzle is the cathode, and the electrode is the anode. When the plasma gas begins to flow, the nozzle is blown forward. A third, less common method is capacitive discharge into the primary circuit via a <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Mark II" [...] "microbombs" [...] had Casio digital {{watches as}} the timers, {{stabilizers}} that looked like cotton wool balls, and an undetectable quantity of nitroglycerin as the explosive. Other ingredients included glycerin, nitrate, sulfuric acid, and minute concentrations of nitrobenzene, silver azide (silver trinitride), and liquid acetone. Two 9-volt batteries in each bomb were used as a power source. The batteries would be connected to light bulb filaments that would detonate the bomb. Murad and Yousef wired an SCR (<b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier)</b> as the switch to trigger the filaments to detonate the bomb. There was an external socket hidden when the wires were pushed under the watch base as the bomber would wear it. The alteration was so small that the watch could still be worn in a normal manner.|$|E
50|$|Series {{triggering}} is {{more common}} in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor). The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the flash duration, but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for external triggering. However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (SCR) must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.|$|E
50|$|Since DuMont was {{a leader}} in cathode ray tube or CRT design and manufacturing, {{it was a natural}} step to use the CRT as a visual {{measuring}} instrument or oscilloscope. The production of CRT's and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories located in Upper Montclair, NJ. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934. Although not the inventor of the oscilloscope, DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (he called them oscillographs) for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the trigger sweep oscilloscope using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to show a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the measurement being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided stability in viewing.|$|E
