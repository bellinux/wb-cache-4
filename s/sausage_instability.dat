The gravity accelerates free-falling water which causes the water column to constrict. Then surface tension breaks the narrowing water column into droplets (not shown here) (see Plateau-Rayleigh instability), which {{is analogous to the}} magnetic field which has been suggested as the cause of pinching in bead lightning.

40|$|A {{magnetized}} planar coaxial {{plasma gun}} {{is used to}} study the physics of spheromak formation. Eight magnetic flux tubes spanning from the cathode to the anode electrode are first filled with plasma by a rapid MHD pumping mechanism which ingests plasma from nozzles at the wall. The ingested plasma convects toroidal flux and the pile-up of this flux in the flux tube causes the flux tube to become collimated. The eight collimated flux tubes first have the shape of spider legs, but then merge to form a central column jet. This jet lengthens, continuing to ingest plasma from the wall sources, and becomes kink unstable. At a later stage {{the root of the}} jet can break off from the electrode and this detachment has been identified as being associated with a <b>sausage</b> <b>instability.</b> The <b>sausage</b> <b>instability</b> takes place during the nonlinear stage of the kinking.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{explore the}} possibility of <b>sausage</b> <b>instabilities</b> developing {{on top of a}} kink instability in lengthening current-carrying magnetic flux tubes. Observations indicate that the dynamics of magnetic flux tubes in our cosmos and terrestrial experiments can involve topological changes faster than time scales predicted by resistive magnetohydrodynamics. Recent laboratory experiments suggest that hierarchies of instabilities, such as kink and Rayleigh-Taylor, could be responsible for initiating fast topological changes by locally accessing two fluid and kinetic regimes. <b>Sausage</b> <b>instabilities</b> can also provide this coupling mechanism between disparate scales. Flux tube experiments can be classified by the flux tube's evolution in a configuration space described by a normalized inverse aspect-ratio k̅ and current-to-magnetic flux ratio λ̅. A lengthening current-carrying magnetic flux tube traverses this k̅ - λ̅ space and crosses stability boundaries. We derive a single general criterion for the onset of the <b>sausage</b> and kink <b>instabilities</b> in idealized magnetic flux tubes with core and skin currents. The criterion indicates a dependence of the stability boundaries on current profiles and shows overlapping kink and sausage unstable regions in the k̅ - λ̅ space with two free parameters. Numerical investigation of the stability criterion reduces the number of free parameters to a single one that describes the current profile, and confirms the overlapping sausage and kink unstable regions in k̅ - λ̅ space. A lengthening, ideal current-carrying magnetic flux tube can therefore become sausage unstable after it becomes kink unstable. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures, accepted by Physics of Plasma...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the linear stability of z-pinch plasmas with equilibria that contain axial sheared flow based on the linearized MHD equations and 2 D MHD simulations using the MHRDR code is presented. The study begins with a linearized set of equations that permit evaluation {{of the effect of}} sheared flow on the m = 0 <b>sausage</b> <b>instability,</b> with the Hall term included in the model. The problem is then treated numerically following the development in time of an initial perturbation. The numerical results as a function of sheared flow and Hall term are reported. The linear stage of instability development is also compared with the 2 D MHRDR simulation results. Linear theory solutions for the growth rate appear to be in good agreement with the MHRDR simulation results. Theory and computations have examined several possible z-pinch stabilization techniques, including axial sheared flow [1 - 4]. With sheared axial flow included in the equilibrium it is found that substantial stabilization of internal modes is possible for some equilibrium profiles.

40|$|The ion {{acceleration}} by a <b>sausage</b> <b>instability</b> in a z-pinch {{is modeled}} using Hall-magnetohydrodynamic theory {{taking into account}} the axial plasma velocity that necessarily develops during the instability. The instability grows, shrinking the neck, until it is stopped by increased pressure. The axial velocity influences ion acceleration through the radial electric field. An axial left–right asymmetry arises due to the contribution of the Hall term. The total electric field reverses its axial direction always on the anode side of the neck. The resulting electromagnetic fields are used to compute ion trajectories. Two classes of particle motion arise: singular ions that cross the cylinder axis and off-axis regular ions, and for both the acceleration by the electric fields is always toward the cathode. The energy gain of singular-orbit ions is larger, reaching values of up to 60. Most off-axis ions drift toward the axis due to the axial electric field, where they experience large energy gains. When the column radius is of the order of the Larmor radius the orbits are complex but the energy gain is still large. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the global stability of a differentially rotating fluid shell threaded by vertical and azimuthal magnetic fields to linear, axisymmetric perturbations. This system, which models a thick accretion disk {{in the vicinity}} of its midplane, is susceptible to the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar (VC) instability {{in the absence of the}} azimuthal field. In most cases, the azimuthal field tends to stabilize the VC instability, although strong fields (Alfvén speed of order the characteristic rotational speed in our incompressible model) are required for complete stabilization. Stability diagrams are constructed, indicating critical values of the two fields for instability. We find an additional strong field instability that arises when the azimuthal Alfvén speed exceeds the characteristic rotational speed. This instability, in the case of a freely bounded configuration, has certain similarities to the <b>sausage</b> <b>instability</b> for interpenetrating fields in plasma physics, and may be important for very massive disks or filamentary molecular clouds. An application to the L 1641 region in Orion A is briefly discussed. Finally, we find that the effect of a radially varying vertical field (without an azimuthal field) is mainly stabilizing.

The equations were extended to a quasi-symmetrical form for treating the compressible medium. An analytical-numerical study was made in which the dispersion relation for incompressible flow was treated as a function of a complex variable. In each of ten different physical situations the flow parameter, [ [...] . ], was varied over the range [ [...] . ] and the following conclusions were reached: 1.

40|$|We present {{here the}} first 2 D rotating, multi-group, {{radiation}} magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of supernova core collapse, bounce, and explosion. In {{the context of}} rapid rotation, {{we focus on the}} dynamical effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and propagation of MHD jets. We find that a quasi-steady state can be quickly established after bounce, during which a well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping of power from the differentially rotating core. If the initial spin period of the progenitor core is < ∼ 2 seconds, the free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving protoneutron star is adequate to power a supernova explosion, and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop stresses, and maintain a small opening angle. We see evidence of <b>sausage</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the emerging jet stream. Neutrino heating is sub-dominant in the rapidly rotating models we explore, but can contribute 10 − 25 % to the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that even in the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova explosion might be followed by a secondary, weak MHD jet explosion, which, because of its weakness may to date have gone unnoticed in supernova debris. Furthermore, we suggest that the generation of a non-relativistic MHD precursor jet during the early protoneutron star/supernova phase is implicit in both the collapsar and “millisecond magnetar ” models of GRBs. The multi-D, multi-group, rapidly rotating RMHD simulations we describe here are a start along the path towards more realistic simulations of the possible role of magnetic fields in some of Nature’s most dramatic events.

In order to have a net outward force {{and at the same time}} avoid a classical pinch (<b>sausage)</b> <b>instability,</b> the two components of the field must satisfy a certain inequality.

We have identified a magnetic flux tube visible in AIA 304 Å that shows curvatures on its surface with variable cross-sections as well as enhanced brightness. These curvatures evolved and thereafter smoothed out within a time-scale of a minute. The curved locations on the flux tube exhibit a radial outward enhancement of the surface of about 1 - 2 Mm (factor of 2 larger than the original thickness of the flux tube) from the equilibrium position. AIA 193 Å snapshots also show the formation of bright knots and narrow regions inbetween at the four locations as that of 304 Å along the flux tube where plasma emission is larger compared to the background. The formation of bright knots over an entire flux tube as well as the narrow regions in < 60 s may be the morphological signature of the <b>sausage</b> <b>instability.</b> We also find the flows of the confined plasma in these bright knots along the field lines, which indicates the dynamicity of the flux tube that probably causes the dominance of the longitudinal field component over short temporal scales. The observed longitudinal motion of the plasma frozen in the magnetic field lines further vanishes the formed curvatures and plasma confinements as well as growth of instability to stablize the flux tube.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} coupling {{between the}} solar chromospheric plasma and magnetic field is investigated by numerically solving a fully self-consistent, two-dimensional initial-value {{problem for the}} nonlinear collisional MHD equations including electric resistivity, thermal conduction, and, in some cases, gas-dynamic viscosity. The processes in the contact zone between two horizontal magnetic fields of opposite polarities are considered. The plasma {{is assumed to be}} initially motionless and having a temperature of 50, 000 K uniform throughout the plasma volume; the characteristic magnetic field corresponds to a plasma β≳ 1. In a physical-time interval of 17 seconds typically covered by a computational run, the plasma temperature gradually increases by a factor of two to three. Against this background, an impulsive (in 0. 1 seconds or less) increase in the current-aligned plasma velocity occurs {{at the site of the}} current-layer thinning (sausage-type deformation, or m= 0 pinch instability). Such a "velocity burst" can be interpreted physically as an event of suprathemal-proton generation. Further development of the <b>sausage</b> <b>instability</b> results in an increase in the kinetic temperature of the protons to high values, even to those observed in flares. The form of our system of MHD equations indicates that such increases are a property of the exact solution of the system at an appropriate choice of the parameters. Magnetic reconnection does not manifest itself in this solution: it would generate flows forbidden by the chosen geometry. Therefore, the pinch-sausage effect can act as an energiser of the upper chromosphere and be an alternative to the magnetic-reconnection process as the producer of flares.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the sustained narrowness observed in the asymptotic cylindrical region of bipolar outflows from Young Stellar Objects (YSO) indicates that these jets are magnetically collimated. The j cross B force observed in z-pinch plasmas is a possible explanation for these observations. However, z-pinch plasmas are subject to current driven instabilities (CDI). The interest in using z-pinches for controlled nuclear fusion has lead to an extensive theory of the stability of magnetically confined plasmas. Analytical, numerical, and experimental evidence from this field suggest that sheared flow in magnetized plasmas can reduce the growth rates of the <b>sausage</b> and kink <b>instabilities.</b> Here we propose the hypothesis that sheared helical flow can exert a similar stabilizing influence on CDI in YSO jets.

40|$|Nonlinear self-focusing in laser glass imposes {{limits on}} the energy fluence that can be safely {{transmitted}} without risking damage. For this reason, it is desirable to strictly limit the peak to average spatial variations of fluence by smoothing schemes such as Smoothing by Spectral Dispersion (SSD). While spatial variations are problematic, the same is not necessarily true of temporal variations since normal group velocity dispersion tends to smooth out temporal peaks caused by spatial self-focusing. Earlier work indicated that increased bandwidth can delay the onset of self focusing. The present work re-examines the question of self focusing threshold increases due to high bandwidth by investigating another source of such increase in three dimensional beam breakup [...] the bending instability. For simplicity, the authors consider {{the behavior of a}} single space-time speckle. Normal dispersion can lead to splitting of the pulse and delay of self focusing for short enough pulses as noted above. In addition to the self focusing instability, the laser beam is also subject to the so-called bending (<b>sausage</b> like) <b>instability</b> which can spatially disperse the field maxima over time. Because the bending instability breaks an initial axial symmetry, a full three dimensional numerical simulation is required to study it accurately. Such calculations are possible, but costly.

40|$|We use new and archival Chandra and ROSAT data {{to study}} the time {{variability}} of the X-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR B 1509 - 58 on timescales of one week to twelve years. There is variability in the size, number, and brightness of compact knots appearing within 20 " of the pulsar, {{with at least one}} knot showing a possible outflow velocity of ~ 0. 6 c (assuming a distance to the source of 5. 2 kpc). The transient nature of these knots may indicate that they are produced by turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar. A previously identified prominent jet extending 12 pc to the southeast of the pulsar increased in brightness by 30 % over 9 years; apparent outflow of material along this jet is observed with a velocity of ~ 0. 5 c. However, outflow alone cannot account for the changes in the jet on such short timescales. Magnetohydrodynamic <b>sausage</b> or kink <b>instabilities</b> are feasible explanations for the jet variability with timescale of ~ 1. 3 - 2 years. An arc structure, located 30 "- 45 " north of the pulsar, shows transverse structural variations and appears to have moved inward with a velocity of ~ 0. 03 c over three years. The overall structure and brightness of the diffuse PWN exterior to this arc and excluding the jet has remained the same over the twelve year span.

Generate paper figures with python paper_figures [...] /output/[timestamp] [...] /output/[timestamp] [...] /output/[timestamp], where [timestamp] is the dated directory name. The order should be from oldest to newest date. 	 newcomb. py description Examines the equilibrium. If the equilibrium has a singularity, the Frobenius method is used to determine a small solution at an r> than the radius of the singularity. If the singularity is Suydam unstable no attempt is made to calulate external stability. If there is no Suydam instability a Frobenius power series solution close to r= 0 is chosen or if the integration does not start at r= 0 a given ξ is used as boundary condition. Only the last interval is integrated. ξ and ξ'are plugged into the potential energy equation to determine stability. Contact Jens von der Linden jensv@uw. ed...|$|R
