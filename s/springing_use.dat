50|$|The {{village was}} famous for its mineral water <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> for healing in sanatoriums, {{including}} the Hawthorne and Lithia springs.|$|R
5000|$|During the Roman era, {{the village}} was known as [...] "Balnearum", at that time a thermal <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> by Romans.|$|R
50|$|Roman remains {{have also}} been found 3 km to the south, at hot <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> for public bathing to this day.|$|R
25|$|A few <b>sprung</b> floors <b>use</b> actual <b>springs</b> - {{the special}} <b>spring</b> floors <b>used</b> by cheerleaders and {{tumblers}} often have coil springs under them.|$|R
5000|$|Note that [...] {{here is the}} {{acceleration}} of gravity along the <b>spring.</b> <b>Using</b> the Euler-Lagrange equation, we arrive at the equation of motion: ...|$|R
25|$|In the Eaux-Chaudes Valley, {{there is}} one cold and eight hot <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> for hydrotherapy. Some are radioactive, and contain sulfides, chlorobromides, and arsenic.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> for both {{drinking}} water and agriculutural purposes in Bteghrine. The four primary springs are Zaarour, Manboukh, Mir, and Sparta.|$|R

50|$|Porsche 911 {{up until}} the 1989 model year (964) used a similar strut design {{that does not have}} coil <b>springs,</b> <b>using</b> torsion bar {{suspension}} instead.|$|R

50|$|Note that <b>Spring's</b> <b>use</b> of {{the term}} file system is {{somewhat}} confusing. In normal usage the term refers to a particular way to physically store files on a disk.|$|R
5000|$|Longitudinal semi-elliptical <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> to {{be common}} {{and still are}} used in {{heavy-duty}} trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage that the spring rate can easily be made progressive (non-linear).|$|R
50|$|Non-artesian springs {{may simply}} flow from a higher {{elevation}} through {{the earth to}} a lower elevation and exit {{in the form of}} a <b>spring,</b> <b>using</b> the ground like a drainage pipe.|$|R
5000|$|Hairspring or {{balance spring}} - a {{delicate}} spiral <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> in watches, galvanometers, and places where electricity must be carried to partially rotating {{devices such as}} steering wheels without hindering the rotation.|$|R
50|$|The Estate Wagons, as {{with other}} GM {{full-sized}} wagons during these years, used a rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village is}} watered by 11 <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> to irrigate {{hundreds}} of small farm plots using a system of canals and dams. [...] Armed Israeli settlers have made these areas unsafe for their local Palestinian owners.|$|R
30|$|The {{subjects}} {{we observed}} {{in this study}} were sixth-grade students in a small, central Texas City, with a student population that is one-third Latino and one-third White. We observed six classes (126 students in the fall and 125 in the <b>spring)</b> <b>using</b> the new Genie 3 platform and six classes (122 students in the fall and 123 in the <b>spring)</b> <b>using</b> the Genie 2 platform. The two groups performed equivalently on a pre-test measure of key topics in sixth-grade mathematics. The Genie 3 group scored an average of 32.63  % (SD[*]=[*] 17.06), while the Genie 2 group averaged 32.72  % correct (SD[*]=[*] 14.49), an effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.006.|$|R
50|$|The Montecarlo/Scorpion {{suffered}} from several issues. Between the taller <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> {{to meet the}} US height requirements, a lack of caster, and bump steer, handling of US market Scorpions {{did not meet the}} promises of the car’s design.|$|R
5000|$|Ideal Spring - the {{notional}} <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> in physics: {{it has no}} weight, mass, or damping losses. The force {{exerted by}} the spring {{is proportional to the}} distance the spring is stretched or compressed from its relaxed position.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic {{valve springs}} are metal bellows filled with {{compressed}} air {{used as an}} alternative to the metal wire <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> to close valves in high-speed internal combustion engines. This system was introduced in the mid-1980s in Renault turbocharged 1.5 litre Formula One engines.|$|R
50|$|There are now 18 {{borehole}} sites {{throughout the}} catchment {{area from the}} South Downs groundwater and the natural springs in Havant and Bedhampton. There are up to 25 <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> {{at any one time}} producing up to 170 million litres per day.|$|R
25|$|In {{the area}} a {{circular}} foundation and other remains suggest the colonnade {{of a small}} round building of Flavian date, which could be this temple's perirrantherion, a sacred <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> for the temple's cult (which included purification ceremonies), and later on probably for lustra.|$|R
50|$|This {{curved spring}} {{consists}} of an outer and two inner springs with different elastic characteristics connected in series. This category of bent <b>spring</b> <b>uses</b> the two concepts together: parallel and series connection {{in order to ensure}} optimal torsional compensation for each value of torque.|$|R
50|$|There are {{therefore}} two possible {{origins of the}} name Holywell. It {{could have been the}} <b>spring</b> <b>used</b> by a holy man or a spring close to a holly tree. However, the persistence of the local pronunciation ("holly well") would appear to favour the latter.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Hindus bathing in the hotsprings at Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Rajgir. In ancient times, hot <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> to be {{the site}} of the Tapodarama, a Buddhist monastery at the time of Gautama Buddha. It is said that King Bimbisara also used to bathe here sometimes.|$|R
5000|$|Rock Springs-Sweetwater County Airport [...] {{is eight}} {{miles east of}} Rock Springs, in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. It {{is owned by the}} city and county.

50|$|A <b>spring</b> {{floor is}} <b>used</b> in most {{competitive}} gymnastics to provide bounce. Spring floors {{are also used}} sometimes in cheerleading. The <b>sprung</b> floor <b>used</b> for indoor athletics, however, is designed to reduce bounce.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to mechanical friction, considerable force {{is required to}} compress the valve <b>springs</b> <b>used</b> to close the engine's valves. This can amount to an estimated 25% of an engine's total output at idle, reducing overall efficiency. Some approaches to reclaiming this [...] "wasted" [...] energy include: ...|$|R
