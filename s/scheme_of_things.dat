25|$|The {{death of}} Lord Richard {{was one of}} a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> but it was the {{identity}} of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people think very hard about the wisdom of it.|$|E

Based on cases representing different businesses in software industry, we explore business models for creating of a holistic view of business options based on <b>schemes</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that the managers of our case companies found essential when describing their businesses. As a result of our study, we combine product development, marketing, sales, revenue logic, services and implementation into a cohesive framework describing the generic elements of business models in the software industry...|$|R

The native Latvian and Estonian population enjoyed fewer rights under the Baltic German nobility compared to the farmers in Germany, Sweden, or Poland.

Segregation of arriving and departing commuters to minimise conflicting movement, and integration of the proposed integrated bus terminus (IBT) and metro services to facilitate travel of passengers, will be key ingredients in the upgrade.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we want to}} explore a new {{approach}} for security mechanisms design and deployment in the context <b>of</b> Internet <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> (IoT). We claim that the usual approach to security issues, typical of more classical systems and networks, does not grab all the aspects related to this new paradigm of communication, sharing and actuation. In fact, the IoT paradigm involves new features, mechanisms and dangers that cannot be completely taken into consideration through the classical formulation of security problems. The IoT calls for a new paradigm of security, which will {{have to consider the}} security problem from a holistic perspective including the new actors and their interactions.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a new user-initiated data offloading scheme. In the proposed <b>scheme,</b> Internet <b>of</b> <b>things</b> modules (IoTMs) initiate the offloading {{process and the}} mobile network operators (MNOs) are responsible of incentivizing APOs. As users, IoTMs are assumed either (1) compliant or properly incentivized, such that they will offload their traffic exactly as the networks intended or (2) unaware of the offloading process at all; it means that data offloading is totally transparent to IoTMs. In this work, data offloading actions are only triggered by either an IoTM or a MNO. To reduce communication costs, IoTMs offload data while the MNO tries to ease traffic congestion of cellular networks. Basically, {{we can assume that}} IoTMs, MNO, and APOs can make strategic decisions independently and rationally to maximize their payoffs. Due to this reason, game theory can be a suitable approach for data offloading scenarios.|$|R

Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable with, what {{it was felt that}} the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and how it would be provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would go in and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{opinion of}} {{development}} professionals {{at home and}} abroad has converged on the point that bad governance lies {{at the root of the}} loss of the momentum of economic growth, increasing poverty and failed investment in social sectors. Early concern of development economists with market failure brought in the arguments for the role of government. Government failure was the dominant issue of the eighties. The last decade of the twentieth century is witnessing a focus on governance failure, a broader concept in that the government is not viewed as the only governing entity. This paper addresses an issue which has been there during the reigns of all these “failure ” paradigms. It arises from the inability of governments, organised traditionally into the vertically operating line departments, to deal effectively with multisectoral or cross-sectoral problems and cross-cutting issues. The paper traces the evolution of multisectoral issues and looks at the standard approach of treating multisectoral initiatives as a horizontally fathomed coordination problem to show that it has been an unmitigated disaster. It argues that the multisectoral issues can be better addressed by internalising the elements of coordination, particularly in social sectors, though there have been situations which raise questions about this approach as well. The large majority of the newly emergent nations of the postwar world adopted a planned course of development, some impressed by the high industrial growth achieved by the Soviet Union and others convinced by the analytical case for overcoming the market imperfections.

However, the current duty-cycle-based power saving approach may incur large access delay times owing to the trade-offs between the power consumption and the access delay. In order to reduce this delay and enhance the power-saving performance, wake-up receiver-based schemes have been proposed. However, because wake-up receiver-based schemes do not consider multiuser operation in dense communication environments, large delays are inevitable in the case of multiuser operation. In order to provide extremely low-power operation and under 1 -mW standby power with reduced delay, we employed the optimized multiuser transmission scheduling of IEEE 802. 11 ax in the proposed scheme and proper enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameter settings. This is with the aim to reduce the delay caused by long wake-up times, and to avoid collisions caused by simultaneous transmission in uplink multiuser scenario.
