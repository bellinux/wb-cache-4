5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover</b> or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E
25|$|In the Paleogene period {{southern}} Sweden {{was at a}} {{lower position}} relative to sea level but was likely still above it as it was covered by sediments. Rivers flowing over the South Småland peneplain flowed also across Scania which {{was at the time}} covered by thick sediments. As the relative sea level sank and much of Scania lost its <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover</b> antecedent rivers begun to incise the Söderåsen horst forming valleys. During deglaciation these valleys likely evacuated large amounts of melt-water. The relief of Scania's south-western landscape was formed by the accumulation of thick Quaternary sediments during the Quaternary glaciations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover</b> in the SE Zagros is {{deforming}} above a {{layer of}} rock salt (acting as a ductile decollement with a low basal friction) whereas in the NW Zagros the salt layer is missing or is very thin. This different basal friction is {{partly responsible for the}} different topographies {{on either side of the}} Kazerun fault. Higher topography and narrower zone of deformation in the NW Zagros is observed whereas in the SE, deformation was spread more and a wider zone of deformation with lower topography was formed. Stresses induced in the Earth's crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered sedimentary rocks. Subsequent erosion removed softer rocks, such as mudstone (rock formed by consolidated mud) and siltstone (a slightly coarser-grained mudstone) while leaving harder rocks, such as limestone (calcium-rich rock consisting of the remains of marine organisms) and dolomite (rocks similar to limestone containing calcium and magnesium). This differential erosion formed the linear ridges of the Zagros Mountains.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBased on lots {{of field}} {{investigations}} and comprehensive interpretations of seismic profiles with outcrop cross-sections, this paper {{shows that the}} foreland belts surrounding the Southwest Tarim Foreland Basin have the regularity of segmentation along the strike of foreland belts. There are many thin-skinned thrusting systems thrusting from mountains to the basin and the arcuate back-thrusting systems to the mountains distributed at intervals {{in the front of}} West Kunlun-Pamir and Southern Tianshan. Between thrusting and back-thrusting systems, the strike-slip faults developed. The northeast uplifts and depressions of Southwest Tarim Basin correspond with the segmentation of foreland basin. The thin-skinned thrusting system is formed in the case that the thickness of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>covers</b> is less than 10 km in depth where the basement is an uplift belt in general. The back-thrusting systems and triangle zones are formed in the case that the thickness of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>covers</b> is larger than 8 km in depth where the basement is a depression zone. The main mechanics of segmentation of foreland basin are the difference of mountain uplift and deformation rate along the longitude of the mountains, the huge sedimentary rocks in different depression centers, the uplift belts and depression zones in the basement rocks, and multi-displaced weak layers in the foreland basin. The segmentation of Southwest Tarim Foreland Basin is due to the intra-plate deformation of re-orogenies of West Kunlun-Pamir and Southwest Tianshan and the co-related deformation between mountains and basement of basin since Neocene...|$|R
25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover</b> can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|E
500|$|Surface {{displacement}} {{during the}} earthquake {{was measured using}} SAR interferometry. The computed area of uplift is elongated W-E, with a maximum value of about [...] centered over {{the eastern end of}} the Latif anticline. A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area, and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface. The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north-dipping fault rupturing between about [...] and [...] in depth, which also provides a good match to the results of seismic modeling using body waves, although a SSE-dipping plane remains possible. This depth range strongly suggests that the fault affected {{the lower part of the}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover,</b> while not ruling out some basement involvement. The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment, possibly within marl layers.|$|E

40|$|Neogene and Quaternary <b>sedimentary</b> <b>covers</b> occur {{along the}} Brazilian coast {{and have been}} {{frequently}} describedtogether as a single unit. The study of Brazilian sedimentary basins concentrates on their rift phase, whereas the post-riftphase has been considered a tectonic quiescent period. In the Potiguar basin, although post-rift Cretaceous units are wellinvestigated, the Neogene and Quaternary <b>sedimentary</b> <b>covers,</b> {{as well as their}} identifi cation and differentiation, are still poorly known. A few previous studies have demonstrated that post-rift sedimentary units with no apparent deformation have a complexdeformation pattern in all scales of observation. The study of this deformation, however, did not include Neogene and Quaternary units. The main aim of the present study is the characterization of Neogene and Quaternary sedimentary units that outcrop in the central partof the Potiguar Basin, State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and related tectonics. The study has concentrated on the description ofthe Barreiras Formation and overlying Quaternary alluvial, marine, and aeolian deposits at 1 : 100, 000 scale. Facies analyses, grain sizestudies, and luminescence dating were carried out. Ten informal and formal lithostratigraphic sedimentary units were described, inaddition to the Precambrian crystalline basement. The main results indicate that several Quaternary alluvial deposits were previouslymapped as the Miocene Barreiras Formation. It was possible to locate the new boundaries of the Quaternary sedimentary deposits andtheir stratigraphic relationships with older units. In addition, it was possible to identify the major fault systems in the basin that show NW- and NE-trending directions, which coincide with macro landforms. It follows that these major fault systems, mainly the NW trending system, control the deposition of Neogene and Quaternary sedimentary units...|$|R
2500|$|The IBM arc {{system is}} an {{excellent}} example of an intra-oceanic convergent margin (IOCM). [...] IOCMs are built on oceanic crust and contrast fundamentally with island arc built on continental crust, such as Japan or the Andes. [...] Because IOCM crust is thinner, denser, and more refractory than that beneath Andean-type margins, study of IOCM melts and fluids allows more confident assessment of mantle-to-crust fluxes and processes than is possible for Andean-type convergent margins. [...] Because IOCMs are far removed from continents they are not affected by the large volume of alluvial and glacial sediments. [...] The consequent thin <b>sedimentary</b> <b>cover</b> makes it much easier to study arc infrastructure and determine the mass and composition of subducted sediments.

The indication that the lower crust beneath the LMS was folded and pushed upwards and the upper crust was removed by exhumation, supports the concept of a lower crustal channel flow beneath Eastern Tibet.

40|$|Total field aeromagnetic {{anomalies}} over Okigwe {{area have}} been evaluated in order to map lineaments and estimate the depths to basement (sedimentary thicknesses). Aeromagnetic contour map of Okigwe (Sheet 312) was acquired, digitized and analyzed. Regional-residual separation and Slope methods were applied. The magnetic lineament map shows major geologic lineaments trending in NE-SW direction with minor ones trending in NW-SE direction. The major trend is in conformity with the trend of the Benue Tough. Visual study of the map shows presence of igneous intrusives in the northeastern part of the area. The results obtained using Slope methods indicate two depth sources in the area. On the average the deeper magnetic sources range from 2. 0 to 4. 99 km, while the shallower magnetic sources range from 0. 4 to 1. 99 km. Deeper magnetic sources probably depict depths to Precambrian Basement, whereas shallower sources probably depict depths to igneous intrusives and/or magnetized bodies within the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>covers.</b> Hydrocarbon exploration is not recommended since the area has low thickness of sediments on the average All these deductions were reached at after due consideration to both qualitative and quantitative interpretations supported by geological information of the area...|$|R
