50|$|Another {{class of}} {{physical}} distance indicator is the <b>standard</b> <b>ruler.</b> In 2008, galaxy diameters {{have been proposed}} as a possible <b>standard</b> <b>ruler</b> for cosmological parameter determination. The method exploits regularity in baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the early universe: while small structures occur at all scales, acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma did not exceed a certain length. The inhomogeneities in the plasma were then organized by gravity into galaxy filaments and voids. Consequently, cosmic voids {{are not expected to}} exceed a maximum size determined {{by the size of the}} BAOs that gave rise to them. The method requires an extensive galaxy survey in order to make this scale visible. The WiggleZ galaxy survey was able to resolve this scale for detecting the expansion effect of dark energy.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{standard}} candles and measurements of <b>standard</b> <b>rulers</b> give an inconsistent {{picture of the}} history of the universe. This discrepancy can be explained if photon number is not conserved as computations of the luminosity distance must be modified. I show that photon number is not conserved when photons mix with chameleons in the presence of a magnetic field. The strong magnetic fields in a supernova mean that the probability of a photon converting into a chameleon in the interior of the supernova is high, this results in a large flux of chameleons at the surface of the supernova. Chameleons and photons also mix as a result of the intergalactic magnetic field. These two effects combined cause the image of the supernova to be brightened resulting in a model which fits both observations {{of standard}} candles and observations of <b>standard</b> <b>rulers.</b> ...|$|R

Both of these features are found at large scales of tens to hundreds of megaparsecs, which is why low angular resolution (unresolved) maps of neutral hydrogen are sufficient to detect them.

40|$|A new {{compilation}} of 120 angular-size/redshift data for compact radio quasars from very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) surveys motivates us {{to revisit the}} interaction between dark energy and dark matter with these probes reaching high redshifts z∼ 3. 0. In this paper, we investigate observational constraints on different phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models with the intermediate-luminosity radio quasars acting as individual <b>standard</b> <b>rulers,</b> combined with the newest BAO and CMB observation from Planck results acting as statistical rulers. The results obtained from the MCMC method and other statistical methods including Figure of Merit and Information Criteria show that: (1) Compared with the current standard candle data and standard clock data, the intermediate-luminosity radio quasar <b>standard</b> <b>rulers,</b> probing much higher redshifts, could provide comparable constraints on different IDE scenarios. (2) The interaction between dark energy and dark matter seems to be vanishing or slightly smaller than zero. At the 68. 3 % confidence level, the energy is seen transferred from dark matter to dark energy, which implies that those IDE models can not alleviate the coincidence problem or even more sever. However, the strong degeneracies between the interaction term and Hubble constant may contribute to alleviate the tension of H_ 0 between the recent Planck and HST measurements. (3) Concerning the ranking of competing dark energy models, IDE with more free parameters are substantially penalized by the BIC criterion, which agrees very well with the previous results derived from other cosmological probes.
