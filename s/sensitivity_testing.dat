25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing.</b> Patients who get better and then get worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they should be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E

Materials and Methods: We investigated the paradoxical effect of caspofungin and micafungin on the growth and cell viability of 38 clinical isolates of Candida albicans using a microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> and growth curve methodology. Results: When cells were incubated in the presence of antifungal agents for 48 h, the paradoxical effect was observed in 50 % and 47. 4 % of the isolates incubated with caspofungin and micafungin, respectively. Growth curves indicated the occurrence of the paradoxical effect varied between different echinocandins. Moreover, increased turbidity in the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> did not correlate with increased fungal cell growth. For caspofungin, the paradoxical effect appeared earlier than in the microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> while for micafungin, the effect observed in the microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> was not a true paradoxical effect. Conclusion: The growth curve methodology is more accurate for evaluating the occurrence of the paradoxical effect in comparison with the microbial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

Direct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> are attractive because they involve only one stage of handling (i. e. cultures need not be set up), are simpler and less expensive, and consume less time.

40|$|In various {{applications}} of forensic phonetics {{the question arises}} as to how far aural-perceptual speaker recognition performance is reliable.
