5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the <b>siting</b> of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to planned increases in large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce carbon emissions are being researched. Although {{there is significant}} support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns {{about the effect of}} the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the <b>siting,</b> and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.|$|E
5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at £78,000. It had been considered {{that it might be}} appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to <b>siting</b> concerns.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1991, a {{local group}} in Albany, New York, fought the government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste <b>Siting</b> Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission.

5|$|The <b>siting</b> of noxious industries, such as tanning and fulling {{downwind}} {{outside the}} boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls. The foul-smelling industries partially preferred the East End because the prevailing winds in London traveled from west to east (i.e. it was downwind {{from the rest of the}} city), meaning that most odors from their businesses would not go into the city but outside, and thereby reduced complaints.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden.

They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E

This suggest that Clover <b>site</b> people maintained closer contact with <b>sites</b> such as Buffalo, Gue Farm, Marmet, and Rolfe Lee than with other <b>sites</b> that were to its west. Other exotic artifacts found at the <b>site,</b> such as shell gorgets associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, pottery effigy bowls, and figurines show a connection with Mississippian culture villages in what is now eastern Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to that, there are special building <b>sites</b> in the game.

5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to erect a}} statue of Seacole in London was launched on 24 November 2003, chaired by Clive Soley, Baron Soley.

There was significant opposition to the <b>siting</b> of the statue, but it was unveiled on 30 June 2016. A feature film is being made of her life by Seacole Pictures.

5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility.

There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the <b>siting</b> of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} <b>siting</b> an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E

5|$|Beeston {{was built}} by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power. The <b>siting</b> of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take {{advantage}} of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers.|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the <b>siting</b> {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} {{two steps}} to secure {{completion of the}} Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the <b>siting</b> of the Green Line route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched {{back to the original}} route.|$|E
