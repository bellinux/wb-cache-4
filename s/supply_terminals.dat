50|$|While a {{magnetic}} levitation train {{is capable of}} performing at extremely high velocities, the configurations so far consume more energy than the trains that are being used currently. This setback {{is one of the}} barriers that is preventing magnetic levitation trains from being commercialized past the experimental and entry phase. A group of scientists in the Daejeon Metropolitan Express Transit Corporation of South Korea (the corporation that operates the Daejeon Metro) focused on the braking system.Train systems such as the Incheon Airport Maglev use air brakes and electric brakes. However, magnetic levitation trains use regenerative braking and plugging braking as opposed to normal trains using regenerative braking and air braking. Regenerative braking is used when the speed of the motor exceeds the synchronous speed. When this happens, the motor changes current flow so that the motor brakes. After this happens, the excess power is converted to power for the motor. Plugging braking is used when the <b>supply</b> <b>terminals</b> are switched, but it is criticized as a wasteful practice, because in order to switch the terminals, an external resistor needs to be implemented as a stopper for the current flow. As a result, a lot of power is squandered.|$|E

The signal envelope dynamic impedance of the <b>supply</b> <b>terminal</b> of a power amplifier (PA) is often unknown and available nonlinear transistor models are unable to predict dynamic low frequency effects required for design of wideband efficient supply modulators. This thesis investigates envelope frequency effects on nonlinear behavior of microwave transistors and PAs under supply-modulated conditions.

40|$|Power supply noise, {{which is}} the {{variation}} in the supply voltage across the on-die <b>supply</b> <b>terminals</b> of VLSI circuits, is a serious performance degrader in digital circuits and mixed analog-digital circuits. In digital VLSI systems, power supply noise causes timing errors such as delays, jitter, and false switching. In microprocessors, power supply noise reduces the maximum operating frequency (FMAX) of the CPU. In mixed analog-digital circuits, power supply noise manifests as the substrate noise and impairs {{the performance of the}} analog portion. The decrease in the available noise margin with the decrease in the feature size of transistors in CMOS systems makes the power supply noise a very serious issue, and demands new methods to reduce the power supply noise in sub-micron CMOS systems. In this thesis, we develop a new method to determine optimal time-delays between the switching of input/output (I/O) data buffers in digital VLSI systems that realizes maximum reduction of the power supply noise. We first discuss methods to characterize the distributed nature of the Power Delivery Network (PDN) in the frequency-domain. We then develop an analytical method to determine the optimal delays using the frequency-domain response of the PDN and the supply current spectrum of the buffer units. We explain the mechanism behind the cancellation of the power supply noise by the introduction of optimal buffer-to-buffer delays. We also develop a numerical method to determine the optimal delays and compare it with the analytical method. We illustrate the reduction in the power supply noise by applying the optimal time-delays determined using our methods to two examples of PDN. Our method has great potential to realize maximum reduction of power supply noise in digital VLSI circuits and substrate noise in mixed analog-digital VLSI circuits. Lower power supply noise translates into lower cost and improved performance of the circuit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} {{techniques for}} power efficient design of power delivery network in multiple voltage-island System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. The first technique is targeted to SoC designs with static voltage assignment, {{while the second}} technique is pertinent to SoC designs with dynamic voltage scaling capability. Conventionally a single level configuration of DC-DC converters, where exactly one converter resides between the power source and each load, is used to deliver currents at appropriate voltage levels to different loads on the chip. In the presence of dynamic voltage scaling capability, each DC-DC converter in this network {{should be able to}} adjust its output voltage. In {{the first part of this}} paper it is shown that in a SoC design with static voltage assignment, a multi-level tree topology of suitably chosen DC-DC converters and voltage regulators between the power source and loads can result in higher power efficiency in the power delivery network. The problem is formulated as a combinatorial problem and is efficiently solved by dynamic programming. In the second part of the paper, a new technique is presented to design the power delivery network for a SoC design to support dynamic voltage scaling. In this technique the power delivery network is composed of two layers. In the first layer, DC-DC converters with fixed output voltages are used to generate all voltage levels that are needed by different loads in the SoC design. In the second layer of the power delivery network, a power switch network is used to dynamically connect the power <b>supply</b> <b>terminals</b> each load to the appropriate DC-DC converter output in the first layer. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both techniques. Index Terms — Low-power design, power delivery network, voltage regulator, DC-DC converter, energy efficiency, voltag...|$|E

40|$|To enhance {{thermal comfort}} and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) by using {{least amount of}} energy is a {{challenge}} for building ventilation system. One answer to this challenge is “ventilation strategies” which are characterized by {{the placement of the}} terminal configurations and the control schemes such as supply temperature and velocity. Mixing (MJV), displacement (DV), and newly introduced impinging jet (IJV) system, are the available options for a common ventilated room. Past studies show that IJV performs impressively yet this system is still lacking of studies in many aspects. For the practitioners to use this system, impinging jet characteristics, terminal configurations, operation method such as Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) and Constant-Air-Volume (CAV), and space volume, are four objectives that must be answered with the first priority. In the process of completing these objectives, this dissertation has maximized the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) by not only for visualizing the flow but also for developing a new ventilation index called CFD ventilation performances. This index is unique for CFD and impossible to be obtained from full scale experiment. Recommended by the standards such as ASHRAE RP- 1133, full scale experiment was rather used for validating the CFD results such as predictive models of an impinging jet. After implementing this newly developed index, well-known indices such as ventilation effectiveness and PMV-PPD (Predicted-Mean-Vote and Predicted-Percentage-of-Dissatisfaction) with related ventilation theories, parameters to make IJV provided the better IAQ and consumed less energy are the results. With high ventilation effectiveness at least 1. 1, IJV still can be supplied with normal velocity and typical cool temperature which is not possible for DV, while disadvantages are stratification discomfort and draft near <b>supply</b> <b>terminals.</b> Given the confirmed promising results of a case study classroom, there are many architectural applications possible for implementing IJV.
