Computational simulations are carried out by FEM, where linear coupling equations are used for modeling of revolute joints and linear <b>sliding</b> <b>guidance</b> is modeled by structural contact of rail and slider.

In this paper, we study the guided relative motion of two spacecraft for which one of them is executing an autonomous rendezvous via the ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance and its robustified Optimal <b>Sliding</b> <b>Guidance</b> (OSG) counterpart. Starting from the classical Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) model, we systematically analyze the ability of the ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance to generate closed loop trajectories that drive the deputy spacecraft to the chief satellite and evaluate its performance in terms of target accuracy and propellant consumption. It is shown that the guidance gains and the time of flight predicted by the theoretical solution generates a class of feedback trajectories that are accurate but suboptimal with respect to the open-loop fuel-optimal solution. Indeed, a parametric study shows that a different set of gains may generate relative guided trajectories that yields fuel consumption closer to the ideal optimal. The guidance algorithms are also demonstrated to be accurate in guiding the relative motion of the deputy toward a chief spacecraft in highly elliptical orbit where the Linearized Equations of Relative Motions (LERM) are employed to compute the Zero-Effort-Miss (ZEM) and Zero-Effort-Velocity (ZEV) necessary to compute the acceleration command as prescribed by the theory...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{non-linear}} methodologies {{that can be}} employed to devise real-time algorithms suitable for guidance and control of spacecrafts during asteroid close-proximity operations. Combination of optimal and sliding control theory provide the theoretical framework {{for the development of}} guidance laws that generates thrust commands as function of the estimated spacecraft state. Using a Lyapunov second theorem one can design non-linear guidance laws that are proven to be globally stable against unknown perturbations with known upper bound. Such algorithms can be employed for autonomous targeting of points of the asteroid surface (soft landing, Touch-And-Go (TAG) maneuvers). Here, we theoretically derived and tested the Optimal <b>Sliding</b> <b>Guidance</b> (OSG) for close-proximity operations. The guidance algorithm has its root in the generalized ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance and its mathematical equations are naturally derived by a proper definition of a sliding surface as function of Zero-Effort-Miss and Zero-Effort-Velocity. Thus, the sliding surface allows a natural augmentation of the energy-optimalguidance via a sliding mode that ensures global stability for the proposed algorithm. A set of Monte Carlo simulations in realistic environment are executed to assess the guidance performance in typical operational scenarios found during asteroids close-proximity operations. OSG is shown to satisfy stringent requirements for asteroid pinpoint landing and sampling accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Devising {{closed-loop}} guidance algorithms for autonomous {{relative motion}} {{is an important}} problem {{within the field of}} orbital dynamics. However, very few closed-loop algorithms have been devised that can autonomously generate feedback trajectories to execute rendezvous in relative motion (e. g. Lopez and McInnes, 1995, JGCD). In this paper, we explore the application of the generalized Zero-Effort-Miss/Zero-Effort-Velocity (ZEM/ZEV) feedback guidance (Guo et al., 2013, JGCD) and its robustified version known as Optimal <b>Sliding</b> <b>Guidance</b> (OSG, Wibben and Furfaro, 2016, ASR) to the problem of closed-loop spacecraft rendezvous guidance. The ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance has been studied extensively and {{can be found in the}} literature for intercept, rendezvous, terminal guidance and landing applications. Such analytical closed-loop guidance has been originally conceived by Battin who devised an energy optimal, feedback acceleration command for powered planetary descent. Ebrahimi et al. (2008, AA) introduced the ZEV concept, as a partner for the well-known ZEM and integrated it with a sliding surface for missile guidance with fixed-time propulsive maneuvers. Furfaro et al. (2011, Advances in Astronautical Sciences) extended the idea to the problem of lunar landing guidance and set the basis for the theoretical development of a robust closed-loop algorithm for precision landing. ZEM/ZEM feedback guidance is attractive because of its analytical simplicity as well as potential for quasi-optimal fuel performance. When robustified by a time-dependent sliding term, the resulting OSG can be proven to be Globally Finite-Time Stable (GFTS) in spite of perturbation with known upper bound. Here, we study the guided relative motion of two spacecraft for which one of them is executing an autonomous rendezvous via the ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance and its robustifed OSG counterpart. When augmented via time-dependent sliding, the application of Lyapunov stability theory for non-autonomous systems provides the sufficient conditions for GFTS. Indeed, the OSG can be demonstrated to be GFTS for any linear and non-linear relative motion model (e. g. rendezvous in circular orbit or in highly eccentric orbit). Starting from the classical Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) model, we systematically analyze the ability of the ZEM/ZEV feedback guidance to execute quasi-optimal closed-loop maneuvers and its ability to correct disturbances for precision guidance. Comparison with the OSG counterpart will provide an assessment of the need for robustification as function of different rendezvous conditions (e. g. rendezvous in highly elliptical orbit) and different thrusting constraints (e. g. limited thrust) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} and application of various nonlinear, autonomous guidance algorithms that utilize sliding mode control to guarantee system stability and robustness. While {{the basis for the}} algorithms has previously been proposed, past efforts barely scratched the surface of the theoretical details and implications of these algorithms. Of the three algorithms that are the subject of this research, two are directly derived from optimal control theory and augmented using sliding mode control. Analysis of the derivation of these algorithms has shown that they are two different representations of the same result, one of which uses a simple error state model (Δr/Δv) and the other uses definitions of the zero-effort miss and zero-effort velocity (ZEM/ZEV) values. By investigating the dynamics of the defined sliding surfaces and their impact on the overall system, many implications have been deduced regarding the behavior of these systems which are noted to feature time-varying sliding modes. A formal finite time stability analysis has also been performed to theoretically demonstrate that the algorithms globally stabilize the system in finite time in the presence of perturbations and unmodeled dynamics. The third algorithm that has been subject to analysis is derived from a direct application of higher-order sliding mode control and Lyapunov stability analysis without consideration of optimal control theory and has been named the Multiple Sliding Surface Guidance (MSSG). Via use of reinforcement learning methods an optimal set of gains has been found that make the guidance perform similarly to an open-loop optimal solution. Careful side-by-side inspection of the MSSG and Optimal <b>Sliding</b> <b>Guidance</b> (OSG) algorithms has shown some striking similarities. A detailed comparison of the algorithms has demonstrated that though they are nearly indistinguishable at first glance, there are some key differences between the two algorithms and they are indeed not identical. Finally, this work has a large focus on the application of these various algorithms to a large number of space based applications. These include applications to powered-terminal descent for landing on planetary bodies such as the moon and Mars and to proximity operations (landing, hovering, or maneuvering) about small bodies such as an asteroid or a comet. Further extensions of these algorithms have allowed for adaptation of a hybrid control strategy for planetary landing, and the combined modeling and simultaneous control of both the vehicle's position and orientation implemented within a full six degree-of-freedom spacecraft simulation...|$|E

However, the probability of clinical complications associated with metallosis after the implantation of such devices is poorly understood. The content of metal ions in the blood and tissues of pediatric patients treated for scoliosis using fusionless growth <b>guidance</b> <b>sliding</b> instrumentation, have not yet been investigated.

STUDY DESIGN: One center case-control retrospective study. PATIENTS SAMPLE: Study group included 25 patients with high growth potential (3 males, 22 females, average age at primary surgery for scoliosis treatment is 11. 4 ± 1. 2 years old) who had <b>sliding</b> growth <b>guidance</b> instrumentation LSZ- 4 D (Conmet, Moscow, Russia) implanted on 13 (range 10 - 16) spine levels for 6 ± 2 years. The LSZ- 4 D device was made from titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V and consisted of two rectangular section rods and fixture elements. Locked fixtures were used on one spinal level, while the others were unlocked (sliding). The control group consisted of 13 patients (12 females and 1 male, 11 ± 1. 2 years old) without any implanted devices.

The paper proposed a guidance law based on non-singular terminal sliding mode (NTSM). In the non-singular Terminal sliding mode control, the tracking error on the sliding surface can converge to zero in a finite time, so a nonlinear term was introduced into the design of the terminal guidance law to substitute the traditional linear sliding mode. In addition, considering the measurement error and the external interference as disturbance with known boundary and making an adaptive estimation to extremes in real time, a non-singular terminal <b>sliding</b> mode <b>guidance</b> law was presented. Controlled by TSMG, the rate of the line-of-sight (LOS) angle between bomb and target can converge quickly, and high guidance precision of bomb in large range airspace of flight condition can be obtained.

40|$|To {{intercept}} maneuvering targets at desired impact angles, {{a three-dimensional}} terminal guidance problem is investigated in this study. Because {{of a short}} terminal guidance time, a finite-time impact angle control guidance law is developed using the fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control theory.

Therefore, by adopting a novel reaching law, an adaptive <b>sliding</b> mode <b>guidance</b> law is provided to release the drawback.

The trajectory of the missile is controlled by controlling the speed of a virtual target that slides towards a predicted intercept point during the midcourse phase. Several sliding schemes, both linear and nonlinear, are proposed and the effect of the variation of the sliding parameters, which control the sliding speed of the virtual target, on the missile performance, are examined through extensive simulations that take into account the atmospheric characteristics as well as limitations on the missile in terms of the energy available and lateral acceleration limits.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{achieving}} pinpoint landing accuracy in future space missions to extra-terrestrial bodies {{such as the}} Moon or Mars presents many challenges, including the requirements of higher accuracy and more flexibility. These new challenges may require the development of novel and more advanced guidance algorithms. Conventional guidance schemes, which generally require a combination of off-line trajectory generation and real-time, trajectory tracking algorithms, have worked well {{in the past but}} may not satisfy the more stringent and difficult landing requirements imposed by future mission architectures to bring landers very near to specified locations. In this paper, a novel non-linear guidance algorithm for planetary landing is proposed and analyzed. Based on Higher-Order Sliding Control (HOSC) theory, the Multiple <b>Sliding</b> Surface <b>Guidance</b> (MSSG) algorithms has been specifically designed {{to take advantage of the}} ability of the system to reach the sliding surface in a finite time. The high control activity seen in typical sliding controllers is avoided in this formulation, resulting in a guidance law that is both globally stable and robust against unknown, but bounded perturbations. The proposed MSSG does not require any off-line trajectory generation and therefore it is flexible enough to target a large variety of point on the planet’s surface without the need for calculation of multiple reference trajectories. However, after initial analysis, it has been seen that the performance of MSSG is very sensitive to the choice in guidance gains. MSSG generated trajectories have been compared to an optimal solution to begin an investigation of the relationship between the optimality and performance of MSSG and the selection of the guidance parameters. A full study has been performed to investigate and tune the parameters of MSSG utilizing reinforcement learning in order to truly optimize the performance of the MSSG algorithm. Results show that the MSSG algorithm can indeed generate trajectories that come very close to the optimal solution in terms of fuel usage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimization {{of the performance}} of a recently proposed virtual <b>sliding</b> target (VST) <b>guidance</b> scheme in terms of maximization of its launch envelope for three- dimensional (3 -D) engagements. The objective is to obtain the launch envelope of the missile using the VST guidance scheme for different lateral launch angles with respect to the line of sight (LOS) and demonstrate its superiority over kinematics-based guidance laws like proportional navigation (PN). The VST scheme uses PN as its basic guidance scheme and exploits the relation between the atmospheric properties, missile aerodynamic characteristics, and the optimal trajectory of the missile. The missile trajectory is shaped by controlling the instantaneous position and the speed of a virtual target which the missile pursues during the midcourse phase. In the proposed method it is shown that an appropriate value of initial position for the virtual target in 3 -D, combined with optimized virtual target parameters, can significantly improve the launch envelope performance. The paper presents the formulation of the optimization problem, obtains the approximate models used to make the optimization problem more tractable, and finally presents the optimized performance of the missile in terms of launch envelope and shows significant improvement over kinematic-based guidance laws.

The practical will focus on providing the registrants with the confidence to differentiate inflammatory from neoplastic disease, to specify which type of inflammation or neoplasia is causing the mass lesion/organ enlargement, and how to differentiate causes of fluid accumulation through fluid classification (e. g. exudate, chylous effusion). These skills will aid the clinician in narrowing differential diagnoses in their patient population with in-house diagnostics. Discussion of tips and tricks to help determine where on the slide to look, what is an important finding and what is an artifact, and the significance of the cytology findings will occur. The examples provided will focus on common inflammatory diseases, commonly encountered neoplasms, and cavitary fluids {{and by the end of}} the session the registrants will be much more comfortable with their in-house cytology ability and knowing when submission to the laboratory may be required to confirm or further narrow in-house findings...|$|R
40|$|The project {{focuses on}} a variety of impacts and hazard-associated manifestations of radon gas. This divides into two {{overlapping}} areas of interest: · radon as a health hazard · recent European research has demonstrated that there is no 'safe' lower limit for radon exposure · radon as an indicator of crustal processes and geohazards · understanding the behaviour and drivers of radon gas is very important and helpful for hazard planners, both concerning radon itself and using it as a possible earthquake / landslide / volcanic hazard monitor and precursor By considering these, the project has a high headline potential for bringing together the dispersed research on radon hazard within interdisciplinary context and facilitating potential scientific advancement, involving: · geological and environmental sciences · medical sciences · engineering and architecture The project aims are to organise international and local/regional meetings and to generate and disseminate material for training courses. The project will also significantly promote international co-operation over and above formal meetings and benefit to society will be worldwide. The project will include universities, governmental and non-governmental bodies, commercial companies and local councils - on a global scale. There are currently five universities/institutions from five countries involved, from which the co-ordinating group is drawn, with a people from universities/institutions in a further nine countries having expressed their intention to become involved. Intended activities and outputs are: · NHESS special issue drawn from the 2009 EGU General Assembly launch session (in progress) · websites at host universities/institutions · oral and poster presentations and short-course at 2010 EGU General Assembly · workshops and working groups at 2010 EGU General Assembly · establishment of local / regional working groups · student training program and instrument training · meetings and published proceedings · self-running PowerPoint <b>slides</b> · and <b>guidance</b> notes in PDF form will be available on the website · project boo...|$|R
40|$|Surgery {{for early}} onset {{scoliosis}} (EOS) often requires instrumentation which enables the pediatric patient’s spine to grow. The drawback of growing rods (Ellipse Technologies, USA) is {{the requirement of}} periodical extension (at least twice a year). In contrast, in growth- <b>guidance</b> <b>sliding</b> devices such as the Shilla (Medtronic, USA) or LSZ- 4 D (Conmet, Russia) the extension procedure is not necessary since only one or few fixtures are locked whilst other fixtures {{make it possible for}} rods to slide allowing growth of the spine. However, due to the absence of fusion in sliding devices increased rate of fractures of rods is possible. Additionally, movement of rods against fixtures may result in the generation of wear debris. Among traditional metallic materials used for such instrumentation titanium alloys are the most biocompatible and are widely used as fixtures material, while Nitinol, an alloy with Shape memory effect, is a promising material for rods due to having potential for more gradual and sustained correction associated with its shape memory effect and potentially reducing adjacent segment degeneration due to its super-elastic properties. The aim of this thesis was to investigate complications associated with implantation of growth-guidance sliding LSZ- 4 D in pediatric patients and to investigate the use of Nitinol and titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) for this application. Analysis of retrieved components of LSZ growth-guidance sliding device (LSZ- 4 D) made from titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) implanted in paediatric patients together with associated tissues showed metallosis which in some cases {{led to the development of}} complications including seromas and fistula formation. These complications occurred in 5 out of the 25 patients investigated. Another 4 patients encountered fatigue fracture of rods. The volume wear rate measured for the retrieved components of LSZ- 4 D was found to be 12. 5 mm 3 per year. In these 25 patients with implanted LSZ- 4 D devices there was a statistically significant increase in titanium and vanadium ions in the whole blood. With a view to replacing titanium alloy rods with Nitinol an investigation on the fatigue behaviour of Nitinol revealed that creating a microstructure which increased deformation due to a martensitic phase transformation improved high strain amplitude fatigue resistance of Nitinol, whereas precipitation of nanosize Ni-rich particles and decreasing of Ti 4 Ni 2 ox inclusions resulted in an increase in low strain fatigue resistance. The wear behaviour of Nitinol in comparison to titanium alloy was also investigated and showed that the wear resistance of Nitinol tested against titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) in the simulated body environment is approximately 100 fold greater compared to titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) and is similar to that of CoCr alloy. Nevertheless, Nitinol - Ti 6 Al 4 V combination still generates high volumetric wear associated with debris release from the Ti 6 Al 4 V component. Coating and treating the surface with TiN (titanium nitride), DLC (diamond like carbon) coatings and ion implantation of nitrogen ions in some instances reduced the wear. The deposition of a TiN coating only on the titanium component in a Nitinol - Ti 6 Al 4 V combination significantly improved the wear performance and this was associated with the protection of titanium component whereas the application of DLC improved the wear performance of both titanium and Nitinol. [on implantation or deposition of TiN or DLC coatings on both counterparts was found to be less effective. The current study indicates the importance and potential of reducing the reliance on titanium alloy by using Nitinol for patients with scoliosis and especially in those cases where relative moment of the fixtures is required, such as in growing patients...|$|R
