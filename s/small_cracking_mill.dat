The behavior and growth rates of the <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> were measured in situ during cycling using a fatigue loading stage contained within an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). We provide quantitative data describing the interaction of representative <b>small</b> fatigue <b>cracks</b> with microstructural features, along with the average growth rate data for approximately 20 different <b>cracks.</b> <b>Small</b> surface and corner cracks, with sizes ranging from 20 to 200 µm, are observed to interact strongly with the surface microstructure during growth. The <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> preferentially propagate through the dendrite cells, and the particle laden interdendritic regions typically act as barriers to fatigue crack propagation. As the <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> approach the interdendritic boundaries, measured growth rates decrease and the cracks sometimes becomes temporarily pinned at the boundary. <b>Cracks</b> <b>smaller</b> than 100 µm experience more significant disruptions in crack growth rates at interdendritic boundaries compared to the larger cracks that interact with the boundaries, but with less change in crack growth rates. Under nominally identical loading conditions, isolated microstructurally <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> grow, on average, two orders of magnitude faster in a sample containing a higher fraction of porosity. The significantly higher crack growth rates in the more porous sample were attributed to local amplification of the nominal stress field {{in the vicinity of}} the microstructurally <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> rather than explicit interactions between growing cracks and pores.

Accurate detection of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> in rotated blades is very significant for safety, reliability, and availability. In nature, a breathing crack model is {{fit for a}} <b>small</b> <b>crack</b> in a rotated blade rather than other models. However, traditional vibration displacements-based methods are less sensitive to nonlinear characteristics due to <b>small</b> breathing <b>cracks.</b> In order to solve this problem, vibration power flow analysis (VPFA) is proposed to analyze nonlinear dynamic behaviors of rotated blades with <b>small</b> breathing <b>cracks</b> in this paper. Firstly, local flexibility due to a crack is derived and then time-varying dynamic model of the rotated blade with a <b>small</b> breathing <b>crack</b> is built.

We propose an over-energy under dissymmetrical rotating bending and expressed in the ellipse axes. An asymptotic approach is transformed the over-energy in polynomial function of critical stress.
