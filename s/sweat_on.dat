500|$|The fight {{scenes were}} heavily choreographed, but the actors were {{required}} to [...] "go full out" [...] to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, {{who worked for the}} director on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create <b>sweat</b> <b>on</b> cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for [...] "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has [...] "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound (40kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role.

[...] Writing for Metro Weekly, Doug Rule called the song an [...] "instant classic" [...] and referred it to as a [...] "sequel of sorts to Elliott's marvelous 2002 hit 'Work It'."

40|$|ABSTRACT: The sweat control {{provided}} by cold pipe/sheet insulation {{depends on the}} surface temperature, the dew point of air and the thermal and surface characteris-tics of the insulation. The objective of the present research is to observe and better understand how surface <b>sweating</b> <b>on</b> closed cell foam insulation occurs at different relative humidities and air temperatures. An apparatus was built to measure the sur-face temperature of foam insulation on a cold plate at various air temperatures and relative humidities. From {{the analysis of the}} experimental data, it can be concluded that the surface of an insulation would visibly sweat only if adverse conditions of air temperature and relative humidity are sustained for rather long periods of time. The reasons are a strong dependence of surface <b>sweating</b> <b>on</b> surface temperature, an increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient with relative humidity at constant air tempera-ture, and a possible condensation of a thin invisible layer of water on the surface...|$|R

2500|$|Livy {{presents}} {{these as}} signs of widespread failure in Roman religio.

The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a cock (and vice versa) – these were expiated with [...] "lesser victims". The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina, singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation. Religious restitution is proved only by Rome's victory.|$|E
2500|$|Academy Award nominee, screenwriter and {{director}} Josh Olson, most {{famous for his}} screenplay for A History of Violence, made a video review of Sorcerer for the Trailers from Hell webseries in 2007. He praised the movie highly, stating that it is Friedkin's best effort ("Sorcerer is Friedkin {{at the top of}} his game") and was [...] "at least equal to the original." [...] He also applauded the atmosphere, which he said had [...] "a wonderful tone to it and a real sense of dread and desperation [...] it's tight and suspenseful, every scene grabs you by the collar, and it's beautifully shot. You can feel the humidity down there in South America. You can feel the <b>sweat</b> <b>on</b> the sticks of dynamite." [...] He concluded the review by saying that the only aspect in which the movie failed was the fact that it came out around the same time as Star Wars. Olson felt that [...] "the movie deserved a huge audience" [...] as well as fantasizing that [...] "somewhere there's an alternate universe where Sorcerer is a massive game-changing hit in Hollywood and I'm doing Trailers from Hell commentary on some unknown cult classic called Star Wars. In that world Hollywood has spent the next 30 years making smart, edgy movies for grown-ups, the literacy rate is 100%, we haven't been in a war since Vietnam and world hunger is just a memory." ...|$|E

However, the sole insulation during walking could be even higher than during standing. This could be related to reduced conductive heat loss and heat gain through friction. Some problems that occurred during these preliminary tests are discussed as well...|$|R
