5000|$|He {{gained the}} {{attention}} of the national media in 1993 when he challenged the operating practices of the media giant TCI Cable. The firm, which had contracted with Brentwood to provide cable television services, added without notice or approval two explicitly adult (pay-per-view) channels, Playboy TV and Spice Networks, and was done to test market the service. When a <b>subscriber</b> <b>television</b> was turned on it would automatically [...] "default" [...] to one of the adult channels, each being lightly scrambled but still providing full uncensored audio. These [...] "mechanical" [...] features made contact with the channels unavoidable, making children vulnerable to programming designed explicitly for adult viewers.|$|E
50|$|On 4 April 1988, {{the station}} started {{broadcasting}} {{under the same}} name Radio 10. Radio 10 was an initiative of former VARA DJ Jeroen Soer. Commercial radio in the Netherlands was still not allowed, but they bypassed that with the so-called U-turn construction, using the possibility that commercial stations from abroad were allowed on the Dutch cable and Radio 10 passed the Amsterdam-made programs via satellite to Italy. Radio 10 was officially an Italian station of the company Rete Zero, with an FM frequency (105 FM) in Milan. This was allowed under the law, applying to satellite and cable broadcasts. Via an uplink station in Belgium by the <b>subscriber</b> <b>television</b> channel FilmNet the signal {{was sent to the}} Dutch cable networks. With this construction, there were some Italian jingles heard on the station. Disc jockeys from the very beginning have included Ferry Maat, Adam Curry, DaniÃ«l Dekker, Peter Rijsenbrij, Jeroen Soer and Roderick Veelo.|$|E

The bill would have made an exception for foreign intelligence gathering in the laws that require a court order necessary for pen register and trap and trace surveillance. It would also have removed restrictions on the prohibition of gaining access to cable <b>television</b> <b>subscriber</b> records and only prohibited the disclosure of viewing patterns of cable <b>television</b> <b>subscribers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the most}} common system, {{multiple}} television channels (as many as 500, although this varies depending on the provider's available channel capacity) are distributed to subscriber residences through a coaxial cable, which comes from a trunkline supported on utility poles originating at the cable company's local distribution facility, called the [...] "headend". Many channels can be transmitted through one coaxial cable by a technique called frequency division multiplexing. At the headend, each television channel is translated to a different frequency. By giving each channel a different frequency [...] "slot" [...] on the cable, the separate television signals do not interfere with each other. The main cable meets lines from the subscriber's residence in an outdoor cable box, and either the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>television</b> or a set-top box provided by the cable company translates the desired channel back to its original frequency (baseband), and it is displayed onscreen. Due to widespread cable theft in earlier analog systems, the signals are typically encrypted on modern digital cable systems, and the set-top box must be activated by an activation code sent by the cable company before it will function, which is only sent after the subscriber signs up. If the subscriber fails to pay his bill, the cable company can send a signal to deactivate the subscriber's box, preventing reception.|$|R
