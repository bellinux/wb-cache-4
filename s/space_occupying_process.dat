40|$|Four {{patients}} had nocturnal back pain or pain that worsened when lying down. In one of these, a 49 -year-old man, the medical history mentioned a malignancy, {{as a result}} of which a spinal metastasis was suspected. In the other three patients, a 52 -year old woman and two men aged 48 and 60 years, the nocturnal back pain and the back pain worsening when lying down was not recognised as indication of a spinal tumour. As objective neurological symptoms were not established at initial investigation, a long period of discomfort and frustration followed before the spinal tumour was diagnosed eventually. The importance of recognising these early complaints is stressed. Nowadays, MRI is the technique of choice to answer the question whether there is a <b>space</b> <b>occupying</b> <b>process</b> in the spine...|$|E
40|$|Brain {{diseases}} in the horse are rare. The diagnosis, {{spread of the}} pathology and any possible planning of the surgical treatment can be made using MRI. Some congenital diseases like Dandy-Walker-Like Syndrome and hydrocephalus give a typical MRI image, just like hemorrhage, edema and infection. A tumor, hematoma, cyst and abscess are <b>space</b> <b>occupying</b> <b>processes</b> that have each their own specific qualities and each giving a specific image on T 1 and T 2. The tumors most frequently seen are cholesterinic granulomas in the choroid plexus, hypophysis tumors and metastases from the nose, the sinuses, the eye or other primary tumors in the body.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} radiographs {{taken at}} the Clinic for Small Animals at the Free University of Berlin between 1994 & 1999. Abdominal radiographs of 368 guinea pigs, 233 (63. 3 %) female and 132 (35. 9 %) male are included. Subject preparation and positioning techniques are discussed. In view of the clinical signs, the application and diagnostic value of plain radiographs in guinea pigs with abdominal diseases are examined. Another primary goal {{of this study is}} to describe the normal radiographical anatomy, including the exact positioning of the abdominal organs, in guinea pigs. Within the gastrointestinal tract of guinea pigs older than six months, under normal physiologic conditions, it is possible to distinguish the stomach, liver, cecum, descending colon, kidneys and bladder. Large amounts of gas inside the gastrointestinal tract are seen in guinea pigs with gastrointestinal, urogenital or general disorders. The occurrence of tympania of the stomach, cecum or both combined could be seen very often, of which tympania of the stomach predominates. Whereas tympania of the stomach could be seen mostly in females, cecal tympania predominated in males. These gastrointestinal disorders were rarely caused by improper feeding, but instead were secondary to diseases of the oral cavity that lead to anorexia. Overloading, bezoars and calcification of the stomach are also described. The radiographic portrait of the liver, pancreas and spleen in guinea pigs are described. Disorders of the liver can be seen as an enlargement with steatosis, congestion and abscesses. Radiological signs of liver enlargement include extension of its caudal margin beyond the first lumbar vertebra, a distance between cranial and caudal border greater than 4 cm and dislocation of the cranial stomach border above thoracic vertebra 11 to 13 on the ventral dorsal view. Specific detection of the normal pancreas is limited, but diffuse calcification of the pancreas secondary to malignant tumors enhances its visibility. Splenomegaly was correlated with serious infections of the gastrointestinal tract and tumours. The normal length of the kidneys varied between 2. 1 and 2. 9 times the length of the first lumbar vertebral body. Besides tympania and <b>space</b> <b>occupying</b> <b>processes</b> in the abdominal cavity, radiography is very important for the diagnosis of urolithiasis. These can be seen as early as nine months of age, and are one of the most common diseases in guinea pigs. Urinary gravel and calculi could be found in each part of the urinary tract. Urolithiasis is more frequent in females. A painful abdomen and urinary disorders should always prompt a radiographic examination in this species. This study found and describes abdominal radiographs as valuable in examination of disorders of the female guinea pigs genital tract and pregnancy. Abnormal findings of the skeleton are considered and included in the description...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: White matter tractography {{based on}} {{diffusion}} tensor imaging {{has become a}} well-accepted non-invasive tool for exploring the white matter architecture {{of the human brain}} in vivo. There exist two main key obstacles for reconstructing white matter fibers: firstly, the implementation and application of a suitable tracking algorithm, which is capable of reconstructing anatomically complex fascicular pathways correctly, as, e. g., areas of fiber crossing or branching; secondly, the definition of an appropriate tracking seed area for starting the reconstruction process. Large intersubject, anatomical variations make it difficult to define tracking seed areas based on reliable anatomical landmarks. An accurate definition of seed regions for the reconstruction of a specific neuronal pathway becomes even more challenging in patients suffering from <b>space</b> <b>occupying</b> pathological <b>processes</b> as, e. g., tumors due to the displacement of the tissue and the distortion of anatomical landmarks around the lesion. Methods: To resolve the first problem, an advanced tracking algorithm, called advanced fast marching, was applied in this study. The second challenge was overcome by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in order to perform fMRI-guided accurate definition of appropriate seed areas for the DTI fiber tracking. In addition, the performance of the tasks was controlled by a MR-compatible power device. Results Application of this combined approach to eight healthy volunteers and exemplary to three tumor patients showed that it is feasible to accurately reconstruct relevant fiber tracts belonging to a specific functional system. Conclusion: fMRI-guided advanced DTI fiber tracking has the potential to provide accurate anatomical and functional information for a more informed therapeutic decision making...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} divided in two parts. The main {{concept of the}} first part is that warping of space is {{provoked}} by the particles emitted by the masses, but not because their interactions (not because the energy or momentum of these emitted particles), but instead, due to the <b>space</b> they <b>occupy</b> (they create). The new space occupied/created by these particles warps space. In the article, it is calculated that the Schwarzschild metric (compared with the Euclidean metric) creates space in a (21 r) distribution, the same distribution of the particles emitted by the masses. So it is considered the possibility that this new space appears, due to the new <b>space</b> <b>occupied</b> (created) by these emitted particles. According to this, when a mass increases, it should increase the <b>space</b> <b>occupied</b> by the particles emitted, so the warping {{is proportional to the}} mass. In the second part, it is calculated that the <b>space</b> <b>occupied</b> by the photons emitted by a body is proportional to the mass of the body that emits them. This makes them a possible candidate to be the transmittals of the warping of space. When the mass increases, the space emitted by it should increase in the same proportion (to increase also the warping). In the second part it is shown that the <b>space</b> <b>occupied</b> by the photons emitted by a mass follows this rule. This means, the <b>space</b> <b>occupied</b> by the photons would transmit the space created by the Schwarzschild metric, consequently its warping and consequently the gravitational field. Independently, the energy and momentum of the photons (their interactions) would transmit the electromagnetic field...|$|R
