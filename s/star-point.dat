In 1973, Bozulich began work on a seven-volume set covering all the fundamentals of the game, The Elementary Go Series, {{with the publication of}} In the Beginning by Ishigure and Life and Death by Kosugi and Davies. By 1984, the set was complete, when Ishi Press published Nagahara and Bozulich's Handicap Go. Meanwhile, Bozulich continued to translate and publish Japanese material for the nascent Western go-playing community, selecting volumes such as Kageyama's Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and Kage's Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go, and a series of books about basic opening strategies: The Power of the <b>Star-Point</b> (Takagawa), The Chinese Opening: The Sure Win Strategy (Kato) and The 3-3 Point: Modern Opening Theory (Cho).|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} it is shown {{that in the}} case of an {{automotive}} electric power steering system, critical pulse power loads can be decoupled from the power net with a storage element and a multifunctional converter. A multifunctional converter system is proposed because it uses the motor drive system as a dc-dc converter and hence no additional front-end dc-dc converter is required. The influence of a multifunctional converter to the torque and losses in induction and PM synchronous machines were analyzed and design guidelines developed. This was necessary because of the fixed <b>star-point</b> connection and the superimposed dc phase currents in a multifunctional converter system. It was shown with analytical models and FEM simulations verified with measurements on induction and PM synchronous machines that the winding scheme has to be carefully selected to avoid partial saturation, braking torque and increased torque ripple. With the presented design improvements, consisting of interleaved pulse-width modulation and winding arrangements, the high-frequency ripple currents were significantly reduced. A further benefit of a multifunctional converter is that three-phase electrical machines can be operated with only two active phases to increase the reliability.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the metaphoric {{use of language}} symbols in analogy to the nonlinguistic pragmatics of using a tool. The basic mechanism of natural language communication is analyzed as an internal matching between the signs ’ literal meaning and the contextual referents, {{based on the principle}} of best match. An important precondition for successful reference is thereby the delimitation of potential referential candidates in the speaker-hearer-internal context of use. This delimitation is based on the <b>STAR-point,</b> i. e. the parameters of the sign’s origin. The pragmatic hierarchy of language uses presented in conclusion is compared with a task of nonlinguistic pragmatics, whereby the different types of use are explained as a way to overcome the inherently limited choice of words for an unlimited variety of referents. 1 Using an organon A theory of nonlinguistic pragmatics must describe the structure of the tools, of the objects to be worked on, and the user’s strategies of applying a tool to an object in order to realize a certain purpose. Analogously, a theory of linguistic pragmatics requires an explicit definition of literal meaning (tool), of the interpretation context (object to be worked on), and of the strategies for relating a literal meaning and a context such that the intended speaker meaning is communicated. Just as a tool is positioned in a specific spot of the object to be worked on and then manipulated in a purposeful way, a suitable literal meaning is positioned relative to a certain internal subcontext in order to represent it linguistically (speaker mode) or to insert it into the subcontext (hearer mode). 2 Internal matching pragmatics In the SLIM theory of language, 1 the utterance meaning (meaning 2) is defined as the use of a literal meaning (meaning 1) relative to a context of use. Reference is modeled as an internal matching procedure between the meaning 1 of language (types) and corresponding contextual referents (I-concepts loc, tokens). This procedure is illustrated in 2. 1 with the sign type symbol, whose meaning 1 is defined as an M-concept...|$|E

It was {{built around a}} steep rock which stood thirty feet high and which was central on a plateau from the hillside. The plateau was relatively flat-topped and La Vasseur built terraces and breastworks all along its edges and into the hillside, enough to accommodate hundreds of men. Star forts were being employed in Europe at this time, so Fort de Rocher was built with two <b>star-points,</b> or redans, facing the coast. The hillside was cleared of trees to give a nearly 180° view of the waterfront. The fortress boasted 24 guns overlooking the harbor and its environs. It also housed a natural water spring.|$|R

Similar to our earlier stellar system, a two-dimensional detector array measures the spectra of the star and the adjacent sky, so that auroral emission from the sky can be subtracted from the stellar signal. Some new features are an altitude–azimuth pointing mirror, so that the spectrometer does not move; slip rings to provide its power thereby avoiding flexing of cables and restriction of all-around viewing; and a glazed enclosure around the mirror to ensure protection from rain and snow, made from flat plates to avoid changing the focal length of the telescope. The optical system can also view sunlight scattered from the zenith sky. The system automatically points and tracks selected stars and switches to other views on command. The system is now installed at Halley in Antarctica, and some preliminary measurements of ozone from Antarctica are shown...|$|R

A 2 -operating parameter central composite design (with 2 * 2 = 4 factorial points, 2 * 2 <b>star-points</b> and 2 repetitions of central point) was adopted to optimize and model the impact of demolition aggregate content (8. 6 - 86. 4) wt. %, and water/cement ratio (0. 43 - 0. 57) for concrete contain demolishing components as coarse aggregate on compressive strength and density.

60|$|Yet {{how could}} we miserable hail the {{approach}} of this delightful season? We hoped indeed that death did not now as heretofore walk in its shadow; yet, left as we were alone to each other, we looked in each other's faces with enquiring eyes, not daring altogether to trust to our presentiments, and endeavouring to divine {{which would be the}} hapless survivor to the other three. We were to pass the summer at the lake of Como, and thither we removed as soon as spring grew to her maturity, and the snow disappeared from the hill tops. Ten miles from Como, under the steep heights of the eastern mountains, by the margin of the lake, was a villa called the Pliniana, from its being built on the site of a fountain, whose periodical ebb and flow is described by the younger Pliny in his letters. The house had nearly fallen into ruin, till in the year 2090, an English nobleman had bought it, and fitted it up with every luxury. Two large halls, hung with splendid tapestry, and paved with marble, opened on each side of a court, of whose two other sides one overlooked the deep dark lake, and the other was bounded by a mountain, from whose stony side gushed, with roar and splash, the celebrated fountain. Above, underwood of myrtle and tufts of odorous plants crowned the rock, while the <b>star-pointing</b> giant cypresses reared themselves in the blue air, and the recesses of the hills were adorned with the luxuriant growth of chestnut-trees. Here we fixed our summer residence. We had a lovely skiff, in which we sailed, now stemming the midmost waves, now coasting the over-hanging and craggy banks, thick sown with evergreens, which dipped their shining leaves in the waters, and were mirrored in many a little bay and creek of waters of translucent darkness. Here orange plants bloomed, here birds poured forth melodious hymns; and here, during spring, the cold snake emerged from the clefts, and basked on the sunny terraces of rock.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two problems, {{which can}} occur when using central composite designs (CCDs), {{that are not}} generally covered in the literature but can lead to wrong decisions-and therefore incorrect models-if they are ignored. Most industrialbased experimental designs are sequential. This usually involves running as few initial tests as possible, while getting enough information as is needed to provide a reasonable approximation to reality (the screening stage). The CCD design strategy generally requires the running of a full or fractional factorial design (the cube or hypercube) {{with one or more}} additional centre points. The cube is augmented, if deemed necessary, by additional experiments known as <b>star-points.</b> The major problems highlighted here concern the decision to run the star points or not. If the difference between the average response at the centre of the design and the average of the cube results is significant, there is probably a need for one or more quadratic terms in the predictive model. If not, then a simpler model that includes only main effects and interactions is usually considered sufficient. This test for 'curvature' in a main effect will often fail if the design space contains or surrounds a saddle-point. Such a point may disguise the need for a quadratic term. This paper describes the occurrence of a real saddle-point from an industrial project and how this was overcome. The second problem occurs because the cube and star point portions of a CCD are sometimes run as orthogonal blocks. Indeed, theory would suggest that this is the correct procedure. However in the industrial context, where minimizing the total number of tests is at a premium, this can lead to designs with star points {{a long way from the}} cube. In such a situation, were the curvature test to be found non-significant, we could end with a model that predicted well within the cube portion of the design space but that would be unreliable in the balance of the total area of investigation. The paper discusses just such a design, one that disguised the real need for a quadratic term. ...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivos avaliar a biodegradabilidade anaerÃbia e o potencial de produÃÃo de metano (PPM) de trÃs resÃduos lignocelulÃsicos proveniente da cadeia produtiva do biocombustÃvel (fibra do mesocarpo do dendÃ - FMD), (bagaÃo de cana-de-aÃÃcar - BCA) e lÃnter de algodÃo tipo 4 - (LA 4). Para tanto, empregou-se trÃs diferentes tipos de prÃ-tratamentos fÃsico-quÃmicos (hidrÃlise hidrotÃrmica, hidrÃlise Ãcida e hidrÃlise alcalina), onde foram usados diversos tempos de reaÃÃo, temperaturas, razÃes massa/volume e concentraÃÃes de Ãcido ou Ãlcali, de forma a buscar o melhor mÃtodo para facilitar a digestÃo anaerÃbia do material. Os prÃ-tratamentos foram avaliados usando-se planejamento fatorial multivariado 22 ou 23, com ponto central em triplicata. O PPM e a biodegradabilidade anaerÃbia obtidos com FMD, BCA e LA 4 sem prÃ-tratamento foram, respectivamente, 77, 8, 35, 6 e 165, 3 L CH 4 /kg substrato e 8, 7, 4, 4 e 24, 1 %. Os resultados obtidos com a FMD mostraram que o melhor PPM (199 L CH 4 /kg substrato) foi obtido utilizando o prÃ-tratamento Ãcido com [HCl] de 1, 97 M, durante 34 min, a 103 ÂC, o qual promoveu 19 % de biodegradabilidade. A digestÃo anaerÃbia do BCA Ã mais beneficiada quando se utiliza hidrÃlise hidrotÃrmica (10 min, 200 ÂC), resultando em PPM de 199 LCH 4 /kg Subst. e biodegradabilidade anaerÃbia de 27, 4 %. Os melhores resultados de PPM e biodegradabilidade do LA 4 foram de 397, 1 L CH 4 /kg Subst e 49, 1 %, obtidos com o prÃ-tratamento Ãcido ([HCl] 1 M, 136 ÂC, 20 min). Apesar dos diversos prÃ-tratamento causarem aumento significativo da hidrÃlise anaerÃbia destes resÃduos lignocelulÃsicos, a energia gerada a partir do metano (FMD = 6, 9 MJ/kg Subst.; BCA = 6, 8 MJ/kg Subst. e LA 4 = 13, 2 MJ/kg Subst.) foi menor do que a obtida por uma {{eventual}} queima direta da fibra (FMD = 9, 6 MJ/kg Subst.; BCA = 7, 2 MJ/kg Subst. e LA 4 = 17, 3 MJ/kg Subst. â na forma de briquete). Uma alternativa Ã utilizar o prÃ-tratamento alcalino para reaproveitamento da lignina extraÃda, alÃm da geraÃÃo de energia. Desta forma, pode-se extrair atÃ 91 % da lignina presente em FMD e 80 % em BCA, que pode ser utilizada na indÃstria quÃmica em geral, e gerar 180 e 313, 4 L CH 4 /kg de FMD e BCA hidrolisados, respectivamente. Estes valores sÃo suficientes para gerar 6, 2 e 11, 2 MJ/kg Subst, respectivamente. This study {{aimed the}} evaluation of the anaerobic biodegradability and methane production potential (MPP) of three lignocellulosic wastes derived from the biofuels production chain: palm oil mesocarp fiber (PMF), sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and cotton linter type 4 (CL 4). Three different types of physico-chemical pretreatments were used (hydrothermal hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis and alkaline hydrolysis), which were evaluated based on the solubilisation of sugars or extraction of lignin. Different reaction times, temperatures, mass/volume ratios, and concentrations of acid or alkali were used for seeking the best pretreatment that improves the anaerobic digestion of the material. The data of the pretreatments were analysed using multivariate factorial design 22 or 23, with the central point in triplicate (level 0) and six <b>star-points</b> (when necessary). The MPP and anaerobic biodegradability obtained with PMF, SCB and CL 4 without pretreatment were, respectively, 77. 8, 35. 6 and 165. 3 L CH 4 /kg substrate and 8. 7, 4. 4 and 24. 1 %. The results obtained with the PMF showed that the best MPP (199 L CH 4 /kg substrate) was obtained using acid hydrolysis with [HCl] of 1. 97 M, during 34 min, at 103 Â C, which promoted 19 % of biodegradability. Anaerobic digestion SCB is improved when using hydrothermal hydrolysis (10 min, 200 ÂC) resulting in a MPP of 199 L CH 4 /kg substrate and an anaerobic biodegradability of 27. 4 %. The best results of CL 4 were MPP of 397. 1 L CH 4 /kg substrate and biodegradability of 49. 1 % obtained with acid hydrolysis ([HCl] of 1 M, 136 ÂC, 20 min). Despite the several pretreatment cause significant increase in the anaerobic hydrolysis of these lignocellulosic wastes, the power generated from methane (PMF = 6. 9 MJ/kg Subst, SCB = 6. 8 MJ/kg Subst, CL 4 = 13. 2 MJ/kg Subst.) were lower than that obtained by the eventual direct combustion of the fibre (PMF = 9. 6 MJ/kg Subst, SCB = 7. 2 MJ/kg Subst, CL 4 = 17. 3 MJ/kg Subst. CL 4 in the form of briquette). An alternative is to use the alkaline hydrolysis for extracting lignin and further use in the chemical industry, as well as for power generation. The results show {{that it is possible to}} extract up to 91 % of the lignin present in the PMF and 80 % in the SCB, which can generate up to 180 and 313. 4 L CH 4 /kg of the hydrolysed PMF and SCB, respectively. These values are sufficient to produce 6. 2 and 11. 2 MJ/kg Subst, respectively...|$|R
