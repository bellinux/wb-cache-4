5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the <b>siphon</b> into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the <b>siphon.</b> When swimming, the head is at the front and the <b>siphon</b> is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the <b>siphon</b> points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the <b>siphon.</b> The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the <b>siphon.</b> Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its <b>siphon.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few bivalves, {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant <b>siphon</b> which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The <b>siphon</b> can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E
40|$|<b>Siphons</b> play an {{important}} role in the development of deadlock control methods by using Petri nets. Thenumber of <b>siphons</b> increases exponentially with respect to the size of a Petri net. This article presents asymbolic approach to the computation of minimal <b>siphons</b> in Petri nets by using binary decision diagrams(BDD). The <b>siphons</b> of a Petri net can be found via a set of logic conditions. The logic conditions are symbolicallymodeled by using Boolean algebras. The operations of Boolean algebras are implemented by BDD thatare capable of representing large sets of <b>siphons</b> with small shared data structures. The proposed methodfirst uses BDD to compute all <b>siphons</b> of a Petri net and then a binary relation is designed to extract allminimal <b>siphons.</b> Finally, by using a number of examples, the efficiency of the proposed method is verifiedthrough different-sized problems...|$|R

40|$|Li and Zhou {{propose to}} add {{monitors}} Vs to elementary <b>siphons</b> S only while controlling {{the rest of}} dependent <b>siphons</b> - important for large systems but far from being maximally permissive. The control policy for weakly dependent <b>siphons</b> (WDS) is rather conservative due to some negative terms in the controllability. We show that {{this is no longer}} true as can be shown that it has the same controllability as that for strongly dependent <b>siphons...</b>|$|R
5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a <b>siphon.</b> Water emptied until it reached the <b>siphon,</b> which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet <b>siphon.</b> When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|Woolston <b>Siphon</b> Weir, {{built in}} 1994 to replace an earlier {{structure}} and located on an extant {{section of the}} Mersey near Latchford, controls {{the amount of water}} in the Latchford Pond by emptying canal water into the Mersey. Howley Weir controls water levels downstream of Woolston Weir. Further upstream, Woolston Guard Weir enables maintenance to be carried out on both.|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisors, {{unlike other}} techniques, Li et al. added control places and arcs to a plant net model for its elementary <b>siphons</b> only, greatly reducing the structural {{complexity of the}} controlled system. Their method, however, suffers from the expensive computation of <b>siphons.</b> We propose a new T-characteristic vector z to compute strict minimal <b>siphons</b> (SMS) for S 3 PR (systems of simple sequential processes with resources) in an algebraic fashion. For a special subclass of S 3 PR, called S 4 PR (simple S 3 PR), we discover that elementary <b>siphons</b> can be constructed from elementary circuits where all places are resources. Thus, the set of elementary <b>siphons</b> can be computed without the knowledge of all SMS. We also propose to construct characteristic T-vectors h by building a graph to find dependent <b>siphons</b> without their computations.

50|$|Home soda <b>siphons</b> {{and soda}} water are enjoying a renaissance {{in the 21st century}} as retro items become fashionable. Contemporary soda <b>siphons</b> are {{commonly}} made of aluminum, although glass {{and stainless steel}} <b>siphons</b> are available. The valve-heads of today are made of plastic, with metal valves, and replaceable o-ring seals. Older <b>siphons</b> are in demand on on-line auction sites. Carbonated water, without the acidity regulating addition of soda, is currently seen as fashionable although home production (see above) is mainly eschewed in favor of commercial products.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>siphons</b> {{are very}} long and {{protrude}} from the posterior end of the animal. Where they leave {{the end of the}} main part of the body the <b>siphons</b> pass between a pair of calcareous plates called pallets. If the animal is alarmed, it withdraws the <b>siphons</b> and the pallets protectively block the opening of the tunnel.|$|R
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to <b>siphon</b> off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E
5|$|South of Shingleton, M-94 {{runs through}} forest lands {{as a part}} of the Great Manistique Swamp. Along the way are {{national}} forest campgrounds located near Steuben. South of Crooked Lake, M-94 curves to the east before turning almost due south to the Manistique area. In Manistique, M-94 enters town on North 5th St before turning to follow Deer Street and River Street. On River Street, the trunkline uses the <b>Siphon</b> Bridge to cross the Manistique River and then uses Elk and Maple streets before terminating at US 2 at Lakeshore Drive.|$|E
5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or <b>siphon.</b> The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E
30|$|In sum, {{by using}} a {{computational}} model that implements filler <b>siphoning</b> theory, we find evidence that <b>siphoning</b> can occur in simultaneous lineups and, if the fillers are competitive, produce lineup ROCs that are superior to showup ROCs (panel c in Figs.  1 and 2). But the advantage is small, {{which raises the question}} of whether the <b>siphoning</b> by fillers is sufficient to explain the magnitude of the lineup advantage seen in empirical data. In addition, we learned that filler <b>siphoning</b> theory does not generalize to sequential lineups. In what follows, we focus on the comparison of simultaneous lineups and showups because this is where we found some support for filler <b>siphoning</b> theory, and because this comparison remains central to Smith et al.’s (2017) arguments for their theory.|$|R
50|$|Water ionizers work {{by simply}} <b>siphoning</b> {{off the water}} near the cathode. Water <b>siphoned</b> off the cathode side {{contains}} increased levels of hydroxide (OH−) and {{would be expected to}} have a higher pH (i.e. be more alkaline), whereas water <b>siphoned</b> off near the anode would have increased levels of H+ making it acidic. The acidic water is claimed to be useful for household disinfecting.|$|R

5|$|The royal {{administration}} could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase {{the income of}} the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to <b>siphon</b> off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead. The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed {{a challenge to the}} authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.|$|E
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant <b>siphon</b> is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details about}} the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little's 1965 general study. In 2005, R. L. Simone gave a {{detailed}} anatomical description. L.gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks (also known as ommatophores) that originate from its base. The tip of each eyestalk contains a large, well-developed lensed eye, with a black pupil and a yellow iris and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle. Amputated eyes completely regenerate. Inside {{the mouth of the}} animal is a radula (a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth) of the taenioglossan type. Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas. The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region, fading to light gray at the posterior end, while the mantle collar is commonly orange. The <b>siphon</b> is also orange or yellow. When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell, several organs are distinguishable externally, including the kidney, the nephiridial gland, the pericardium, the genital glands, stomach, style sac and the digestive gland. In adult males, the penis is also visible.|$|E
50|$|The deeper a bivalve species {{lives in}} the sediment, the longer its <b>siphons</b> are. Bivalves which have {{extremely}} long <b>siphons,</b> like the Geoducks pictured here, live very deeply buried, and are hard to dig up when clamming.|$|R
40|$|<b>Siphons</b> in a {{chemical}} reaction system are subsets {{of the species}} that have the potential of being absent in a steady state. We present a characterization of minimal <b>siphons</b> in terms of primary decomposition of binomial ideals, we explore the underlying geometry, and we demonstrate the effective computation of <b>siphons</b> using computer algebra software. This leads to a new method for determining whether given initial concentrations allow for various boundary steady states...|$|R
40|$|Current {{deadlock}} control {{approaches for}} S 3 PGR 2 (systems of simple sequential processes with general resources requirement) suffer from incorrect or restricted liveness characterization {{based on the}} concept of deadly marked <b>siphons</b> (DMS) and max-controlled <b>siphons.</b> Dead transitions may exist when there are no DMS and the net model is in livelock states. A new liveness condition is developed based on the so-called max*controlled <b>siphons</b> to replace that of the restrictive max-controlled <b>siphons.</b> A deadlock control policy is further proposed for WS 3 PR (weighted S 3 PR (systems of simple sequential processes with resources)) by adding control nodes and arcs for elementary <b>siphons</b> only, reducing significantly the number of monitors compared with existing methods. A counter example is shown to indicate that Li’s characteristic P-vector must be weighted. The controlled model for WS 3 PR is proposed and its liveness property is proved...|$|R
5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated <b>siphon</b> sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the <b>siphon</b> for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the body}} are {{openings}} to the mantle cavity, which contains the gills (ctenidia) and openings to the excretory and reproductive systems. At {{the front of}} the mantle cavity lies the <b>siphon,</b> which the squid uses for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the mantle cavity and expelled out of the <b>siphon</b> in a fast, strong jet. The direction of the <b>siphon</b> can be changed, to suit the direction of travel.|$|E
5000|$|L. balthica is an infaunal bivalve, living {{buried in}} the mud or silt, and {{extending}} its two narrow <b>siphons</b> to the bottom surface. Through the <b>siphons,</b> it feeds on organic matter on the sediment surface or in the water.|$|R
30|$|Filler <b>siphoning</b> theory {{posits that}} the {{presence}} of fillers (known innocents) in a lineup protects an innocent suspect from being chosen by <b>siphoning</b> choices away from that innocent suspect. This mechanism has been proposed as an explanation for why simultaneous lineups (viewing all lineup members at once) induces better performance than showups (one-person identification procedures). We implemented filler <b>siphoning</b> in a computational model (WITNESS, Clark, Applied Cognitive Psychology 17 : 629 – 654, 2003), and explored the impact of the number of fillers (lineup size) and filler quality on simultaneous and sequential lineups (viewing lineups members in sequence), and compared both to showups. In limited situations, we found that filler <b>siphoning</b> can produce a simultaneous lineup performance advantage, but one that is insufficient in magnitude to explain empirical data. However, the magnitude of the empirical simultaneous lineup advantage can be approximated once criterial variability is added to the model. But this modification works by negatively impacting showups rather than promoting more filler <b>siphoning.</b> In sequential lineups, fillers were found to harm performance. Filler <b>siphoning</b> fails to clarify the relationship between simultaneous lineups and sequential lineups or showups. By incorporating constructs like filler <b>siphoning</b> and criterial variability into a computational model, and trying to approximate empirical data, we can sort through explanations of eyewitness decision-making, a prerequisite for policy recommendations.|$|R
50|$|Large {{inverted}} <b>siphons</b> {{are used}} to convey water being carried in canals or flumes across valleys, for irrigation or gold mining. The Romans used inverted <b>siphons</b> of multiple lead pipes to cross valleys that were too big to construct an aqueduct.|$|R
25|$|Geoducks {{are one of}} the longest-living {{organisms in}} the animal kingdom. The oldest {{recorded}} specimen was 168 years old, but individuals usually live up to 140 years. A geoduck sucks water containing plankton down through its long <b>siphon,</b> filters this for food and ejects its refuse out through a separate hole in the <b>siphon.</b> Adult geoducks have few natural predators, which may also contribute to their longevity. In Alaska, sea otters and dogfish have proved capable of dislodging geoducks; starfish also attack and feed on the exposed geoduck <b>siphon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whipped cream {{may also}} be made in a {{whipping}} <b>siphon,</b> typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste. The <b>siphon</b> may have replaceable cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.|$|E
25|$|Both {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} mussels are filter feeders; they feed on plankton and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent <b>siphon.</b> The water is then {{brought into the}} branchial chamber {{by the actions of}} the cilia located on the gills for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent <b>siphon.</b> The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.|$|E
50|$|In some {{bivalves}} {{the mantle}} edges fuse to form <b>siphons,</b> which take in and expel water during suspension feeding. Species which live buried in sediment usually have long <b>siphons,</b> {{and when the}} bivalve needs to close its shell, these <b>siphons</b> retract into a pocket-like space in the mantle. This feature of the internal anatomy of a bivalve is clearly indicated on {{the interior of the}} shell surface as a pallial sinus, an indentation in the pallial line.|$|R
