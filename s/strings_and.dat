5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> branes was reduced to a relationship between <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> <b>strings,</b> <b>and</b> the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

40|$|A first-quantized <b>string</b> (<b>and</b> membrane) {{theory is}} {{developed}} here {{by using a}} general wave function of the <b>string</b> (<b>and</b> membrane), analogously to the first-quantized quantum theory of a point particle. From the general wave function of the <b>string</b> (<b>and</b> membrane), {{the properties of the}} <b>string</b> (<b>and</b> membrane) such as its relation to Bosons, Fermions and spacetime are investigated. The <b>string</b> <b>and</b> membrane wave functions are found to be very useful and we can deduce Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac equation and the fundamental property of the spacetime from this new starting point.

5|$|The cantata {{has seven}} movements, and is scored festively with four vocal parts and a Baroque {{orchestra}} of three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, bassoon, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> continuo.

5|$|The second aria is {{accompanied}} by the <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> the two oboes da caccia in unison as obbligato instruments, thus both arias are dominated by instruments with a relatively low range (oboes de caccia having a pitch below that of a normal oboe).|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six {{movements and}} scored it for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboes, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> continuo.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, first alternating arias and recitative, then uniting {{the voices}} in recitative and aria, finally a chorale. The two soloists are supported by an intimate Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> continuo. The oboe accompanies the soprano, a solo violin the bass, both play when the voices are united.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two framing choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn tune in the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> continuo. It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle that kept the original words unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} {{the work}} in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives, and a closing chorale. The scoring requires only a small ensemble of a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, <b>strings</b> <b>and</b> basso continuo. While the first aria is pensive and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.|$|E
