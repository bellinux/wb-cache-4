25|$|<b>Solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used on {{compressed}} air or hydraulic fluid for powering actuators on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses.|$|E
25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves.</b> Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Possible faults {{existing}} in electronic diesel fuel injection control (EDC) systems include rack deformation, <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> failure, and rack-travel sensor malfunction. Among these problems, the solenoid failure {{is the most}} likely to occur for in-use diesel engines. This paper focuses on developing the algorithm that can clearly classify the usability of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> without disassembling the fuel pump of the EDC system. Key parameters to feature the failure of the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> are determined. And a detection algorithm is discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by externally adding weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> but was more reproducible. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R

Solenoid-controlled valves are often used in irrigation systems, where a relatively weak solenoid opens and closes a small pilot valve, which in turn activates the main valve by applying fluid pressure to a piston or diaphragm that is mechanically coupled to the main valve.Solenoids are also in everyday household items such as washing machines to control the flow and amount of water into the drum.|$|E
