After sufficient awakening from the anesthetic agent has taken place, and if the patient is a candidate for same day discharge, he (and the person responsible for his transport home) will be instructed in the care and emptying of the catheter and its drainage <b>system,</b> <b>cleansing</b> of the involved area(s) and methods/intervals for dressing change, monitoring for signs of infection and for signs of catheter blockage. The patient will be given prescriptions for an antibiotic or anti-infective agent, a urinary anti-spasmodic, and a mild to moderate pain medication (no {{more than a few days}} worth of pain is expected). The patient will be instructed to optimize bed rest for the first two days after the operation, be limited to absolutely no lifting, and instructed to consume a high fiber diet and use a stool softener such as docusate sodium to help in avoiding straining during evacuation. After days 1 and 2, the patient will be instructed to sensibly increase physical activity, and avoid becoming sedentary. Adequate hydration is essential during the post-recovery phase of the procedure.|$|E

If compared with traditional endoscopy, bowel cleansing procedure in CE becomes of greater importance, due to the impossibility to intraoperatively operate on unclean gastrointestinal tract areas.

40|$|Summary: “Integrated Constructed Wetlands ” (ICWs) are a {{specific}} design approach to water resource management. The concept, design, application and performance are described.

As a surface flow constructed wetland <b>system,</b> the <b>cleansing</b> capacity of the ICW is largely dependent upon the ratio of water inflow to wetland area. Precipitation-derived influent fluxes to the wetland are the primary influence in determining the required wetland area and consequently their cleansing capacity.

Recent NASA research regarding future interplanetary manned spacecraft has shown that certain plants can absorb gasses, reducing indoor air pollution.

Bio-safe provides plants, a bed of activated carbon and an air pump installed near the plant's roots. Pollutants are trapped by the charcoal and either digested by the roots or broken down by microorganisms. Purified air is then directed back into the room.
