25|$|After The Antiphon Barnes {{returned}} to writing poetry, which she worked and reworked, producing {{as many as}} 500 drafts. She wrote {{eight hours a day}} despite a growing list of health problems, including arthritis so severe that she had difficulty even <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> typewriter or turning on her desk lamp. Many of these poems were never finalized and only a few were published in her lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Montgomery {{was also}} {{inspired}} by the [...] "formula Ann" [...] orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) which were popular {{at the time and}} distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra [...] "e". She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2010 CMT Music Awards, held in June, Swift {{encountered}} an ex-boyfriend of hers. The {{two were}} seated {{a couple of}} seats away from each other, but were unwilling to speak to each other, although they both had much to say. As a result, they both pretended to be heavily engaged in conversations with those surrounding them, individuals who Swift noted to be practically strangers. Swift had the desire to confront him and ask him if the experience was as painful for him {{as it was for}} her. However, she did not do so because they both had [...] "silent shields up". [...] "We're sitting six seats away from each other and just fighting this silent war of â€˜I don't care that you're here.' I don't care that you're here.' It's so terribly, heartbreakingly awkward", she said. She recalled it to be a miserable experience. When Swift arrived home, she spoke to her mother about the encounter, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> kitchen table and said, [...] "I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room." [...] She then stood up and ran towards her bedroom to compose [...] "The Story of Us", something Swift's mother was already accustomed to. [...] "The Story of Us" [...] was the last track Swift composed for Speak Now, claiming that upon completing the song she knew she was done with the album. The song's subject was revealed by Swift to be the same for [...] "Dear John", which in an interview musician John Mayer confirmed that he was the song's subject. Furthermore, Swift and Mayer both attended the 2010 CMT Awards.|$|E

60|$|The {{servitor}} retired, and {{she waited}} in seeming calm, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> desk, her trembling hand alone betraying {{the excitement of}} her mind.|$|E

6000|$|Gyp, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> bureau, {{seemed to}} be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How {{was she going to}} receive him? ...|$|E
60|$|And so the solicitor-general went his way, and {{his wife}} {{remained}} <b>sitting</b> motionless <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dressing-table. They had both of them already become aware that the bargain they had made was not a wise one.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Prince was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>'er</b> {{front door}} nursing 'er three cats when 'e got there. She was an ugly, little old woman with {{piercing}} black {{eyes and a}} hook nose, and she 'ad a quiet, artful sort of a way with 'er that made 'er very much disliked. One thing was she was always making fun of people, and for another {{she seemed to be}} able to tell their thoughts, and that don't get anybody liked much, especially when they don't keep it to theirselves. She'd been a lady's maid all 'er young days, and it was very 'ard to be taken for a witch just because she was old.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed a}} bargain. Faith found herself {{shaking hands with}} the ogre and then <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> his board. <b>Her</b> temper was over--Faith's tempers never lasted very long--but its {{excitement}} still sparkled {{in her eyes and}} crimsoned her cheeks. Norman Douglas looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> admiringly.|$|R
60|$|She was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> piano {{with her}} hands idle, looking at a line of music.... She had been sitting thus for many minutes, but had not yet taken in the notes.|$|E

60|$|He was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet, {{careless}} of time, the law, {{content with}} her nearness, and mindful only of her comfort, when a distant rifle-shot {{brought him to}} his feet with the swiftness of the startled stag.|$|E
60|$|Having got to {{the bottom}} of her cup, and {{to the end of a}} muffin amorously {{presented}} to her by the incorrigible Zack, Mrs. Peckover had leisure to turn again to Madonna; who, having relieved her of her bonnet and shawl, was now <b>sitting</b> close <b>at</b> <b>her</b> side.|$|R

60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{children}} had eaten their dinner, Mrs. Fenwick went up to Mary's room with the Squire's note in her hand. She knocked, and was at once admitted, and she found Mary <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> writing-desk.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> table writing letters. She lifted her face abstractedly when he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then {{she looked down at}} her paper again.|$|E
60|$|His spouse, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> toilet-table, {{continued}} her avocations, making {{no answer to}} all this. She had known that the archdeacon would gain nothing by interfering, {{but she was too}} charitable to provoke him by saying so while he was in such deep sorrow.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} months of 1938, Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson), a respectable middle-class British woman in an affectionate but rather dull marriage, tells <b>her</b> story while <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> home with <b>her</b> husband, imagining {{that she is}} confessing her affair to him.|$|R
60|$|Over at {{the stone}} house Miss Avery {{was lying on}} the couch in her room. The nurse had gone away and Dr. Walter was <b>sitting</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> He leaned forward and pulled away the hand with which she was hiding the scar on her face. He looked first at the little gold ring on the hand and then at the scar.|$|R

60|$|Hearing that Kitson's mother lived not a mile {{out of his}} way, Malcolm rode to {{the fine}} old moated grange, where he found her <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> spinning, {{presiding}} over a great plentiful household, while her second son, a much shrewder-looking man than Sir Christopher, managed the farm.|$|E
60|$|One day I {{came into}} Raggett Street at lunch time {{and she was}} alone, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> desk. She glanced up as I entered, and then became very still, with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table.

60|$|Laura {{installed}} {{herself as}} nurse, and her devotion was repaid four-fold; for, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sister's bedside, she learned a finer art than {{that she had}} left. Her eye grew clear to see {{the beauty of a}} self-denying life, and in the depths of Nan's meek nature she found the strong, sweet virtues that made her what she was.|$|E
60|$|About a {{week after}} the occurrences related in the last chapter, Mrs. Henry was <b>sitting</b> one morning <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window, <b>at</b> work. It was a large and {{beautiful}} window, opening out upon a piazza.|$|R

60|$|But {{the darkest}} hour, so the proverb goes, is {{just before the}} dawn, and after Lilian had had her cry out and was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window in the dusk, {{watching}} a thin new moon shining over the trees down the street, her inspiration came to her. A minute later she whirled into the tiny sitting-room where her mother was sewing.|$|E
60|$|In Brussels {{women would}} be weeping; and Crystal--forlorn and desolate--would perhaps be <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> window {{watching}} the stream of fugitives that came in--wounded and exhausted--from the field of battle, recounting tales of a catastrophe which had no parallel in modern times: and Crystal, seeing and hearing this, would think of the man she loved, and believing him to be dead would break her heart with sorrow.|$|E
60|$|All {{that was}} most human in him, all that was weak in this strong and untamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness: for long summer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the {{companionship}} of horses and dogs and of flowers, with no thought or cares save those for the next evening's gavotte, no graver occupation save that of <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>HER</b> feet.|$|E
60|$|He went up {{the veranda}} stairway, and, {{stopping}} near where she was <b>sitting,</b> looked down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a curious little glow in his eyes. She started, for she had not expected to see it there so soon.|$|R
