40|$|The {{development}} of an interfirm cooperative relationship leads {{to the creation of}} accounting information flows between firms, that have to exchange their accounting information in order to achieve cost reduction and to create value. As a consequence, firms should implement both new management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> and modify their accounting information systems. This paper analyzes a <b>specific</b> management <b>accounting</b> <b>technique,</b> i. e. open-book accounting, and its relationship with accounting information systems. In particular, the paper first uses organizational theories to classify interfirm relationships in order to define cooperative relationships which can benefit most from the implementation of open-book accounting. Secondly, the paper shows the logic used in implementing open-book accounting, in order to control the accounting information flows between firms. Finally, the paper describes the relationship between open-book accounting and accounting information systems within interfirm cooperative relationships...|$|R

The chapter aims to analyze how <b>specific</b> <b>accounting</b> tools and <b>techniques</b> can assist in the control of a LG’s FS based on the governance setting adopted for service delivery.

40|$|The {{demand for}} public {{healthcare}} services has increased rapidly {{over the last}} decades, which has entailed an amplified pressure on the healthcare organizations {{to increase the efficiency}} of care. In the 1980 s, a wave of change usually referred to as New Public Management swept over the public sector and a number of private sector management techniques were implemented, including the concept of performance management. The traditional concept of financial performance measurement clashed against the intricate notions of good care, subsequently leading to the introduction of new performance measurement tools that included non-­‐financial performance measures. However, these tools were also adopted from the private sector and not tailored for the decentralized healthcare organizations with its many stakeholders and individuals of different professions. The decentralized healthcare organization is subject to the control complexities of action at a distance, where operating personnel might have difficulties in interpreting, understanding or personally rationalize the inscriptions inherent in <b>specific</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> supporting certain programs or objectives. Within public mental healthcare, the issues of performance measurement are even further enhanced due to the absence of objective outcome indicators, making the different users’ interpretations of performance measurement imperative to its result. Although there is substantial literature on the topic of management accounting within public healthcare in general and public mental healthcare in specific, there is a gap in the research of the interpretations and perceptions on account of the actors at different hierarchical levels within healthcare organizations regarding the purposes of given performance measures. Hence, in order to aid the further development of performance measurement within public mental healthcare, this study focuses on the role assigned to given performance measures by personnel at different hierarchical levels within a public mental healthcare organization, the reasons therefore and the consequences thereof. A qualitative case study conducted within the region of Västra Götaland, Sweden, illuminates the meaning of hierarchical communication, role perceptions, sense-­‐giving, accountability, stakeholder perspective, and cooperation in developing performance measures as shaping the perceptions of performance measures at different hierarchical levels...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purposes}} of this study were twofold: (1) to determine the relationship between certain contextual variables of firm characteristics and the application of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques,</b> and (2) to identify how firm performance is affected by contextual variables and the application of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques.</b> Eight hypotheses were formulated to accomplish the study purpose. A questionnaire was developed to gather data. The sampling frame of the population was the Top 500 listed Australian companies. A pilot study of 100 questionnaires were sent to the respondents. Revised questionnaires were mailed to all Top 500 Australian companies. Two types of statistical analysis were adopted to test the hypotheses. Hypothesis one was tested using multiple logistic regression model. Hypotheses two through eight were tested using nonparametric statistical test, Mann-Whitney U test. The study found that the extent of use of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> and firm size significantly reduce the probability the firm will perform above average performance of the sample firm. But the interaction variables provide evidence that any separation of size and capital intensity effect from the extent of the use of management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> is problematic. Looking at the interaction variables the results show that large firms that applied advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> extensively significantly increase the probability the firm will perform above average performance of the sample firms. It is also true for high capital intensive firms that applied advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> extensively. The study also observed that contextual variables of firm characteristics influenced the application of management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques.</b> Contextual variables age, type of industry, capital intensity, and leverage have significant influenced on the application of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> type I, II and HI. Firm size has significant influence on the application of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> type I and III. Firm risk also only has significant influence on the application of advanced management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> type II and DDL But in terms of ownership, there is no difference between public listed domestic firms and public listed foreign firms in applying management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply {{regulatory}} mix theory as a framework for investigating the use of management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> by Australian large listed companies in constraining their carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews are conducted with senior managers involved with managing their companies' carbon emission risks. Analysis of the interview data is undertaken with a view to provision of insight to the impact of the regulatory framework imposed to deal with carbon emissions. Findings: The findings reveal that regulation impacting companies' economic interests rather than requiring mere disclosure compliance is much more likely to be behind focusing top management and board attention and use of management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> to set targets, measure performance and incentivise emission mitigation. However, there remains much scope for increased use of accounting professionals and <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in working towards a carbon-constrained economy. Research limitations/implications: The usual limitations associated with interpretation of interview data are applicable. Practical implications: Under-use of management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> is likely to be associated with less than optimal constraint of carbon emissions. Social implications: Carbon emissions are accepted as being involved in harmful climate change. To the extent effective techniques are under-utilised in constraining emissions, harmful consequences for society are likely to be heightened unnecessarily. Originality/value: The topic and data collected are original and provide valuable insights into the dynamics of management <b>accounting</b> <b>technique</b> use in managing carbon emissions...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this exploratory research are {{to examine the}} current situation {{in the use of}} traditional and modern management <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in local governments. Fourteen local governments in Perlis, Kedah and Penang were sent questionnaires. Literature reviews suggest that there is lack of research in this area being done in Malaysian local governments. Local researchers such as Sulaiman et al. concentrated more on private and public sectors. These two sectors are more advanced compared to local governments in terms of management accounting uses. Foreign researches concluded that the uses of these techniques are slowly being adopted in their local governments. If the western countries experience can be an indication of trends in local government then this would portent to our own local governments’ experience. The results obtained from the questionnaires and interviews indicate that the level of advancement fell short of such expectation. This is especially true for district councils.

40|$|Whereas {{the problem}} of fraud is a global one, the rate and {{extent to which it}} is perpetrated in Nigeria, {{particularly}} in the public sector, is quite high and alarming. Literature reveals that different fraud prevention and detection mechanisms are being adopted to combat the menace of fraud; forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> appears to be the most effective and are currently used in most developed countries of the world. However, the extent to which forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> are being applied in fraud prevention and detection in Nigeria is not known. Also, the intention to use forensic accounting services in the public service has not been investigated. This study was therefore aimed at examining the application of forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in fraud prevention and detection in Nigeria. Specific objectives were: (1) to investigate the mechanisms of fraud prevention and detection, and their levels of effectiveness in Nigeria, (2) to identify the major factors that hinder the application of forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in fraud prevention and detection in Nigeria, (3) to examine practitioners’ opinions and behavioural intention to use forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in fraud prevention and investigation in Nigeria, (4) to explore the level of awareness of forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in Nigeria and (5) to examine the readiness of universities in taking up forensic accounting courses. The study involved the collection of quantitative data. These data were collected from three sets of populations, viz. accounting students, accounting academics and accounting practitioners. The questionnaire served as the survey instruments. The data collected were analysed using appropriate statistical techniques and computer software. The study identified several fraud prevention and detection mechanisms that are currently used in Nigeria, such as systems of internal controls, operational audits and corporate code of conduct. Students’ t-test indicates {{a significant difference between the}} perceived effectiveness and actual usage of fraud prevention and detection mechanisms in Nigeria. It was further discovered that the most effective mechanisms, like the forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques,</b> are the least used in fraud prevention and detection. This implies that the current mechanisms of fraud prevention and detection are not proactive in dealing with the fraud menace. Also, legal, educational and political factors were identified to hinder the application of forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques</b> in Nigeria. The level of awareness in forensic accounting in Nigeria is generally low. While the one-way analysis of variance indicates a significant variation among the three populations, it was discovered that students had the lowest level of awareness. Further findings of the study reveal that the universities are not yet ready to take up forensic accounting courses. Using the structural equation modelling (SEM), all the other seven propositions were supported. The findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it further strengthened the findings of previous studies on the organisational intention. From the practical point of view, there is urgent need for manpower development in universities with specialisation in forensic accounting. Again, the educational institutions, and particularly the universities in Nigeria, would need to include forensic accounting courses in the undergraduate curriculum as education has been shown to be pivotal in creating awareness on the use of forensic <b>accounting</b> <b>techniques.</b> Furthermore, from the sampled space, the study has captured the current state of forensic accounting in Nigeria and the findings will be very useful for the public service, private organisations and policy makers...|$|R
