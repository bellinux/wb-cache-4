5|$|After St. Gatien's {{defeat in}} the Cambridgeshire, Hammond responded to the earlier {{challenge}} of Lord Hastings by <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> level-weight match race between St. Gatien and Melton {{at some point in}} the following season for a stake of between £5,000 and £20,000.|$|E
30|$|Of {{the qualities}} that Lovecky {{mentioned}} in intelligent adults, each <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> relationship between intelligence {{and at least one}} of Ryff’s dimensions of PWB. Divergency and entelechy <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> positive relationship between intelligence and Autonomy (“resistance to enculturation”). Perceptivity and entelechy <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> positive relationship between intelligence and Environmental Mastery. Entelechy <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> positive relationship between intelligence and Personal Growth. Sensitivity and perceptivity <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> positive relationship between intelligence and Purpose in Life.

5|$|At {{least four}} cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are {{visible in the}} lake. The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern edge of the caldera has only sparse vegetation, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> young age of several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 metres above sea level) on the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active.|$|E
5|$|Cú Chulainn shows {{striking}} {{similarities to}} the legendary Persian hero Rostam, {{as well as}} to the Germanic Lay of Hildebrand and the labours of the Greek epic hero Heracles, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> common Indo-European origin, but lacking in linguistic, anthropological and archaeological material.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly {{more susceptible to}} infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.|$|E
5000|$|That {{research}} did not <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> immediate {{need for}} additional legislation, and neither did it <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> {{need to change the}} threshold for the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports.|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to establish the lifestyle of Perspicaris. Its large eyes and other parts would <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> swimming animal, yet it lacks claws, which seems to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> bottom feeder.|$|R
50|$|In a first {{proposal}} of march, 1853, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument, partially reusing material of the Van Peteghem organ.A second proposal also <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument with almost identical disposition.|$|R
5|$|In December 2006, {{as a part}} of a {{constitutional}} reform, Chávez proposed a reorganisation of the municipal powers. Chávez mentioned his reform plans again in his January 2007 presidential inauguration, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> new form of subdivision—communal cities—in which mayors and municipalities would be replaced by communal powers.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{ceiling of}} the tomb of Senenmut (BC) {{contains}} the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations {{in the form of}} discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.|$|E
5|$|The four galeai ships {{uncovered}} in the Yenikapi excavations, {{dating to the}} 10th–11th centuries, are of uniform design and construction, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> centralized manufacturing process. They have a length of c. 30 m, and are built of European Black Pine and Oriental plane.|$|E
50|$|In children, a {{posterior}} fat pad sign <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> condylar {{fracture of}} the humerus. In adults it <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> radial head fracture. The fat pad sign only occurs after an intra-articular fracture.|$|R
50|$|The strong breed predilection <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> genetic {{basis to}} the disease. Despite some {{similarities}} in breed prevalence, {{there is no}} evidence to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> link between equine shivers and equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM).|$|R
5000|$|Lettering made to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic, such as modernism, {{the natural}} world, or another genre of lettering. Examples {{of the latter}} include use of stencil or {{embossing}} tape fonts to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> industrial aesthetic.|$|R
5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> dearth of skilled labor.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{community}} and ecology {{is very similar}} to that of other Cambrian localities, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> global pool of species that repopulated localities after calamitous burial events occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{population}} in Sichuan Province is {{larger and more}} stable than the Yunnan population, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> southward expansion from Sichuan into Yunnan in the Holocene.|$|E
50|$|Yanomaman {{is usually}} not {{connected}} with any other language family. Joseph Greenberg has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> relationship between Yanomaman and Macro-Chibchan. Migliazza (1985) has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> connection with Panoan and Chibchan. Neither proposal has been accepted.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} indicators for utility efficiency.

5|$|Workers began {{excavating}} {{the foundations}} of the United States Capitol in July 1793. During construction of the foundation, building commissioner David Stuart wrote to other members of the capitol commission <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> cornerstone ceremony be held. At their September 2 meeting, the commission agreed with Stuart, setting a date for the ceremony {{a little more than two}} weeks later.|$|E
5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
30|$|A lag {{length of}} {{two for the}} first period is also {{suggested}} by the AIC criterion (Akaike, 1973), while the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978) <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> lag length of one. For the second period, all three criteria coincide and <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> lag length of one.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a double}} review for All About Jazz, Clifford Allen observes that [...] "Where Morris' music can <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> somber Mark Rothko-like atmosphere, {{even in its}} most lickety-split moments, the music of Rob Brown <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> urbane fauvism not unlike the {{paintings}} of Bob Thompson." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} JK Wallenberg (in 1931) <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon root, tynan, to enclose, {{followed by}} the Anglo-Saxon word [...] "Hamm", a land drained by dykes. Another historian, Eilert Ekwall (in 1936), <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> early owner named Teona, whose name is found in Teonanhyll in Berkshire.|$|R
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
50|$|Sallaberger and Westenholz (1999) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> {{location}} {{close to}} {{the confluence of the}} ʿAdhaim river east of Samarra (at or near Dhuluiya). Similarly, Reade (2002) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> site in this vicinity, based on a fragment of an Old Akkadian statue (now in the British Museum) found there.|$|R
50|$|This {{portion of}} the phrase <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> person should arrive to vote early in the day. Most {{democratic}} electoral processes involve polling booths, which are open for a mandated period of time. Voting early would <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> particular enthusiasm for voting not necessarily shared by other electors.|$|R
50|$|Townsend often {{embroidered}} flowers which {{exhibited a}} surprising deepness for needlework. Her floral designs <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> influence from the William Morris and the Royal School of Art Needlework.
