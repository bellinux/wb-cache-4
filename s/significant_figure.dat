5|$|Hamilton {{has also}} {{appeared}} as a <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> in popular works focusing on other American political figures of his time.He was a major character in Gore Vidal's 1973 historical novel Burr and in episodes of the 1976 PBS miniseries The Adams Chronicles, and a major villain in L. Neil Smith's libertarian alternative history series North American Confederacy. Hamilton was a main character in the 1986 TV series , where he was portrayed by Richard Bekins. In 2008, Rufus Sewell played Hamilton in two episodes of HBO's seven-part miniseries John Adams.|$|E
5|$|The early {{eighteenth century}} {{was also a}} period of {{innovation}} in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714–78) and Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms {{can be seen in}} his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's Seasons, which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 Anschluss—the {{annexation}} of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime—led to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Boosey & Hawkes {{seized the opportunity}} to sign up composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, and also rescued Universal's Jewish staff, who later {{played an important role in}} developing the company. One such employee in particular, Ernst Roth, facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky, and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's Vier letzte Lieder (Four Last Songs) (1948; premièred 1950) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (premièred 1951). Another <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg's pupil Erwin Stein, and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner, a pupil of Anton Webern, was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal Tempo in 1939, which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication.|$|E

5000|$|When {{multiplying}} or dividing numbers, {{the result}} is rounded {{to the number of}} <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in the factor with the least <b>significant</b> <b>figures.</b> Here, the quantity of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in each of the factors is important—not the position of the <b>significant</b> <b>figures.</b> For instance, using significance arithmetic rules: ...|$|R
5000|$|In most cases, {{the same}} rules apply to numbers {{expressed}} in scientific notation. However, in the normalized form of that notation, placeholder leading and trailing digits do not occur, so all digits are significant. For example, [...] (two <b>significant</b> <b>figures)</b> becomes , and [...] (six <b>significant</b> <b>figures)</b> becomes [...] In particular, the potential ambiguity {{about the significance of}} trailing zeros is eliminated. For example, [...] to four <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> is written as , while [...] to two <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> is written as [...]|$|R
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the party}} was {{established}} a Political Bureau ("Politburo") and Organisation Bureau ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin was the most <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> in this governance structure; {{as well as being}} the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during a flu pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz Platten, who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s {{there was}} a {{backlash}} against the statism and compressive nature of modernist architecture. Instead {{there was a}} move towards a form of post-modernism that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also {{a combination of the}} private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988–89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985–87, extended 1993–94). The most <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980–86).|$|E
50|$|All non-zero digits are {{considered}} significant. For example, 91 has two <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> (9 and 1), while 123.45 has five <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).|$|R
5000|$|In {{both cases}} the result is {{accurate}} to same order of magnitude as the inputs (-20 and -10, respectively). In the second case, the answer seems to have one significant digit, which would amount to loss of significance. However, in computer floating point arithmetic, all operations {{can be viewed as}} being performed on antilogarithms, for which the rules for <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> indicate that the number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> remains the same as the smallest number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in the mantissas. The way to indicate this and represent the answer to 10 <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> is: ...|$|R
5000|$|Only {{measured}} quantities figure {{into the}} determination of the number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in calculated quantities. Exact mathematical quantities like the [...] in the formula for the area of a circle with radius , [...] has no effect on the number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in the final calculated area. Similarly the [...] in the formula for the kinetic energy of a mass [...] with velocity , , has no bearing on the number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures</b> in the final calculated kinetic energy. The constants [...] and [...] are considered to have an infinite number of <b>significant</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Limited toleration and the {{influence}} of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves Lords of the Congregation in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by Parliament in 1560, while the young Mary, Queen of Scots was still in France. Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva, where he became a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most <b>significant</b> <b>figure.</b> The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the Medieval church. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy, and resulting in widespread, but generally orderly, iconoclasm. At this point {{the majority of the population}} was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} <b>significant</b> <b>figure</b> in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
