40|$|Brand, L., 1979. Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies on the}} Coconino Sandstone (Permian) vertebrate footprints and their paleoecological implications. Palaeogeogr., Palaeoclimatol., Palaeoecol., 28 : 25 - 38. The fossil footprints in the Coconino Sandstone have long been considered to be evidence for eolian deposition. I conducted field study of the fossil footprints in Hermit Basin, the Grand Canyon, {{and laboratory}} studies of modern amphibian and reptile foot-prints on dry sand, damp sand, wet sand, and underwater sand. Five species of salamanders all spent {{the majority of their}} locomotion time walking on the bottom, under water, rather than swimming. The experimental animals produced footprints under all test conditions, both up and down the 25 ° slopes of the laboratory "dunes". Toe marks and other details were present in over 80 % of the fossil tracks, underwater <b>tracks,</b> and wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> but less than 12 % of the dry sand and damp <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> had any toe marks. Dry <b>sand</b> uphill <b>tracks</b> were usually just depressions, with no details. Wet <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> were quite different from the fossil tracks in certain features. The fossil tracks were most similar to the underwater tracks. These data suggest that the Coconino Sandstone fossil tracks should not be used as evidence for eolian deposition of dry sand...|$|R
50|$|The area is very {{isolated}} and land travel is difficult (along <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> {{that can only}} be negotiated using four-by-four vehicles or camels). The town has a small airport, Mao Airport , with a paved runway.|$|R
50|$|In July 1996, the <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> was {{upgraded}} to a tartan track, {{and the first}} time the new surface was used, local athlete Berner Rodas set a new national record at the 1500 metres event.|$|E
50|$|Beach {{access is}} via a small <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> near the now-defunct {{football}} oval. Tides must be observed as the Curries River can become high, making driving {{on to the}} beach difficult. There are kilometers of coastal tracks for 4-wheel drive vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The MJC has one {{track on}} Taipa {{converted}} {{from the old}} trotting track. The old track is now the inner <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> and the newer outer track is turf. The stables at the MJC are home to about 1,000 horses.|$|E
50|$|Parking for {{the beach}} is reached by <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> either from the Gialova Lagoon parking area (also used by bird-watchers) or by {{following}} the Northside route from Petrochori. The beach is considered friendly for naturists and gay tourists.|$|R
50|$|Ponta do Ouro {{is about}} 15 km {{away from the}} South African border and about 130 km South of Maputo. Due {{to the lack of}} tar roads between Maputo and Ponta, {{reaching}} Ponta from Maputo takes about 3-4 hours and a 4x4 vehicle, mainly due to the 20-30 km closer to Ponta, since most of this segment of the road is made up of soft <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> sometimes confusing due to the many parallel paths and the lack of direction signs. Nevertheless, reaching Ponta from Maputo is easy in the dry season, since most of the <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> merge together near Ponta, there is always some traffic and to find help if required is not difficult. There is a project planned to build a full tar road between Ponta and Maputo, starting with a huge bridge crossing the Maputo bay.|$|R
25|$|In 1961 the a track {{heating system}} was {{introduced}} with electric cables sewn into the track by the tractor {{and a team}} of workers about eight inches under the turf. They would prove to be useful until the advent of all <b>sand</b> <b>tracks.</b> The track was able to use two hares, an 'Outside McGee' and 'Outside Sumner' and small hurdle races described as chases. Harringay held Bookmakers Afternoon greyhound Service (BAGS) meetings from 1967 after being chosen as one of the tracks to host the service.|$|R
50|$|Donkerbos {{is outside}} the {{coverage}} of all mobile communication networks. It does not have electricity or landline telephone service and is not connected to Namibia's water and sewerage system. School and village share one borehole. The access road off D1692 is a bumpy 30 km <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> only accessible by 4x4.|$|E
50|$|Near the port, {{originally}} named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became {{defensive and}} stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a <b>sand</b> <b>track.</b> This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in Cocody and a racetrack {{was built in the}} south of the city.|$|E
50|$|After the {{completion}} of the South Road Extension, Mavis Hutter Reserve was created at the corner of Carroll Road and Bourke Road. The park contains two workstations of outdoor gym equipment, a playground, and a granitic <b>sand</b> <b>track.</b> The playground comprises a slide, swings, and butterfly sculpture. The granitic sand creates a circuit in the park.|$|E
5000|$|Soil mapping reveals {{four areas}} of {{potential}} concern (AOPCs) which exhibit {{high concentrations of}} lead, hydrocarbons, arsenic, and antimony. The first AOPC area surrounds the former diesel turntable, the second envelops the former fueling and <b>sanding</b> <b>tracks,</b> the third sits along the southern portion of the former roundhouse, and the fourth is located near the diesel shops.|$|R
5000|$|... 11,460 km earth-graded road. These {{roads are}} built by {{clearing}} the vegetation and blading the surface. Compaction {{is achieved by}} the traffic using the road. Some of these roads are not graded at all but just consist of earth or <b>sand</b> <b>tracks</b> separated by vegetation. These tracks are in use where a daily usage of less than five vehicles is expected.|$|R
50|$|In an {{idealised}} coastal psammosere model, at the seaward edge of {{the sand}} dune the pH of the soil is typically alkaline/neutral with a pH of 7.0/8.0 particularly where shell fragments provide a significant component of the <b>sand.</b> <b>Tracking</b> inland across the dunes a podsol develops with a pH of 5.0/ 4.0 followed by mature podsols at the climax with a pH of 3.5 - 4.5.|$|R
50|$|The Hipódromo {{is located}} 22 km from Buenos Aires City. It has {{an area of}} 1.48 km². The grass track is 2,783 m long and 45 m wide, {{allowing}} for thousand-metre races without turns (or 1,400 m using a diagonal). There is an inner <b>sand</b> <b>track,</b> inaugurated in 1994, which measures 2,590 m in length by 31 m in width.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Cole {{returned}} {{to cross the}} Sahara again; this time his plan was to cross and then return from the Red Sea back to the Atlantic Ocean. In October 2000, he left Timbuktu for Gao on the <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> known as Autoroute Nationale. He arrived in Ber and departed eastwards after speaking with the Malian Gendarmerie under a date tree.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as a}} Western & Quarter Horse {{arena and}} Club rooms, the Reserve is an {{operational}} Thoroughbred training facility, with grass and <b>sand</b> <b>track,</b> and swimming facilities as well as practice barriers and jumps schooling course. Currently 20 Racing Victoria-licensed trainers are registered to the Tatura Racecourse. In addition to race meetings, the Club also runs regular official trials and jumpouts (unbroadcast trials).|$|E

5000|$|Eglinton Hill {{provides}} {{views of}} the ocean and the scrub leading north towards Eglinton and Yanchep, and almost untouched beaches continuous almost to Yanchep are accessible by <b>sand</b> <b>tracks.</b> The undeveloped part of the suburb offers a wide array of native scrubland, woodland and heath, varying in condition from excellent to completely degraded, and including Xanthorrhoea preissii (commonly known as [...] "black boys"), banksia, sheoak and Nuytsia floribunda. Some degradation has occurred due to uncontrolled vehicular access, clearing for stock grazing, fire and rabbits.|$|R
50|$|Pabor Lake is {{a public}} lake {{accessible}} from Lake Pabor Drive, which winds around the lake's north and east sides. Caution should be used when using this road to keep vehicles from becoming mired in dry or wet sand. The road {{is nothing more than}} a <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> and is impassible in wet weather. Part of the road running along the east side of Pabor Lake is almost impassible even in dry weather.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘Barree Stud’, {{set over}} some 400 acres and located in Willowmavin in north eastern Victoria {{originally}} {{served as the}} breeding, spelling and pre-training centre for the company {{when it was first}} purchased. As the company has developed, Barree has been redeveloped into a world-class pre-training, spelling and rehabilitation centre. During this process, the company’s breeding operations have moved elsewhere. Facilities include a 2000m <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> for workouts, equine water walker and swimming pool, treadmill, hyperbaric chamber and hydrotherapy equipment.|$|E
50|$|Horse racing {{started in}} Adana in 1962 at a race course near the Şakirpaşa Airport. Short {{after the race}} course moved to its current {{location}} to a 66.6 hectare land area. At the opening, {{there was only the}} <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> which still serves today. The turf track was completed in 1996 and started hosting competitions in the spring of 1998. Besides the two tracks, training track was opened in fall 2000. There are currently 3 tracks at the race course.|$|E

50|$|The circuit posed {{a unique}} problem. Positioned {{in the middle}} of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, {{organizers}} were able to keep the <b>sand</b> off the <b>track</b> by spraying an adhesive on the <b>sand</b> around the <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|To support Eighth Army's {{attack on}} Wadi Akarit on 6 April, First Army {{attacked}} towards Kairouan {{to cut off}} the enemy retreat. The approach roads for 128th Infantry Brigade Group were little more than 150 miles of <b>sand</b> <b>tracks,</b> and had to be improved by 586th Field Company, assisted by US engineers from II Corps. On 8 April, 128th Bde captured Pichon in an operation requiring two crossings of the bed of the Oued Marguellil and considerable mine clearance. The Tunisian campaign ended on 12 May with the surrender of Armeegruppe Afrika.|$|R
5000|$|North Beach Road (the {{original}} road name) and {{was built}} to offer access to Osborne Park, which {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was rural community with established agriculture including market gardens, pig farms, dairy farms, and poultry farms. Whilst it was a formed road from North Perth to the corner of Frobisher Road, there was only a <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> beyond this point to Njookenbooroo, now known as Innaloo. A plank road, completed in 1912, replaced this <b>sand</b> <b>track,</b> and [...] "some years later", a limestone road extension to Brighton Road, near the coast, was built. By 1925 the road had been renamed as Scarborough Beach Road, and was classified as an arterial road by Mr. Arundale, the Perth Road Board engineer in 1925. By 1933, the plank roads in the area had been replaced by regular roads, but these roads were narrow and many accidents occurred due to increase in traffic associated with Scarborough Beach's rising popularity. The increasing traffic meant that the road was continually being upgraded, including a partial reconstruction by the Main Roads Department in 1938. In the 1950s, prior to the development of shopping centres at Karrinyup and Innaloo, the Mount Hawthorn section of the road was a popular shopping area.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Lake Speedway {{contained}} two tracks. One {{track was}} a 1 mi <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> that was completely surrounded by Wolf Lake. A {{portion of the}} lake was drained {{to allow for the}} track's construction. This track hosted auto racing, while speedboat racing was held in the lake {{in the vicinity of the}} track. The other was a 1/5 mi dirt and oil surfaced midget track, constructed in 1935, located between Wolf Lake and Calumet Avenue. Midget car racing took place at this track, with the opening race on June 9, 1935, and races continuing until 1936.|$|E
5000|$|Goffe {{began his}} racing career in 1934 at the <b>sand</b> <b>track</b> in the resort of California near Wokingham, riding for prize money. He then {{concentrated}} on grasstrack racing, winning the South of England Grass Track Championship at Basingstoke in 1936. He bought a 500cc Rudge bike from [...] "Froggy" [...] French in 1936, {{which he used}} in his early speedway rides, impressing sufficiently to receive offers from both Hackney Wick Wolves and the Johnny Hoskins-managed West Ham Hammers, signing for the latter in 1937. He had a brief spell with the Leicester Hounds team, riding in three matches in 1937 before the club withdrew from the Provincial League.|$|E

50|$|Like Fern Bay Fullerton Cove lies to {{the west}} of the Tasman Sea. Although the entire {{coastline}} is part of Stockton Beach there is no public access to the beach from Fullerton Cove. The only access in the suburb is via a private track, which is off-limits to the public, in a large sand mining development at the end of Coxs Lane. <b>Sand</b> <b>tracks</b> in this area provide best access to the wreck of the , a 53,000 tonne Norwegian bulk carrier that ran aground during a major storm on 26 May 1974 and which has since become an icon and landmark for the local area as well as being a popular destination for off-road enthusiasts driving along Stockton Beach.|$|R
