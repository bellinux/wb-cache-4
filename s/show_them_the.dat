25|$|Of {{the four}} Gospels, Philip figures most {{prominently}} in the Gospel of John. Jesus is asked by Philip on how to feed the 5,000 people. Later he appears as {{a link to the}} Greek community. Philip bore a Greek name, may have spoken Greek, and may have been known to the Greek pilgrims in Jerusalem. He advises Andrew that certain Greeks wish to meet Jesus, and together they inform Jesus of this (John 12:21). During the Last Supper, when Philip asked Jesus to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Father, he provides Jesus the opportunity to teach his disciples about the unity of the Father and the Son.|$|E
25|$|In August 1537 Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada {{entered the}} territories of the zaque, who ruled from Hunza. When the Spanish conquerors entered the {{outskirts}} of Hunza and found a hill with poles were bodies were dangling, they named it Cerro de la Horca ("Gallow Hill"). At {{the time of the}} conquest Quemuenchatocha was the zaque and he ordered his men to not submit to the European invaders or <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> way to his bohío. He sent messengers to the Spanish conquistadors with valuable peace offers. While this was happening, Quemuenchatocha had hidden his treasures from the Spanish. Hunza was located in a valley not as green as the Bogotá savanna. The advantage of the Spanish weaponry {{and the use of the}} horses quickly beat the Muisca warriors.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{the park}} was opposed on {{multiple}} fronts. Many cultural institutions in Toronto such as Ontario Place, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the operators of the Canadian National Exhibition felt that the Toronto market was not large enough to support more competition. Other groups that fought the building of Wonderland included a Vaughan residential association called SAVE, which thought the increased traffic would reduce property values. People in the region were concerned that the new park would be similar in aesthetics to a carnival or midway. Some of the concessions the company made included a landscaped berm around the park to reduce noise and modifying {{the appearance of the}} large parking lot. Taft was concerned about opposition and flew a group of opponents and regional councilors to Mason, Ohio (near Cincinnati) to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> positive impact of one of its theme parks on the local community.|$|E
25|$|Cameron next {{began the}} sequel to Alien, the 1979 film by Ridley Scott. Cameron named the sequel Aliens and again cast Sigourney Weaver in the iconic role of Ellen Ripley. According to Cameron, the crew on Aliens was hostile to him, {{regarding}} him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott. Cameron sought to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>The</b> Terminator {{but the majority of}} the crew refused to watch it and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production. Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors when Michael Biehn of Terminator took James Remar's place as Corporal Hicks), Aliens became a box-office success. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Weaver, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and won awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of TIME magazine as a result of numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat; these were almost without precedent and expressed the feminist theme of the film very strongly.|$|E
25|$|As Hunter {{prepared}} {{to attack the}} village of Piedmont, Virginia, on June 5, Meigs suggested that cavalry be sent in a feint to take Mount Crawford overlooking the town. Sources differ {{as to whether he}} rode with or without orders, but Meigs accompanied the cavalry to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> way. Lieutenant Colonel John Platner's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteer Veteran Cavalry briefly skirmished with the defenders on Mount Crawford. The feint worked as nervous Confederates held off their attack and gave Hunter time to attack. But Meigs' ride with the cavalry proved a problem as well. Hunter planned an early attack on the town as a means of keeping the Confederates off-balance. But the Confederates had burned the bridge over the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. Hunter ordered a pontoon bridge constructed. But hours passed, and no bridge was built. Hunter was angered when he realized that Meigs, the responsible officer, was off with the cavalry. It is unclear whether Meigs rushed back to his unit and quickly constructed the bridge or whether Hunter oversaw its construction himself. At any rate, the bridge was poorly constructed, and {{only a small number of}} troops could cross it at once. The delay cost the Army of the Shenandoah three critical hours and ruined its planned early-hours attack.|$|E

But so concerned is he, he seems almost evangelical in his determination to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> error of their ways." [...] The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among [...] "The week's best", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, [...] "Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining." [...] The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, [...] "Best in show". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his [...] "Top Choice" [...] recommendation. Adams wrote, [...] "A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq – they believe God killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is." ...|$|E

The next morning they are {{surprised}} however to learn that Groundskeeper Willie was arrested for stealing the car, as he matched the description they gave of the carjacker as a [...] "foreign loner with wild, bushy hair". Not wanting to admit they were conned, Homer and Bart go along with Marge's theory. At the trial, the Blue Haired Lawyer leads Homer {{to say that it}} was Willie who stole the car. After Willie is proven guilty, he snatches Wiggum's gun and shoots Principal Skinner. At this point Homer finally confesses that he got conned but Marge and the townspeople themselves tell Homer and Bart that they set up the trial and the carjacking to teach them a lesson on conning people, revealing that Skinner was not really shot (it was a fake blood pack), the judge was Grampa wearing a latex mask, and the con man who stole their car was an actor called Devon Bradley. As Lisa is ready to explain why the town, media and police officials had [...] "nothing better to do" [...] than <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> consequences of their actions, Otto runs through the courtroom doors, shouting, 'Surf's Up!'. The scene then cuts to Springfield at the beach, with characters from the episode surfing, including the waiter from the restaurant, the two astronauts from the Mir space station and the sturgeon swimming in the sea.|$|E

2500|$|Skeptic Michael Shermer {{claims that}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of [...] "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "implausible."

2500|$|The pre-conquest {{religion}} of the natives consisted {{of a variety of}} monotheistic and polytheistic cults. Often, localized forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam or Tantrism admixed with Animism. [...] Bathala (Tagalog – Central Luzon) or Laon (Visayan) was the ultimate, creator deity above subordinate gods and goddesses. Natives also worshiped nature and venerated the spirits of their ancestors whom they propitiated with sacrifices. Mostly men practiced ritualistic drinking and many rituals performed aimed at cure for a certain illness. Magic and superstition also existed among the natives. The Spaniards claimed to liberate the natives from their wicked practices and <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> right path to God.|$|E
