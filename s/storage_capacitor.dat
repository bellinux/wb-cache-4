2500|$|Like the {{two-level}} converter and the six-pulse line-commutated converter, a MMC {{consists of}} six valves, each connecting one AC terminal to one DC terminal. [...] However, where each valve of the two-level converter is effectively a high-voltage controlled switch {{consisting of a}} large number of IGBTs connected in series, each valve of a MMC is a separate controllable voltage source in its own right. [...] Each MMC valve consists of a number of independent converter submodules, each containing its own <b>storage</b> <b>capacitor.</b> [...] In the most common form of the circuit, the half-bridge variant, each submodule contains two IGBTs connected in series across the capacitor, with the midpoint connection and one of the two capacitor terminals brought out as external connections. Depending on which of the two IGBTs in each submodule is turned on, the capacitor is either bypassed or connected into the circuit. [...] Each submodule therefore acts as an independent two-level converter generating a voltage of either 0 or Usm (where Usm is the submodule capacitor voltage). [...] With a suitable number of submodules connected in series, the valve can synthesize a stepped voltage waveform that approximates very closely to a sine-wave and contains very low levels of harmonic distortion.|$|E

40|$|A hold-up {{power supply}} for flash memory systems is provided. The hold-up power supply {{provides}} the flash memory {{with the power}} needed to temporarily operate when a power loss exists. This allows the flash memory system to complete any erasures and writes, and thus allows it to shut down gracefully. The hold-up power supply detects when a power loss on a power supply bus is occurring and supplies the power needed for the flash memory system to temporally operate. The hold-up power supply stores power {{in at least one}} capacitor. During normal operation, power from a high voltage supply bus is used to charge the <b>storage</b> <b>capacitors.</b> When a power supply loss is detected, the power supply bus is disconnected from the flash memory system. A hold-up controller controls the power flow from the <b>storage</b> <b>capacitors</b> to the flash memory system. The hold-up controller uses feedback to assure that the proper voltage is provided from the <b>storage</b> <b>capacitors</b> to the flash memory system.
