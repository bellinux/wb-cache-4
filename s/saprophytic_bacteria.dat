This agrees with the findings of the geologists, according to which the proportion of carbon compounds in the sediments decreases from south to north. Luminous bacteria were found in many samples of water. Their proportion of the saprophytic flora becomes less from south to north. Most of the water samples also contained pigmented bacteria. On freshwater medium, relatively few bacteria were able to develop.

In this study, the ability of cell-free culture medium (CFCM) of B. cepacia to improve early developmental stages of plants has been assessed on two agronomically important crops, maize (Zeamays) and rice (Oryzasativa). Treating maize and rice seeds for 45 min before germination significantly improved seed germination and consequent seedling growth. The effect of CFCM was confirmed by the increased biomass of the shoot and, mainly, the root systems of treated seedlings. Chromatographic characterization of the CFCM revealed that the spent culture medium of B. cepacia is a complex mix of different classes of metabolites including, among others, salicylic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and several unidentified phenolic compounds. Fractionation of the CFCM components revealed that the impressive development of the root system of CFCM-treated seedlings is due to the synergistic action of several groups of components rather than IAA alone.

Intranasal delivery of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides also provided significant protection; however, combining preexposure vaccination with CpG treatment at the time of infection or up to 18 hours after infection, provided significantly greater protection than either treatment alone.
