This study aimed to evaluate mineralogical and chemical characteristics of Toba highland <b>Spodosols,</b> North Sumatra, and their implication on agricultural development.  Three pedons of the Toba highland <b>Spodosols</b> from Humbang Hasundutan regency were studied, consisted of soils developed from volcanic sand overlying liparite tuff under the influence of low temperature and high rainfall. Field observation was conducted in January 2008. Fifteen soil samples were collected from the three pedons based on the depth of soil horizon.  Results indicated that the formation of these <b>Spodosols</b> were influenced by parent material, high elevation (1676 - 1821 m) above sea level), and by high amount of rainfall (2167 mm).  The <b>Spodosols</b> in Toba highland {{were still in the}} early stage of development as characterized by shallow effective soil depth (22 - 23 cm), domination of weatherable minerals (39 - 81 %) in the sand fraction and dominated by amorphous mineral as shown by sum of A 1 + 1 / 2 Fe extracted by ammonium oxalate as much as 0. 6 - 12. 8 %.

Results showed that the stabilization processes affected biosolids-N agronomic rates and effectiveness to yield plant biomass, which was a function of organic-N contents mineralized in soils.

In the soils of the bay area (P 1 and P 2), the pH ranged from 5. 0 to 7. 5, associated with dominance of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, with base saturation above 50 % in some horizons. In the flooded fields (P 3 and P 4) the soil pH ranged from 4. 9 to 5. 9, H+ contents were high in the surface horizons (0. 8 - 10. 5 cmol c kg- 1), Ca 2 + and Mg² contents ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 8 cmol c kg- 1 and base saturation was < 50 %.

The pedogenic processes in a <b>Spodosol,</b> 10, 700 years-old, at Sotkamo that has been cultivated for about 50 years were studied by characterizing the morphology and analyzing the major chemical properties, texture and mineralogy. Before cultivation, organic acids produced by decomposition of organic matter from pine litter in O and A horizons had weathered primary minerals in A and E horizons releasing Al and Fe. Percolating waters moved the organo-metallic complexes from A and E horizons to Bhsm and Bs horizons where the complexes coated and bridged sand grains eventually forming cemented ortstein. Because of the high biotite content of the parent material, the index of accumulation of Fe and Al in the Bhsm horizon (Al + 0. 5 Fe = 4. 1 %) was the highest reported in Spodosols of Finland. The data support the theory of downward movement of Al and Fe as organo-metallic complexes with formation of some ferrihydrite but little or no formation of imogolite type materials. Little, if any, podzolization has likely occurred since the initiation of cultivation because, after agricultural liming and consequent increase of pH in the Ap horizon, organic compounds are likely to chelate Ca and Mg rather than Al and Fe. ...|$|E

The ecosystems are influenced by the park’s proximity to the Sacramento Valley and the Cascade and Coast ranges, and by its wide altitudinal gradient: 190 m at Lower Clear Creek, 1892 m at Shasta Bally summit. The park’s topography is typified by steep terrain. The area has a Mediterranean climate of wet-cool winters and dry-hot summers, with temperatures ranging from sub-freezing in winter months to over 38 °C during the summer (USDI 2003). Mean annual precipitation is 152 cm and mostly comes as rainfall from November through April (USDI 2003); the upper elevation snowpack often remains into June. The WNRA soil types consist of entisols, inceptisols, <b>spodosols,</b> alfisols, and a few mollisols (USDI 2003). While upper elevation steep hillsides are composed of poorly developed entisols and inceptisols, the lower elevation areas are mainly composed of well developed alfisols and <b>spodosols</b> (USDI 2003, Fry and Stephens 2006). Mollisols are found in grasslands and broadleaf forests (USDI 2003).|$|R

The main primary form, bedrock-derived apatite P, becomes progressively lost through leaching, or transformed into more immobile and less plant-accessible, secondary organic and mineral forms. Here we studied the rejuvenating effect of dust deposition on soil P along an active dust flux gradient downwind of a braided river. Along the gradient, we measured soil P fractions to 50 cm depth of six <b>Spodosols</b> and one Inceptisol, supplemented by tree foliage P concentrations. While an increasing dust flux correlates with a twofold increase of foliar P and soil organic P along the gradient, apatite P declines from ~ 50 to 3 g m⁻² and total P shows no response. Compared to dust-unaffected <b>Spodosols,</b> depth distribution of total P becomes increasingly uniform and organic P propagates deeper into the soil under dust flux. Further, the effect of topsoil P eluviation attenuates due to higher organic P content and the zone of high apatite P concentrations associated with un-weathered subsoil becomes progressively removed from the upper 50 cm. We interpret these patterns as being consistent with upbuilding pedogenesi and conclude that dust-derived mineral P is assimilated in the organic surface horizon and does not reach the mineral soil. Dust-derived mineral P is temporarily stored in the living biomass {{and returns to the}} soil with plant and microbial detritus as organic P, which is subsequently buried by further dust increments. We further conclude that (1) the efficiency of P fertilization of the ecosystem by dust accession is higher than through P advection in dust-unaffected <b>Spodosols</b> and (2) organic P may serve as an important source of labile P in a high-leaching environment. © 2013.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{developed}} on 52 soil profiles, 61 surface diagnostic horizons, and 26 subsurface diagnostic horizons classified {{according to the}} Soil Taxonomy and Brazilian Soil Classification System (SiBCS) as Mollisols (Chernossolos), <b>Spodosols</b> (Espodossolos), Entisols (Gleissolos), Oxisols (Latossolos), and Histosols (Organossolos). The objective was to quantify the carbon (C) in organic matter fractions and to correlate it with soil chemical attributes. Soil organic matter was fractionated into fulvic acids (C-FAF), humic acids (C-HAF), and humin (C-HUM), and the ratios C-HAF/C-FAF and AE (alkaline extract) /C-HUM were calculated. Humin was the predominant fraction in Mollisols and Oxisols, which showed values of AE/C-HUM and C-HAF/C-FAF lower than 1. 0. The humin fraction was also predominant in surface horizons of <b>Spodosols</b> and Entisols, whereas a higher content of C-FAF and C-FAH was observed in the subsurface horizons, with values higher than 1. 5 for the AE/C-HUM ratio. C-HAF was predominant in the Histosols, and C-HAF/C-FAF ratio values were higher than 2. 0. The highest correlation values with soil attributes were observed for C-HAF, C-HUM, and total organic C with pH, sum of bases, and cation exchange capacity. The differences in humic substances distribution was a useful parameter to characterize soil orders in the Brazilian soil classification system and to understand pedogenic processes. 200...|$|R
