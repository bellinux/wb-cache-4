25|$|In {{the context}} of the <b>social</b> <b>web,</b> {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E

But when Maura Murray disappeared, the <b>social</b> <b>Web</b> was in its infancy. There was no YouTube and no Twitter. On the day Maura went missing, Facebook was five days old.

[...] In November 2004, a second cousin of Murray created the website [...] [...] In 2005, active discussion of Murray's disappearance was documented on websleuths.com, and in 2007, Facebook and Myspace pages were created dedicated to helping find her.|$|E

2500|$|These fantasy worlds {{were part}} of a general trend. [...] This era began a general trend toward more self-consistent and {{substantive}} fantasy worlds. [...] Earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a <b>social</b> <b>web,</b> where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril. [...] In Phantastes, for instance, George MacDonald has a mentor-figure explain to the hero that the moral laws are the same in the world he is about to enter as in the world he came from; this lends weight and importance to his actions in this world, however fantastical it is.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Over {{the past}} several years, a lot of {{research}} has been done on the concept of semantic web. However, the research and implementation of the semantic web has predominantly focused on making data machine-understandable while neglecting personal information and human relationships. The <b>social</b> semantic <b>web</b> is a catchall term for defining and presenting social information such as friendship {{in a manner that is}} machine-understandable. This paper will introduce the concept of the <b>social</b> semantic <b>web</b> and two related initiatives: the Friend of a Friend-project (FOAF) and XHTML Friends Network (XFN). Their similarities and differences as well as real-life applications are also discussed.

2500|$|NPR {{has been}} dubbed as [...] "leveraging the Twitter generation" [...] because of its {{adaptation}} of the popular microblogging service {{as one of its}} primary vehicles of information. Of NPR's Twitter followers, the majority (67%) still do listen to NPR on the radio. In a survey of more than 10,000 respondents, NPR found that its Twitter followers are younger, more connected to the <b>social</b> <b>web,</b> and more likely to access content through digital platforms such as its Peabody Award-winning website npr.org, as well as podcasts, mobile apps and more. NPR has more than one Twitter account including @NPR; its survey found that most respondents followed between two and five NPR accounts, including topical account, show-specific accounts and on-air staff accounts. In addition, NPR's Facebook page has {{been at the forefront of}} the company foray into social media. Started by college student and fan Geoff Campbell in 2008, the page was quickly taken over by the organization, and over the last two years has grown to nearly 4 million fans and is a popular example of the company's new focus on a younger audience.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>social</b> <b>Web</b> {{is quickly}} {{becoming}} {{a way of}} life: many people visit social networking sites at least once per day, and in 2008 the average amount of time per visit to MySpace hovered around twenty-six minutes (the length of a sitcom). Furthermore, the astoundingly rapid growth of the <b>social</b> <b>Web</b> since the '90s is not projected to slow down anytime soon: with less than 20% of the world's population using the Internet, the <b>social</b> <b>Web</b> is felt by some to still be in its infancy. The line between social networking and social media is becoming increasingly blurred as sites such as Facebook and Twitter further incorporate photo, video, and other functionalities typical of social media sites into users' public profiles, just as social media sites have been integrating features characteristic of social networking sites into their own online frameworks. One notable change that has been {{brought about by the}} merging of social networking/media is the transformation of <b>social</b> <b>web</b> applications into egocentric software that put people at the center of applications. Although there had been discussion about a sense of community on the web prior to these innovations, modern <b>social</b> <b>web</b> software makes a wider set of social interactions available to the user, such as [...] "friending" [...] and [...] "following" [...] individuals, even sending them virtual gifts or kisses. <b>Social</b> <b>Web</b> applications are typically built using object oriented programming, utilizing combinations of several programming languages, such as Ruby, PHP, Python, ASP.NET and/or Java. Often APIs are utilized to tie non-social websites to social websites, one example being Campusfood.com.|$|E
