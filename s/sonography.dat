25|$|Haemodynamic {{problems}} {{have been found in}} the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using transcranial color-coded duplex <b>sonography</b> (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). In 2010 there were conflicting results when evaluating the relationship between MS and CCSVI. but {{is important to note that}} positives have appeared among the blinded studies.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} not clear whether {{magnetic}} resonance venography, venous angiography, or Doppler <b>sonography</b> should be considered {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance venography for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance venography is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler including the fact that results are more operator-independent.|$|E
25|$|Hydrosalpinx may be {{diagnosed}} using ultrasonography as the fluid filled elongated and distended tubes display their typical echolucent pattern. However, a small hydrosalpinx may be missed by <b>sonography.</b> During an infertility work-up a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), an X-ray procedure {{that uses a}} contrast agent to image the fallopian tubes, shows the retort-like shape of the distended tubes {{and the absence of}} spillage of the dye into the peritoneum. If, however, there is a tubal occlusion at the utero-tubal junction, a hydrosalpinx may go undetected. When a hydrosalpinx is detected by an HSG it is prudent to administer antibiotics {{to reduce the risk of}} reactivation of an inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{with major}} trauma {{commonly}} have chest and pelvic X-rays taken, and, {{depending on the}} mechanism of injury and presentation, a focused assessment with <b>sonography</b> for trauma (FAST) exam to check for internal bleeding. For those with relatively stable blood pressure, heart rate, and sufficient oxygenation, CT scans are useful. Full-body CT scans, known as pan-scans, improve the survival rate {{of those who have}} suffered major trauma. These scans use intravenous injections for the radiocontrast agent, but not oral administration. There are concerns that intravenous contrast administration in trauma situations without confirming adequate renal function may cause damage to kidneys, but this {{does not appear to be}} significant.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. <b>Sonography</b> will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
500|$|French {{researchers}} Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported {{similar findings}} {{to that of}} O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D <b>sonography</b> of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating {{the ways in which}} erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of their findings, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot, because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the [...] "coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall". Buisson and Foldès suggested [...] "that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction".|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{credentialing}} {{bodies in}} the United States for sonographers, the Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) Established in 1968 and the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical <b>Sonography</b> (ARDMS) Established in 1975. Both CCI and ARDMS have earned the prestigious ANSI-ISO 17024 accreditation for certifying bodies from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Accreditation is granted through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

2500|$|Where no intrauterine {{pregnancy}} is seen on ultrasound, measuring β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels may {{aid in the}} diagnosis. The rationale is that a low β-hCG level may indicate that the {{pregnancy is}} intrauterine but yet {{too small to be}} visible on ultrasonography. While some physicians consider that the threshold where an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound is around 1500 IU/ml of β-hCG, a review in the JAMA Rational Clinical Examination Series showed that there is no single threshold for the β-human chorionic gonadotropin that confirms an ectopic pregnancy. [...] Instead, the best test in a pregnant woman is a high resolution transvaginal ultrasound. The presence of an adnexal mass {{in the absence of an}} intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal <b>sonography</b> increases the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy 100-fold (LR+ 111). [...] When there are no adnexal abnormalities on transvaginal <b>sonography,</b> the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy decreases (LR- 0.12). An empty uterus with levels higher than 1500 IU/ml may be evidence of an ectopic pregnancy, but may also be consistent with an intrauterine pregnancy which is simply too small to be seen on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is uncertain, it may be necessary to wait a few days and repeat the blood work. This can be done by measuring the β-hCG level approximately 48 hours later and repeating the ultrasound. The serum hCG ratios and logistic regression models appear to be better than absolute single serum hCG level. If the β-hCG falls on repeat examination, this strongly suggests a spontaneous abortion or rupture. The fall in serum hCG over 48 hours may be measured as the hCG ratio, which is calculated as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Suspicion of an {{abdominal}} {{pregnancy is}} raised when the baby's parts {{can be easily}} felt, or the lie is abnormal, the cervix is displaced, or there is failed induction of labor. X-rays {{can be used to}} aid diagnosis. <b>Sonography</b> can demonstrate that the pregnancy is outside an empty uterus, there is reduced to no amniotic fluid between the placenta and the fetus, [...] no uterine wall surrounding the fetus, fetal parts are close to the abdominal wall, the fetus has an abnormal lie, the placenta looks abnormal and there is free fluid in the abdomen. MRI has also been used with success to diagnose abdominal pregnancy and plan for surgery. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are another clue of the presence of an abdominal pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|Increasing {{awareness}} of the problem has led to multiple campaigns by celebrities and journalists to combat sex-selective abortions. Aamir Khan devoted the first episode [...] "" [...] of his show Satyamev Jayate to raise {{awareness of}} this widespread practice, focusing primarily on Western Rajasthan, which is known {{to be one of the}} areas where this practice is common. Its sex ratio dropped to 883 girls per 1,000 boys in 2011 from 901 girls to 1000 boys in 2001. Rapid response was shown by local government in Rajasthan after the airing of this show, showing the effect of media and nationwide awareness on the issue. A vow was made by officials to set up fast-track courts to punish those who practice sex-based abortion. They cancelled the licences of six <b>sonography</b> centres and issued notices to over 20 others.|$|E

2500|$|Duodenography and colonography are {{performed}} like a standard abdominal examination using B-mode and color flow Doppler ultrasonography using a low frequency transducer — for example a 2.5MHz — {{and a high}} frequency transducer, for example a 7.5MHz probe. Detailed examination of duodenal walls and folds, colonic walls and haustra was performed using a 7.5MHz probe. Deeply located abdominal structures were examined using 2.5MHz probe. All ultrasound examinations {{are performed}} after overnight fasting (for at least 16 hours) using standard scanning procedure. Subjects are examined with and without water contrast. Water contrast imaging is performed by having adult subjects take at least one liter of water prior to examination. Patients are examined in the supine, left posterior oblique, and left lateral decubitus positions using the intercostal and subcostal approaches. The liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, duodenum, colon, and kidneys are routinely evaluated in all patients. With patient lying supine, {{the examination of the}} duodenum with high frequency ultrasound duodenography is performed with 7.5MHz probe placed in the right upper abdomen, and central epigastric successively; for high frequency ultrasound colonography, the ascending colon, is examined with starting point usually midway of an imaginary line running from the iliac crest to the umbilicus and proceeding cephalid through the right mid abdomen; for the descending colon, the examination begins from the left upper abdomen proceeding caudally and traversing the left mid abdomen and left lower abdomen, terminating at the sigmoid colon in the lower pelvic region. [...] Color flow Doppler <b>sonography</b> is used to examine the localization of lesions in relation to vessels. [...] All measurements of diameter and wall thickness are performed with built-in software. Measurements are taken between peristaltic waves.|$|E
