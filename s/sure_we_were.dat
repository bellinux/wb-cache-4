He describes the moment in his own words: [...] "We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to get it. About 30 of us were killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic {{it would be to}} be killed {{at the end of the}} war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} mixed. Ramsey Isler of IGN noted his enjoyment of Dan Quagmire's character traits: [...] "I'll give the writing team credit for this little plot twist, as I'm <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all expecting the elder Quagmire {{to be even more}} of a womanizer than his son." [...] Regarding the episode's treatment of LGBT issues, Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated, [...] "there's a gold mine of material to dig into for satire and comedy; comedy which will likely offend as many people as the real issues do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the scenes between Quagmire and his father [...] "surprisingly well-done" [...] while noting, [...] "the scenes where the mockery seemed a little too mean-spirited were definitely out of the show's worst sections of its toolkit". Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number ten on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and praised Brian's line of 'Hey... I fucked your dad' after Quagmire attacks him, describing it as [...] "amazing".|$|E

[...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} May, the Russo brothers, {{along with}} Feige and Pascal, held a screen test in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed {{for the role of}} Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for [...] "chemistry"; Tom Holland was cast as the {{character}} the next month, to also appear in a [...] The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War, due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly. The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, [...] "were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on." [...] Holland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film, and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit. Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to [...] "see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it," [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, [...] "to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all on the same page so that [...] transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a [...] "plan B" [...] should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because [...] "it was very important to us to reintroduce" [...] Spider-Man in the film, adding, [...] "We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man." ...|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{said that}} crew {{resource}} management (CRM) {{contributed to the}} flight's safe landing at Anchorage; he said [...] "This was a classic application of CRM. We were blessed and lucky that we had full flight crew augmentation. We had four pilots {{to work together in}} the cockpit. We had an excellent group of flight attendants on board; that became important later because we briefed this as a ‘red’ emergency, which means there’s at least a solid chance you’re going to have to evacuate.

[...] On developing Cosette, Seyfried said, [...] "In the little time that I [...] had to explain Cosette and give the audience a reason [...] a symbol of love and strength and light in this tragedy, I needed {{to be able to}} convey things you may not have connected with in the show."
