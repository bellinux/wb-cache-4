5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide <b>Sb2O5</b> shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
500|$|Antimony is a silver-white solid with a {{blue tint}} and a {{brilliant}} lustre. It has a density of 6.697 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more so than arsenic; less so than iron; {{about the same as}} copper). It is stable in air and moisture at room temperature. It is attacked by concentrated nitric acid, yielding the hydrated pentoxide <b>Sb2O5.</b> Aqua regia gives the pentachloride SbCl5 and hot concentrated sulfuric acid results in the sulfate Sb2(SO4)3. It is not affected by molten alkali. Antimony is capable of displacing hydrogen from water, when heated: [...] 2 Sb + 3 H2O → Sb2O3 + 3 H2. It melts at 631°C. Antimony is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.1 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.16eV. Liquid antimony is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of around 5.3 × 104S•cm−1.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{reaction}} with nitric acid, most metals {{give the}} corresponding nitrates. [...] Some metalloids and metals give the oxides; for instance, Sn, As, Sb, and Ti are oxidized into SnO2, As2O5, <b>Sb2O5,</b> and TiO2 respectively.|$|E

50|$|SnO2 {{has been}} used as pigment in the {{manufacture}} of glasses, enamels and ceramic glazes. Pure SnO2 gives a milky white colour; other colours are achieved when mixed with other metallic oxides e.g. V2O5 yellow; Cr2O3 pink; and <b>Sb2O5</b> grey blue.|$|E
5000|$|In {{chemistry}} an antimonate is {{a compound}} which contains a metallic element, oxygen and antimony in an oxidation state of +5. These compounds {{can be considered}} to be salts of the hypothetical antimonic acid H3SbO4, or combinations of metal oxides and antimony pentoxide, <b>Sb2O5.</b> Historically these compounds were assumed to be analogous to the phosphates and formulas such as LiSbO3·3H2O and Na2H2Sb2O7·5H2O were used and the compounds described as hydrated meta-antimonates and pyro-antimonates. LiSbO3·3H2O is now known to be LiSb(OH)6 and contain the [...] anion and that Na2H2Sb2O7·5H2O is actually NaSb(OH)6.|$|E
