30|$|Different {{cupric oxide}} (CuO) {{structures}} have attracted intensive interest {{because of their}} promising applications in various fields. In this study, three kinds of CuO structures, namely, CuO microdisks, CuO nanoblocks, and CuO microspheres, are synthesized by solution-based synthetic methods. The morphologies and crystal structures of these CuO structures are characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer, respectively. They are used as thermal conductive fillers to prepare silicone-based thermal greases, giving rise to great enhancement in thermal conductivity. Compared with pure <b>silicone</b> <b>base,</b> the thermal conductivities of thermal greases with CuO microdisks, CuO nanoblocks, and CuO microspheres are 0.283, 0256, and 0.239  W/mK, respectively, at filler loading of 9  vol.%, which increases 139 %, 116 %, and 99 %, respectively. These thermal greases present a slight descendent tendency in thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. These experimental data are compared with Nan's model prediction, indicating that the shape factor has a great influence on thermal conductivity improvement of thermal greases with different CuO structures. Meanwhile, due to large aspect ratio of CuO microdisks, they can form thermal networks more effectively {{than the other two}} structures, resulting in higher thermal conductivity enhancement.|$|E

Results: Observation over several hours of lice treated using 4 % high molecular weight dimeticone in a volatile <b>silicone</b> <b>base</b> showed that, although rapidly immobilised initially, the insects still exhibited small movements of extremities and death was delayed.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{fabrication}} methods for CuNWs have been developed, including template-assisted synthesis [15, 16], {{chemical vapor deposition}} [17], vacuum vapor deposition [18], hydrothermal reduction [13, 14] and so on [19, 20]. However, the above methods are hardly applicable in composite materials because of the limitation in mass production and process complexity. In this paper, large-scale synthesis of ultra-long CuNWs has become a reality through hydrothermal reduction of divalent copper ions using oleylamine and oleic acid as the dual ligands. The CuNWs have been usually used for improving the electrical properties of composite materials [3, 10, 12, 13], but the improvement of composites based on CuNWs was seldom reported. In order to investigate the influence of ultra-long CuNWs on thermal conductivity of polymer composites, silicone composites with different fillers were prepared due to good compatibility of <b>silicone</b> <b>base</b> and easy fabrication of silicone composites. Since graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) possess large aspect ratio and superior thermal conductivity [21 – 24], as a comparison, they were also used for preparing silicone composites. Based on experimental data, the analytical models on polymer composites were developed for simultaneously calculating the thermal property with single or hybrid fillers [25, 26].|$|E

The performance of a <b>silicone</b> <b>based</b> membrane was first compared to membranes based on polyimide and PIM- 1 (polymers of intrinsic microporosity).

The predicted values of styrene oligomer rejection curves in these solvents were also compared to the measured values.

40|$|Implantation of left {{ventricular}} assist devices typically requires cardiopulmonary bypass support, which {{is associated with}} postoperative complications. A novel suture-less inflow cannula, which can be implanted without bypass, uses mild myocardial compression to seal the interface, however, this may lead to necrosis of the myocardium. To circumvent this issue, a bilayered scaffold has been developed to promote tissue growth at the interface between cannula and myocardium. The bilayered scaffold consists of a <b>silicone</b> <b>base</b> layer, which mimics the seal, and a melt electrospun polycaprolactone scaffold {{to serve as a}} tissue integration layer. Biocompatibility of the bilayered scaffolds was assessed by analyzing cell viability, morphology, and metabolic activity of human foreskin fibroblasts cultured on the scaffolds for up to 14 days. There was no evidence of cytotoxicity and the cells adhered readily to the bilayered scaffolds, revealing a cell morphology characteristic of fibroblasts, in contrast to the low cell adhesion observed on flat silicone sheets. The rate of cell proliferation on the bilayered scaffolds rose over the 14 -day period and was significantly greater than cells seeded on the silicone sheets. This study suggests that melt electrospun bilayered scaffolds have the potential to support tissue integration of a suture-less inflow cannula for cardiovascular applications. Furthermore, the method of fabrication described here and the application of bilayered scaffolds could also have potential uses in a diverse range of biomedical applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{extraction}} stage of edible {{oil in the}} oil industry is commonly performed by using toxic solvents (e. g. hexane) and processes with high energy consumption (e. g. distillation, evaporation) to recover the solvent, which represents around 70 - 75 wt% in the oil-solvent mixture. In this paper, a membrane-based extraction method using nanofiltration (NF) membranes is presented. Commercial nanofiltration membranes made of different polymers (Desal-DK-polyamide NF from GE-osmonics®, NF 30 polyethersulfone NF from Nadir®, STARMEMTM 122 polyimide from MET ® and SOLSEP NF 030306 <b>silicone</b> <b>base</b> polymer SOLESP ®) were selected and tested to recover the solvent from soybean oil/solvent (10 - 20 - 30 % w/w oil) mixtures at various separation pressures and constant temperature in a dead-end filtration set up. The selection of the solvent was made in order to compare solvents obtainable from renewable resources, such as ethanol, iso-propanol and acetone, with solvents traditionally used in the industry (i. e. cyclohexane and n-hexane). The structural stability of the membranes towards the different solvents used in this work was verified visually, by the variation of the membrane area and by means of permeate flux assessments. Desal-DK and NF 30 showed poor filtration performance and even visible defects after exposure to acetone but a good performance was obtained for the nanofiltration membranes STARMEM TM 122 and SOLSEP NF 030306 with ethanol, iso-propanol and acetone. For example, considering a mixture with 30 % edible oil in acetone, STARMEM TM 122 shows a flux and oil rejection of 16. 8 L m- 2 h and 70 %, respectively. For the same conditions, SOLSEP NF 030306 exhibited a flux of 4. 8 L m- 2 h with 78 % rejection, which shows the potential application of nanofiltration membranes {{in the oil industry}}...|$|E
