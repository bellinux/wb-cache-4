50|$|Also, {{alkaline}} lysis {{is sometimes}} used to extract plant genetic material. The plant cells {{are subjected to}} a strongly alkaline solution containing a detergent (usually a zwitterionic or nonionic detergent such as Tween 20), and the mixture is incubated at high temperature. This method is not used as often due to the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide's</b> tendency to damage genetic material, reducing DNA fragment size.|$|R

5|$|The {{flesh of}} the {{mushroom}} is smooth, thin and white. The taste and odor are mild and have no distinct smell. When treated with a dilute solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (NaOH) or sulfuric acid, the flesh turns reddish. The spore print of H.olivaceoalbus is white.|$|E
5|$|When {{concentrated}} <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{solution is}} added to lead(II) nitrate solution, basic nitrates are formed, even well past the equivalence point. Up through the half equivalence point, Pb(NO3)2·Pb(OH)2 predominates, then after this point Pb(NO3)2·5Pb(OH)2 is formed. No simple Pb(OH)2 is formed up to at least pH 12.|$|E
5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
5000|$|As the soluble {{potassium}} and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> are leached out of {{the concrete}} along the seepage path, the solution pH will fall to pH ≤12.5. [...] Below about pH 10.3, the more dominant chemical reaction will become 2. The leachate solution pH, influences which dominant carbonate species (ions) are present, so {{at any one time}} there may be one or more different chemical reactions occurring within a concrete structure.|$|R
50|$|This {{is where}} the {{chemistry}} becomes a bit complicated, due {{to the presence of}} soluble potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> in new concrete, which supports a higher solution alkalinity of about pH 13.2 - 13.4, the predominant carbon species is CO32− and the leachate becomes saturated with Ca2+. The following chemical formulae 3 & 4 will most likely be occurring, and 4 responsible for the deposition of CaCO3 to create stalactites under concrete structures.|$|R
50|$|Handling of wet {{concrete}} {{must always be}} done with proper protective equipment. Contact with {{wet concrete}} can cause skin chemical burns due to the caustic nature {{of the mixture of}} cement and water. Indeed, the pH of fresh cement water is highly alkaline due to the presence of free potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> in solution (pH ~ 13.5). Eyes, hands and feet must be correctly protected to avoid any direct contact with wet concrete and washed without delay if necessary.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E
5|$|The {{high demand}} of {{aluminium}} created {{the need for}} the production of sodium. After the introduction of the Hall–Héroult process for the production of aluminium by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was developed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{summarizes}} {{the effect of}} activator ratio on the processing of cement powder. Geopolymer slurry was produced via alkaline activation of calcined kaolin. Once the geopolymer slurry solidified, it was crushed and ground to obtain cement powder. Ultilizing the concept of “just adding water”, hardened cement paste could be produced from cement powder. This paper concluded that solids-to-liquid and <b>sodium</b> silicate-to-sodium <b>hydroxide</b> ratios {{have a significant effect}} on compressive strength of hardened cement paste. The optimum solids-to-liquid and <b>sodium</b> silicate-to-sodium <b>hydroxide</b> ratios were 0. 80 and 0. 20, respectively. SEM micrographs showed that a processing route to produce cement powder by “just adding water” was possible, and the structure became denser and fewer unreacted particles were observed...|$|R

5|$|It {{was named}} by Wollaston in 1802 after the {{asteroid}} 2 Pallas, {{which had been}} discovered two months earlier. Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide).</b>|$|E
5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E

40|$|The {{essentiality}} and carcinogenicity of chromium {{depend on}} its chemical form. Oxidation state and solubility {{are particularly important}} in determining the biological effects of chromium compounds. For this reason, total chromium measurements are of little value in assessing its nutritional benefits or its toxicological hazards. Aqueous <b>sodium</b> carbonate-sodium <b>hydroxide</b> solutions have been successfully used for extracting hexavalent chromium {{from a variety of}} environmental and biological matrices while preserving its oxidation state. Typical recoveries are 90 to 105 % in samples spiked with both trivalent and hexavalent chromium. Determination of hexavalent chromium after extraction with <b>sodium</b> carbonate-sodium <b>hydroxide</b> solution, coupled with the determination of total chromium after nitric acid-hydrogen peroxide digestion, has been applied to the evaluation of chromium speciation in airborne particulates, sludges, and biological tissues...|$|R

5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are not}} burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|A {{recommendation}} from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory {{had been established}} to make <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, {{who worked as a}} stenographer in nearby Stockton-on-Tees. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, Alexander Fleck had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} more {{efficient}} than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure <b>sodium</b> (or potassium) <b>hydroxide</b> at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.|$|R
40|$|Biogas is an {{alternative}} source of energy which is produced by anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste materials. Biogas contains 50 - 70 % methane and 30 - 50 % carbon dioxide as well as small a amounts of other gases with a calorific value of about 21 - 24 MJ/m 3. These trace components limit the usage of the biogas as they lower the calorific value of the gas and limit its commercialization. Hence, {{there is a need}} for purification and upgrading to meet specified application standards. The purification and upgrading processes can be classified into four major techniques which are absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic separation. This review is focused on biogas enrichment through chemical absorption. This process involves amine washing with mono-,di- or tri-ethanolamine solutions, alkali washing with calcium oxide, calcium, potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> and synthesised ionic solutions of halide imidazolium ionic liquids. The regeneration of the spent chemicals for re-use will also be studied...|$|R
40|$|Silica {{particles}} {{had been}} successfully separated and extracted from rice husk by using solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (NaOH) as solvent and were characterized with SEM-EDX.

In {{order to understand the}} adsorption capacity of silica in removing free fatty acids (FFA) which were recognized as the contaminants in biodiesel., the profile of time dependence and silica amount in the adsorption process had been investigated in this study. The results indicated that the adsorption process showed optimum condition at 30 minutes with the free fatty acids (about 90, 64 %) of adsorption). Moreover, the adsorption capacity of silica to those impurities contaminated in biodiesel was proportional to the amount of adsorbent used in the experiment. Finally, biodiesel with less FFA was produced, and the FFA residues remained in the biodiesel were 0, 58 mg/g...|$|R
