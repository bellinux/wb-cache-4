30|$|Figure 2 {{illustrates}} the average load {{in terms of}} average number of requests handled by each <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> located in the RI. In this scenario, we set the number of requests to 100. In the basic LocVSDP protocol 97 % of the requests are handled by the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> 116, whereas in the QoS-based LocVSDP every <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> located in RI handles at most 11 % of the total requests generated during the simulation time. This proves that our QoSLocVSDP succeeds in balancing the load among the different <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in the RI. In the basic LocVSDP protocol, the service reply contains information about the closest <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> {{to the center of}} the RI. Since in our simulation scenario we assume that all the service requests specify the same RI, the closest <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> 116 located closer {{to the center of the}} RI than the other <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> handled 97 % of the total requests and 3 % of the total requests were dropped. However, in the QoSLocVSDP, service replies contain information about the closest less loaded <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> to the center of the RI. Thus 99 % of the total number of requests are handled by <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> inside RI such that every <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> handles at most 11 % of the total requests.|$|R

But in current e-commerce, separate logins are needed to access different <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> This limitation prevents MMS to closely cooperate with other <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> The Liberty Alliance standards are intended {{to solve the problem of}} signing on repeatedly for each <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> The Liberty Alliance defines the specifications to share identity information across <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> However, these specifications have not been integrated into MMS.

30|$|We {{define the}} load on a <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> SP {{as the number}} of {{requests}} handled by the SP during the simulation time. In the LocVSDP [3], the service requester receives in the service reply the information of the closest requested <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> {{to the center of the}} desired RI. If many service requesters specify the same RI, then the same <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> S P 0 would be returned to these service requesters, even if there are other <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> located in the desired RI. Thus, the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> S P 0 would be overloaded while the other <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> located in the RI are underloaded, which can affect the performance of the overloaded <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> In order to overcome this weakness and balance the load on <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in the vehicular network, we proposed the following load balancing technique: When a service client sends its request to the desired RI, the RRs inside the RI compute a spanning tree with a unique leader RR. Then all RRs send their local replies to the leader of the spanning tree starting from the leaves. In their local replies, every RR adds the load on each <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> in its range. The leader RR receives all the information about SPs including their loads. In the reply returned to the service requester, the leader sends the information of <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> ranked from the less loaded one to the most loaded one. Then the service requester connects to the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> that satisfies the desired QoS requirements. The chosen <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> updates its load and acknowledges its neighboring RRs about its new load that would be considered for future requests.|$|R
