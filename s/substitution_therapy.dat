25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, {{many of these}} people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term <b>substitution</b> <b>therapy</b> of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of any cartilage substitution device, {{an understanding of the}} tribological response of the natural joint, as well as the treated joint is of upmost importance. Many previous studies have investigated the tribology of potential cartilage <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies,</b> using small scale pin on plate experiments. The aim of the current study was to develop an anatomical and physiological simulation of the medial compartmental bovine knee joint and to use this simulation to investigate a number of cartilage <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies</b> for damaged or diseased knee joints. A pendulum friction simulator was used to apply physiological loading and motion to medial compartmental knees. The wear of the cartilage was characterised following the experiments using three different techniques: surface topography analysis, volumetric wear quantification using µMRI scans and histological assessment. Three main interventions were investigated using this novel anatomical simulation - the tribological response of meniscectomy, the effect of conformity of tibial hemiarthroplasty designs, and finally, a number of potential cartilage substitution materials were investigated as osteochondral repair devices in the femoral condyle. In the first two studies, the removal of the meniscus and a decrease of tibial hemiarthroplasty conformity, resulted in an elevation of the coefficient of friction, contact stress, friction shear stress and subsequently the wear and degradation of cartilage. In the defect repair study, biphasic defect repair materials (hydrogels) had a superior tribological performance to non-compliant single phase materials (stainless steel). Across the three studies, the use of non-biphasic materials and/or the loss of joint congruity resulted in a more rapid decrease of cartilage interstitial fluid pressurisation and biphasic fluid load support, resulting in increased cartilage solid-solid contact and increased wear. This tribological simulation can be used to investigate many potential knee joint intervention, from uni- or hemi-arthroplasty, cartilage defect repair, meniscus substitutes or tissue engineered substitutes. This simulation can be used to further our understanding of the tribological characteristics of more satisfactory and conservative therapies for damaged and diseased synovial joints. ...|$|R

However, {{treatment of}} persons with HIV or who inject drugs remains challenging because of special issues: drug–drug interactions with antiretroviral, psychiatric and drug <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies,</b> treatment adherence, impact of treatment on HIV disease course or on risk of bacterial infections. Sofosbuvir induced sustained virologic response in 91 % of 23 HIV/HCV coinfected persons treated in combination with ribavirin and pegylated interferon, in 83 % of 497 treated in combination with ribavirin and in all 50 patients infected with HCV GT 1 treated in combination with ledipasvir and ribavirin. The rates of efficacy in HCV–HIV coinfected were almost the same as those observed in HCV monoinfected suggesting that the efficacy of sofosbuvir is not reduced by HIV coinfection. There are no data on the efficacy of sofosbuvir in injection drugs users. The pangenotypic activity, the high barrier to resistance, the modest potential for drug–drug interactions makes sofosbuvir a reference drug for the treatment of these two special populations...|$|R

40|$|In Malaysia the {{response}} to illicit drug use has been largely punitive with the current goal of the Malaysian government being to achieve a drug-free society by 2015. This paper outlines {{the results of a}} desk-based situation assessment conducted over a 3 -week period in 2004. Additional events, examined in 2005, were also included to describe more recent policy developments and examine how these came about. Despite punitive drug policy there has been a substantial {{rise in the number of}} drug users in the country. Over two-thirds of HIV/AIDS cases are among injecting drug users (IDUs) and there has been an exponential rise in the number of cases reported. Further, data suggest high risk drug use practices are widespread. Harm reduction initiatives have only recently been introduced in Malaysia. The successful piloting of <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies,</b> in particular methadone and buprenorphine, is cause for genuine hope for the rapid development of such interventions.

40|$|Objective: To use {{the social}} welfare {{function}} {{to decide on}} allocation of resources between smoking cessation methods and lovastatin treatment of hypercholesterolaemia for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease. Method: Three smoking cessation therapies (medical advice, nicotine gum and nicotine patch) were considered in smokers, and lovastatin 20, 40 and 80 mg/day was considered in individuals with hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol > 7. 24 mmol/L [> 270 mg/dL]). Multiple logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} obtain parameter epsilon determining the exact form of the social welfare function in Catalonia, Spain. The preferable strategy was to give higher priority to the intervention that used one smoking cessation method and lovastatin treatment for hypercholesterolaemia and that was associated with a value of epsilon consistent with the social welfare function. Results: A value of 1. 58 (95 % CI: 0. 75 - 2. 84) was obtained for parameter epsilon of the social welfare function, showing a nonutilitarian form. A higher priority should be given, based on the social welfare function, to the intervention using medical advice for smoking cessation and lovastatin 20 - 80 mg/day for hypercholesterolaemia, since this approach was associated with epsilon values of 2. 8 - 2. 9 in men and 1. 8 - 2. 4 in women, while interventions using nicotine <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies</b> were associated with epsilon values ofCost-analysis, Hypercholesterolaemia, Lovastatin, Smoking-cessation-therapies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvidence-based {{strategies}} to guide {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) prevention for people who use substances can be grouped into approaches that lower infectiousness among substance users living with HIV and those that prevent HIV acquisition {{among those who are}} uninfected. Dramatic successes in HIV prevention involving access to antiretroviral <b>therapy,</b> opioid <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies,</b> and needle and syringe exchange programs have reduced both prevalence and incidence in the United States for people who use injection drugs, and modeling studies suggest that scale-up of these approaches will have a parallel impact worldwide. Medical HIV-prevention strategies that reduce infectiousness (“treatment as prevention” or early antiretroviral therapy initiation) and that block HIV acquisition (pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis) can constitute key elements of novel combination HIV-prevention approaches to the goals of reducing infectiousness and reducing acquisition of HIV among people who use substances. For individuals who use substances but do not inject, drug dependence treatments as HIV prevention have a meager evidence base, with most consistent findings being reduction of sexual transmission behaviors that correspond with reductions in substance use, although not with prevention of HIV transmission. This approach may have value, however, when working with groups of substance users who face high rates of HIV prevalence and incidence. Some evidence exists to support HIV prevention interventions that target reduction of sexual risk behaviors in the setting of active stimulant use...|$|R

Krupitsky et al. undertook a [...] "double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised", 24-week trial running [...] "from July 3, 2008 through October 5, 2009" [...] with [...] "250 patients with opioid dependence disorder" [...] at [...] "13 clinical sites in Russia" [...] {{on the use of}} injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence. The study was funded by the Boston-based biotech Alkermes firm which produces and markets naltrexone in the United States. An 2011 article reported that this single trial of naltrexone was performed not by comparing it to the best available, evidence-based treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) but by comparing it with a placebo. In addition, the study failed to follow up on participants to document post-treatment overdose - a key measure for opioid <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies.</b> Furthermore, by 2011, Vivitrol cost about $1,100 a month, compared to $11 a month for generic naltrexone.

40|$|AbstractThe {{successful}} {{development of}} early-stage cartilage and meniscus repair interventions {{in the knee}} requires biomechanical and biotribological understanding of {{the design of the}} therapeutic interventions and their tribological function in the natural joint. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a porcine knee model using a whole joint knee simulator for investigation of the tribological function and biomechanical properties of the natural knee, which could then be used to pre-clinically assess the tribological performance of cartilage and meniscal repair interventions prior to in vivo studies. The tribological performance of standard artificial bearings in terms of anterior–posterior (A/P) shear force was determined in a newly developed six degrees of freedom tribological joint simulator. The porcine knee model was then developed and the tribological properties in terms of shear force measurements were determined for the first time for three levels of biomechanical constraints including A/P constrained, spring force semi-constrained and A/P unconstrained conditions. The shear force measurements showed higher values under the A/P constrained condition (predominantly sliding motion) compared to the A/P unconstrained condition (predominantly rolling motion). This indicated that the shear force simulation model was able to differentiate between tribological behaviours when the femoral and tibial bearing was constrained to slide or/and roll. Therefore, this porcine knee model showed the potential capability to investigate the effect of knee structural, biomechanical and kinematic changes, as well as different cartilage <b>substitution</b> <b>therapies</b> on the tribological function of natural knee joints...|$|R
