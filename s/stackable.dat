5|$|Metroid Primes second full sequel is , which {{closes the}} Prime series. It was {{released}} on August 27, 2007, for the Wii console. In Corruptions story, Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become {{the leader of a}} Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets. Corruptions gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote, and the interchangeable beams are replaced with a <b>stackable</b> upgrade system.|$|E
5|$|The Emeco 1006 (pronounced ten-oh-six), {{also known}} as the Navy chair, is an {{aluminum}} chair manufactured by Emeco. The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became a designer chair used in high-end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the <b>stackable</b> Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E
25|$|Raised {{portion of}} the design along the edge that protects the coin from wear. It also makes the coins <b>stackable</b> and easy to roll by machine.|$|E
25|$|A coin {{with the}} raised design {{high above the}} field. Coins struck in high relief often have {{problems}} with details not coming up sharp enough and dies having a shorter than usual lifespan. If the design {{is higher than the}} rim, the coin may not be <b>stackable,</b> and the highest points of the design will wear away very quickly.|$|E
25|$|Jim Marshall {{then cut}} the massive speaker cabinet into two {{separate}} speaker cabinets, {{at the suggestion}} of Townshend, with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets <b>stackable.</b> The Marshall stack was born, and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.|$|E
25|$|Each {{model was}} sold in <b>stackable</b> red plastic garages, with clear {{removable}} top and sides. The model would slide out of a double hinged opening door to one end. This was {{in place of the}} usual cardboard box. Some Mini-Dinkys were also blister packaged in a dark grey pack (some with garage and some not) with bright yellow lettering (Mini Dinky 2011).|$|E
25|$|Swap body units {{usually have}} the same bottom corner {{fixtures}} as intermodal containers, and often have folding legs under their frame {{so that they can}} be moved between trucks without using a crane. However they frequently don't have the upper corner fittings of ISO containers, and are not <b>stackable,</b> nor can they be lifted and handled by the usual equipment like reach-stackers or straddle-carriers. They are generally more expensive to procure.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} standard for containers {{was established by}} the Bureau International des Containers et du Transport Intermodal (B.I.C.) in 1933, and a second one in 1935, primarily for transport between European countries. American containers at this time were not standardized, and these early containers were not yet <b>stackable</b> – neither in the U.S. nor Europe. In November 1932, the first container terminal {{in the world was}} opened by the Pennsylvania Rail Road Company in Enola, PA. The development of containerization was created in Europe and the US as a way to revitalize rail companies after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, in New York, which resulted in economic collapse and a drop in all modes of transport.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly {{may play}} an {{important}} role here, both from the perspective of encapsulating cells and proteins, as well as creating scaffolds on the right physical scale for engineered tissue constructs and cellular ingrowth. The micromasonry is a prime technology to get cells grown in a lab to assemble into three-dimensional shapes. To break down tissue into single-cell building blocks, researchers have to dissolve the extracellular mortar that normally binds them together. But once that glue is removed, it's quite difficult to get cells to reassemble into the complex structures that make up our natural tissues. While cells aren't easily <b>stackable,</b> building blocks are. So the micromasonry starts with the encapsulation of living cells in polymer cubes. From there, the blocks self-assemble in any shape using templates.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, <b>stackable</b> substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – <b>stackable</b> substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
500|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 88 Emeco chair models. The first designer version of the 1006 chair in the [...] "Emeco by Starck" [...] line was the Hudson chair, named after the Hudson Hotel that put a Hudson chair in every room. It has a similar silhouette as the original 1006, but has a reflective or brushed aluminum surface, a solid backrest and is <b>stackable.</b> It also came in swivel and upholstered versions. The reflective glossy versions of the 1006 chair are polished for eight hours, substantially increasing their cost. There are also Emeco-brand barstools, swivel chairs, rocking chairs and armchairs.|$|E
500|$|An unofficial, full-color {{remake of}} Metroid II, titled AM2R, short for Another Metroid 2 Remake, was {{developed}} by Milton Guasti, under the pseudonym DoctorM64. AM2R updates the game's appearance by drawing upon the visual designs of Super Metroid, and features gameplay modeled after [...] It also includes elements such as a map system, minibosses, <b>stackable</b> beams, and a log system with non-intrusive narrative. After years of development, AM2R was released in August 2016 for Microsoft Windows, coinciding with the thirtieth anniversary of the Metroid series. Shortly after the game's release, the download links on AM2R official website were removed after Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting it, although Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti announced that the game's development has ended after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo. Several journalists have enjoyed AM2R, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of Metroid II.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, {{he created}} the Ant chair for an {{extension}} of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being [...] light, compact and easily <b>stackable.</b> Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|In 1793 Simeon Lowell {{founded a}} likely {{birthplace of the}} banks dory, Lowell's Boat Shop in Amesbury Massachusetts. Lowell's Boat Shop has been {{declared}} a National Historic Landmark. It is now a non profit working museum still dedicated to building classic dories and skiffs. Simeon's grandson, Hiram Lowell developed the Banks Dory. The major innovation was the straight sides to the new Banks Dory. This made the boats <b>stackable</b> on top one another. This revolutionized the fishing industry because now fisherman would stack 10 Dories on a larger boat and use all 10 Dories at once {{in order to maximize}} yield ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a nominal}} length of , two Bicons coupled {{together}} lengthwise match one 20-foot ISO container, but their height is [...] {{shy of the}} more commonly available 10-foot ISO containers of so-called standard height, which are [...] tall. Tricons and Quadcons however have to be coupled transversely— either three or four in a row— to be <b>stackable</b> with twenty foot containers. Their length of [...] corresponds to {{the width of a}} standard 20-foot container, which is why there are forklift pockets at their ends, {{as well as in the}} sides of these boxes, and the doors only have one locking bar each. The smallest of these, the Quadcon, exists in two heights: [...] or [...] Only the first conforms to ISO-668 standard dimensions (size1F).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{closely related}} type is the <b>stackable</b> {{connector}} for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets {{on the opposite}} surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic milk crates. Examples of this include <b>stackable</b> banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the IEEE-488 instrumentation bus. <b>Stackable</b> mezzanine bus connectors are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the Arduino add-on daughterboards called [...] "shields". The older PC/104 embedded PC modules use a similar <b>stackable</b> format for interconnection. <b>Stackable</b> connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stackable</b> switch is {{distinct}} from a standalone switch, which only operates as a single entity. A <b>stackable</b> switch {{is distinct}} from a switch modular chassis.|$|E
5000|$|These {{entry-level}} gigabit Ethernet <b>stackable</b> switches provide enterprise-class desktop features, including PoE/PoE+, and 1 Gbit/s uplink connections. [...] The ERS 3500 {{supports the}} <b>Stackable</b> Chassis and ID Engines technologies.|$|E
50|$|There is not {{universal}} {{agreement as}} to the threshold for being a <b>stackable</b> versus being a standalone switch. Some companies call their switches <b>stackable</b> if they support a single IP address for multiple units even if they lack other features from this list. Some industry analysts have said a product is not a <b>stackable</b> if it lacks one of the above features (e.g., dedicated bandwidth).|$|E
5000|$|Deployment flexibility: <b>Stackable</b> {{switches}} {{can operate}} {{together with other}} <b>stackable</b> switches or can operate independently. Units one day can be combined as a stack in a single site, and later can be run in different locations as independent switches.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "laundry center" [...] is a {{compromise}} between the <b>stackable</b> and the combo configurations. Like the washer dryer combo, the laundry center is a one-piece appliance. Like the <b>stackable</b> configuration, the laundry center comprises two separate machines, the washer and the dryer. In most laundry centers, the dryer is mounted above the washer, making for a one-piece design that offers the compact footprint of a washer dryer combo with the functionality and capacity of <b>stackable</b> washing machines and drying machines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stackable</b> machines, on {{the other}} hand, are defined by two {{separate}} machines, a washer and a dryer, stacked {{on top of one}} another. These <b>stackable</b> machines are often a good choice for large families that still need the full capacity and functionality of a washer and dryer without having to compromise too much regarding space. Most <b>stackable</b> washer and dryer configurations come in the front-loading design as opposed to the top-loading design, which makes it easier to access both the washer and dryer while they are stacked.|$|E
