40|$|As {{software}} systems evolve over {{a series}} of releases, it becomes important to know which components show repeated need for maintenance. Deterioration of a <b>single</b> component <b>manifests</b> itself in repeated and increasing problems that are local to the component. A second type of deterioration is related to interactions between components, that is, components are repeatedly change-prone in their relationships with each other. The latter requires changes to code in multiple components and {{is a sign of}} problems with the software architecture of the system. Software architecture problems are by far more costly to fix and thus it is very desirable to identify potential architectural problems early and to track them across multiple releases. This paper uses Revision Control System (RCS) change history to determine which system parts are the most change-prone, both locally and in their interactions with other parts of the systems. Relationships among system components are identified based on whether they are involved in the same group of changes, and how many lines of code are changed. The resulting change architecture figures show what the system’s most change-prone components and relationships are.

40|$|I {{report a}} {{theoretical}} study of collective coherent quantum-mechanical oscillations in disordered superconducting quantum metamaterials (SQMs), i. e artificially fabricated arrays of interacting qubits (two-levels system). An unavoidable disorder in qubits parameters {{results in a}} substantial spread of qubits frequencies, {{and in the absence}} of electromagnetic interaction between qubits these individual quantum-mechanical oscillations of <b>single</b> qubits <b>manifest</b> themselves by a large number of small resonant drops in the frequency dependent transmission of electromagnetic waves propagating through disordered SQM, D(ω). We show that even a weak electromagnetic interaction between adjacent qubits can overcome the disorder and establish completely or partially synchronized quantum-mechanical dynamic state in the disordered SQM. In such a state a large amount of qubits displays the collective quantum mechanical oscillations, and this collective behavior manifests itself by a few giant resonant drops in the D(ω) dependence. The size of a system r_ 0 showing the collective (synchronized) quantum-mechanical behavior is determined in the one-dimensional SQMs as r_ 0 ≃ a [K/δΔ]^ 2, where K, δΔ, a are the energy of nearest-neighbor interaction, the spread of qubits energy splitting, and the distance between qubits, accordingly. We show that this phenomenon has an origin in the Anderson localization of spinon-type excitations arising in the SQM.

40|$|Abstract Background Brachydactyly type E (BDE; MIM# 113300) is {{characterized}} by shortening of the metacarpal, metatarsal, and often phalangeal bones, and predominantly affects postaxial ray(s) of the limb. BDE may occur as an isolated trait {{or as part of}} a syndrome. Isolated BDE is rare and in the majority of cases the molecular pathogenesis has so far not been resolved. Originally, the molecular cause of isolated BDE has been unravelled in 2 families and shown to result from heterozygous missense mutations in the homeodomain of the HOXD 13 gene. Since the initial manuscript, one further HOXD 13 mutation has been reported only in a <b>single</b> family <b>manifesting</b> isolated BDE. Case Presentation In this paper, we report on a Polish family exhibiting isolated BDE caused by a novel nonsense heterozygous HOXD 13 mutation. We investigated a Polish female proband and her father, both affected by isolated BDE, in whom we identified a nonsense heterozygous mutation c. 820 C > T(p. R 274 X) in the HOXD 13 gene. So far, only two missense HOXD 13 substitutions (p. S 308 C and p. I 314 L), localized within the homeodomain of the HOXD 13 transcription factor, as well as a single nonsense mutation (p. E 181 X) were associated with BDE. Both missense changes were supposed to alter DNA binding affinity of the protein. Conclusion The variant p. R 274 X identified in our proband is the fourth HOXD 13 mutation, and the second truncating (nonsense) mutation, reported to result in typical isolated BDE.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of single {{extensions}} and continuous fatigue on the structures of various natural rubber networks. The change in network structure of a conventional vulcanisate on a <b>single</b> extension <b>manifests</b> itself as permanent set. The change in network structure has been assessed by the use of the chemical probes, propan- 2 -thiol/piperidine, hexane-thiol/piperidine and triphenyl phosphine, which determine the polysulphide and disulphide crosslink densities and main chain modification respectively. The permanent set induced on a single extension of a conventional sulphur vulcanisate has been shown to result from the destruction and reformation of polysulphide crosslinks. The magnitude of the effect was dependent upon the degree of extension and showed a maximum at extensions corresponding to the onset of stress-induced crystallisation. The incorporation of a reinforcing filler, HAF-carbon black, magnified the effect. Vulcanisates that possessed only mono and disulphide crosslinks did not show any significant permanent set. The continuous changes in network structure during fatigue have also been determined, and the effects of carbon black and antioxidants on these changes and the fatigue life have been assessed. During fatigue the overall crosslink density increased slightly, which resulted from the destruction of polysulphide crosslinks. and their replacement by principally disulphide crosslinks. Antioxidants reduced the rate of destruction of polysulphide crosslinks and increased the fatigue life of the rubber network. The fatigue life of the network also depended upon the concentration of free chain ends. These chain ends were incorporated into the network by masticating rubber under nitrogen in the presence of bis (diisopropyl) thiophosphoryl disulphide, which improved the fatigue resistance by up to 9 %...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{correlated}} quantum dynamics {{of a single}} atom, regarded as an open system, with a spatio-temporally localized coupling to a finite bosonic environment. The single atom, initially prepared in a coherent state of low energy, oscillates in a one-dimensional harmonic trap and thereby periodically penetrates an interacting ensemble of $N_A$ bosons, held in a displaced trap. We show that the inter-species energy transfer accelerates with increasing $N_A$ and becomes less complete at the same time. System-environment correlations prove to be significant except for times when the excess energy distribution among the subsystems is highly imbalanced. These correlations result in incoherent energy transfer processes, which accelerate the early energy donation of the single atom and stochastically favour certain energy transfer channels depending on the instantaneous direction of transfer. Concerning the subsystem states, the energy transfer is mediated by non-coherent states of the <b>single</b> atom and <b>manifests</b> itself in singlet and doublet excitations in the finite bosonic environment.
