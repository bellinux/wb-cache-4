40|$|The article {{studies the}} role of <b>supplementary</b> {{communicative}} <b>units</b> functioning as discourse markers in analytical articles and opinion columns of modern Russian and English newspapers. The dependence of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of different <b>supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> {{on the type of}} the article and on the language is discussed. The article proves that the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> in opinion columns in Russian and in English has more common features than in analytical articles. The highest frequency of occurrence of these units is registered in Russian analytical articles, the lowest – in English articles. In Russian newspapers analytical articles and columns demonstrate more similar characteristics than in English materials. <b>Supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> with organizing functions occur more frequently in Russian articles, in English articles and columns they are equally rare. Regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> are used equally often in all analyzed newspaper texts. There is a conclusion that regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> tend to be more universal in their use in the two languages, while organizing units show greater dependence on the language. The presented analysis of the supplementary communicative units’ use can become one of the ways to take an inventory of persuasive language means in media discourse. These units produce a productive influence on the readers, help them interpret the text adequately; enhance their attention and mental activity...|$|R

500|$|When the {{directive}} was revisited during 1977, {{some of the}} older units that were being reviewed (such as millimetre of mercury for blood pressure) were retained but others were phased out, thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI. The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances. It was reissued as directive 80/181/EEC. During subsequent revisions, {{the directive}} has reflected changes in the definition of SI. The directive also formalised the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units,</b> which in 1979 were permitted for a period of ten years.

Data were presented relative to the following areas: (1) statistical analysis of frequency of idea units; (2) statistical analysis of frequency as well as proportion of idea units categorized as literal; inferential, text-relevant supplementary, and text-irrelevant supplementary; (3) statistical analysis of frequency as well as proportion of idea <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> categorized as relating to character, theme, reader reaction, or none; (4) statistical analysis of holistic scores for quality of recall; (5) statistical analysis of correlation of holistic scores to frequency scores. Descriptive data relative to categorization of <b>supplementary</b> idea <b>units</b> relating to character, theme, reader reaction, or none were also reported. Subjects were students enrolled in developmental reading courses at Pima Community College who demonstrated a reading ability of at least ninth grade level on the Nelson Denny Reading Test. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four recall prompts: (1) guided recall prompt which called attention to character, (2) guided recall prompt which called attention to theme, (3) guided recall prompt which called attention to reader reaction, or (4) free recall prompt. Findings indicated that guided recall prompts had effects on the written recalls and that those effects were specific to the respective prompt. Additionally, the responses of readers provided with the guided recall prompts were qualitatively better than those provided with the free recall prompt.

[...] It was the researcher's contention that few materials were readily available on this topic at this grade level. A review of existing materials both print and non-print, confirmed that this was the case. [...] A survey of thirty-five teachers of history in Grade Five was conducted.
