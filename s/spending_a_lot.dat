Wallace persuaded his brother John {{to join him in}} starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath Mechanics' Institute, founded in 1843. William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).|$|E

25|$|Phormia regina was {{described}} by the German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1826. Its specific epithet {{is derived from the}} Latin regina 'queen'. Meigen's career works were mainly involved in the taxonomical aspect of identifying different species of Diptera. <b>Spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time classifying species based on wing ventilation as well as antennae, he discovered this was not sufficient to classify these dipteran species. He then reasoned that species can only identified by combination of characteristics; this technique later became known as the eclectic method.|$|E

25|$|Dan Byrd as Travis Cobb – Jules' and Bobby's son, who is {{a senior}} in high school at the start of the series, then later attends a local college. He loves both of his parents {{although}} he is frequently embarrassed by both of them. In high school, he dealt with humiliation from his friends and classmates but has made friends at college. He is generally supportive of his mother, but finds her parenting style a bit too smothering. After dealing with his mom's real estate ads around town and his dad's new job as his former high school's grass cutter, his father helps him realize not to worry about what other people think. <b>Spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time with his parents and their friends, he often flirts with Laurie and is shown to have a crush on her.

The tour was completed successfully, but the line-up now contained two temporary members, and Lynott was <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time on projects outside Thin Lizzy, including composing and producing material for other bands, as well as putting together his first solo album, Solo in Soho. Lynott also reactivated The Greedy Bastards, who released a one-off Christmas single, [...] "A Merry Jingle", in December 1979 as simply The Greedies. With the group now composed of Lynott, Gorham and Downey with Sex Pistols Jones and Cook, the single reached no. 28 in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The Great Southern Group relied {{significantly}} {{on financial}} planners and accountants recommending their MIS products to investors. The company was paying commissions of ten percent – high by industry standards, and {{similar to those}} paid by other failed investment businesses including Westpoint Corporation and Storm Financial. It was also <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money on recruiting financial advisers to sell its products. One report indicated that A$137 million was spent on [...] "commissions, marketing and promotion in two years to 2008". Some accountants, with Great Southern's support, were recommending the agribusiness investment schemes, though {{they did not have}} a financial services licence; one report suggested over half of Great Southern's MIS sales were coming through accountants, often tax specialists from small practices. These practices had been questioned for several years by the corporate regulator ASIC and some market analysts, and were widely criticised following Great Southern's collapse. Some experts were critical of the lack of knowledge and expertise of the investment advisers recommending agroforestry MIS schemes.|$|E

500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of time on the}} road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was {{released}} on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've been hearing about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before. And shooting it, you know, <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time on what ended up being maybe like a second and a half, couple seconds, of screen time." [...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|E
500|$|Zur {{typically}} {{is brought}} in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more [...] "flexible" [...] process. He finds that it is [...] "crucial" [...] for him {{to play a game}} before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music [...] "intuitively", rather than <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects {{that he would like to}} work on in the future that he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the essay, Carr says that his recent {{difficulties}} with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time on the Internet. He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation. He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 University College London study titled [...] "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future" [...] which suggests the emergence of new types of reading. He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages. Carr raises the point that unlike speech, which is an innate ability hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words. He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies. Carr further draws on Wolf's work, particularly her 2007 book Proust and the Squid, to relate his argument {{to the way in which}} neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and alphabet-based scripts. Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' first Hamburg {{residency}} {{took place}} in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon's aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money on a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as [...] "a gangster's moll", and was often unpleasant towards her. The Beatles went to Hamburg {{for a second time}} in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney's girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother's house. After the trip to Hamburg, Powell's mother Lillian said Powell's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new-born baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. To pay the rent, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool, after her student grant had run out. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). from his aunt Mater who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams.|$|E
