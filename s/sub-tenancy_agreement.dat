Under common law, the landlord was not liable; the Act changes this. Section 4(1) provides that, when a tenant is occupying the premises {{in such a way}} as to impose an obligation on the landlord to maintain the property, the same duty that the landlord owes to the tenant is extended to anybody whose goods may be on the property [...] "from time to time". Where premises are occupied under a <b>sub-tenancy</b> <b>agreement,</b> the same obligation extends to the tenant leasing the property. Section 4 was repealed by Section 6(4) of the Defective Premises Act 1972.|$|E

After over-spending, Kingstonian entered {{administration}} and lost the Kingsmeadow lease in October 2001. It was assigned in April 2002 by the administrators to property developers. AFC Wimbledon were Kingsmeadow sub-tenants before buying the lease in June 2003, making it their “home” until their move to Wimbledon was feasible. Kingstonian secured a 25-year <b>sub-tenancy</b> <b>agreement,</b> with customary break clauses. The clubs operated a ground-sharing arrangement, with Kingstonian receiving cheap rental terms. In 2015 AFC Wimbledon agreed plans to sell Kingsmeadow to Chelsea in order to help finance their plans to move back to a new stadium in Wimbledon. Chelsea have stated that they wish to use the ground for their own youth and ladies' teams and are unwilling to accommodate Kingstonian at Kingsmeadow. On 22 February 2017, Kingstonian announced that they will be sharing Leatherhead F.C.'s ground at Fetcham Grove for the 2017–18 season.|$|E
