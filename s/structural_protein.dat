5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|Noroviruses {{contain a}} linear, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome of {{approximately}} 7.5 kbp, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7) by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).|$|E

25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Microvirinae {{have four}} structural proteins: major capsid protein F, major spike protein G, a small DNA-binding protein J (25 - 40 amino acids in length) and DNA pilot protein H. Assembly of the viron uses two scaffolding proteins, internal scaffolding protein B and external scaffolding protein D. Protein H is a multifunctional <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. The genomes are between 5.3 and 6.2 kilobases (kb) in length.|$|E
25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a <b>structural</b> <b>protein,</b> defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development. The carriers of the high-risk genes have a tenfold increased risk of myopia.|$|E

25|$|Titin {{is a large}} {{abundant}} protein of striated muscle. Titin's primary {{functions are}} to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the sarcomere, and to recoil the sarcomere like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half {{the length of a}} sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{approximately}} one hundred genes whose brain expression is increased {{during periods of}} sleep have been found. A similar number of genes were found to promote gene expression during wakefulness. These sets of genes are related to different functional groups which may promote different cellular processes. The genes expressed during wakefulness may perform numerous duties including energy allocation, synaptic excitatory neurotransmission, high transcriptional activity and synaptic potentiation in learning of new information. There was a sleep related increase in processes that involve the synthesis and maintenance of the synapse. Such processes include membrane trafficking, synaptic vesicle recycling, myelin <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> formation, and cholesterol and protein synthesis. In a different study {{it was found that}} there was a sleep related increase in calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV that has been specifically involved in synaptic depression and in the consolidation of long-term memory. These findings encourage an association between sleep and different aspects of neural plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E

However, Rev is needed to export incompletely spliced mRNAs {{in order to produce}} the viral <b>structural</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Densonucleosis virus cannot {{code for}} its four <b>structural</b> <b>proteins</b> if {{each of them}} has a unique sequence. The {{objective}} of the present investigation, therefore, was to establish whether: (i) the viral genome contains overlapping genes; (ii) the virus incorporates host proteins; or (iii) one of the <b>structural</b> <b>proteins</b> is a dimer. Two independent methods were employed for this purpose. First, the viral proteins, solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate, were purified after dansylation and were analyzed by peptide mapping, using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for a comparative analysis of the viral proteins solubilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate. It was demonstrated with both techniques that densonucleosis virus has four unique <b>structural</b> <b>proteins,</b> all with extensive sequence homologies. Moreover, all <b>structural</b> <b>proteins</b> contained intraprotein, but no interprotein, disulfide linkages. These results indicated similarities between densonucleosis virus {{and representatives of the}} two other genera of the Parvoviridae...|$|R
25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B {{seems to be}} to lower the amount of protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and is responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a phosphodiester bond between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is mutated. Protein A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X viral DNA in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the viral DNA in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the burst size of the virus.|$|E
500|$|The {{inner ear}} houses the {{apparatus}} necessary {{to change the}} vibrations transmitted {{from the outside world}} via the middle ear into signals passed along the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain. The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid, and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells. The microscopic [...] "hairs" [...] of these cells are <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> filaments that project out into the fluid. The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated. Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti. The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium-rich endolymph. This causes the cell to depolarise, and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|After the unbound probes are washed away, {{the western}} blot {{is ready for}} {{detection}} of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest.

Size approximations are taken by comparing the stained bands {{to that of the}} marker or ladder loaded during electrophoresis. The process is commonly repeated for a <b>structural</b> <b>protein,</b> such as actin or tubulin, that should not change between samples. The amount of target protein is normalized to the <b>structural</b> <b>protein</b> to control between groups. A superior strategy is the normalization to the total protein visualized with trichloroethanol or epicocconone. This practice ensures correction for the amount of total protein on the membrane in case of errors or incomplete transfers. (see western blot normalization) ...|$|E

[...] Being an RNA virus, FCV has a high elasticity of its genome, which makes it more adaptable to environmental pressures. [...] This not only makes the development of vaccines more difficult, but also allows for the development of more virulent strains.
