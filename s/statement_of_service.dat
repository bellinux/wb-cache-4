40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{reports on}} the results of a case study {{investigating}} the response of New Zealand schools to the legislative requirement to prepare service performance reports. To date, the ongoing failure to successfully establish service performance reporting in schools suggests further research is warranted. Prime facie, it was expected that schools would find the output and outcome distinction underlying the Ministry of Education’s procedural guidelines difficult to apply. However, the case study findings support this expectation to a surprising extent. Schools do not apply the output/outcome distinction to their choice of objectives because they include only activities that are easy to measure in their <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> performance. Objectives are then designed to fit these activities. In this sense, schools adopt a historical and arbitrary methodology to service performance reporting whilst government policy assumes a forward looking and purposeful approach. The research findings also suggest that schools do not prepare <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> performance in the way intended by the reporting framework because they question its applicability and relevance. Participants expressed concerns with the language used in service performance reporting because it is informed by terminology which they perceive to be associated with commercial enterprises. Schools felt this model was incongruous with the educational environment. Overall, the research suggests that schools are not prepared to devote sufficient time and resources to developing adequate reports <b>of</b> <b>service</b> performance. If, as appears to be case, “service performance reports are [expected to be] forged in the field, by the public entities required to produce them” (Thompson, 1995, p. 337) then service performance reporting in the school sector seems destined to remain a controversial and problematic issue for both the schools and the New Zealand government...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how a major public benefit entity in New Zealand uses formal {{accountability}} mechanisms and informal reporting to justify its existence. The paper is premised on the view that the accountability relationship for public benefit entities is broader and more complex than the traditional shareholder-manager relationship in the private sector. Design/methodology/approach – This longitudinal single case study of the Department of Conservation (DOC) spans the period from its establishment in 1987 to June 2006. It involves the detailed examination of the narrative disclosures contained in the annual reports, including the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> Performance, over the period of the study. A number of controversial items that appeared in the printed media between 1 April 1987 and 30 June 2006 were traced through the annual reports to establish whether DOC used impression management techniques in its annual reports to gain, maintain and repair its organisational legitimacy. Findings – The analysis found that the annual report of a public benefit entity could play an important legitimising role. Using legitimacy theory, it is argued that assertive and defensive impression management techniques were used by DOC to gain, maintain and repair its organisational legitimacy in the light of extensive negative media publicity. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to examine the relationship between narrative disclosures in annual reports and legitimacy in the public sector. The paper provides a valuable contribution to researchers and practitioners as it extends the understanding of how public benefit entities can make use of the narrative portions of the annual report when pursuing organisational legitimacy.

40|$|Human {{resource}} costs {{comprise a}} significant proportion of New Zealand government departments' operating expenditure, thus, reporting on these resources is important. Yet, to date, a practical alternative to the monetary valuation and reporting of human resources has still to be found. This thesis examines the usefulness and practicality of reporting non-monetary human resource information in government departments' statements of service performance. The examination was conducted through a mail questionnaire sent to all 39 government departments, with a response rate of 87 % (34 questionnaires out of 39 sent) being achieved. Personal interviews were then conducted with two of the respondents. The majority (84 %) of government department financial controllers believed it was necessary to report non-monetary human resource information. A <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> performance (SSP) received 61 % support as the method of disclosure, followed by a statement of resources (48 %), a separate human resource report (45 %), and a chief executive's report (42 %). There was considerable support for the disclosure in the SSP of several items of human resource information as either inputs, outputs or outcomes. A number of costs and benefits were also identified by respondents as resulting from the disclosure of human resource information in the SSP. However, when comparing the overall costs and benefits, the majority of respondents did not expect such reporting to be cost effective. These results indicate that, although there is support in theory for reporting non-monetary human resource information in government departments' SSPs, further research is necessary to determine the practicality of such reporting. The results of this thesis have extended the literature concerning disclosure of human resource information. Many costs and benefits associated with the provision of monetary human resource information have been found to apply to the reporting of non-monetary human resource information. Furthermore, many of the non-monetary human resource measures suggested for the private sector were found to be applicable to public sector organisations, specifically New Zealand government departments...|$|E

The CRIMSON trial aims to determine if JCPs, compared with treatment as usual, are effective in reducing the use of the MHA in a range of treatment settings across the UK. Methods/Design This is a 3 centre, individual-level, single-blind, randomised controlled trial of the JCP compared with treatment as usual for people with a history of relapsing psychotic illness in Birmingham, London and Lancashire/Manchester. 540 service users will be recruited across the three sites. Eligible service users will be adults with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (including bipolar disorder), treated in the community under the Care Programme Approach with at least one admission to a psychiatric inpatient ward in the previous two years. Current inpatients and those subject to a community treatment order will be excluded to avoid any potential perceived pressure to participate. Research assessments will be conducted at baseline and 18 months. Following the baseline assessment, eligible service users will be randomly allocated to either develop a Joint Crisis Plan or continue with treatment as usual. Outcome will be assessed at 18 months with assessors blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the proportion of service users treated or otherwise detained under an order of the Mental Health Act (MHA) during the follow-up period, compared across randomisation groups. Secondary outcomes include overall costs, service user engagement, perceived coercion and therapeutic relationships. Sub-analyses will explore the effectiveness of the JCP in reducing use of the MHA specifically for Black Caribbean and Black African service users (combined). Qualitative investigations with staff and service users will explore the acceptability of the JCPs.

40|$|The {{provision}} of statements of service performance (SSPs) by local government in New Zealand {{is a product}} of the economic reforms carried out in the late 1980 s. A <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> performance is regarded as an important document of New Zealand local government reporting. It is statutorily required by the Local Government Act 2002 and complemented by accounting guidance provided by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA), with the objective of strengthening accountability obligations (Local Government Act 2002, s. 98; NZICA, 2002). In spite of twenty years‟ experience in preparing statements of service performance, the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) (2008) criticised that the quality of SSPs prepared by local authorities (and other public-sector entities) was poor. A fundamental problem of statements of service performance reporting is the lack of comprehensive authoritative requirements on their preparation and presentation (Office of the Auditor-General, 2008). Arguably, the present authoritative requirements have been written to cater for the needs of large, profit-oriented entities in the private-sector rather than for the public-sector‟s specific needs for performance reporting and pitched at a higher or more conceptual level than is typically required for financial reporting standards (Office of the Auditor-General, 2008, Webster, 2007). This may be due to the fact that the current authoritative requirements, developed in early 1990 s, have been influenced by the economic framework highlighting the decision-usefulness purpose of private-sector reporting, which is not suitable for public-sector reporting (Mack, 2003; Parker & Gould, 1999). Responding to the need for more adequate guidance for non-financial performance reporting of public-sector entities, the OAG and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) are working on improving accounting guidance applicable for the preparation for SSP reporting by public-sector entities (Office of the Auditor-General, 2010; International Public Sector Accounting Standard Board, 2010). Pallot (1992) points out that accountability is the preferred purpose for public-sector reporting since the nature of the relationship between providers and users of government is non-voluntary. Past theoretical literature has attempted to define the possible components of accountability that would be suitable for public-sector entities to adequately discharge their accountability. Among them, Stewart (1984) has developed accountability bases, which provide a platform for understanding accountability expectations and, hence desirable characteristics of any accountability documents provided by public-sector entities for the public. It is possible that accountability documents pertaining to these accountability expectations will enable the public-sector entities to adequately discharge their accountability. New Zealand local government is the important second tier of New Zealand government sector. Among the wide range of community services provided by New Zealand local authorities, wastewater services represent one of the most crucial services. New Zealand constituents could be expected to be concerned not only about the performance of wastewater services provided by their local authorities, but also with the disclosures about that performance. However, the research on SSP wastewater disclosures by New Zealand local authorities is limited (Smith & Coy, 2000). Given the criticism on the usefulness of authoritative requirements for SSP reporting and the recognition of accountability expectations by the literature, the first two objectives of this study are to examine the consistency of SSP disclosures, regarding wastewater services provided by New Zealand local authorities, with the existing authoritative requirements, and the accountability expectations, using the disclosure index as a measurement tool. To understand possible explanations for the cross-sectional differences on the extent of disclosures, according to the authoritative requirements and accountability expectations, the third objective of this study is to examine the influential factors of the disclosures, using multiple regression analysis. The study finds that the performance disclosures made by the local authorities have low levels of correspondence with the index that is based on the authoritative requirements. The result also provides evidence that the current authoritative requirements are focused on financial information reporting and pitched at a high conceptual level. This supports the view that the existing authoritative pronouncements are not providing sufficient guidance for local authorities. The index based on accountability expectations has relatively greater correspondence with the disclosures made. This identifies that local authorities are providing information consistent with accountability expectations. The study suggests that accountability expectations provide a model suitable for SSP reporting guidance. According to the multiple regression analysis, the result shows that only size is significantly related to the extent of the disclosures. Larger local authorities report more corresponding information. The findings of this study provide three immediate implications which should be useful to: (i) accounting standard-setters for their current work on improving accounting guidance for SSP reporting; (ii) the Office of the Auditor-General for providing more insightful comments in the audit statement for SSP reporting; and (iii) regulators for increased attention on some special local authorities. By doing so, it is expected that New Zealand local authorities may lead the world in providing comprehensive SSPs, which enable them to adequately discharge their accountability and, hence in reaching a reform principle for greater accountability...|$|E

40|$|AbstractService-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) provide {{methods and}} {{technologies}} for modelling, programming and deploying software applications that can run over globally available network infrastructures. Current software engineering technologies for SOAs, however, {{remain at the}} descriptive level and lack rigorous foundations enabling formal analysis of service-oriented models and software. To support automated verification <b>of</b> <b>service</b> properties by relying on mathematically founded techniques, we have developed a software tool that we called Venus (Verification ENvironment for UML models <b>of</b> <b>Services).</b> Our tool takes as an input service models specified by UML  2. 0 activity diagrams according to the UML 4 SOA profile, while its theoretical bases are the process calculus COWS and the temporal logic SocL. A key feature of Venus is that it provides access to verification functionalities also to those users not familiar with formal methods. Indeed, the tool works by first automatically translating UML 4 SOA models and natural language <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> properties into, respectively, COWS terms and SocL formulae, and then by automatically model checking the formulae over the COWS terms. In this paper we present the tool, its architecture and its enabling technologies by also illustrating the verification of a classical ‘travel agency’ scenario...|$|R

40|$|Identifying the {{adequate}} {{level of}} financial viability {{refers to the}} most vital economic issues, since inadequate financial viability can result in the lack of resources for development, insolvency and bankruptcy of the company, but the surplus viability can impede development burdening the company with excessive reserves. The authors suggest introducing the concept of marginal values of financial viability indicators. In the course of research authors analyzed financial <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> enterprises <b>of</b> Riga’s region for the period 2003 - 2008 and assessed actual, as well as marginal values of financial viability indicators, evaluated overall financial viability level of these enterprises for this period, analyzed deviation between actual and marginal values. The results were compared to actual bankruptcy tendency of Latvian companies, which verified objectivity of suggested methodology of financial viability indicators’ analysis. Suggested approach to determining lower and upper marginal values of company’s financial viability indicators {{can be considered as}} an effective tool for controlling company’s solvency level, estimating the risk of bankruptcy and choosing best possible alternatives for running economic activities in line with sustainable development...|$|R
