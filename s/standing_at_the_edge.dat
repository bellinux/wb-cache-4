500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists {{in the air to}} yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1867 Roebling started {{design work}} {{on what is}} now called the Brooklyn Bridge, {{spanning}} the East River in New York. On June 28, 1869 at Fulton Ferry, while he was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a dock, working on fixing the location where the bridge would be built, his foot was crushed by an arriving ferry. His injured toes were amputated. He refused further medical treatment and wanted to cure his foot by [...] "water therapy" [...] (continuous pouring of water over the wound). His condition deteriorated. He died on July 22, 1869 of tetanus at the home of his son on Hicks Street, in Brooklyn Heights. It was just 24 days after the accident. Roebling is buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

60|$|Princess Ozma {{considered}} the situation gravely. Then she tied her handkerchief to her wand and, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water's <b>edge,</b> waved <b>the</b> handkerchief like a flag, as a signal. For a time they could observe no response.|$|R

60|$|She was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water's <b>edge</b> when Jimmy came up. Her {{back was}} turned. She was rocking {{with her foot}} a Canadian canoe that lay {{alongside}} the bank. She started as he spoke. His feet on the soft turf had made no sound.|$|R
60|$|Porportuk nodded, and untied {{the mouths}} of the sacks. El-Soo, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bank, tore the papers to shreds and sent them {{fluttering}} out over the Yukon. The weighing began, but halted.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked back}} over his {{shoulder}} at the world they had left. The last of the Dreevers had rounded the clump of laurels, and was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the water, gazing perplexedly after the retreating canoe.|$|E
60|$|He {{was just}} {{dragging}} {{the last of}} the wood up to the fire when a sudden yelping broke upon his ears. Looking up, he saw a lone wolf <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the timber, gazing fixedly at him.|$|E

50|$|The Cullercoats Fish Lass {{became a}} popular subject {{for many of}} the Cullercoats Artist Colony, most notably Winslow Homer.

60|$|Mr. Vyner, slept on. Gulls mewed overhead; a {{rattle of}} cranes sounded from the quays, and a conversation—mostly in hoarse roars—took {{place between the}} {{boatswain}} in the bows and an elderly man ashore, but he remained undisturbed. Then he sprang up so suddenly that he nearly knocked his chair over, and the captain, turning his head after him in amaze, saw Joan Hartley <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the quay.|$|E
6000|$|I strolled {{into the}} pine-wood. The earth there was covered like a bee's body {{with black and}} gold stripes; there was the blue sea below, and white, sleepy clouds, and bumble-bees booming above the heather; it was all softness, a summer's day in Devon. Suddenly I came on Pearse <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the cliff with Pasiance sitting in a little hollow below, looking up at him. I heard him say: ...|$|E

50|$|Anzac Memorial Avenue is {{important}} for its association with Thomas Rothwell and the Royal Automobile Club Queensland (RACQ), an organisation that has made a major contribution {{to the development of}} motoring in Queensland.

5000|$|After {{promotion}} {{had completed}} on his previous record <b>Standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sky's <b>Edge,</b> Hawley {{worked on the}} soundtrack for the film Love is All. Hawley wrote much of the album while recovering from a broken leg and slipped disc. Hawley referred to the song [...] "Sometimes I Feel" [...] as a turning point during the album's sessions. Much of what {{ended up on the}} album are the raw demos, which Hawley says helped keep the record small.|$|R
60|$|From {{the spot}} where they were now <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the ravine the ground sloped very steeply up for some {{hundreds}} of feet, and then steep crags rose in an unbroken wall; but from the view they had had of the country {{from the other side}} they knew that behind this wall rose a range of lofty summits. The Indian trail ran along close {{to the edge of the}} ravine. The chief looked round earnestly.|$|E
60|$|The {{speakers}} were <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of {{the water}} in front of the Palace of St. Mark. In the piazza behind them a throng of people were walking to and fro, gossiping over the latest news from Constantinople, the last rumour as to the doings of the hated rival of Venice, Genoa, or the purport of the letter which had, as everyone knew, been brought by the Bishop of Treviso from the pope to the seignory.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the pit}} {{that the}} Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the common.|$|E
6000|$|Somewhere {{near the}} middle of the forenoon, as we were jogging along, I saw a deer <b>standing</b> just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> road and looking across it, as if in fear of its blazing publicity. It seemed for a moment as if he were an optical illusion, so beautiful, so shapely, and so palpitant was he. I had no desire to shoot him, but, turning to Burton, called in a low voice, [...] "See that deer." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{coming on}} to the little level, he saw two figures of men <b>standing</b> silent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water's <b>edge.</b> His heart leaped. They were fishing. He turned {{and put his hand}} up warningly to Clara. She hesitated, buttoned her coat. The two went on together.|$|R

I don't know nothing about p'isoning, though I dare say Mr. Twentyman does. But if a hound comes on my land, I'll shoot him,--open, before you all." [...] There was, however, no danger of such a threat being {{executed}} on this day, as of course no hound would be allowed to go into Dillsborough Wood.|$|R
