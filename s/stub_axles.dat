5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
25|$|The main {{undercarriage}} was a robust split-axle construction with the legs joining the wings {{at the bottom}} of the X-form centre-section struts. Braced <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> carried the arrester claws required by the longitudinal arrester wires of Royal Navy aircraft carriers up to 1926. The undercarriage assembly was designed so that it could be easily removed with the aircraft on trestles, and replaced with a pair of aluminium single-step, V-bottomed round-topped floats. These carried water rudders for manoeuvring afloat.|$|E
2500|$|In 1883 Starbucks {{supplied}} {{a further}} two single deck cars, {{similar to the}} original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the [...] "toast-rack" [...] design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 {{and in the same}} year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is one of}} the {{two front}} axles that carries a wheel in a rear wheel drive vehicle. The axle is capable of limited angular {{movement}} about the kingpin for steering the vehicle. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> consists of wheel bearings which support the wheel hub.|$|R

50|$|In 1909 H.F.S. Morgan {{introduced}} a fundamentally similar system using a sliding <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{on a fixed}} pillar, used first on Morgan Motor Company cyclecars, then on their cars up to the current time. The Morgan design is an inverted sliding pillar, as are most of the later designs; the pillar {{is attached to the}} chassis and the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is carried by the sliding sleeve over this.|$|R
2500|$|The Harrow {{had to have}} a clear space {{below the}} {{fuselage}} to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the front spar at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. [...] These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1920s the {{carriage}} was upgraded; first to Mk 1R (solid rubber tyres) then to Mks 1P or 1PA (new wheels, axles, brakes and pneumatic tyres) for vehicle towing. [...] The Mk 1P was a British conversion which involved {{cutting off the}} ends of the axle and fitting a new axle beneath {{the carriage}} which utilized 9.00 X 16 tyres. The Mk 1PA was the American Martin-Parry (Buquor) conversion in which 'drop down' <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> were fitted, secured by means of sleeves fitted over {{the ends of the}} original axles. These had larger 7.50 X 24 tyres. [...] The No. 26 artillery trailer was similarly converted. Unlike most other guns and howitzers in British service, calibrating Probert sights were not fitted to the 4.5-inch howitzer.|$|E
50|$|Some {{trailers}} {{support a}} normal axle on two sides, others mount the wheel off one {{side with a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (a one sided axle).|$|R
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|R
50|$|The Week-End had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with each mainwheel {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{provided}} with a torsional shock absorber. Each axle was at the convergence of three struts from the lower fuselage. There was a small tailskid.|$|R
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
50|$|Hamster {{wheels are}} {{exercise}} devices. Most {{of these devices}} consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel {{moves forward}} as it rises, {{can also be}} poor for impact {{harshness}} (this can be negated by designing the beam with the mounts higher than the <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> which impacts on the floorpan height, and causes more roll oversteer) ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is named}} so because it resembles {{the shape of}} a stub, like a {{truncated}} end of an axle, short in shape and blunt.There are four following method those are1. Elliot strub axle2. Reversed elliot3. Lemoine4. Lemoine inverted ...|$|R
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (for knock-off wheels) or a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 Earle MacPherson {{patented}} the MacPherson strut {{for use on}} the Chevrolet Cadet. [...] This was {{the first}} true strut suspension for cars: the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout's Scarab.|$|R

5000|$|Hamster wheels or [...] {{running wheel}} are {{exercise}} devices used primarily by hamsters and other rodents, {{but also by}} other cursorial animals when given the opportunity. Most of these devices consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined. The earliest dated {{use of the term}} [...] "hamster wheel", located by the Oxford English Dictionary, is in a 1949 newspaper advertisement.|$|E
2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body. The block's vertical movement was controlled by coil springs. The front suspension was upgraded with a hydraulic shock absorber ...|$|R
50|$|The D.480 had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with a {{track of}} 2.80 m. Each mainwheel was {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> at the vertex of a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage longeron, with a near-vertical sprung leg, with an oleo strut shock absorber, to the wing spar. The tailwheel was on a long, hinged leg close to the rear fuselage with a short, vertical shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The Peitz had a {{tail skid}} {{undercarriage}} with each wheel on a steel <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> hinged on a V-strut {{from the lower}} fuselage and with a short vertical elastic shock absorber leg to the forward wing strut This junction was strengthened by extra struts to the forward fuselage and {{to the top of}} the forward, vertical cabane strut and by another long strut outwards {{to the top of the}} rear wing spar.|$|R
50|$|The axle passes {{beneath the}} loadbed {{of the cart}} but was cranked upwards at each side. This allows the load to be carried low, for {{stability}} and ease of loading with heavy objects such as churns or barrels. The high position of the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> allow large wheels, giving a smooth ride. The box body is open at the rear, {{with no more than}} a chain across for safety. Rather than a driving seat or box, they are driven from a standing position, alongside the load. Floats were drawn by a single horse or, especially in Ireland, a donkey.|$|E
5000|$|In 1883 Starbucks {{supplied}} {{a further}} two single deck cars, {{similar to the}} original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the [...] "toast-rack" [...] design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 {{and in the same}} year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker.|$|E
50|$|The smooth, oval section {{fuselage}} was ply {{and fabric}} covered, tapering towards the tail. The pilot sat low {{down in a}} small open cockpit with narrow streamlined dorsal fairings in front and behind. His view forward was severely restricted by the central inline bank of four cylinders of the W-12 Lorraine-Dietrich 12E water-cooled piston engine. The engine was cooled by radiators in the wings, assisted for the first flight by a bank of radiators mounted between the undercarriage legs. These backward leaning legs were wide chord, faired cantilevers with large, unfaired wheels mounted on individual <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> The V.1's conventional undercarriage was completed by a small tailskid.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long radius arm running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the upper wishbone.|$|R
50|$|A sliding pillar {{suspension}} {{is a form}} {{of independent}} front suspension for light cars. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and wheel assembly are attached to a vertical pillar or kingpin which slides up and down through a bush or bushes which are attached to the vehicle chassis, usually as part of transverse outrigger assemblies, sometimes resembling a traditional beam axle, although fixed rigidly to the chassis. Steering movement is provided by allowing this same sliding pillar to also rotate.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.61a had a conventional, fixed {{undercarriage}} with double-tyred mainwheels {{under the}} outer engines. Each wheel was hinged on a V-strut from the fuselage {{side and a}} narrow V drag strut from the aft spar to the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> ends. A vertical, shock absorbing strut joined the axle to the forward spar. There were tailskids {{at the ends of}} the booms and a large nosewheel, half buried in the fuselage below the gunner, in case of nose-overs.|$|R
50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly mounted axle beam in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|E
50|$|H-drive {{was first}} {{developed}} by Hub van Doorne of the Dutch truck maker DAF. It was a derivative of their Trado conversion {{to produce a}} 6×4 off-road truck from a commercial 4×2 chassis. The Trado used a bogie rear suspension for both sets of rear wheels. This suspension, best known through the Scammell Pioneer of 1927, uses a single central axle, or driveshaft, that in turn drives two walking beams (balanceur, in Dutch) one on each side. The wheels are supported by overhung <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> The conversion added the walking beams {{to the ends of}} the original truck beam axle. From that point, the drive between the axles of each side was separated side by side.|$|E
50|$|This {{principle}} of divided drive already being {{established for the}} front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output.|$|E
5000|$|Murray and {{his brother}} Ray Murray were put out of {{contention}} {{when one of the}} [...] "Grey Ghost"'s <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and its king pin broke, but he was able {{to get back on the}} road with a loss of only 70 points thanks to fellow-competitor Robert Whan, who allowed Murray to cannibalize his own car, which had crashed into a tree.He lost 69 further points when he took a wrong turn after Mt Isa, and ended up at the Mary Kathleen uranium fields.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R
50|$|Sliding pillar {{independent}} suspension {{was first used}} by Decauville in 1898, the first recorded instance of independent front suspension on a motor vehicle. In this system, the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> carrying the wheel was fixed {{to the bottom of}} a pillar which slid up and down through a bush in a transverse axle fixed {{to the front of the}} chassis. The top of the pillar was fixed and pivoted on a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring. This system was copied by Sizaire-Naudin a few years later.|$|R
