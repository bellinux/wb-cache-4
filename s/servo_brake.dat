50|$|The final {{model used}} a Röhr chassis with {{independent}} suspension all round. At the front a {{transverse leaf spring}} was used. <b>Servo</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted. The eight-cylinder engine was also by Röhr, but the six was probably a Continental unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} years saw the radiator grille painted black (rather than grey). In 1976, the 101L replaced the De Luxe model, featuring new bumpers with rubber trim, flat-folding seat backs, chrome-trimmed radiator grille, reverse light, electric windshield-washer pump, coolant-temperature gauge, cigarette lighter and <b>servo</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

The EJ had Duo <b>Servo</b> <b>brakes,</b> strengthened front suspension, safety belt anchorages.|$|R

Seating four it had two 40 inch doors.A high-line Regal model available on all bodies was introduced in 1928. Priced at a 12 per cent premium it came with a sliding roof, bumpers (buffers) front and rear, safety glass, vacuum <b>servo</b> <b>braking,</b> two spare wheels and special mats.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{price of}} $6000-$7250 for the S1, the Excalibur SII went up to $12,000 -$13,000 but {{justified}} that extra cost with its supplementary equipment. This included air conditioning, variable ratio power steering, adjustable steering column, <b>servoed</b> <b>brakes,</b> [...] "Positraction" [...] differential, chromed wire wheels, stereo radio, two spare tires mounted in the front fenders, driving lamps, air horns and constant level rear shock absorbers.|$|R
500|$|By 1939, all {{the major}} car makers were using unassisted {{hydraulic}} brakes; Ford {{was the last to}} switch from cable-manipulated systems. [...] Power-assisted Vacuum <b>servo</b> <b>brakes</b> had been invented in 1903, but did not become generally available as an option until the 1950s. Self-adjusting brakes initially were offered on the 1957 Mercury and 1958 Edsel, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. Buick offered power brakes as standard equipment on several of its vehicles by the 1954 model year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sporting}} Levin {{was originally}} only available with the twin-cam engine; in late 1973 this {{was joined by}} the somewhat cheaper and less powerful [...] "Levin J", with the SOHC 2T-B engine. Levin production levels were around 5000 per year. In addition {{to a variety of}} other performance upgrades, the Levin has fender extensions and a quicker steering rack than other Corollas, while the Twin Cam versions lack <b>servo</b> <b>brakes</b> so as to make for a sportier feel for the driver.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> <b>braking</b> pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|R
50|$|Features {{that in one}} decade were {{considered}} luxury items (for example, power steering, power (<b>servo</b> assisted) <b>brakes,</b> air conditioning, electric windows) would in later decades be viewed as appropriate as standard equipment even in economy models.|$|R
50|$|Small vacuum motors {{were also}} used to operate {{windscreen}} wipers in automobiles. In this case, the motors were powered by manifold vacuum. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the vacuum <b>servo.</b> <b>Brakes</b> are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors {{were also used}} from the late 1960s to control servomechanisms such as door locks, heater controls or movable bonnet ventilation flaps.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Carbodies (who {{had been}} {{producing}} the FX4 for Austin and Mann & Overton) {{took over the}} cab's intellectual property rights when BL (Austin's parent company) lost interest in it; Carbodies thereafter produced it under their own name. The old Austin engine was no longer available because, during Michael Edwardes' reconstruction of British Leyland, the plant had been sold to India. Carbodies selected the Land Rover 2286 cc diesel engine in its place and also offered the similar-sized Land Rover petrol engine as an option. The new model was branded the FX4R, with R standing for Rover. The FX4R had some improvements over the previous FX4 models, including power steering and full <b>servo</b> <b>brakes,</b> but its performance and reliability were poor and the cab gained a bad reputation.|$|R
5000|$|The Renault 24cv models PI and PZ were {{produced}} as 1927 and 1928 models only. The cars {{were made to}} distributor order and as sales were very low production was small. Both featured the new three spring rear suspension that provided much improved roadholding and handling. The 6-cylinder motor (85 x 140) was also uprated to [...] and a four-speed gearbox fitted. Other running gear, including the <b>servo</b> <b>brakes</b> were identical to the 40cv which had the 110 x 160 motor. This was the last model year of the 6-cylinder large cars. [...] The PI were the open cars on short and long chassis. PZ were closed cars on long or very long chassis. All were available with two side-mounted spare wheels or the signature dual rear-mounted wheels to emphasize the long bonnet.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{production}} was suspended in 1978 while the braking problems {{were resolved by}} some engineering changes including removing the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|R

50|$|All designs {{consist of}} two main {{components:}} the mechanical {{arm and the}} control system. These are typically interconnected by one or two large multi-conductor cables.
