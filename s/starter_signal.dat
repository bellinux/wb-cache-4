5000|$|A three-arched red brick-faced viaduct {{crossed the}} River Cairn {{just below the}} station. Electrically {{controlled}} home and <b>starter</b> <b>signals</b> were present for both directions and a telephone system was provided for communication between stations. In about 1936 the London Midland and Scottish Railway removed the original signals and the line was worked by a brass Key Token Trains, however replacement signals were provided to control the passing loop.|$|R
50|$|Trains {{change from}} AC to DC {{traction}} supply, {{or vice versa}} whilst standing at Drayton Park station. The platform <b>starter</b> <b>signal</b> on the Up platform at Drayton Park is held at danger (red) as the train approaches. This ensures that all trains stop and drop the pantograph before entering the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|After torrential {{overnight}} rain on June 19, 2007 {{areas of}} the railway near Highley collapsed in landslides. Highley Up <b>Starter</b> <b>signal</b> and the embankment it stood on were washed away. After repair the line between Northwood Halt and Bridgnorth was restored for passenger use and the first public train was on Friday 21 March 2008.|$|E

50|$|Elsewhere, Tanygrisiau {{had been}} {{provided}} with a run-round loop whilst {{it had been the}} terminus between June 1978 and May 1982. This loop was removed when the line was reopened to Blaenau Ffestiniog. In the mid-1990s, a project was launched to install a fully signalled passing loop. This proceeded as a volunteer project, including the building of a signal box. However, prior to commissioning, the project was abandoned in 2001. The trackwork (apart for the siding off the Up Loop) remained in situ. In June 2002, the loop was once again used to run trains around as part of the 2002 Gala to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of services to Blaenau Ffestiniog. The intended platform <b>starter</b> <b>signals</b> (posts, brackets and arms) have been recovered and some are now in use on the Isle of Man Railway, whilst others are destined for the resignalling of Harbour Station. In 2004, with new disc <b>starter</b> <b>signals</b> and spring-loaded points installed, Tanygrisiau became a passing loop for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the collapse of the Federation of the West Indies (and with it the Federal Supreme Court), which had lasted a mere four years, from 1958 to 1962, the Anglophone continental and insular Caribbean states formed the CARIFTA (the Caribbean Free Trade Association), with a view to maintaining an economic link among the various former and continuing colonies of the United Kingdom {{after the collapse of the}} political bond. On 1 August 1973, the successor to the CARIFTA, the Caribbean Community, better known by its acronym, CARICOM, came into being. The founding document of the CARICOM, the Treaty of Chaguaramas, was signed by the so-called [...] "Big Four" [...] states: Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago, all of which had gained their political independence from the UK during the 1960s. This signing was the <b>starter’s</b> <b>signal</b> for a more mature, though at times slow and halting, process of regional integration among the states of the Commonwealth Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Blanks are {{commonly}} used when the sound and flash of gunfire is needed, but a projectile would not be safe, such as in military training maneuvers or funeral honors, in movies that require gun fights, in <b>starter</b> pistols to <b>signal</b> the beginning of races and in the equestrian sport of cowboy mounted shooting.|$|R
50|$|The {{signal wiring}} {{engineer}} had secured and reconnected all wires {{between the various}} circuit breakers in the cabin. However, one wire, which linked circuit breaker number 8 to circuit breaker number 9 had {{been put on the}} wrong terminal of circuit breaker number 9, thereby causing signal EH9, the eastbound <b>starter</b> <b>signal,</b> to clear too soon, with a train held at automatic signal number 823.|$|E
50|$|The halt {{closed in}} 1915 as a wartime economy, but {{remained}} intact {{until at least}} 1931. The remains were cleared by the Southern Railway in preparation for reopening and electrification of the line in 1935. An up <b>starter</b> <b>signal</b> for Selsdon on a post made of old rails was subsequently installed {{on the site of}} the Up platform, and during the Second World War a tank trap was built {{on the site of the}} Down platform.|$|E

50|$|The {{competition}} has also doubled as the Italian Marathon championships on two occasions; in 1983 and 1986. The race date was {{shifted from the}} traditional March schedule to 1 January in 2000 for {{a special edition of}} the event to celebrate the beginning of the new millennium. The IAAF Rome Millennium Marathon received the support of Primo Nebiolo and national federation president Gianni Gola. The race start point was at Saint Peter's Square and Pope John Paul II delivered a short benediction in approval of the event and the Bells of Saint Peter's replaced the usual <b>starter's</b> pistol to <b>signal</b> the beginning of the race.|$|R
5000|$|A second {{station was}} opened in Bedford in 1857 on the Midland Railway's [...] to [...] line. The route {{chosen by the}} Midland took it across the earlier line at a point near the Bletchley end of the triangle, and a level {{crossing}} was built. In March 1875, a Midland passenger train collided with the rear coaches of a Bedford service, killing one passenger and injuring four others. The subsequent enquiry identified a badly-positioned Bedford <b>starter</b> <b>signal</b> as {{a major cause of}} the accident. To remedy the problem a 29-lever signal box was opened in 1877 to control new interlocked signals, and block signalling was introduced throughout the Bedford line, which had been extended to Cambridge.|$|E
5000|$|Hampton Loade {{signal box}} {{controls}} three points, two distant signals, three starter signals, three home signals, {{and a set}} of catch points with related [...] "Dummy" [...] signal. Two of the points are located {{at either end of the}} station, controlling the exits to the loop, the third set of points controls the entrance to the siding, and are protected by the [...] "Dummy" [...] signal and its catch points. There are starter signals on the end of the down and up platforms, as well as an extra <b>starter</b> <b>signal</b> on the Brignorth end of the up platform which permits down trains starting at Hampton Loade to be despatched from the up platform. The home signals are located just before the loop entrance points that they protect, in the up direction a bracket carries two homes controlling entrance to the loop and main line, in the down direction a single home controls entry to the main line. In both directions working distant signals protect the homes.|$|E
40|$|Neurons innervating {{peripheral}} tissues display complex {{responses to}} peripheral nerve injury. These include the activation and suppression {{of a variety}} of signalling pathways that together influence regenerative growth and result in more or less successful functional recovery. However, these responses can be offset by pathological consequences including neuropathic pain. Calcium signalling {{plays a major role in}} the different steps occurring after nerve damage. As part of our studies to unravel the roles of injury-induced molecular changes in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons during their regeneration, we show that the calcium calmodulin kinase CaMK 1 a is markedly induced in mouse DRG neurons in several models of mechanical peripheral nerve injury, but not by inflammation. Intrathecal injection of NRTN or GDNF significantly prevents the post-traumatic induction of CaMK 1 a suggesting that interruption of target derived factors might be a <b>starter</b> <b>signal</b> in this de novo induction. Inhibition of CaMK signalling in injured DRG neurons by pharmacological means or treatment with CaMK 1 a siRNA resulted in decreased velocity of neurite growth in vitro. Altogether, the results suggest that CaMK 1 a induction is part of the intrinsic regenerative response of DRG neurons to peripheral nerve injury, and is thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention to improve peripheral nerve regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to discuss the {{response}} time of different diving techniques for goalkeepers. A total of 6 subjects from college soccer teams were analyzed in this study. A self-designed flash unit was used as a <b>starter</b> <b>signal,</b> and a high-speed camera and a synchronized force plate were used to record the data. The data was digitized by Peak Motus 4. 2. The results showed that in a type A take-off dive, the response time was faster for dives to the bottom left and bottom right corners. In a type B take-off dive, the response time was faster for dives to the bottom left, bottom right and upper left corners. Knowledge of the different response times for the different diving directions could be of benefit in training for coaches and players. KEY WORDS: soccer, penalty kick, response time INTRODUCTION: Jumping is a basic ability in human movement. Coutts divided jumping into two types: First is the Hop jump, where both legs leave the ground simultaneously at take-off. The other is the Step-Close jump, where one leg leaves the ground first followed by the other leg. The goalkeeper when diving often uses similar take-off jumping techniques. Different take-off jumping techniques could result in different response times, and this i...|$|E
