50|$|The {{first sign}} of HSAN2 is usually {{numbness}} in the hands and feet. Soon after, affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. People with HSAN2 often develop open sores (ulcers) {{on their hands and}} feet. Because affected individuals cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek treatment right away. Without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may lead to amputation of the affected area. Unintentional self-injury is common in people with HSAN2, typically by biting the tongue, lips, or fingers. These injuries may lead to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> of the affected areas. Affected individuals often have injuries and fractures in their hands, feet, limbs, and joints that go untreated because of the inability to feel pain. Repeated injury can lead to a condition called Charcot joints, in which the bones and tissue surrounding joints are destroyed.|$|E
40|$|An eight week old baby {{presented}} with a deep constriction round {{the base of the}} third right toe, of one day’s duration. A strand of filamentous material was found and uncoiled from the depths of the cleft which subsequently healed within a week. Recurrence in the same digit four weeks later raised the question of factitious disease. Pseudoainhum refers to a constricting band around a digit or limb, congenital or acquired. It must be distinguished from true ainhum, where a painful, idiopathic constriction of the fifth toe in dark-skinned adults results in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> of the digit...|$|E
40|$|Ainhum, {{also known}} as dactylolysis spontanea, is a painful {{constriction}} of {{the base of the}} fifth toe, frequently followed by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> a few years later. The disease is often symmetrical on both the feet, but, occasionally, other toes are also affected and rarely the distal phalanx of the fifth finger. Pseudoainhum is a similar condition that occurs as a secondary event resulting from certain hereditary and nonhereditary diseases that lead to annular constriction of digits. We hereby present a case of familial ainhum in father and son with multiple toes affected, autoamputation, and more involvement of fourth toe than the fifth toe, which is a very rare finding...|$|E
5000|$|Autoamputation is the <b>spontaneous</b> {{detachment}} (<b>amputation)</b> of an appendage {{from the}} body. This {{is not to}} be confused with self-amputation. It is usually due to destruction of the blood vessels feeding an extremity such as the finger tips. Once the vessels are destroyed, the tissue is starved of oxygen and dies, which is often followed by gangrene.Autoamputation is a feature of ainhum, cryoglobulinemia [...] and thromboangiitis obliterans.|$|R

40|$|Vohwinkel {{syndrome}} or hereditary mutilating keratodermatitis i a rare condition producing palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis and constricting {{rings of}} the fingers and toes which can progress to compromise neurovascular function and mobility. Medical treatment with oral retinol derivatives is recommended when its use is not contra-indicated. This paper describes surgical correction of the constricting rings on both hands in a 33 -year-old woman affected by this condition. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B.

" 338 341 Hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles with starfish-shaped projections on the dorsal aspects of hands and feet in a young mother and her 2 -year-old child was described by Vohwinkel in 1929. This skin disorder starts in early childhood. In ado-lescence or young adult life it is often complicated by keratotic onstrictions (pseudo-ainhum) of fingers and toes, which may lead to <b>spontaneous</b> digital <b>amputation.</b> Other clinical signs are sometimes seen, such as ichthyos-iform skin changes, knuckle pads, cicatricial alopecia, nail anomalies, high-tone acoustic impairment or deaf-mutism (Chang Sing Pang et al, 1981).

40|$|Chatcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is {{also known}} as peroneal muscular atrophy and {{hereditary}} motor-sensory neuropathy (HMSN). It is the most commonly encountered inherited peripheral neuropathy. Actually, CMT is not a single disease, but is a group of disorders with similar symptoms. CMT type 2 is the second most common form after CMT type 1. Symptoms usually begin in childhood or early adulthood. Mostly the peripheral nerves of the lower extremities and occasionaly upper extremities may be affected. Motor nerve involvoment induces distal muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower extremities that may result in foot deformities known as foot drop, pes cavus, pes planus, hammer toe etc. As a result of sensorial nevre degeneration, callus, recurrent foot ulcers, osteonecrosis, osteolysis and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> may accompany the disease. The speed of nerve conduction is not changed in the EMG, but axonal type sensorymotor semptoms that lead to a decrease of amplitude. We report here a 55 year old man with recurrent foot ulcers for 33 years and self amputations, whose EMG findings suggest acsonal neuropathy and who also has a 20 year - old son with similar complaints...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} primary ichthyosis (ARPI) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous skin disease. Several loci {{of responsible}} genes have been identified, including 14 q 11, which controls transglutaminase- 1 expression, and 2 q 33 – 35. Clinical, biochemical, and histological evidence exists separating ARPI into two distinct diseases: lamellar ichthyosis (LI; the severe phenotype) and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE, the milder phenotype). The estimated incidence is 1 : 200 000 to 300 000 live births. Affected babies are called ‘collodion babies,’ {{because they are}} embedded in an inelastic membrane that dries soon after birth. Within 2 weeks the collodion membrane spontaneously sheds and the skin develops plate-like scales covering the entire body. In LI the scales are dark, large, polygonal, and tightly adherent and give a typical lifelong disfiguring appearance. Histopathologically, there is marked hyperkeratosis and a prominent granular layer. LI is a retention disorder, with normal epidermal turnover. Pseudoainhum is an affection characterized {{by the appearance of}} a constricting band around a digit, which may lead to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> (dactylolysis). This lesion has been observed in vascular, neurological, and skin disorders. Pseudoainhum is very rarely found in patients with LI. We report herein the eye changes in a patient with LI and toe pseudoainhum. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{efficacy}} of a single 60 min application of capsaicin 8 % patch in reducing chronic amputation stump and phantom limb pain, associated hypersensitivity with quantitative sensory testing, and changes in brain cortical maps using functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Methods: A capsaicin 8 % patch (Qutenza) treatment study was conducted on 14 patients with single limb amputation, who reported pain intensity on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale ≥ 4 / 10 for chronic stump or phantom limb pain. Pain assessments, quantitative sensory testing, and fMRI (for the lip pursing task) were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after application of capsaicin 8 % patch to the amputation stump. The shift into the hand representation area of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task has been correlated with phantom limb pain intensity in previous studies, and was the fMRI clinical model for cortical plasticity used in this study. Results: The mean reduction in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>amputation</b> stump pain, phantom limb pain, and evoked stump pain were − 1. 007 (p= 0. 028), − 1. 414 (p= 0. 018), and − 2. 029 (p= 0. 007), respectively. The areas of brush allodynia and pinprick hypersensitivity in the amputation stump showed marked decreases: − 165 cm 2, − 80 % (p= 0. 001) and − 132 cm 2, − 72 % (p= 0. 001), respectively. fMRI analyses provided objective evidence of the restoration of the brain map, that is, reversal of the shift into the hand representation of the cerebral cortex with the lip pursing task (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that capsaicin 8 % patch treatment leads to significant reduction in chronic pain and, particularly, in the area of stump hypersensitivity, which may enable patients to wear prostheses, thereby improving mobility and rehabilitation. Phantom limb pain (“central” pain) and associated brain plasticity may be modulated by peripheral inputs, as they can be ameliorated by the peripherally restricted effect of the capsaicin 8 % patch...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine multiple risk factors and correlated malignant neoplasms of blackfoot disease (BFD), a unique peripheral vascular disease related to continuous exposure to high-arsenic artesian well water. A total of 241 BFD cases, Including 169 with <b>spontaneous</b> or surgical <b>amputations</b> of affected extremities, and 759 age-sex-resldence-matched healthy community controls were studied to explore the risk factors of BFD. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that artesian well water consumption, arsenic poisoning, familial history of BFD, and undernourishment were significantly associated with the development of BFD. The life-table method used to analyze cancer mortality of 789 BFD patients followed for 15 years showed a significantly higher mortality from cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, and cancers of bladder, skin, lung, and liver among BFD patients as compared with the general population In Taiwan or residents In the BFD-endemic area.

40|$|Introduction: Olmsted {{syndrome}} (OS) {{is a rare}} congenital {{skin disorder}} presenting {{with a combination of}} hyperkeratotic lesions and palmoplantar keratoderma severe enough to result in <b>spontaneous</b> digit <b>amputation.</b> It is often associated with infections of the keratotic area. A recent study identified de novo mutations causing constitutive activation of TRPV 3 as a cause of the keratotic manifestations of OS. Objective: This study was aimed at exploring the immunological component of Olmsted syndrome. Methods: Genetic, clinical and immunological profiling was performed on a case study patient with the clinical diagnosis of OS. Genetic assessment of the case was performed by exome sequencing and common polymorphisms were filtered out. Confirmation and frequency testing of candidate mutation was performed via Sequenom using iPLEX technology on a MALDI-TOF based MassARRAY Compact Analyzer (Sequenom Inc., CA, USA). Multi-color flow cytometry was used to profile the peripheral immune system after staining for specific surface and intracellular cell markers. All major cell types and their subsets from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were considered including B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells subsets. Results: The sequencing results revealed the OS patient to harbor a previously undescribed 1718 G-C transversion in TRPV 3, causing a G 573 A mutation. Detailed clinical and immunological analysis identified indicators suggestive of immune dysregulation: frequent dermal infections, inflammatory infiltrate in the affected skin, hyper IgE production and elevated follicular T cells and eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Conclusion: The presence of systemic phenotype of hyper IgE and persistent eosinophilia provides strong evidence for the involvement of immunological processes in the pathogenesis of OS. Being the first comprehensive assessment of the immunological features of OS, the results have important clinical consequences with regard to the treatment of OS patients. status: publishe...|$|R
