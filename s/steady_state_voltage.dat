Little control, however, is expected over the time duration of the discharge, which is likely to depend on the actual spark-gap conditions (size and pollution) at the moment of the discharge. The RC circuit generator can allow the user to obtain short time durations of the discharges more easily than the pulse-controlled generator, although this advantage is diminishing with the development of new electronic components.

A non-linear optimization problem is then formulated and the required metal line width changes that reduce the first time step voltage drops by a sufficient amount are then determined.

40|$|Introduction A {{prerequisite}} for a solid engineering design of resonant converters [1 - 3] {{is a good}} model that describes their operation in the {{time as well as}} in the frequency domain. Two basic approaches have been used hitherto, to develop such models. One approach applies analytical relationships to derive the expressions that describe the behavior of a given converter in the various domains [4]. A second approach developed by Steigerwald [5] uses the first harmonics approximation and the R ac concept. By this, the converter is described as a simple resonant network with a load dependent damping (or quality) factor which can then be examined by basic (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> network equations. The limitation of the second approach is the difficultly of applying it to more than just the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> (DC) <b>voltage</b> ratio relationships.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the impact of electric vehicle battery charging on grid demand at a national level and on the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> parameters of distribution networks. An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric vehicles according to electric vehicle owner preferences, distribution network technical limits and electricity prices was designed and developed and its operation was tested experimentally. The impact on grid demand peak increases at the national systems of Great Britain and Spain was evaluated using low and high electric vehicle uptake levels of 7 % and 48. 5 % of the car fleet for the year 2030 with a deterministic method. It was found that a low uptake will not raise significantly the grid demand peaks in both countries under investigation. However, a high uptake will raise significantly the grid demand peaks. The impact from residential electric vehicle battery charging on <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>voltages,</b> power line losses, transformers’ and cables’ loadings of distribution networks was evaluated using a deterministic and a probabilistic method. It was found that low and medium uptake levels of electric vehicles equivalent to 12. 5 % and 33 % per residential area of 384 customers in 2030, can be safely accommodated by reinforcing the distribution network. A combination of reinforcements, installation of microgenerators and control of electric vehicle battery charging {{will be required to}} accommodate safely a high uptake of 71 % with regards to the constraints studied. An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric vehicles was designed and developed. Search techniques and neural networks were used for the decision making processes.
