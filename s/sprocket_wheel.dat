500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel,</b> was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "bedstead" [...] was {{a system}} of pulleys around which two {{continuous}} loops of tape were driven in synchrony. Initially this was {{by means of a}} pair of <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> on a common axle. This was changed to drive by friction pulleys with the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> maintaining the synchrony when it was found that this caused less damage to the tapes. Speeds of up to 2000 characters per second were achieved for shorter tapes, but only 1000 for longer tapes. The tapes were guided past an array of photo-electric cells where the characters and other signals were read. Possible tape lengths on the bedstead were from 2000 to 11,000 characters.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Red Star {{was put on}} the run between Sicamous, British Columbia and Enderby, British Columbia. However, {{she drew}} too much water, so R. P. Rithet had a flat-bottomed, scow-shaped {{stern-wheeler}} of light draft built, where he placed Red Star's machinery. The machinery was not suitable for a stern-wheeler, so the paddle wheel had to be driven with a chain and <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel.</b> and to overcome the difficulty the paddle wheel was driven with a chain and <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel.</b> This vessel became known as Red Star No. 2 and thus, the original Red Star's long and varied career ended.|$|E
50|$|During {{continuous}} contact printing, the {{raw stock}} {{and the negative}} are placed next to one another around the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the raw stock has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|E
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the film {{transport}} mechanisms of movie projectors and movie cameras. In this case, the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> engage film perforations in the film stock. Sprocket feed was also used for punched tape and is used for paper feed to some computer printers.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the twelve}} years of {{collaboration}} between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of internal combustion engines were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine, constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of air and hydrogen or an illuminating gas shot a piston upwards thereby creating a vacuum in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to {{the action of the}} atmospheric pressure, it turned a toothed rod connected to a <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The M56 was a fully {{tracked vehicle}} with rubber-tired run-flat road wheels and front drive <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels.</b> It was {{powered by a}} Continental A01-403-5 {{gasoline}} engine developing [...] at 3,000 rpm, allowing a maximum road speed of 28 mph and a maximum range of 140 mi. Twenty-nine rounds of main gun ammunition were carried, and only the blast shield was armored.|$|R
5000|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism must {{be employed}} in concert with a rotating shutter which blocks light transmittance during {{the motion of the}} film and allows light through while the film is held in place usually by one or more registration pins. The intermittent mechanism can be accomplished in many ways, but most often, it is done with <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels,</b> claws, or pins coupled to the camera or projector drive mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts, {{from this}} {{experience}} of the War Office competition, had the vision to design a vehicle for the British Army which {{would be able to}} traverse unstable ground. Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where [...] two pitched chains of links and pins with cross bars and blocks of metal and wood to make contact with the ground are passed around the front and rear <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels,</b> one {{on each side of the}} vehicle and form a track. The weight of the vehicle body (and engine) is taken by side brackets provided with curved pathways or bearing surfaces resting on rollers which, in turn, are supported on the chains, or on rollers of large diameter revolving on fixed pins. With this arrangement, when the vehicle is running the body is, so to say, rolled forward on the chains. Steering may be accomplished by varying the speed of the driving <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> on either side of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the film}} {{cassette}} engages the rewind fork at the top, {{and it is}} {{held in place by}} a hinged retaining ring at the bottom. The film lead passes under the fixed black film-pressure plate {{on its way to the}} slotted large diameter take-up spool. The spool always rotates the same angular amount to advance the film without a <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> drive. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} proved troublesome {{from the}} start. A motor failed {{and ran away}} with a car in tow, before derailing wrecking at Pius Street near St. Michael's Church. At {{least one of the}} injured passengers suffered wounds which were initially considered possibly fatal. The line had not as yet been formally accepted from the Daft and Company firm which had been involved in its construction, and engineers from that company laid the incident at failure to lower the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> to the rack system when the motor failed. Additionally, the route's terrain made its operation fragile: Snow was known to put it out of operation.|$|E
50|$|William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a Scottish {{inventor}} {{and employee}} of Thomas Edison, designed the Kinetographic Camera in 1891.

In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, idler and drive <b>sprockets,</b> <b>wheels,</b> winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|R

50|$|Rewinding {{the film}} into its {{cassette}} {{is accomplished by}} first pulling the wind-on knob to its raised position followed by turning the left-hand top mounted rewind-knob clock-wise; this {{is accompanied by a}} rattling noise. It is not possible to raise the wind-on knob if it is not free to rotate, it is freed by turning the knob clock-wise while depressing the double exposure prevention button. The frame counter dial rotates during rewind as long as the film passes the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> drum. The wind gears, which is visible inside the machined steel film chamber. All internal metal parts are either plated steel or brass. The film pressure-plate is chrome-plated polished steel, while the other parts are nickel-plated.|$|E
50|$|Data were {{represented}} by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with twenty-four rows. A row of smaller sprocket holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel.</b> Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the least significant bits, when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
5000|$|The Motor Wheel had a 2 {{cycle engine}} which {{produced}} 1HP {{and had two}} flywheel magnetos, bronze bearings and a float feed carburetor.

5000|$|The {{original}} scenario {{was titled}} Ursignol, and {{was approved by}} Diaghilev {{in the autumn of}} 1925. [...] It appears however that {{over the next two years}} the story-line was changed, against Yakulov's wishes, as Diaghilev made preparations for the first production. [...] The original scenario was rooted in scenes of Soviet life, of which Yakulov had experience (but the émigrés Prokofiev and Diaghilev did not), involving speculators, sailors and workers, and with scenes in a station, a market and a factory, centered on life in the early Soviet Union. The factory scene features machines and <b>sprocketed</b> <b>wheels</b> as the setting for a danced romance between a sailor and a young girl worker.|$|R
5000|$|A pair of {{propellers}} at {{the rear}} provided propulsion. One problem presented by the Sherman was that {{the configuration of the}} transmission (gearbox at the front) made it impossible to take a drive-shaft directly from the gearbox to the propellers. The solution to this was to have <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> {{at the rear}} of the tank so power was delivered to the propellers by the tank's tracks. DD Tanks could swim at up to [...] Both the commander and the driver could steer in the water, although with different methods. A hydraulic system under the control of the driver could swivel the propellers; the commander from a platform {{at the rear of the}} turret, where he could see over the skirt, could contribute by operating a large tiller.|$|R
50|$|With the {{manufacturing}} of new high power LEDs, came pulsed LED/triggered three CCD camera systems. Flashing the LED light source {{for a very}} short time span gives the full frame CCD camera a stop action of the film, allowing continuous film motion. With CCD video cameras that have a trigger input, the camera now can be electronically synced up to the film transport framing. There are now a number of retail and home made Pulsed LED/triggered camera systems. An array of high-power multiple red, green and blue LEDs is pulsed just as the film frame is positioned in front of the optical lens. The camera sends the single, non-interlaced image of the film frame to a digital frame store, where the electronic picture is clocked out at the selected TV frame rate for PAL or NTSC or other standard. More advanced systems replace the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> with laser or camera based perf detection and image stabilization system.|$|E

Having already traveled throughout the US, Canada and Europe, the band visited Japan for performances with Husking Bee and <b>Sprocket</b> <b>Wheel</b> in July 1997. Although Bracket had been issuing vinyl on Fat Wreck Chords since 1994, their first studio album for the label didn't transpire until the September 1997 release of Novelty Forever, co-produced by Ryan Greene and Fat Mike at Motor Studios in San Francisco.

The New York Sun described what the club women saw in the [...] "small pine box" [...] they encountered:In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as Dickson Greeting. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a [...] "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an [...] "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, [...] "I have been able to take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." [...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film projection system that was apparently abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions.

As the rack was cast with the edge rails in use, this cannot have been an attractive adaptation. It may have been for that reason that it was not until 1817 that Bentinck arranged to acquire a steam locomotive from George Stephenson. It was a six-wheel design of Killingworth type; the first and last axles were driven by pistons in two vertical cylinders set in the boiler top, and a chain drive working on central <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> connected all three axles. Photographs of an excellent model, considered to be accurate, are shown in the South Ayrshire Libraries history blog.|$|R
