40|$|Full flat slabs can be {{enhanced}} by using spherical voids to replace the unemployed concrete from the core part of the slab. Therefore we get low self-weighted slabs that can reach a high range of spans, a low material consumption compared to classical solutions used so far. On the other hand, the upsides of these slabs pale against the insecurity in design stage about their punching and shear force behaviour. In this paper it is presented a parametric study about shear force behaviour of flat slabs with spherical voids used in <b>standard</b> <b>condition</b> <b>service.</b> The study was made using the Atena 3 D finit element design software, starting form a numerical model gauged on experimental results on real models – scale 1 : 1. Based on these lab results, the model’s validation was made by overlapping the load – displacement experimental curves on the curves yielded from numerical analyses. The results indicate that under a longitudinal reinforcement rate of lower than 0. 50...|$|R

40|$|The DoD Space Test Program (STP), the Air Force Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), and United Launch Alliance (ULA) are {{teaming up}} {{to provide a}} {{rideshare}} service to small satellites (3 ̆c 400 lb) using an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). This rideshare service is an opportunity on EELV missions with margin to carry auxiliary payloads (APLs). This paper will define the ESPA, the <b>standard</b> rideshare <b>service</b> provided to APLs, and how APLs can access this service. We will discuss the roles and responsibilities the different government organizations, ULA, and the small satellite provider have in accessing and implementing ESPA <b>Standard</b> <b>Service.</b> In brief, ULA builds the EELV and performs the launch service, LRSW is responsible for developing and acquiring EELVs from ULA, and STP is responsible for identifying and manifesting APLs that meet ESPA <b>Standard</b> <b>Service</b> requirements. We will further define the processes and procedures required to implement ESPA <b>Standard</b> <b>Service</b> to include: how a particular EELV mission is selected to host ESPA <b>Standard</b> <b>Service,</b> the selection process for auxiliary satellites to utilize the capability, the requirements and timelines small satellites must meet to qualify, and the scope of services provided by ULA as part of <b>Standard</b> <b>Service...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{large number}} of people on {{sickness}} and disability benefits due to mental disorders in Denmark has increased the need for improved rehabilitative services to facilitate their return to work. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the use of psychoeducation in relation to the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of a Danish job centre for individuals on sick leave with regard to relevance, elements contributing to recovery, and improvements of psychoeducation as an intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 individuals on sick leave who were at risk of having a mental disorder. The interviews were analysed using systematic text condensation inspired by Giorgi’s phenomenological analysis. The resulting core themes describing psychoeducation with respect to the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job centre included access and relevance of psychoeducation in relation to the job centre’s <b>standard</b> <b>services,</b> social support, self-care, and psychoeducation intervention. This study concludes that the informants consider psychoeducation a relevant offer to individuals on sick leave who are at risk of having a mental disorder. The relevance of the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job-centre services was considered to be low. Furthermore, psychoeducation reinforces peer support and inclusion of relatives as elements to aid recovery to a much larger extent than do the <b>standard</b> <b>services</b> of the job centre. In general, the results support the use of psychoeducation in a municipal job-centre setting as a targeted and beneficial offer to individuals on sick leave who are at risk of having a mental disorder. </p...|$|R
