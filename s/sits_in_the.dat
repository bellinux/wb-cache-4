50|$|As {{members of}} the Irish peerage, the Lords Baltimore were not {{entitled}} to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English House of Lords -- because they were entitled to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> separate Irish House of Lords. Irish peerages were often used {{as a way of}} creating peerages which did not grant a seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British House of Lords and so allowed <b>the</b> grantee to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons in London. As a consequence, many Irish peers had little or no connection to Ireland.|$|R
