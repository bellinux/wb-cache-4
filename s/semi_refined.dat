40|$|Pearl millet is an underutilized grain crop {{commonly}} used as whole flour for traditional food preparation and hence confined to traditional consumers and {{to people of}} lower economic strata. In this study two commercially available pearl millet varieties (Kalukombu & MRB) obtained from the local market were milled into whole flour, <b>semi</b> <b>refined</b> flour & bran rich fraction. These milling fractions were evaluated for nutrients, antinutrients and mineral bioaccessibility. The bran rich fraction, a by product of flour milling contained significantly (P[*]≤[*] 0. 05) higher ash content (3. 3 & 3. 5 g/ 100 g in K & MRB respectively). Minerals like phosphorus, calcium and antinutrients like oxalates, phytates, were found mainly distributed in the bran fraction. The nutrient content of semi-refined flour was comparable to whole flour except for the fat content (1. 3 %). Due to partial separation of the bran fraction, <b>semi</b> <b>refined</b> flour was low in antinutrients which improved its mineral bioaccessibility making it nutritionally superior...|$|E
40|$|From the {{nutritional}} point of view, data on dietary fiber content, tannin and in vitro protein digestibility of processed millet is of importance, because millets are never eaten raw. Effects of commonly used traditional methods on dietary fiber, tannin content and %IVPD of two locally available pearl millet varieties (Kalukombu and Maharashtra Rabi Bajra) were investigated. The millet {{was subjected to}} various processing methods like milling (whole flour, <b>semi</b> <b>refined</b> flour and bran rich fraction) roasting, boiling, pressure cooking & germination resp. Processing {{had little effect on}} the total dietary fiber (TDF) content in both varieties; however the bran rich fraction showed highest TDF content of around 29 %. Tannins effectively lowered upon boiling and pressure cooking resp., but significantly increased (P â‰¥ 0. 05) upon germination. Although the % IVPD of the millet (45. 5 - 49. 3 g/ 100 g) was low, it significantly increased upon milling (bran rich fraction), roasting and germination resp...|$|E

Yellowish-white, are {{to form a}} gel that {{was instrumental in the}} food industry and medicine, which is a stabilizer, thickening agents and emulsifiers. Edible films made ​​from hydrocolloid has the mechanical properties are good, but the texture is fragile and therefore need the addition of plasticizer which serves to increase elasticity, reduce the risk of rupture, tears and destruction of the edible film is formed. Sorbitol is one effective plasticizer used because it can increase the elasticity of the film. This study aims to determine the influence of starch concentration of SRC and sorbitol concentration on the characteristics of edible films produced, determine the best treatment combination between SRC and flour concentration of sorbitol concentration so that the resulting edible film with good quality.

40|$|Phytoestrogens are plant-derived dietary {{compounds}} with structural {{similarity to}} 17 -β-oestradiol (E 2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E 2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti) oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors. The {{aim of the}} present review is to present a state-of-the-art overview of the potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens. Various beneficial health effects have been ascribed to phytoestrogens, such as a lowered risk of menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and osteoporosis, lowered risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, brain function disorders, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bowel cancer and other cancers. In contrast to these beneficial health claims, the (anti) oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens have also raised concerns since they might act as endocrine disruptors, indicating a potential to cause adverse health effects. The literature overview {{presented in this paper}} illustrates that several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks. Furthermore, the data currently available are not sufficient to support a more <b>refined</b> (<b>semi)</b> quantitative risk-benefit analysis. This implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made...|$|R

40|$|Kappaphycus alvarezii or {{commonly}} known Euchema cottonii {{is a good}} source of kappa-carrageenan and can be found cultivated in the coastal areas of Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia. Carrageenans have many applications and are utilized in human food and pet-food industry. Carrageenans are also utilized in non-food industry such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, printing and textile formulations. Currently, the Southeast Asian region is producing <b>semi</b> <b>refined</b> carrageenan (SRC). There are various works in producing SRC; however, there are limited efforts to develop the optimization of cooking process parameters. Hence, the present study features on the cooking process (alkaline treatment) where the parameters (concentration of potassium hydroxide solution, cooking time and cooking temperature) and the ranges are identified experimentally. The effects of these parameters on carrageenan quality such as gel viscosity and gel strength were studied. The optimization of cooking process parameters and the experimental design was conducted based on the Central Composite Design (CCD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The experimental result showed that gel viscosity increases with the decrease of cooking time, cooking temperature and potassium hydroxide (KOH) concentration (% w/w). In contrast, gel strength increases as cooking time, cooking temperature and KOH concentration (% w/w) increases. From the optimization, the best conditions for alkaline treatment found were cooking temperature 80  °C, cooking time 30  min and KOH concentration 10 (% w/w) which are similar to current practice in industry...|$|E
