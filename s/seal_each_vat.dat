40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate several forms of equations for predicting Cheddar cheese yields based on the fat and protein content of milk and moisture content of cheese. Production and quality control data from a Cheddar cheese plant for one entire year was used. This included the pounds of milk that went into <b>each</b> <b>vat</b> of cheese, yield of cheese from <b>each</b> <b>vat,</b> cheese moisture from <b>each</b> <b>vat,</b> and fat and protein percentages of the milk. Seven models were derived to predict the yield of Cheddar cheese. The seven models were statistically fitted to the data by applying the Marquardt non-linear least squares method of iteration. These were compared with the commonly used Van Slyke and Price formula, with casein estimated as a percentage of total protein. The differences among the eight models were small...|$|R

30|$|Bioassays {{were carried}} out in outdoor cement vat (diameter 90  cm and average depth 50  cm). Before {{stocking}} of fish, <b>each</b> <b>vat</b> was prepared with a 3 -cm-thick layer of uncontaminated soil {{at the bottom and}} approximately 100  g cow dung was applied on it. The vats were then filled with water (400  L) and kept in this condition for 1  month {{prior to the start of}} the experiment to ensure the growth of planktons, which serve as natural food for the test fish. Fingerlings of O. niloticus were stocked in these experimental vats and acclimatized in this condition for 1  week before the start of the experiments. Thirty fish, irrespective of their sex, were stocked in <b>each</b> <b>vat.</b> Altogether, nine vats were arranged according to randomized block design so that the fingerlings could be reared in three replicates for each of the three test concentrations (0, 1.25 and 2.50  µg/L) of cypermethrin (10 % EC). Treatments with cypermethrin were made on day 1 of the experiment (initial treatment). Then 20 % of the test medium was renewed at 10 -day interval with a pulse treatment of pesticides at 20 % of the initial nominal concentration. Static renewal bioassay with renewal of the bioassay medium at regular interval is a standard method to compensate loss of water through evaporation, to reduce the possibility of depletion of dissolved oxygen in the test medium and to reduce the possibility of loss of toxicant through volatilization and/or adsorption to test vessels (USEPA 2002). The experiment was continued for 90  days. During the experiments, the fish were hand fed the formulated diet (Table  1) twice daily at an interval of 10  h up to apparent satiation of the fish. Daily survey was made on the behaviour and mortality of the experimental fish. Water samples were collected from <b>each</b> <b>vat</b> every 15  days and dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide, temperature, total hardness and total alkalinity of the sampled water were determined by standard method (APHA 1995). All fish from <b>each</b> outdoor <b>vat</b> were sampled at the end of 90 days and the lengths (cm) and weights (g) of the sampled fish were recorded. Three sampled fish from <b>each</b> <b>vat</b> were subjected to biochemical analyses to determine crude protein, crude lipid and ash contents of the fish following the AOAC method (Helrich 1990). Growth was determined by percent increase in weight, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and apparent net protein utilization (ANPU) using standard formulae (Bagenal 1978; Castell and Tiews 1980; Adams and Mclean 1985; Steffens 1989).|$|R

The time and rate of this antigenic switch were characteristic for <b>each</b> <b>VAT.</b> Growth rates of the VATs were determined {{when they were both}} grown separately and grown with 1. A. It appeared that the order of growth rates was 1. 7 a greater than 1. A = 1. 1 a greater than 1. 11 a greater than 1. 5 a greater than 1. 3 a. We have generated theoretical curves for the replacement of one VAT by another based on differences in their growth rates and the rate at which one VAT switches to another (switch frequency). These curves closely match those derived experimentally. We postulate that the differences in growth rates between VATs and the different switch frequencies for VATs may be sufficient to generate the loosely defined sequence of VATs seen in chronic infections...|$|R

The prevalence of <b>each</b> <b>VAT</b> was essentially the same in subpopulations in the blood, mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, brain, kidneys and peritoneal and pleural cavities.
