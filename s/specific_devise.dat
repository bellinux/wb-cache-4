40|$|A general {{two-dimensional}} spin {{model with}} U(N) invariance, interpolating between and O(2 N) models, is studied {{in detail in}} order to illustrate both the general features of the 1 /N expansion on the lattice and the <b>specific</b> techniques <b>devised</b> to extract scaling (field-theoretical) behavior. The continuum version of the model is carefully analyzed deriving quantitative O(1 /N) physical predictions {{in order to establish}} a benchmark for lattice computations. The 1 /N expansion on the lattice, including second-nearest-neighbor interactions, is set up by constructing explicitly effective propagators and vertices. The technique of asymptotic expansion of the lattice propagators, basic to the derivation of analytical results in the scaling domain, is presented in full detail and applied to the model. Physical quantities, like the free energy and different definitions of correlation length, are evaluated. The lattice renormalization-group trajectories are identified and universality among different lattice (and continuum) schemes in the scaling region is explicitly proven. A review of other developments based on the lattice 1 /N expansion is presented. Comment: 99 pages, report no. IFUP-TH 14 / 93, two misprints in Appendix C correcte...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop a method of {{predicting}} the orientation of a blunt-nosed spacecraft(e. g. Kheops Expert) with regard to pitch and sideslip by measuring pressure data at specified locations in the nose region. The strategy devised here is to use analytic sensor functions (ASF) for the prediction of angle of attack (AoA) and yaw angle according to the local pressure data on the vehicle surface. First, the derivation of the sensor functions is presented. In the second step, the range of validity of these formulas is determined with respect to flight velocity (Mach Number), AoA, and yaw angle by employing extensive computer simulation. Third, the corrections of these empirical formulas is devised for the given vehicle so that the required accuracy (resolution better than 0. 5 degrees) is guaranteed within the range of the flight envelope. Fourth, the impact of configuration changes on the accuracy of these functions is also evaluated. Results show that this methodology is effective and accurate in the hypersonic regime, provided <b>specific</b> corrections <b>devised</b> from numerical simulation are applied to modify the analytic sensor functions. 1...|$|R

This paper provides a critical review of recent efforts on improving the description and classification of weathering grades, and discusses current conceptual and practical issues and proposed methods for the engineering geological characterisation of igneous and metamorphic saprolites.

Even so, major knowledge gaps remain, because different authors have focused on different explanatory factors-and, in the case of electricity, because the conditions vary considerably between states.

The existence of informal technical meetings in EU external trade negotiations – a classic example of principal-agent relations – illustrates that there is room in the principal-agent model for rectifying the anti-agent bias and the single-minded focus on goal conflict.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in wireless technologies {{have made the}} mobile computing a reality. In order to provide services of good quality to mobile users and improve the system performance, the mobile computing system is usually of a distributed server architecture. As users {{move to a new}} service area, the new server is expected to take over the execution of running programs for mobile users so as to reduce the communication overhead of the mobile system. This procedure is referred to as service handoff. Note that when service handoff occurs, the cache of the new server does not contain any data entry that was accessed by prior transactions and the new server will thus lose its advantages for cache access. To remedy this, we examine in this paper several cache retrieval schemes to improve the efficiency of cache retrieval. In particular, we analyze the impact of using a coordinator buffer to improve the overall performance of cache retrieval. Moreover, in light of the properties of transactions (i. e, temporal locality of data access among transactions), we devise a Dynamic and Adaptive cache Retrieval scheme (DAR) that can adopt proper cache methods based on some <b>specific</b> criteria <b>devised</b> to deal with the service handoff situation in a mobile computing environment. The performance of these cache retrieval schemes is analyzed and a system simulator is developed to validate our results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Following injury, {{tissue repair}} {{involves}} inflammation, granulation tissue formation and scar constitution. Granulation tissue develops from the connective tissue surrounding the damaged or missing area and contains mainly small vessels, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. As the wound closes and evolves into a scar, {{there is a}} striking decrease in cellularity, including disappearance of typical myofibroblasts. The question arises as to what process is responsible for granulation tissue cell disappearance. Our results (in cutaneous wounds) and results of other laboratories (particularly in lungs and kidney) suggest that apoptosis is the mechanism responsible {{for the evolution of}} granulation tissue into a scar. During excessive scarring (hypertrophic scar or fibrosis), it is conceivable that the process of apoptosis cannot take place. After experimental endothelial injury in an artery, accumulation of smooth muscle cells participates in the formation of intimal thickening. Apoptotic features have been observed in cells of intimal thickening and also within human atherosclerotic plaques. In the case of atherosclerosis, apoptosis could be detrimental: since smooth muscle cells participate in plaque stability, apoptosis could lead to weakening and rupture of the plaque. These results underline the fact that both increased cell survival or excessive cell death can be associated with pathological disorders. <b>Specific</b> therapies <b>devised</b> to enhance or decrease the susceptibility of individual cell types to apoptosis development could modify the evolution of a variety of human diseases...|$|R
