40|$|As {{intellectual}} property (IP) and {{intellectual property}} rights (IPRs) play an increasingly important role in corporate strategy, the accurate valuation of IP remains a major obstacle to their emergence as a tradable asset class. Though there are several generally accepted ways to measure the value of IP, the introduction of more transparency in IP valuation procedures may render the trading of IP rights significantly more efficient and profitable. This report summarises the conclusions and recommendations of a European Commission (EC) appointed panel of European IP valuation experts drawn {{from a range of}} disciplines including those involved with accounting, business valuation, IP consulting, litigation and damage award activities. The panel's task was to consider how IP valuation plays a part in the policy for the "Innovation Union" and the bottlenecks that occur. This Expert Group has received the mandate to review valuation methods for IP and their use; to identify bottle necks in the valuation methods used for the purpose of a company’s financial reporting, access to finance and litigation; to identify good practices; and to recommend possible policy actions. Following the mandate given, this expert group has focused its analysis on IP and IPRs (excluding other intangible assets). The intangible assets created through the processes of innovation represent a major share of the value of today's businesses. The IP rights associated with those assets are the legal underpinning for potential returns on investment in that innovation. Despite their fundamental importance, the understanding of IP and IP rights does however differ widely amongst businesses large and small. There is a clear need to increase market actors’ confidence and certainty in IP valuation methods as a way to stimulate IP transactions, to support IP based financing and to give companies the tools to provide information about their IP. This will also allow investors to better understand the business and the value of the company itself and even to provide decision makers with the required information to decide whether to enforce or to license IP. However, the Expert Group has demonstrated {{that it is not the}} lack of valuation methods per se, or even standards for valuing IP that are missing, but rather other barriers that are having a greater influence on business and lenders. As IP is, by its nature, innovative and therefore different, each case for valuation requires investigation, rather than having an automated approach to IP valuation. As a result, IP valuation of a company’s assets is an opinion, at a particular point in time – similar in many respects to the way that a legal opinion is given. Although an informed layman might proffer a good guess, it is important to note that in the same way that one cannot automate the judgement on a law suit, one cannot automate judgement on an independent IP valuation. There are many factors involved and evidence and purpose can have a large impact. The valuation of IP assets is complicated by the fact that no two IP assets are the same. This is inherently the case when IP is protected by rights such as patents and trademarks, where a requisite for obtaining such rights is that the IP does not already exist. The uniqueness of IP makes comparisons with other IP difficult, thereby limiting the usefulness of comparison based pricing. As a result, valuations are often based on assumptions about the IP asset’s future use, what important milestones will be met and what management decisions will be taken. Valuation involves assumptions and judgement by the valuer derived from and justified based on a bespoke, rigorous analysis of the IP within its business context, together with its importance versus other business drivers, broader industry and competitor constraints, dynamics and economic outlook. Numerous valuation standards have been issued during the last years concerning different IP rights with different geographical scope and different regulation approach. They have different binding power for professionals, organizations or for certain applications. It is important to note that these standards and guidelines have no contradictory content. Also, from a content perspective they are quite homogeneous. The bottleneck for the improvement of an IP market is not in the lack of accepted methods or standards, their content or consistency, but in the limited dissemination of the fact that they exist and the little confidence in their results. This Expert Group has firstly investigated European best practice in IP valuation as performed by financial institutions that are providing capital, particularly to SMEs. This report presents the results of this research and their approach to IP backed financing – the successes and failures and whether IP valuation is actually carried out as part of the financing process. The findings of the research carried out are summarised under the headings of equity financing and debt financing and some examples of current practice are provided. We note that there is a significant difference in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups compared with larger corporates that have a strong trading history. A solution is needed to fund the commercialisation of innovative ideas, with the value of the IP asset acting as collateral. Overcoming the barriers to lending against IP assets is therefore attractive at a national and European Level. Equity investors typically invest into companies, but not into IP assets as such. The equity finance community considers the importance of IP when financing companies, however, the actual value of IP assets per se is rarely considered important. In general IP is evaluated but generally not formally valued in the regular banking, venture capital or private equity sectors. The general consensus amongst those interviewed is that IP is too risky to be used as collateral for traditional loans. However, it must be noted that cases of intangible asset based lending (IABL) have occurred in certain circumstances. Combined asset based lending has been achieved whereby a bank provides a loan to a pension fund against tangible assets and the pension fund then provides a <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease-back</b> <b>arrangement</b> against intangible assets. IABL from pension funds (on a sale and lease back arrangement) rather than banks, provides a route for SMEs to obtain loans that is gaining increasing attention. One reason given for this uptake in IABL between a company and director pension funds is the growing number of SMEs who have difficulties in securing bank loans. In the Accounting and Reporting section the Expert Group reports that there are limitations on when and how it is possible to place the value of IP assets on the balance sheet of the company. The complexity of IP from an accounting perspective leads to problems in its reporting, which may result in the vulnerability of firms which base most of their performance on IP. The existing regulatory situation implies that IP can only be recognised in rare cases, and mostly at historical cost based on a previous acquisition of such IP. It is difficult to recognise internally generated IP as, when the expenditure to develop the IP is incurred, it is usually unclear whether it will generate benefits in the future. As a consequence, an important part of internally generated IP is not recognised in the balance sheet of an enterprise, meaning that potential investors are not receiving some relevant information about the company. The filing of a “management report” together with the annual report, giving detailed information about IP value, seems to be a useful vehicle to improve publicly available information on intangibles. Finally, the Expert Group states that an issue that influences a company’s decision to protect its IP, especially in the case of SMEs, is to what extent such rights are enforceable, the time and costs involved in litigation, and the foreseeable economic results. The quality of the enforcement system has an important impact in IP protection. SMEs and large companies need to be assured an accessible justice system in case of infringement, validity and other IPR related litigation cases, which implies the need to provide judges and professional valuers with the appropriate tools and data to facilitate valuation in litigation. As a result of the in-depth analysis carried out in all the mentioned areas, the Expert Group recommends a number of policy actions that could have a significant impact on reducing the identified barriers in order to increase the efficient use of IP valuation and to make such valuation flexible, transparent and reliable to respond to market requirements: Establishing a data source containing information for use by valuation professionals, as a way to enhance credibility of valuations by improving data and available information on IP transactions, Creating an organization to oversee IP valuation practice as a way to increase confidence in the quality of valuations being performed and to ensure that valuations are in line with generally accepted principles and standards, Introducing a risk sharing scheme for banks to facilitate IP secured lending to innovative companies, especially SMEs, Introducing an additional reporting section for intangible assets and IP that would increase the transparency of IP value within company accounts, providing important information to lenders, investors and stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{quantitative}} framework {{for analysis of}} the UK commercial property sector is developed, and the possible implications explored for the financial stability of this sector, and for the corporate sector as a whole. There is little previous empirical literature. But where there is, models have either studied particular markets or have developed single-equation approaches. Lack of suitable data {{has been a major}} impediment. A model of the real estate sector is constructed using econometric analysis of rental values and bank lending, supplemented by a calibrated model of the remainder of the financial accounts of real estate companies (using data for private and public real estate companies). Using related work on company-failure models, it is possible to extend the analysis to provide an equation for the probability of default of real estate companies. The empirical results fail to find a role for borrowing costs in the bank lending equation before 1999, but unless borrowing costs are included after this period, the equation breaks down and systematically underestimates the growth in lending to real estate from then on. Various potential explanations are examined for this breakdown, including the importance of <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> <b>lease-backs.</b> The estimated rental equation appears more stable. The historical tracking performance of the estimated real estate model fails to capture {{the full extent of the}} swings in capital values and bank lending in the early 1990 s. This is attributed to shifts in the discount rate applied to property income, possibly reflecting a temporary shift in risk premia during this period. The property sector links to the rest of the private non-financial corporate sector through its role as collateral. Since the property model relies partly on macroeconomic influences it can be used in conjunction with macro models to provide forecasts of property values and the probability of default of property companies. Simulations that use this model with the Bank of England macroeconometric model show not only the sensitivity of the probability of default of real estate companies to selected macroeconomic shocks, but also the potential links between the commercial property sector and the financial health of the rest of the corporate sector. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The results suggest that collaborative <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing will positively affect marketing orientation and leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing so that the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, market intelligence and organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. It was found through the survey that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, but that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing has a positive effect on business performance. This research identifies some of the antecedents of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and clarifies the benefits of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing to the organisation.

Design/methodology/approach - Three exploratory case studies and {{a review of the}} literature are used to examine the antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The case studies allow this fuzzy and undefined area to be clarified and existing theories to be empirically tested. Findings - The study identifies that there are three types of factor influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing: integrators, facilitators, and management attitudes towards coordination. The exploratory case studies establish that senior management plays a pivotal role in creating and improving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and that there is a positive correlation between collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and improved business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are that it is qualitative in nature and the conceptual framework needs be tested through a large-scale survey. In addition, the study considers only large UK organisations and, therefore, future research should consider expanding the study to overseas organisations. Practical implications - There appears to be an established relationship between the level of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and business performance. Further, the attitude of senior managers to improving coordination is critical to influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Originality/value - This study contends that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing need to collaborate rather than integrate and uses exploratory case studies to support the development of the framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{into the}} <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> {{marketing}} interface have neglected {{the relationship between}} market orientation <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. We found that market intelligence processes and management attitudes towards coordination have positive impacts on market orientation, which then has benefits for collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and business performance. The <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing interface has attracted considerable attention from researchers, but the relationship between market orientation {{and the level of}} collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing has not yet been fully explored. This issue is important to help understand how to improve collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. As organizations are competing in increasingly crowded markets with more demanding customers and who are struggling to differentiate their offer from their competitors, the effective operation of the customer-facing interface of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing is critical in helping to achieve success (e. g. Homburg and Jensen, 2007). The objectives of this study are to help understand the relationship between market orientation <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing; to identify the role of senior management and market intelligence in creating market orientation, and to explore if these variables directly or indirectly impact on business performance. Further, the study aims to contribute to the debate on the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing interface by bridging gaps found in literature. Evidence from recent studies indicate <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing staff are frequently set individual targets that may pull them in different directions {{and that there is a}} less than optimum working relationship (Dewsnap and Jobber, 2000; Rouzies et al., 2005). Friction can be aggravated by differing perspectives, strong independent cultures and need to maintain independent functionality (Shaprio, 2002; Kotler, Rackham and Krishnaswamy 2006), but <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing still need to coordinate their efforts to maximize the return on their activities and a marketing orientation should facilitate this. If an organization has a market orientation, logic suggests that the organization should be customer orientated and the objectives of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing departments should exhibit greater alignment and ensure that the response to the market is efficient. Senior management need to create an internal culture of cooperation and provide guidance to <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing managers on aligning goals and improving communications. They also have a key role in building an environment that will facilitate the development of market orientation and an understanding of the part that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing play in achieving organizational objectives. Senior managers also provide <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing with the guidance and tools to enable them to align their activities, share information more efficiently and appreciate each others’ contribution to achieving objectives. Integrated market intelligence processes enable <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing to understand market conditions more effectively and share information in a structured environment, thereby improving efficiency in responding to customers and competitors. This study explores this topic through a quantitative survey questionnaire sent to Managing Directors/CEOs of large, UK organizations who had separate <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing departments. The study finds an effective market intelligence system that collects and disseminates market information internally positively supports a market orientation, but does not directly impact business performance. A positive senior management attitude towards coordination impacts on marketing orientation, but not directly on business performance or collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing.

There is {{evidence to show that}} collaborative <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions have benefits to an organisation in terms of improved business performance, but many organisations have not yet achieved collaborative internal functions.
