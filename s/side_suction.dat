40|$|The tips of {{gas turbine}} rotor blade {{experience}} large thermal loads, {{which can lead}} to tip damage. The large thermal loads on the tips of rotor blade are due to the hot leakage flow through the gap between rotating blade tip and stationary shroud. The hot leakage flow accelerates due to the large pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of blade, resulting a thin boundary layer and high heat transfer rates. The flow across the blade tip is also undesirable from the perspective of efficiency since it increases the loss of turbine power. For this reason, squlealer-type tip is used to reduce the leakage flow. Rim and groove increase the flow resistance of the leakage flow, resulting decrease of the leakage flow rate. However, the thermal loads and stresses are concentrated in the tip edge of rotor blade and occur crack and breakage. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} understand the heat transfer characteristics on surfaces inside the cavity of the squealer tip, such as tip surface and inner rim surface. Kwak et al.

The main objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate various configurations of roughness to find a solution in order to mitigate roughness destructive impacts. Hence, the sand grain roughness is distributed uniformly along pressure <b>side,</b> <b>suction</b> side and both sides during the manufacturing process. Navier-Stokes equations are discretized by the finite volume method and are solved by SIMPLE algorithm. Results indicated that in contrast with previous studies, the roughness will be useful if it is applied on only pressure side of the airfoil. In this condition, the lift coefficient is increased to  and 1. 2 % compare to the airfoil with rough and smooth sides, respectively. However, in 3 -D simulation, the lift coefficient of the blade with pressure surface roughness is less than smooth blade, but still its destructive impacts are much less than of both surfaces roughness and suction surfaces roughness. Therefore, it can be deduced that in order to reveal the influence of roughness, the simulation must be accomplished in three dimensions.

40|$|Present work {{deals with}} {{reducing}} secondary losses in turbine cascade by using boundary layer fences in two ways. Firstly, {{to reduce the}} strength of vortex which is incident {{at the leading edge}} of airfoil and hence reduce the strength of horse shoe vortex, and secondly, to reduce the pressure gradient between the pressure <b>side</b> and the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> in the flow passage region between airfoils. In previous works, the boundary layer fence followed the profile of airfoil. In this publication, boundary layer fence does not follow the profile of airfoil i. e stagger and camber of boundary fence is different when compared to airfoil. A profiled boundary layer fence is proposed in the present work which reduces the incident voracity and also reduces pressure gradient from pressure <b>side</b> to <b>suction</b> <b>side.</b> Such boundary layer fence was checked on T 106 test cascade which is available as open literature. Numerical work is carried out using commercial software Ansys CFX. Viscous RANS simulations are carried out using k-omega SST turbulence model with yplus value around unity on all walls. Coefficient of secondary kinetic energy (CSKE) and Secondary Kinetic energy helicity (SKEH) are used as target functions. Total pressure loss is also monitored. All the three functions show a reduction in secondary loss. The strength of horse shoe vortex is reduced by the fence protruding in front of leading edge. The converging flow passage created by the fence near the pressure side of airfoil reduces the pressure gradient from pressure <b>side</b> to <b>suction</b> <b>side.</b> The total pressure loss was reduced by 1. 5 % and CSKE was improved by 36 % when the boundary layer fence was adopted...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first stage vane endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface are significantly influenced by slot injection angle. For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side,</b> which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface. With the increase of the slot injection angle, the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large slot injection angle leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller slot injection angle obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> surface compared to the slot injection angle...|$|R

The current study uses the concept of a tip platform extension that is a very short “winglet ” obtained by slightly extending the tip platform in the tangential direction.

A steady liquid crystal technique was applied to obtain detailed distribution of the temperature over the blade surface.

40|$|Abstract—Tip vortex {{cavitation}} {{is one of}} {{well known}} patterns of cavitation phenomenon which occurs in axial pumps. This pattern of cavitation occurs due to pressure difference between the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of blades of an axial pump. Since the pressure in the pressure side of the blade {{is higher than the}} pressure in its <b>suction</b> <b>side,</b> thus a very small portion of liquid flow flows back from pressure <b>side</b> to the <b>suction</b> <b>side.</b> This fact is cause of tip vortex cavitation and gap cavitation that may occur in axial pumps. In this paper the results of our experimental investigation about movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge due to reduction of pump flow rate in an axial pump is reported. Results show that reduction of pump flow rate in conjunction with increasing of outlet pressure causes movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge towards the blade tip. Results also show that by approaching tip vortex cavitation to the blade tip, vortex tip pattern of cavitation replaces with a cavitation phenomenon on the blade tip. Furthermore by further reduction of pump flow rate and increasing of outlet pressure, an unstable cavitation phenomenon occurs between each blade leading edge and the next blade trailing edge...|$|R
