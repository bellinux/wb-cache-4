40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{performances}} regarding grid-interactivity {{of a conventional}} {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) district heating system and a <b>solar</b> <b>CHP</b> district heating system – with decentralized solar thermal systems and heat storages in the buildings – are investigated and compared for a future scenario of the energy system. For this, simulations were carried out and the subsequent results evaluated applying a recently introduced method (load-grid matching coefficient) for quantifying grid-interactivity. It is shown that the <b>solar</b> <b>CHP</b> district heating system has better grid-interactivity compared with the conventional CHP district heating system. It is also quantitatively and visually shown that there is still potential to improve the grid-interactivity of both concepts by, for instance, applying more sophisticated control strategies. Furthermore, it is shown that in the summer period the CHP unit is not required for long periods of time. This allows temporal decommissioning of the district heating station and the district heating grid and thus an avoidance of the distribution losses which are relatively high when compared with the actual heat used during this period...|$|R

50|$|A {{concentrated}} {{solar still}} {{is a system that}} uses the same quantity of solar heat input (same solar collection area) as a <b>simple</b> <b>solar</b> still but can produce a volume of freshwater that is many times greater. While a <b>simple</b> <b>solar</b> {{still is a}} way of distilling water by using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from a water source and ambient air to cool a condenser film, a concentrated solar still uses a concentrated solar thermal collector to concentrate solar heat and deliver it to a multi-effect evaporation process for distillation, thus increasing the natural rate of evaporation. The concentrated solar still is capable of large-scale water production in areas with plentiful solar energy.|$|R

This paper deals with a <b>simple</b> and inexpensive <b>solar</b> desalination configuration. The performance of a <b>simple</b> <b>solar</b> still operating under Maltese climatic conditions is analysed both theoretically and experimentally. The internal and external heat transfer modes of the distillation unit are examined. This paper concludes that the distillation rate in a <b>simple</b> <b>solar</b> distiller increases with ambient temperature and solar radiation, even though the condensation capacity of the glass is reduced. A higher wind speed decreases the evaporation and condensation processes. The energy fractions within the solar still have also been analysed.

40|$|The {{result of}} several years of {{analysis}} of Distributed Concentrating Solar Combined Heat and Power (DCS-CHP) systems is a design that is predicted to convert sunlight to heat at 8 - 10 % solar-electric efficiency while simultaneously capturing ~ 60 % of that initial sunlight as usable heat (at 100 ºC). In contrast to similarly sized photovoltaic systems in the U. S. that cost ~$ 7. 90 /Watt of generator rated peak electrical output, in mass production the proposed collector and generator system sized at 1 - 10 kW would cost ~$ 3. 20 /Watt electricity and ~$ 0. 40 /Watt-thermal, allowing adjustment of heat and electrical output on demand. The proposed system would revolutionize distributed energy generation in several ways: 1) by enabling rapid dissemination via avoidance of production limitations of photovoltaics such as expensive and limited materials, 2) by efficient local production of both heat and power to offset more greenhouse gases {{at a lower cost}} than other renewable energy technologies, and 3) by democratizing the means of electricity production; putting the {{power in the hands of}} the consumer instead of large utilities. With over 5. 4 GW of photovoltaics added globally in 2008 and 20 GW of solar thermal, there is a large proven market for solar energy. With widespread market penetration, this system would reduce greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from electricity generation and heating for a significant portion of the developed and developing world, including those in remote locations with no connection to an electric grid. Chapter 1 begins with analysis of the relative demand for electricity and heat in California, showing that, on average, demand matches production of a theoretical <b>solar</b> <b>CHP</b> system. Then, we explore the economic and technological impetus for a solar powered combined heat and power Rankine cycle, showing cost and performance modeling in comparison to photovoltaics across varying conditions, and concluding that <b>solar</b> <b>CHP</b> generated electricity is comparable to PV electricity in terms of cost "per peak watt". Chapter 2 shows results of a life cycle analysis of DCS-CHP in comparison to other renewable and non-renewable energy systems including its global warming potential (80 gCO 2 eq/kWh electric and 10 gCO 2 eq/kWh thermal), levelized electric and thermal energy cost ($ 0. 25 /kWh electric and $ 0. 03 /kWh thermal), and cost of solar water purification/desalination ($ 1. 40 /m 3). Additionally the utilization of water for this technology is shown to be much less than fossil-fuel based thermal power plants. Chapter 3 explores the expander as an enabling technology for small solar Rankine cycles and presents results of physical testing and characterization of a rotary lobe expander prototype developed by a small Australian company, Katrix, Inc. Testing of this expander using compressed air yields an impressive isentropic efficiency of 80 - 95 % at pressure ratios of 6 - 11 making the rotary lobe expander a leading choice for DCS-CHP systems, if operation on steam is successful and reliability issues can be addressed. Chapter 4 concludes with a description and analysis of a DCS-CHP system using simulation software developed in Matlab for the purpose of system analysis and optimization. This chapter focuses on the selection of an appropriate expander and collectors, the two key enabling technologies for DCS-CHP. In addition to discussion of the rotary lobe expander, we present a novel collector device appropriate for <b>solar</b> <b>CHP</b> systems that eliminates high pressure articulate joints, a typical failure point of solar concentrating systems. Given the results of the rotary lobe expander testing, comparison to previous expander modeling work, and comparison of the predicted cost and efficiency of the collectors analyzed, an appropriate technology version of the DCS-CHP system is selected and overall system performance is predicted across 1020 sites in the US...|$|R

In particular hetero-junction solar cells comprised of a n-type amorphous silicon-based layer deposited onto p-type crystalline silicon materials is studied. First relatively <b>simple</b> <b>solar</b> cells are presented in which an uniform layer of n-type amorphous silicon is used in order to establish reproducible preparation conditions and to set a baseline by which more complicated structures could be evaluated. These simple structures achieved 11 % solar conversion efficiencies. Analysis of the dark diode characteristics including the current-voltage behavior reveal that the diode quality factor is independent of temperature; the pn-junction dominates the transport in forward direction. The capacitance-voltage profiles (C"-" 2 vs. V) are linear; this holds at varied temperature and under illumination. The capacitance varies very slowly with frequency.
