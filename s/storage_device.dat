5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} delay line memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} delay line for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital <b>storage</b> <b>device.</b> The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical <b>storage</b> <b>device,</b> by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E

5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass <b>storage</b> <b>device.</b> These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
5|$|The game {{proceeds}} {{according to}} the Courier's decisions and involves many different events, factions, and characters. The main storyline follows the Courier's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip. Along the way, the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that they can choose to assist with, ignore, or otherwise sabotage, resulting in positive or negative karma. Eventually, after finding Benny and the Chip, the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. The Chip is a data <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E

40|$|The {{commonly}} used Distributed Generations (DG) technologies include wind generators, photovoltaics, and biomass generators with their sizes varying between several kW {{to a few}} MW. Energy <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are generally used to smooth variations in DG’s MW output due to inherent unpredictability and to minimize exchange of power from grid. Connecting the storage and DG’s to the grid have both technical and economic impacts.

The technical analysis includes analyzing the transient stability of a system with DG’s and energy <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> such as a battery and ultracapacitor.

The individual <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> have different parameters that characterize attributes such as capacity, maximum charging rates, and losses in charging and storage. We address two problems related to such a system. The first is the problem of operating a portfolio of <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time, i. e., making real-time decisions as to how to charge or discharge each of the <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> in response to the fluctuating commodity flow and cost function. The second is the problem of configuring the portfolio of <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> i. e., choosing a single portfolio from a set of candidate portfolios. Here we are given the cost of each candidate portfolio as a function of its parameters, and seek to minimize a combination of initial configuration cost and average operating cost.

The purpose of the project was to survey mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> and systems and to select several devices for detailed analysis. Representative devices were analyzed in order to determine their suitability for various file management functions. The major conclusions of the study are the following: 1. Mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> have high potential for those applications which have a requirement to store a large data base (10 ﾹ- 10 ﾹﾲ bits) on-line. 2. Mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> should be considered as supplements to conventional <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> for large data base applications, and used as part of a hierarchical storage system, rather than as replacements for conventional storage quipment. 3. Mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are not competitive with conventional storage equipment for direct access processing. 4. Erasable mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are competitive with conventional storage equipment for sequential file processing. 5. Non-erasable mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> are inappropriate for high activity file processing but can be employed to advantage in archival storage applications. 6. As in the case of conventional storage units, the file activity ratio is a prime consideration in the selection of a file processing technique for mass storage.

40|$|The uptake of USB storage has mainly {{replaced}} previous portable media. With {{the evolution}} of USB <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> increased importance is placed on this technology in both the private and commercial worlds.

40|$|The National Storage Laboratory (NSL) is {{currently}} implementing a prototype storage system that utilizes network attached high performance <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> to transfer data directly between <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> and client processors using HIPPI IPI- 3. The client processors in {{use at the}} NSL include Cray YMP-C 90 supercomputers, IBM RISC System 6000 workstations, Silicon Graphics workstations, SUN workstations, and a PsiTech frame buffer. This paper describes the HIPPI IPI- 3 interface between the client processors and the <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> It is intended {{to serve as a}} guide for vendors who desire to connect their products to the NSL.
