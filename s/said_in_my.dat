In the morning I hear my master invoking {{the protection of}} the Tree Treasures in the evening I hear his wife reciting the noble scriptures. To be a dog and have to accept the whole realm of impurities is {{a small price to pay}} for never so much as hearing the word 'Hell' <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ear." ...|$|E

One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elric's {{albinism}} appears {{influenced by}} Monsieur Zenith, an albino Sexton Blake villain whom Moorcock appreciated enough to write into later multiverse stories. [...] Moorcock read Zenith stories {{in his youth}} and has contributed to their later reprinting, remarking that it [...] "took me forty years to find another copy of Zenith the Albino! In fact it was a friend who found it {{under lock and key}} and got a copy of it to Savoy who are, at last, about to reprint it! Why I have spent so much energy making public the evidence of my vast theft from Anthony Skene, I'm not entirely sure... [...] Moorcock later said, [...] "As I've <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> introduction to Monsieur Zenith: The Albino, the Anthony Skenes character was a huge influence. For the rest of the character, his ambiguities in particular, I based him on myself at the age I was when I created Elric, which was 20". The influence of Zenith on Elric is often cited in discussions of Zenith.|$|E

6000|$|DAN:--"Don't brag of it, Sis. He's {{the man who}} {{was asked}} if {{somebody}} else <b>said</b> something <b>in</b> sincerity and old Joe said 'No, he <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cellar.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must presume, Mademoiselle," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most business-like manner, [...] "that the {{document}} {{you speak of}} has been stolen." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN. She said 'I {{have found}} her,' and I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt way, 'You mean Lady Sybil,' {{and she went}} away laughing.|$|E
6000|$|I leaned {{around the}} corner of the tree and spoke. 'Excuse me,' I <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> suavest voice, 'but I think I see a way out of your difficulty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Marika, your Cornish friend {{may have}} taught you to speak English," [...] <b>said</b> I, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> native tongue, {{turning to the}} woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alicia, dear," [...] I <b>said,</b> {{interrupting}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> turn, [...] "repeat my words. Say 'I {{take this}} man, Francis Softly, for my lawful wedded husband.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it seems!" [...] <b>said</b> I, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt fashion. [...] "You may {{not feel}} so merry when my friend Jim Horscroft comes back to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Mool entered on the {{necessary}} explanation, triumphing in the reply {{that he had}} just made. [...] "It's the smartest thing," [...] he thought, [...] "I ever <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I deny it,' said Marie's uncle, coming {{close up}} to his opponent, and {{standing}} before him. 'I deny it. It is not true. That shall not be <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing, even by you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is my reason, Hans," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most icy voice, and I {{pointed to}} a faint line of smoke rising against the {{twilight}} sky on the further side of the intervening valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{now they}} mourn indeed, Mopo," [...] <b>said</b> Chaka <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ear; [...] "now thy people mourn {{from the heart}} and not with the lips alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I really don’t {{remember}} {{very much}} about the night <b>in</b> question,” he <b>said.</b> “Nobody <b>in</b> <b>my</b> place could. I was wounded slightly and almost dazed, you see.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mackay {{thinks of}} everything," [...] Steel <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ear. [...] "He sent Gordon off {{to bring his}} wife along. There's only the {{half-breed}} here, and she'll need a white woman with her to-night, poor soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{some one}} <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brother James's presence[2] that I was a Jacobin, he very well observed,--"No! Samuel is no Jacobin; he is a hot-headed Moravian!" [...] Indeed, I {{was in the}} extreme {{opposite}} pole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be silent," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sternest manner. Then, {{unable to}} bear more of Ayesha's mockery, for I felt that as usual she was mocking me, I added {{with all the}} dignity that I could command, ...|$|E
6000|$|Ant. I did {{not think}} so; I <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rage: Pr'ythee, forgive me: Why didst thou tempt my anger, by {{discovery}} Of what I would not hear? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{lieutenant}} tells me, Mademoiselle," [...] <b>said</b> I <b>in</b> <b>my</b> counterfeited voice, [...] "that it is {{your desire}} to bear Monsieur your father company upon this journey of his to Paris." ...|$|R
60|$|His remark was {{unrelated}} to our talk, I {{did not know what}} he meant by it; nevertheless it pleased me more than anything that had ever been <b>said</b> me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would expect}} to find me alone, from what I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> note," [...] {{observed}} Miss Moore, as she conducted Caroline towards the parlour; [...] "but it was written this morning: since dinner, company has come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|Instead of answering, Estella {{burst out}} laughing. This was very {{singular}} to me, and I {{looked at her}} in considerable perplexity. When she left off--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> diffident way with her,-- ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{saw that}} she had tricked me, and taken her watch at night. For I slept like a trooper after a day's forage. As to what I might have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreams--that thought made me red as an apple.|$|E
6000|$|ANTONY. I did {{not think}} so; [...] I <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rage: Pr'ythee, forgive me. [...] Why didst thou tempt my anger, by {{discovery}} [...] Of what I would not hear? ...|$|R
60|$|Tow. You have <b>said</b> all <b>in</b> that, <b>my</b> Isabinda, if {{she still}} be so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it then {{a disgrace}} to be innocently within these walls, lady?" [...] she asked, still with an averted eye. [...] "I have long {{suspected}} this, but none has ever before <b>said</b> it, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{asked how}} {{it was that she}} had no {{companion}} to take care of her. [...] "You are too young and too pretty," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt English way, [...] "to trust yourself alone in such a place as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} the bracelet, Sir," [...] I <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most suave manner. [...] "You shall have it, but not unless {{you will pay}} me three {{thousand}} francs for it. I can get two thousand five hundred by taking it straight to Mlle. Mars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ear, as a thing {{concerning}} {{himself and}} me alone, [...] "your hair's pretty well all falling out. You'd better {{let me just}} shampoo up the scalp a bit and stop up them follicles or pretty soon you won't--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you got him, Bill?" [...] she <b>said,</b> which <b>in</b> <b>my</b> present {{frame of}} mind {{struck me as a}} jolly creepy way of putting it. The sort of thing Lady Macbeth might have said to Macbeth, don't you know.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked up}} the street, and down the street, and rubbed his chin timidly; and then <b>said,</b> glancing <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face as if a light had broken on his mind, yet with a humble appeal to my {{forbearance}} that was perfectly irresistible: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Abner {{rose from}} the door-step, and, {{entering}} the room, stood before Mr. Brownsill. 'That's the most sensible thing,' said he, 'that I ever heard <b>said</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> life. Sample first, and go into afterwards; that's sound reason. Mr. Brownsill, I will do it.' ...|$|R
