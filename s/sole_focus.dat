5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the <b>sole</b> <b>focus</b> of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E

5|$|Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which {{although}} it ordered Wilfrid's restoration {{and the return}} of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained. Wilfrid was, however, given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected. The council had been called to deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid's concerns were not the <b>sole</b> <b>focus</b> of the council. In fact, the historian Henry Chadwick thought that one reason Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid's support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy. Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12. Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops.|$|E
5|$|While {{heavy metal}} {{throughout}} its history has referenced the occult, Viking metal bands use {{a very specific}} mythology, which informs their textual choices, album imagery, and, frequently, musical compositions. Despite a whole pantheon of Norse gods to choose from, Viking metal bands typically focus on Odin, the god of war, and on Thor and his hammer. Alcohol, particularly mead, is also a common lyrical focus. Viking metal bands tend to follow one of two approaches. The first is one of romanticism and escapist ideas, where bands cultivate an image of strength and barbarism and quote passages from various poems and sagas. The second approach emphasizes historical accuracy, typically relying on Norse mythology as the <b>sole</b> <b>focus</b> of lyricism and identity. Many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots– for instance, Moonsorrow with Finland or Einherjer with Norway– with a wider northern European identity coming second.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the <b>sole</b> <b>focus</b> of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} {{catadioptric}} imaging systems {{has been developed}} that can achieve omnidirectional viewing with a single planar imager while still being able to recover perspective images, provided that they satisfy the single-viewpoint (SVP) constraint. It {{has been shown that}} the only mirror shapes that can have SVP when paired with a <b>sole</b> <b>focusing</b> planar imager camera are the surfaces of revolution of conic section curves. However, the special case of such a surface, the cone-shaped mirror itself, has not been deemed a viable SVP mirror shape. We present a comprehensive imaging theory of the cone mirror in its SVP configuration. We show that the SVP, cone mirror catadioptric system not only is practical but also has unique advantages for certain applications. The detailed theory explains why and how a practical SVP cone configuration can be set up, the merits and weaknesses of such systems, and how one can remedy the weaknesses to create a workable imaging system. We also derive the tolerance formula for estimating effects of alignment errors. A prototype has been constructed, and experimental results validate our theory.

25|$|German {{nationalism}} {{became the}} <b>sole</b> <b>focus</b> of the German Question {{which was the}} question of how Germany was going to be best unified into a nation-state.

The other option, the Kleindeutsche Lösung ("Lesser German solution") only advocated unifying the northern German states without Austria and the German Austrians was supported predominantly in the Kingdom of Prussia. The idea of including the Austrian Empire into a German nation-state was a problem because it included many non-German ethnic groups, as well as many of the areas it ruled had never been part of Germany {{and did not want to}} become part of a German nation-state. In 1866, the feud between Austria and Prussia finally came to a head.

40|$|Thyroid hormone-induced {{metamorphosis}} {{seems to}} represent an ancestral feature of chrordates (urochordates, cephalochordates and vertebrates), {{but also of}} nonchordate animals. Although thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone receptor profiles during metamorphosis have been analyzed in different vertebrate taxa, including fish, developmental expression and activity of type 2 (dio 2, D 2) and type 3 (dio 3, D 3) iodothyronine deiodinases, two key enzymes in anuran metamorphosis, remain unknown in any fish species. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} development of thyroid hormone system during the metamorphosis of a flatfish species, the Senegalese <b>sole,</b> <b>focusing</b> on the deiodinases developmental profile. We have cloned sole D 2 and D 3 and analyzed several parameters of thyroid hormones system in pre-, early-, middle-, and late-metamorphic larvae. Both deiodinases contain in their catalytic centers an UGA triplet encoding for a selenocystein (Sec) residue as expected. Left eye migration and rotation in body position were associated with a significant increase in both thyroid hormones and thyroid hormone receptors at the middle-late metamorphic stages. Although dio 2 expression slightly increased during metamorphosis, D 2 activity augmentation was much more significant. Sole dio 3 expression declined only slightly, whereas the D 3 activity clearly decreased at mid-late metamorphic period. This developmental profile of deiodinases sustained the rise of thyroid hormones levels observed during sole metamorphosis. No clear cut daily rhythms were observed in the parameters analyzed although it seemed that thyroid hormone system was more active during daytime, in particular at late metamorphic stages. These developmental changes point out the importance not only of thyroid hormones and their receptors but also of dio 2 and dio 3 in mediating flatfish metamorphosis, as it has been described in amphibians. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in designing systems {{such that the}} current many-to-one ratio of operators to unmanned vehicles (UVs) can be inverted.
