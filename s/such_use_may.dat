2500|$|It {{may be that}} alien civilizations are {{detectable}} {{through their}} radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them.

50|$|This is {{a leading}} {{decision}} {{as it is the}} first case regarding children’s rights with respect to social networks to be decided by a higher court in Colombia.

5000|$|Key {{derivation}} {{functions are}} often {{used in conjunction with}} non-secret parameters to derive one or more keys from a common secret value (which is sometimes also referred to as [...] "key diversification"). <b>Such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> prevent an attacker who obtains a derived key from learning useful information about either the input secret value {{or any of the other}} derived keys.

40|$|Aerogel wafers {{were made}} using an {{evaporative}} drying procedure. The main steps were sol formulation, gelation, aging, capping, and drying. Of these, {{the most critical}} step was drying. Both {{the rate of evaporation}} and temperature of the system must be controlled for best results. Aerogel materials should be benchmarked against more traditional foams and current systems may have to be redesigned to make best use of aerogel strengths. Finally, the flexibility of this procedure lends itself to producing aerogel materials for many uses other than insulation. <b>Such</b> <b>uses</b> <b>may</b> include catalysis, sensing, and composite materials...|$|R
50|$|Producers or {{creators of}} parodies of a copyrighted work have been sued for {{infringement}} by {{the targets of}} their ridicule, even though <b>such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> be protected as fair use. These fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and satire, or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on {{the application of the}} four fair use factors.|$|E
50|$|The textile {{historian}} Sarah Randles {{argues that}} the two quilts were originally one large quilt, measuring a monumental 6 metres high by 4 metres wide, and that significant sections are missing. Randles' plan for the quilt suggests that the scenes would have been arranged clockwise in the border, with the central images paired and reading bottom to top. Ultraviolet light tests on the Bargello quilt revealed traces of calcium on the reverse, which {{could have come from}} its use as a wall hanging, though <b>such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> not have been the original intention.|$|E

The derived key is used instead of the original key or password as the key to the system. The values of the salt and the number of iterations (if it is not fixed) are stored with the hashed password or sent as plaintext with an encrypted message.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships approves {{mahogany}} for use {{in small}} boats and high-speed boats that require a wood easy to work, medium in weight but adequate in strength, with low shrinking, swelling, and warping characteristics, and high decay resistance. In 1966, mahogany still held an important place {{in the construction of}} yachts, launches, motorboats, and small boats of various kinds. In large ships its use is confined largely to interior trim, paneling, and furniture. In a large luxury liner, the volume for <b>such</b> <b>uses</b> <b>may</b> be considerable.|$|R

Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. A study conducted along the lower Colorado River in Arizona, the United States found that hydroseeding could be used to restore riparian vegetation in cleared land.|$|R
50|$|Surreptitious use of key-logging {{software}} {{is on the}} rise, as of this writing. Use of such software may be in direct and explicit violation of local laws, such as the U.S. Patriot Act, under which <b>such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> constitute wire-tapping. This could have severe penalties including jail time. See spyware for a better description of user-consent issues and various fraud statutes.

5000|$|Whips used without painful stimulus, as an {{extension}} of the human hand or arm, are a visual command, or to tap an animal, or to exert pressure. <b>Such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> be related to operant conditioning where the subject is conditioned to associate the whip with irritation, discomfort or pain, but in other cases, a whip can be used as a simple tool to provide a cue connected to positive reinforcement for compliant behavior.

50|$|Traditionally bênê ’ēlîm {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as 'sons of the mighty', 'mighty ones', for ’El can mean 'mighty', though <b>such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> be metaphorical (compare the English expression by God awful). It is possible also that the expression ’ēlîm in both places descends from an archaic stock phrase in which ’lm was a singular form with the m-enclitic and therefore to be translated as 'sons of Ēl'. The m-enclitic appears elsewhere in the Tanakh and in other Semitic languages. Its meaning is unknown, possibly simply emphasis. It appears in similar contexts in Ugaritic texts where the expression bn ’il alternates with bn ’ilm, but both must mean 'sons of Ēl'. That phrase with m-enclitic also appears in Phoenician inscriptions {{as late as the}} fifth century BCE.|$|E
25|$|In {{pipeline}} compressors {{of natural}} gas to move the gas from the production site to the consumer. Centrifugal compressors for <b>such</b> <b>uses</b> <b>may</b> be one- or multi-stage and driven by large gas turbines. Standards set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed an API-style. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of horsepower (HP). Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance {{of natural gas}} pipeline centrifugal compressors.|$|R

50|$|Dandy {{brush or}} Hard-bristled brush: A stiff-bristled brush {{is used to}} remove the dirt, hair and other {{material}} stirred up by the curry. Brushes {{are used in the}} direction of the horses hair coat growth, usually in short strokes from front to back, except at the flanks, where the hair grows in a different pattern. The best quality dandy brushes are made of stiff natural bristles such as rice stems, though they wear out quickly. Plastic-bristled dandy brushes are more common. Dandy brushes can usually be used on the legs, but many horses object to a stiff brush being used on the head. Some dandy brushes do double duty as a Water Brush, when moistened in water and used to wet down the hair coat, mane or tail. <b>Such</b> <b>use</b> <b>may</b> include creating quarter marks for show.|$|E

40|$|Although {{substantial}} literature {{exists on}} the properties of formal grammars, much less has been written {{on the use of}} grammars for describing the languages which they are capable of explaining, Thus we see a well-developed theory concerning the expressive (generative) power of different kinds of formal grammars and powerful algorithmic methods (analytical) for the languages defined by these grammars. For natural spoken and written languages, grammars have been used for explaining their structure but for the two-dimensional generalization to designs, pictures, images, and fine arts, which has been known since 1964, almost no use has been made of grammars. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to call attention to the powerful dormant tools that can be used in the design arts. Some of the benefits of using these tools for describing existing (natural) design languages are discussed. How <b>such</b> <b>uses</b> <b>may</b> direct us from the more formal design arts into the fine arts is discussed by reporting progress on building a grammar for a class of contemporary paintings. ...|$|R
