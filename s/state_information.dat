25|$|A state monad {{allows a}} {{programmer}} to attach <b>state</b> <b>information</b> {{of any type}} to a calculation. Given any value type, the corresponding type in the state monad is a function which accepts a state, then outputs a new state (of type s) along with a return value (of type t). This is similar to an environment monad, except that it also return a new state, and thus allows modeling a mutable environment.|$|E

25|$|OSPF is an {{interior}} gateway protocol (IGP) for routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets solely within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link <b>state</b> <b>information</b> from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network. The topology {{is presented as a}} routing table to the Internet layer which routes packets based solely on their destination IP address. OSPF supports Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E

The USIA's mission was [...] "to understand, inform and influence foreign publics in {{promotion of the}} national interest, and to broaden the dialogue between Americans and U.S. institutions, and their counterparts abroad". The United <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> Agency (USIA) was established [...] "to streamline the U.S. government's overseas information programs, and make them more effective". The United <b>States</b> <b>Information</b> Agency was the largest full-service public relations organization in the world, spending over $2 billion per year to highlight America’s view, while diminishing the Soviet’s side through about 150 different countries.|$|R
25|$|A latch or a {{flip-flop}} is {{a circuit}} that has two stable states {{and can be}} used to store <b>state</b> <b>information.</b> They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.|$|E
25|$|One {{particular}} {{weakness of}} this method with OpenSSL is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to AES128-CBC-SHA256, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session. This means that the <b>state</b> <b>information</b> (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself. Of particular concern is OpenSSL's storage of the keys in an application-wide context (SSL_CTX), i.e. {{for the life of}} the application, and not allowing for re-keying of the AES128-CBC-SHA256 TLS session tickets without resetting the application-wide OpenSSL context (which is uncommon, error-prone and often requires manual administrative intervention).|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} {{only one}} {{program would be}} running at a time, the engineers were able to ignore the concept of reentrancy; the ability for a program (or library) to be stopped at any point, asked to do something else, {{and then return to}} the original task. In the case of QuickDraw for example, this means the system can store <b>state</b> <b>information</b> internally, like the current location of the window or the line style, knowing it would only change under control of the running program. Taking this one step further, the engineers left most of this state inside the application rather than in QuickDraw, thus eliminating the need to copy this data between the application and library.|$|E

25|$|Terminal Server is {{the server}} {{component}} of Terminal services. It handles {{the job of}} authenticating clients, as well as making the applications available remotely. It is also entrusted with the job of restricting the clients according {{to the level of}} access they have. The Terminal Server respects the configured software restriction policies, so as to restrict the availability of certain software to only a certain group of users. The remote session information is stored in specialized directories, called Session Directory which is stored at the server. Session directories are used to store <b>state</b> <b>information</b> about a session, and can be used to resume interrupted sessions. The terminal server also has to manage these directories. Terminal Servers {{can be used in a}} cluster as well.|$|E
25|$|When Windows 95 started up, MS-DOS loaded, {{processed}} CONFIG.SYS, launched COMMAND.COM, ran AUTOEXEC.BAT {{and finally}} ran WIN.COM. The WIN.COM program used MS-DOS {{to load the}} virtual machine manager, read SYSTEM.INI, load the virtual device drivers, and then turn off any running copies of EMM386 and switch into protected mode. Once in protected mode, the virtual device drivers (VxDs) transferred all <b>state</b> <b>information</b> from MS-DOS to the 32-bit file system manager, and then shut off MS-DOS. These VxDs allow Windows 9x to interact with hardware resources directly, as providing low-level functionalities such as 32-bit disk access and memory management. All future file system operations would get routed to the 32-bit file system manager. In Windows ME, win.com was no longer executed during the startup process; instead it went directly to execute VMM32.VXD from IO.SYS.|$|E
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel <b>state</b> <b>information</b> (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E
