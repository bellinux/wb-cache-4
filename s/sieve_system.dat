From 1995 to 1996 I worked on the mechanical design team for a prototypical Oxygen Concentrator.

40|$|A {{physical}} separation method (i. e. sieving) was investigated to determine {{particle size distribution}} in non-radioactive sludge slurry simulants {{with the goal of}} implementation into the SRNL (Savannah River National Laboratory) shielded cells for use with radioactive sludge slurries. The investigation included obtaining the necessary experimental equipment, developing accessory equipment for use with the sieve shaker (to be able to sieve simulant slurries with aqueous solutions), sieving three different simulant slurries through a number of sieves and determining the particle size distribution gravimetrically, and developing a sufficient cleaning protocol of the sieves for re-use. The experimental protocol involved successive sieving of a NIST standard (to check the particle size retention of the sieves) and three non-radioactive slurry simulants (Batch 3 Tank 40 Test 3, Tank 40 Drum 3 and CETL Sludge Batch 2, which had been previously characterized by Microtrac analysis) through smaller and smaller sieves (150 microns x 5 microns) via use of the wet <b>sieving</b> <b>system</b> or by hand. For each of the three slurries, duplicate experiments were carried out using filtered supernate and DI water (to check the accuracy of the method versus Microtrac data) to sieve the slurry. Particle size determinations using the wet <b>sieving</b> <b>system</b> with DI water agree well with Microtrac data on a volume basis and in some cases the sieving data may be more accurate particularly if the material sieved had large particles. A correction factor had to be applied to data obtained from experiments done with supernate due to the dissolved solids which dried upon the sieves in the drying stage of the experiments. Upon subtraction of the correction factors, the experimental results were very similar to those obtained with DI water. It should be noted that approximately 250 mL of each of three simulant slurries was necessary to have enough filtered supernate available to carry out the experiments. The experimental results for the slurries are below with Microtrac data. The design of the experimental equipment was sufficient initially, but some pieces of the equipment began failing over time due to the caustic nature of the supernate and the vibrations from the sieve shaker. It is therefore recommended that upgrades to the experimental equipment be done before implementation into the SRNL shielded cells. Theses upgrades include using manipulator friendly connections, changing brass parts for stainless steel parts, using Teflon rather than polycarbonate, and possibly a change of pumps used to re-circulate the sieving fluid...|$|R

40|$|Conventional size {{segregation}} or screening in batch mode, using stacked vibrated screens, {{is often a}} time-consuming process. Utilization of centrifugal force instead of gravity as the primary body force can significantly shorten the time to segregate feedstock into a set of different-sized fractions. Likewise, under reduced gravity or microgravity, a centrifugal <b>sieve</b> <b>system</b> would function {{as well as it}} does terrestrially. When vibratory and mechanical blade sieving screens designed for terrestrial conditions were tested under lunar gravity conditions, they did not function well. The centrifugal sieving design of this technology overcomes the issues that prevented sieves designed for terrestrial conditions from functioning under reduced gravity. These sieves feature a rotating outer (cylindrical or conical) screen wall, rotating fast enough for the centrifugal forces near the wall to hold granular material against the rotating screen. Conventional centrifugal sieves have a stationary screen and rapidly rotating blades that shear the granular solid near the stationary screen, and effect the sieving process assisted by the airflow inside the unit. The centrifugal sieves of this new design may (or may not) have an inner blade or blades, moving relative to the rotating wall screen. Some continuous flow embodiments would have no inner auger or blades, but achieve axial motion through vibration. In all cases, the shearing action is gentler than conventional centrifugal sieves, which have very high velocity differences between the stationary outer screen and the rapidly rotating blades. The new design does not depend on airflow in the sieving unit, so it will function just as well in vacuum as in air. One advantage of the innovation for batch sieving is that a batch-mode centrifugal sieve may accomplish the same sieving operation in much less time than a conventional stacked set of vibrated screens (which utilize gravity as the primary driving force for size separation). In continuous mode, the centrifugal sieves can provide steady streams of fine and coarse material separated from a mixed feedstock flow stream. The centrifugal sieves can be scaled to any desired size and/or mass flow rate. Thus, they could be made in sizes suitable for small robotic exploratory missions, or for semi-permanent processing of regolith for extraction of volatiles of minerals. An advantage of the continuous-mode system is that it can be made with absolutely no gravity flow components for feeding material into, or for extracting the separated size streams from, the centrifugal sieve. Thus, the system is capable of functioning in a true microgravity environment. Another advantage of the continuous-mode system is that some embodiments of the innovation have no internal blades or vanes, and thus, can be designed to handle a very wide range of feedstock sizes, including occasional very large oversized pieces, without jamming or seizing up...|$|E

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that polypeptides present within the phloem sap traffic cell to cell from the companion cells, where they are synthesized, into the sieve tube via plasmodesmata. Coinjection of fluorescently labeled dextrans along with size-fractionated Cucurbita maxima phloem proteins, {{ranging in size from}} 10 to 200 kDa, as well as injection of individual fluorescently labeled phloem proteins, provided unambiguous evidence that these proteins have the capacity to interact with mesophyll plasmodesmata in cucurbit cotyledons to induce an increase in size exclusion limit and traffic cell to cell. Plasmodesmal size exclusion limit increased to greater than 20 kDa, but less than 40 kDa, irrespective {{of the size of the}} injected protein, indicating that partial protein unfolding may be a requirement for transport. A threshold concentration in the 20 – 100 nM range was required for cell-to-cell transport indicating that phloem proteins have a high affinity for the mesophyll plasmodesmal binding site(s).

These results are discussed in terms of the requirements for regulated protein trafficking between companion cells and the <b>sieve</b> tube <b>system.</b> As the threshold value for plasmodesmal transport of phloem sap proteins falls within the same range as many plant hormones, the possibility is discussed that some of these proteins may act as long-distance signaling molecules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this thesis, nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of noble gas atoms and methane molecule {{is applied to the}} structure studies of solid microporous materials (molecular sieves). This is an indirect method, where changes to the spectral parameters (i. e. isotropic and anisotropic nuclear shielding tensors) of the adsorbate induced by the investigated environment are measured at variable temperatures and adsorbate loadings. The data are analyzed concentrating on lineshape fitting methods and the correlations with the sieve framework parameters are examined. The studies in this thesis involve resonance signals mostly from 129 Xe and 13 C nuclei. Molecular sieves, such as zeolites, are typically composed of oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. They are found in the nature, but in most cases they are manufactured synthetically. These materials have a wide variety of industrial applications, such as dehydration, odour and pollutant removal, ion exchange, water softening, etc. The size and shape of molecular-size intracrystallite cavities and channels vary considerably. This thesis focuses on aluminophosphate molecular sieves and their silicon-containing counterparts. In molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>systems,</b> the effects of intra- and intercrystallite motions and exchange of adsorbates on their NMR spectra is discussed.

A technique employing pulsed field gradients to reveal shielding anisotropy component of methane from overlapping resonances from less restricted methane is used. The effects of cations located in molecular sieve frameworks are studied and discussed. From the fast exchange effects on spectral data the intercrystallite cavity sizes are estimated.

A cross-check of UF- 100, dipstick, and microscopic sediment data was performed in 1001 urine samples. Good agreements (P < 0. 001) were obtained between UF- 100 and dipstick data for erythrocytes (r � 0. 636) and leukocytes (r � 0. 785). Even in urine with low conductivity, the UF- 100 could detect lysed erythrocytes. The UF- 100 bacterial count was higher among nitrite-positive urine samples (P < 0. 0001) and {{was positively correlated with}} the UF- 100 leukocyte count (r � 0. 745; P < 0. 001). In stored urine (24 h), bacterial counts increased, whereas the forward light scatter of leukocytes decreased (P < 0. 01). Casts and yeast cells reported by the UF- 100 should be confirmed by microscopic review because false positives occurred. We suggest that a computerassisted cross-check of UF- 100 and dipstick data allows a clinically acceptable <b>sieving</b> <b>system</b> to reduce the workload of microscopic sediment urinalysis. Microscopic urine sediment analysis has been the gold standard for examining urine cells and particles. However, it is imprecise and has wide interobserver variability (1). Moreover, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming. These problems have led to the widely used “sieve concept”, which states that if the results of chemical screening with dipsticks are negative, then microscopic examination is unnecessary. Such simplification, however, may lead to substantial losses in diagnostic yield (2 – 6). Automation seems the answer to the need to improve both the accuracy and the productivity of urine sediment analysis (7 – 11). For this purpose, a flow cytometer-based walkaway instrument, Sysmex UF- 100, that performs automated microscopic urinalysis was developed recently...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Molecular Plant Sciences, Washington State UniversityThe Pressure Flow Hypothesis, {{presented}} in 1930 by Ernst Münch, {{is the most}} accepted model for photoassimilate translocation by the phloem of plants. Net photosynthetic sugar production occurs in source tissues, often mature leaves. These photoassimilates are transported along the <b>sieve</b> tube <b>system</b> to consumptive sink tissues such as roots, meristems, and seeds. Münch’s hypothesis states that a sugar concentration gradient between sources and sinks osmotically generates a hydrostatic pressure differential that drives sap flow. If phloem sap is driven by a pressure differential, geometries of the <b>sieve</b> tube <b>system,</b> and the rheology of phloem sap should scale to equations describing pressure flow in low Reynolds number tubes. Imaging methods developed in this work provide robust geometric and rheological data, expanding the phloem biophysics toolkit. Additionally, insight into a mysterious phenomenon in which transient inhibition of translocation is induced by sudden localized stem chilling is presented. A novel application of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) allowed simultaneous measurement of sap velocity, and diffusivity of a phloem-mobile probe. This technique was used to investigate the cold shock phenomenon directly {{at the site of}} cold stimulus at higher resolution than was previously possible. Cold-induced sap velocity declines were not accompanied by similar reductions in sap viscosity. A Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) method was also developed, providing direct in vivo measurements of viscosity in translocating phloem sap. Values obtained indicate phloem sap viscosities of less than 2 mPas, consistent with sugar concentrations estimated by previous time-intensive exudate analyses. Questions regarding pressure flow in trees, where tube lengths are very long and source phloem turgor pressures have been measured as surprisingly low were also addressed. Sieve element lengths, diameters, and sieve plate angles were measured in 3 positions of 22 different angiosperms. These conductivity factors were large, and scaled to stem length in trees. Because pressure flow equations indicate an inversely proportional relationship between conductivity and pressure, these data are consistent with pressure driven flow as the mechanism for translocation in trees.

The elastomer is 'wrapped' around the sensitizing system and hence shields the dyes from polar components, such as water, and balances the sorption of solvents and reagents. This results in an enhanced oxygenate yield for water sensitive dyes. Finally, a new porphyrin, 5, 15 -(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) - 10, 20 -(4 -allyloxyphenyl) porphyrin, was synthesized and chemically anchored to PDMS, resulting in a highly active heterogeneous singlet oxygen generating system.

40|$|In food {{industry}} {{a couple of}} techniques are available for separating impurities from the raw material. Besides shakers, magnets and <b>sieves</b> also optical <b>systems</b> are used. All of them have their own pros and cons and even when combining these methods {{it is impossible to}} detect all impurities. For instance, buried pieces of glass, plastic or rubber, which can have almost the particle size of the bulk material, are hard to extract. Hence, applying a radar concept based on dielectric anomalies, {{it should be possible to}} detect such particles and thus to increase further the purity of the bulk material...|$|R
30|$|Research on {{flowering}} time {{regulation in}} rice expands {{the field of}} mobile molecular signaling in plants. Florigen is {{also referred to as}} a flowering hormone because of its mobile nature and the universality of its flowering promotion activity. Using the analogy of the canonical plant hormone studies, the next step in florigen research would be understanding Hd 3 a/FT synthesis, transport, identification of receptors, and subsequent cellular signaling. Virtually nothing is known about Hd 3 a long-distance trafficking. How Hd 3 a in companion cells is transferred to <b>sieve</b> element <b>systems,</b> how the direction of movement in phloem is determined, and how Hd 3 a targets the SAM after unloading from {{the upper end of the}} phloem are all open questions. Flowering time research has also identified many important genes as resources for breeding. The genetic basis of natural variation or artificial selection in flowering time genes, including genes that are or were lost through the process of domestication, should contribute not only to a further understanding of the mechanism of flowering but also to future breeding applications.|$|R
30|$|The {{homogenised}} pollen pellet samples (2.3. 1) {{were treated}} by separation methods differentiating in size using a wet <b>sieving</b> cascade <b>system</b> (Fritsch Analysette Pro, metal meshes and micro wet sieving, sieves of 10  cm diameter). Stepwise wet sieving was applied with mesh widths of 180  µm, 125  µm, and 60  µm to concentrate the maize pollen {{in the sample}} fraction 60 – 125  µm. This sample fraction was sieved until the suspension was transparent, transferred to a 500 -ml Erlenmeyer flacon, mixed and distributed equally to 50 -ml centrifugation tubes (e.[*]g. Greiner). After centrifugation (2, 000 rpm, 5 min) the water volume in the tubes was reduced nearly to the sediment containing the maize pollen fraction, filled up by 50  % glycerol and mixed. 500  µl of the suspension were used for microscopic analysis to control {{the quality and quantity}} of the maize pollen and total pollen contents. The majority of the maize pollen was intact in all samples. Representative subsamples of 2  ml were stored at – 18  °C until subsequent PCR analysis.|$|R
40|$|Included {{among the}} many signals that traffic through the <b>sieve</b> element <b>system</b> are {{full-length}} mRNAs that function {{to respond to the}} environment and to regulate development. In potato, several mRNAs that encode transcription factors from the three-amino-loop-extension (TALE) superfamily move from leaves to roots and stolons via the phloem to control growth and signal the onset of tuber formation. This RNA transport is enhanced by short-day conditions and is facilitated by RNA-binding proteins from the polypyrimidine tract-binding family of proteins. Regulation of growth is mediated by three mobile mRNAs that arise from vasculature in the leaf. One mRNA, StBEL 5, functions to activate growth, whereas two other, sequence-related StBEL’s, StBEL 11 and StBEL 29, function antagonistically to repress StBEL 5 target genes involved in promoting tuber development. This dynamic system utilizes closely-linked phloem-mobile mRNAs to control growth in developing potato tubers. In creating a complex signaling pathway, potato has evolved a long-distance transport system that regulates underground organ development through closely-associated, full-length mRNAs that function as either activators or repressors...|$|R
