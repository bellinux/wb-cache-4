5|$|Supply {{problems}} {{in the aftermath of}} the war meant that the concrete piers were founded on jarrah timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure. Also, the cement that was used on the bridges had to be sourced from seven different sources, which led to different durability for different parts of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, the Angle Mills {{site was}} the largest <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> factory in the world. In 1892, in {{addition}} to steelmaking, the company had a foundry (a mile from Consett at Crookhall) capable of making 150 tons of iron castings per week, and a brickworks capable of making around 12,000 bricks per week. The estate had grown to roughly 2,700 workers' cottages. The company ran a 16-bed infirmary to treat injured workers. The 6,000 workers were paid an average of £5.33 a month. The company continually invested in modern equipment, such as a Roots blower (a powerful air pump) that was acquired in 1893.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a fracture criterion for the impact fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in a car body. For the accurate prediction of crash characteristics of car bodies by computer-aided engineering (CAE), it is also necessary to examine the behavior and fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to impact loads. Although the actual impact fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in cars is complicated, for simplifying the problem it might be classified into the shear fracture and the extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> Attention is given to the extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in this study. The extractive behavior and fracture of three kinds of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> used for cars are examined in experiments and numerical simulations. The impact extraction test of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> jointed by a bolt is performed using the one-bar method, together with the static test. In order to understand the mechanism of extractive fracture process of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> numerical simulations by a FEM code LS-DYNA are also carried out. The obtained results suggest that a stress-based fracture criterion may be developed for the impact extractive fracture of jointed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of a bolted joint used in a car body. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Double skin {{composite}} (DSC) panels are constructed by filling concrete between two <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> welded with stud shear connectors at a regular spacing. <b>Steel</b> <b>plates</b> in DSC panels used as two-way slabs or shearwalls may buckle locally between stud shear connectors when subjected to in-plane biaxial compression. This paper investigates {{the local and}} post-local buckling behaviour of biaxially compressed <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> restrained by shear connectors and concrete in DSC panels by using the finite element modelling technique. Local buckling coefficients are obtained for <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with various aspect ratios, biaxial loading and boundary conditions by incorporating the shear stiffness effect of stud shear connectors. These buckling coefficients {{can be used to}} determine limiting width-to-thickness ratios for <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and the distribution of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material non-linear analysis is undertaken to quantify the post-local buckling strength of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> under biaxial compression. The initial imperfections of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> and non-linear shear-slip characteristics of stud shear connectors are taken into account in the post-local buckling analysis. Based on numerical results, biaxial strength interaction curves and formulae are developed for the ultimate strength design of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in double {{skin composite}} construction...|$|R
5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge {{on the deck}} of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: <b>Steel</b> <b>plates</b> {{in double}} skin {{composite}} (DSC) panels are restrained by a concrete core and welded stud shear connectors at discrete positions. Local buckling of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in DSC panels may {{occur in a}} unilateral mode between stud shear connectors when subjected to combined states of stresses. This paper studies the local and postlocal buckling strength of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in DSC panels under biaxial compression and in-plane shear by using the finite element method. Critical local buckling interaction relationships are presented for <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with various boundary conditions that include the shear stiffness effects of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material nonlinear analysis is employed to investigate the postlocal buckling interaction strength of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in biaxial compression and shear. The initial imperfections of <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> material yielding, and the nonlinear shear–slip behavior of stud shear connectors are considered in the nonlinear analysis. Design models for critical buckling and ultimate strength interactions are proposed for determining the maximum stud spacing and ultimate strength of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in DSC panels...|$|R

Reinforced concrete beams were preloaded to 85 % of their ultimate capacity and subsequently repaired by bonding <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of different widths. Different widths of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> were used {{in order to determine}} the width-to-thickness ratio that will promote ductile behaviour. It is shown that strengthening of significantly cracked beams by bonding <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> is possible and beams can be restored to stiffness and strength values superior to those of the original unplated beams...|$|R
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|E

Although internal politics hampered Chinese modernization, American naval power produced a major reform in Japan which bore fruit during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima when the Japanese {{were able to}} decisively defeat Russia. The great navies initially focused their efforts on constructing great dreadnoughts and battleships, but these fought inconclusively in the First World War. By contrast, the much cheaper German U-boats showed that submarines could cripple shipping even in waters nominally controlled by the enemy. Convoys, intelligence, and airborne ASW won a hard-fought victory in the Second World War's Battle of the Atlantic, but developments in applied physics meant that by the 1960s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines were being maintained on constant patrol as a second-strike force along with {{a second set of}} hunters intended to counter them. Meanwhile, the battles of the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters of the war had shown that air power was capable of overcoming the strongest warships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: The {{availability}} of high strength steels and concrete {{leads to the}} use of thin <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> tubular beam-columns. However, the use of thin <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in composite beam-columns gives a rise to local buckling that would appreciably reduce the strength and ductility performance of the members. This paper studies the critical local and post-local buckling behavior of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in concrete-filled thin-walled steel tubular beam-columns by using the finite element analysis method. Geometric and material nonlinear analyses are performed to investigate the critical local and post-local buckling strengths of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> under compression and in-plane bending. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses presented in <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> material yielding and strain hardening are taken into account in the nonlinear analysis. Based on the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analyses, a set of design formulas are proposed for determining the critical local buckling and ultimate strengths of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> tubular beam-columns. In addition, effective width formulas are developed for the ultimate strength design of clamped <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> under non-uniform compression. The accuracy of the proposed design formulas is established by comparisons with available solutions. The proposed design formulas can be used directly in the design of composite beam-columns and adopted in the advanced analysis of concrete-filled thin-walled steel tubular beam-columns to account for local buckling effects...|$|R
