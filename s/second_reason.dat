5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is {{the general}} path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|E
5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> the {{district}} is significant is its collection of buildings and their architectural styles (Criterion C). Most of these buildings were constructed during the Indiana Gas Boom in the late 19th century or early 20th century, and have many of their original features. Three styles of architecture, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque Revival are all well represented, and additional styles can also be found.|$|E
5|$|After Italy, Hungary was {{the first}} European country where the renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came {{directly}} from Italy during the Quattrocento to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks {{to the development of}} early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E

50|$|Due to reasons still debated by {{the physics}} {{community}} {{because of the}} lack of methods to observe clusters, Rydberg matter is highly stable against disintegration by emission of radiation; the characteristic lifetime of a cluster at n = 12 is 25 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Reasons</b> given include the lack of overlap between excited and ground states, the forbidding of transitions between them and exchange-correlation effects hindering emission through necessitating tunnelling that causes a long delay in excitation decay. Excitation plays a role in determining lifetimes, with a higher excitation giving a longer lifetime; n = 80 gives a lifetime comparable to the age of the Universe.|$|R

25|$|MVI's {{simplicity}} {{was due to}} two reasons. Firstly, Digital {{had determined}} that the Alpha 21164 was already capable of performing DVD decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in MPEG-2 encoding. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was the requirement to retain the fast cycle times of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation's clock frequency.|$|E

It does so by putting centre stage {{the notion of a}} ‘bipolar second person relation’, and examining ways of giving it substance suggested by the authors of these papers. In particular, it focuses on claims made (and denied) in these papers (a) about the existence and/or nature of second person thought, <b>second</b> person <b>reasons</b> for action and <b>second</b> person <b>reasons</b> for belief and (b) about possible connections among thought-theoretical, ethical and epistemological issues and debates in this area. ...|$|R
25|$|The first {{contribution}} to this was a large unilateral reduction which began with an announcement by Gorbachev in December 1988; these reductions continued {{as a result of}} the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and in accordance with Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaties. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> for the decline was the widespread resistance to conscription which developed as the policy of glasnost revealed to the public the true conditions inside the Soviet army and the widespread abuse of conscript soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address the unfairness of the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|All etched or {{sintered}} anodes have a {{much higher}} surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the later capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, {{by a factor of}} up to 200 for non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors. The large surface compared to a smooth one is the <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> for the relatively high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other capacitor families.|$|E

5000|$|The opinion will ordinarily {{state the}} {{conclusions}} of law, but will not provide reasoning. This reflects {{the role of the}} foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool. The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law). [...] Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a <b>second,</b> <b>reasoned,</b> opinion. In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.|$|R

By manufacturing the aircraft in China, Cessna reported that it saved US$71,000 in production costs per aircraft produced. A <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was that Cessna at that time had no plant capacity available in the USA.|$|E
25|$|It {{is easier}} to detect planets around low-mass stars, for two reasons: First, these stars are more {{affected}} by gravitational tug from planets. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is that low-mass main-sequence stars generally rotate relatively slowly. Fast rotation makes spectral-line data less clear because half of the star quickly rotates away from observer's viewpoint while the other half approaches. Detecting planets around more massive stars is easier if the star has left the main sequence, because leaving the main sequence slows down the star's rotation.|$|E
25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is so that teams can scout out the competition and get a feel for that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not just those competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E
25|$|A <b>second</b> common <b>reason</b> {{for this}} kind of {{discrimination}} is when the worker or consumer is not cost-efficient. For example, some stores in the US Northwest do not stock ethnic foods, despite requests for such, since they feel the cost is too high for too low a return.|$|R
50|$|A <b>second</b> major <b>reason</b> for {{the signing}} of the treaty was that smallpox, {{recently}} introduced by settlers, had spread through the area, killing many of the Cree who had no immunity to this new disease.

25|$|One of {{the causes}} of the War of 1812 may have been an American desire to annex or {{threaten}} to annex British Canada in order to stop the Indian raids into the Midwest, expel Britain from North America, and gain additional land.

The American failure to occupy any significant part of Canada prevented them from annexing it for the <b>second</b> <b>reason,</b> which was largely ended by the Era of Good Feelings, which ensued after the war between Britain and the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is {{to satisfy the}} larval requirements. The workers fly off {{early in the morning}} to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant {{early in the morning and}} are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.|$|E
