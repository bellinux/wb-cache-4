The two exceptions are [...] "Marine" [...] and [...] "Mouvement", which are vers libre. [...] These two poems are remarkable {{not only as}} exceptions within Illuminations itself, but as two of the first free verse poems written in the French language. [...] Within the genres of prose poetry and vers libre, the poems of Illuminations bear many stylistic distinctions. Though influenced by the earlier prose poems of Charles Baudelaire, the prose poems differ starkly from Baudelaire's in that they lack prosaic elements such as linear storytelling and transitions. Because of these differences, Rimbaud's prose poems are denser and more poetic than Baudelaire's. [...] These differences {{also contribute to the}} surrealist quality of Illuminations. Though Rimbaud predated surrealism, he is said to have written in a surrealistic style due to the hallucinatory, dreamlike aspect of many of the poems. [...] Another aspect of Rimbaud's style, which also contributes to the visionary quality of the poems, is his use of words for their evocative quality rather than their literal meaning. [...] In addition to these stylistic qualities, Illuminations is rich with <b>sensory</b> <b>imagery.</b> [...] A puzzling aspect of Rimbaud's style is his use of foreign words within the French text of Illuminations. For example, the poem [...] "Being Beauteous" [...] has an English title, even in the original French. Rimbaud biographer Graham Robb suggests that the presence of words from languages like English and German are due in part to Rimbaud's travels. Apparently, as he learned languages, Rimbaud kept lists of words he wished to use in poems.|$|E

40|$|The Mawu {{people of}} eastern Ghana make common use of ideophones: marked words that depict <b>sensory</b> <b>imagery.</b> Ideophones have been {{described}} as “poetry in ordinary language, ” yet the shadow of Lévy-Bruhl, who assigned such words to the realm of primitivity, has loomed large over linguistics and literary theory alike.

We studied the imagery-induced modulation of the vestibulospinal (VS) reflex earlier component in highly (Highs) and low hypnotizable subjects (Lows), as it is not affected by voluntary control, its amplitude depends on the stimulus intensity, and the plane of body sway depends on the position of the head with respect to the trunk. Results showed that the effects of the "obstructive" imagery of anaesthesia are different from those elicited by the "constructive" imagery of head rotation. Indeed, both Highs and Lows having their face forward and reporting high vividness of imagery experienced anaesthesia and reduced their VS reflex amplitude in the frontal plane, while only Highs changed the plane of body sway according to the imagined head rotation that is from the frontal to the sagittal one. These effects cannot be voluntary and should be attributed to translation of <b>sensory</b> <b>imagery</b> into the corresponding real perception...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{transmitting}} ballet’s complex technique to young dancers {{can interfere with}} the innate processes {{that give rise to}} efficient, expressive and harmonious movement. With the intention of identifying possible solutions, this article draws on research across the fields of neurology, psychology, motor learning, and education, and considers their relevance to ballet as an art form, a technique, and a training methodology. The integration of dancers’ technique and expressivity is a core theme throughout the paper. A brief outline of the historical development of ballet’s aesthetics and training methods leads into factors that influence dancers’ performance. An exploration {{of the role of the}} neuromotor system in motor learning and the acquisition of expert skills reveals the roles of <b>sensory</b> awareness, <b>imagery,</b> and intention in cuing efficient, expressive movement. It also indicates potentially detrimental effects of conscious muscle control, explicit learning and persistent naïve beliefs. Finally, the paper presents a new theory regarding the acquisition of ballet skills. Recontextualisation theory proposes that placing a problematic task within a new context may engender a new conceptual approach and/or sensory intention, and hence the genesis of new motor programs; and that these new programs may lead to performance that is more efficient, more rewarding for the dancer, more pleasing aesthetically, and more expressive. From an anecdotal point of view, this theory appears to be supported by the progress of many dancers at various stages of their dancing lives...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMotor {{imagery and}} {{perception}} – considered generally as forms of motor simulation – share overlapping neural representations with motor production. While much {{research has focused}} on the extent of this “common coding,” less {{attention has been paid to}} how these overlapping representations interact.

In the first part of this review we describe interactions between motor production and motor simulation, and explore apparent regulatory mechanisms that balance these processes. Next, we consider the somatosensory system. Numerous studies now support a “sensory mirror system” comprised of neural representations activated by either afferent sensation or vicarious sensation. In the second part of this review we summarize evidence for shared representations of sensation and <b>sensory</b> simulation (including <b>imagery</b> and observed sensation), and suggest that similar interactions and regulation of simulation occur in the somatosensory domain as in the motor domain.

These regulatory mechanisms are frequently revealed by cases of brain injury but can also be employed to facilitate sensorimotor rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Pleasure {{is a key}} {{component}} of food consumption. It has traditionally been approached as one-dimensional, largely synonymous with taste. However, recent findings suggests that pleasure may be multi-dimensional, composed of social, emotional, intellectual, and <b>sensory</b> pleasures. Mental <b>imagery,</b> identified as an important component of hedonic consumption, may provide insight into the nature of pleasures experienced in food consumption. The goal of this thesis is to (1) determine whether multiple pleasures are identifiable and impact food consumption experiences and (2) whether these experiences vary for men and women, as sex is known to have an important impact on food consumption. Study 1 was largely exploratory and provided valuable insight into the types of pleasures and mental images associated with food and how these differ by sex. Study 2 was an experimental study designed to further our understanding of the impact of pleasure and mental imagery on consumption choices. In this study participants were required to view two advertisements for similar products, one familiar and one novel, and rate their attitude toward the ad, their attitude toward the product, and their purchase intention. Results indicate that the novelty of the product (whether the product is novel or familiar) as well as imagery (whether imagery is absent, is emotional, or is sensory) both have significant effects on these measures. However, the results for sex were not significant, requiring further investigation on this topic...|$|R
50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{involuntary}} memory, researchers are mainly interested {{in the concept of}} these trauma-related intrusions, which generally involved some form of re-experiencing the event, including a <b>sensory</b> component (e.g., <b>imagery</b> in any modality be it visual, auditory etc.). These intrusions, often termed, “Flashbacks” make the victim feel as though they are reliving the trauma, and cause high levels of emotional arousal, and the sense of an impending threat. Typically, they are parts of the traumatic event that were most salient at the time, known as “hotspots” and have the definitive feature that they cause high levels of emotional distress, and may be difficult to recall deliberately. Although this is a defining feature of PTSD, intrusive memories are also frequently encountered in anxiety-based disorders, psychotic disorders and even within the general population. Regardless of the context in which they are encountered, intrusions tend to have the same central feature; that the stored information is being recalled involuntarily. It is thought that intrusions arise when an individual encounters stimuli similar to the stimuli that were processed and stored during the trauma, thus triggering the memory into the conscious mind. A common example is one in which someone who has the victim of a car crash, upon hearing the screeching of tires experiences a flashback of their own collision, as if they are back at the original event.|$|R

The paper’s alternative account is used in explaining various pieces of phenomenological and behavioural data concerning visualisation.

40|$|Sight-reading at {{the piano}} {{requires}} coordination of multiple modalities—visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Visual feedback (obtained {{by looking at the}} keyboard and the fingers) is usually regarded as one means by which pianists guide musical performance, but few researchers have focused on the organisational aspects implicit in the information provided by the keyboard. This study investigated the role of the keyboard with respect to the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities involved in sight-reading. Five pianists sight-read two compositions, each in a different musical style. They were then interviewed in a semi-structured interview format. A qualitative content analysis was made from the data. The keyboard proved to {{play a significant role in}} sight-reading {{at the piano}}: the results indicated that the keyboard was involved in generating visual, auditory, and kinesthetic imageries, as well as motor actions. The pianists also relied on visual feedback in order to execute discrete movements on the keyboard. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic processing were all dependent on contextual factors identified in the score as well as on whether the composition was tonal or non-tonal. The utilisation of the keyboard, brought on by effective visual input, involved two kinds of <b>sensory</b> dimensions: visual-kinesthetic <b>imagery</b> and (visual-) auditory-kinesthetic imagery. The former led to partly pre-defined motor responses and the latter, to flexible finger movements.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effects of music-prompted emotional valence and arousal on psychophysiological responses in both evaluative and non-evaluative contexts. Instrumental music prompted emotion in a 2 Valence (negative, positive) x 2 Arousal (low, high) within-subjects design (N = 67). In the initial and final experimental phases, participants were instructed to process the emotion expressed in 26 -sec music trials and rated their affect after each trial. In the main, non-evaluative section of study, participants processed emotion both during and after music presentation trials, separated by 11 - 20 sec relaxation intervals. Physiology was measured throughout the study. Heart rate (HR), skin conductance, and orbicularis oculi EMG change scores were higher during high vs. low-arousal emotion. Zygomatic EMG was higher during positive vs. negative conditions, and corrugator EMG showed the opposite pattern. In contrast to previous findings, startle reflex magnitudes were unaffected by valence, and were larger during low vs. high-arousal conditions. These findings pose interesting questions about the relationships among affective arousal, the startle, and HR. Ratings supported valence and arousal manipulations. HR decreases indicative of orienting responses occurred during all evaluation phase conditions, and only during the low-arousal conditions in the main study. Facial EMG, valence and liking ratings changed from the initial to final evaluation phase. Results are discussed in terms of emotional dimensions, the evaluative context of emotion, and in relation to findings from other <b>sensory</b> stimulus and <b>imagery</b> paradigms. This research contributes a new paradigm to the emotion and psychophysiology literature, organizes self-report and physiological responses to music within the framework of valence and arousal, and bridges the gap between music psychology and the broader field of emotion research. ...|$|R

When blindfolded, people tended to mistake the assumed intrinsic axes of symmetry of their immediate environment (a room) for their own egocentric relation to features of the room. When asked {{to point to the}} door and window, known to be at mid-points of facing (or adjacent) walls, they pointed with their arms at 180 ?? (or 90 ??) angles, irrespective of where they thought they were in the room. People did the same when requested to imagine the situation. They justified their responses (inappropriately) by logical necessity or a structural description of the room rather than (appropriately) by relative location of themselves and the reference points. In eight experiments, we explored the effect on this in perception and imagery of: perceptual input (without perceptibility of the target reference points); imaging oneself versus another person; aids to explicit spatial self-consciousness; order of questions about self-location; and the relation of targets to the axes of symmetry of the room. The results indicate that, if one is deprived of structured perceptual input, as well as losing one's bearings, (a) one is likely to lose one's egocentric frame of reference itself, and (b) instead of pointing to reference points, one demonstrates their structural relation by adopting the intrinsic axes of the environment as one's own.

Though they are a ma-jor word class on a par with nouns and verbs, their origins are ill-understood, and the {{question}} of ideophone creation {{has been a source of}} controversy.

New, uncon-ventionalised ideophones are identified using native speaker judgements, and are studied in context to understand the rules and regularities underlying their production and interpretation. People produce and interpret new ideophones with the help of the semiotic infrastructure that underlies the use of existing ideophones: foregrounding frames certain stretches of speech as depictive enactments of <b>sensory</b> <b>imagery,</b> and various types of iconicity link forms and meanings. As with any creative use of linguistic resources, context and common ground also play an important role in supporting rapid ‘good enough ’ interpreta-tions of new material.

40|$|Repetition {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic {{operations}} on talk, often discussed for its iconic meanings. Ideophones are marked words that depict <b>sensory</b> <b>imagery,</b> often identified by their reduplicated forms. Yet not all reduplication is iconic, and not all ideophones are reduplicated. This paper discusses the semantics and pragmatics of repeated talk (repetition as well as reduplication), with special focus on the intersection of reduplicative processes and ideophonic words. Various formal features of ideophones suggest that it is fruitful to distinguish two modes of representation in language —description and depiction— along with cues like prosodic foregrounding that can steer listeners’ interpretation from one to the other. What is special about reduplication is that it can naturally partake in both of these modes of representation, which is why it is so common in ideophones as well as in other areas of grammar. Using evidence from Siwu, Korean, Semai and a range of other languages, this paper shows how the study of ideophones sheds light on the interpretation of repeated talk and can lead to a more holistic understanding of reduplicative phenomena in language...|$|E
