25|$|On 27 May the AIBN {{released}} an update to the preliminary investigation report where they confirmed that scenarios under consideration included failure of epicyclic module, <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> (lift strut) attachment and MGB (gearbox) conical housing. On {{the same day}} Airbus Helicopters updated their press release bulletin and stated that in their opinion only failure of the attachment of a <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> could be assessed as probable {{based on the information}} available by that date, an opinion also stated by Airbus during a safety meeting on 20 May.|$|E
25|$|The base upgrade package uses 20-inch wheels, {{shod with}} BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the {{standard}} upgrade {{does not offer}} much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires do provide improved grip while the suspension brace results in better cornering.|$|E
25|$|Airborne {{operations}} {{were in their}} infancy in the Second World War and the British Army medical services had to design and develop a range of special medical airborne equipment. These included the Don pack, the Sugar pack, the folding airborne stretcher, the folding trestle table, the folding <b>suspension</b> <b>bar,</b> the airborne operating table, the airborne inhaler and special containers for blood and plasma.|$|E

25|$|A date clasp {{was also}} {{introduced}} in 1923, for award with the medal to first recipients as well as, without a medal, to champions {{who had already}} been awarded the medal. The clasp is inscribed with {{the year of the}} award and is designed to be attached to the medal's <b>suspension</b> <b>bar.</b> The institution of the clasp was followed in 1926 with the provision that a rosette may be worn on the ribbon bar to indicate the award of each subsequent clasp.|$|E
25|$|Every medal {{is awarded}} with a clasp, inscribed with {{the year of}} award and {{attached}} to the medal's <b>suspension</b> <b>bar.</b> Holders of the medal who qualify for a subsequent award, are awarded a clasp only, to be worn on the ribbon of the original medal and attached to the original or previous clasp. When medals are not worn, the award of second or further clasps are denoted on the ribbon bar by a silver rosette to denote the award of each additional clasp.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} systems were a {{development of the}} [...] "M" [...] series, in particular the suspension which was reliable, but in rough terrain would not allow speeds similar to the more modern Christie <b>suspension</b> or torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension.</b> Nevertheless, the good power-to-weight ratio represented a significant improvement in mobility over its predecessors.|$|R
500|$|The Army {{version is}} {{described}} by the Institute of Heraldry as [...] "a gold five pointed star, each point tipped with trefoils, [...] wide, surrounded by a green laurel wreath and suspended from a gold bar inscribed VALOR, surmounted by an eagle.

On the reverse is a bar engraved THE CONGRESS TO with a space for engraving the name of the recipient." [...] The pendant and <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> are made of gilding metal, with the eye, jump rings, and suspension ring made of red brass.

This was originally to have been FOR THE BRAVE, until it was changed {{on the recommendation of}} Queen Victoria, as it implied that not all men in battle were brave. The decoration, <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> and link weigh about 0.87 troy ounces (27g).|$|E

500|$|The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is {{identical}} to the original design. The decoration is a cross pattée, [...] high, [...] wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription FOR VALOUR. This was originally to have been FOR BRAVERY, until it was changed on the recommendation of Queen Victoria, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle.

On the front, the state emblem {{appears in the}} center on a raised circle surrounded by four copies of the vajra, the mythical weapon of Indra, the ancient Vedic King of Gods. The motif symbolizes the sacrifice of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave his bones to the Gods to make the vajra to kill the demon Vritra.

50|$|Sprint cars use {{quick change}} rear ends. This allows the teams to quickly change the gear ratio for {{different}} size tracks. Most cars use a torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> system. Different size bars either soften or stiffen the <b>suspension.</b> Torsion <b>bars,</b> and specialty shock absorbers {{are the key}} ingredients in the handling of sprint cars. That coupled with the wings, tire stagger, light weight, and enormous horsepower make these cars {{one of the fastest}} race cars in the world using a horsepower-to-weight ratio. The monstrous power-to-weight ratios of Sprint Cars can exceed that of Formula 1 cars.|$|R
40|$|Enron {{has brought}} about demands from many {{quarters}} to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) new powers. Among the powers the SEC now seeks is the power to bar or suspend securities law violators from serving as an oflicer or director of any public company. Currently, the law assigns this power only to federal district courts. In this Essay, Professor Barnard traces {{the history of the}} current law; examining why Congress has expressly withheld <b>suspension</b> and <b>bar</b> powers from the SEC. She then argues that the courts have exercised their <b>suspension</b> and <b>bar</b> powers wisely, and that recent developments do not compel any legislative change. Finally, recognizing that Congress may well be persuaded that new legislation is necessary, she provides model statutory language {{that could be used for}} such a change...|$|R
2500|$|The Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, [...] in {{diameter}} and [...] thick. The medal is mounted from a single-toe claw, affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal and with double-scroll claw supports on the rim. The mount attaches to a straight, swiveling <b>suspension</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In a {{press conference}} on 3 May, the AIBN stated that the initial {{investigation}} and analysis of data from the combined FDR and CVR convinced them that pilot error could be ruled out {{and that there were}} no indications of any malfunction until one second {{before the end of the}} recording, which they assumed was the moment when the rotor detached. An AIBN spokesman said the accident was down to a technical fault and [...] "not an accident caused by human error". Later that day Airbus Helicopters updated their press release bulletin with a request for verification of the correct installation of all main gearbox <b>suspension</b> <b>bar</b> attachments for the EC225LP. They also stated that [...] "similar measures will be published shortly for the EC725AP in a specific ASB" [...] (Alert Service Bulletin).|$|E

50|$|Although {{equipped}} with the same electro-mechanical drive as originally fitted to the TOG 1, the TOG 2 used twin generators and no problems were reported. It was modified to include, among other things, a change from the unsprung tracks to a torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> and went through successful trials in May 1943. No further development occurred, although a revised version, the TOG 2 (R) was proposed. The 'R' would have been 6 ft shorter, used torsion <b>bar</b> <b>suspension</b> and had no sponsons.|$|R
