50|$|After refereeing 14 Tests, he was {{a charter}} member of the IRB Referee <b>Selector</b> <b>panel</b> when it was formed in 1997, and was the longest-serving member of the panel when he retired in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} do {{not have}} jump seats in the cockpit, while others have one or two. In most airliners, the observers' seats have an audio <b>selector</b> <b>panel</b> so that the observer can monitor or participate in flight communications. An oxygen mask is provided for each station. There can be extra flight attendant jump seats in the main cabin, {{depending on how the}} airline has configured its aircraft and how many on-duty flight attendants are staffed. Both types might be stand-alone seats, or folding. Either type of jump seat may sometimes be used by off-duty staff (or an employee of another airline or other person) engaging in non-revenue travel, when no passenger seats are available in the cabin (a practice known as jumpseating). Increased security requirements for the flight deck since September 11, 2001 have meant a tightening of restrictions on who is allowed to use jump seats.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} get better receive {{coverage}} over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with {{what is known as}} a voted receiver system. In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on). All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting <b>selector</b> <b>panel</b> that switches from receiver to receiver based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter. A properly adjusted voting system can switch many times a second and can actually [...] "assemble" [...] a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise {{would not be able to}} key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue. Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.|$|E

25|$|Suggestions of {{regional}} bias caused by each territory having a representative on the selection panel {{led to a}} reduction to three <b>selectors</b> only. This <b>panel</b> would {{be joined by the}} captain.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has already}} been tagged as the second [...] "Captain Grumpy" [...] since Allan Border early in his {{captaincy}} reign, having to warn Mitchell Starc for unsportsmanlike behaviour, and being {{highly critical of the}} team's bowling and fielding despite beating New Zealand by over 200 runs. Yet, he has also scored 4 centuries in 5 Tests as captain, including a maiden second-innings century against New Zealand in Perth, which was also Mitchell Johnson's final cricket match. He was also undefeated in the his first 10 Tests as captain, the only one out of the past 4 captains to do so. However, late in 2016, he accumulated consecutive Test series losses, which prompted a reshuffle of the <b>selector's</b> <b>panel.</b> He is also known for being reluctant to use spinners as he no longer bowls on a regular basis, and is very defensive when he does. Since the reshuffle, however, he has used Lyon and Steve O'Keefe in tandem more, which could be due to necessity in India's spin-friendly pitches.|$|R
25|$|District and Office {{parameters}} were variable translations {{supplied by}} the decoder, while Incoming parameters and Final Brush were a fixed translation from the Thousands and Hundreds digits of the phone number, merely to adapt efficiently to {{the capabilities of the}} <b>Panel</b> <b>selector.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clare captain Patrick Donnellan {{accepted}} the Liam MacCarthy Cup from GAA president Liam O'Neill in the Hogan Stand {{and gave a}} speech in which he thanked the Clare <b>panel,</b> <b>selectors,</b> and back room team for their work throughout the year. The Clare team then embarked on a lap of honor around Croke Park.|$|R
50|$|Dublin captain Stephen Cluxton {{accepted}} the Sam Maguire cup from GAA president Liam O'Neill in the Hogan Stand {{and gave a}} speech in which he thanked the Dublin <b>panel,</b> <b>selectors,</b> and back room team for their work throughout the year. He also thanked Mayo for a competitive game and said that their time will come.|$|R
40|$|Building on a unique, multi-source, and multi-method {{study of}} R&D {{projects}} in a leading professional service firm, we develop {{the argument that}} organizations {{are more likely to}} fund projects with intermediate levels of novelty. That is, some project novelty increases the share of requested funds received, but too much novelty is difficult to appreciate and is selected against. While prior research has considered the characteristics of the individuals generating project ideas, we shift the focus to <b>panel</b> <b>selectors</b> and explore how they shape the evaluation of novelty. We theorize that a high panel workload reduces panel preference for novelty in selection, whereas a diversity of panel expertise and a shared location between panel and applicant increase preference for novelty. We explore the implications of these findings for theories of innovation search, organizational selection, and managerial practice...|$|R
5000|$|The Pro Football Hall of Fame {{uses only}} media representatives to select inductees. This, {{along with its}} policy of {{inducting}} only a maximum of seven players a year (six in certain years past), with a current maximum of two [...] "senior" [...] candidates and five [...] "non-seniors," [...] has been criticized by sports columnists, former players, and football fans. Such critics {{would like to see}} solutions such as expanding the number of <b>selectors,</b> rotating <b>panel</b> members on and off the selection committee, and allowing former players to participate in the voting. The small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, with defensive players in general and defensive backs and outside linebackers in particular, special teams players, wide receivers, deserving players who primarily played on bad teams, and those from the [...] "seniors" [...] category, being slighted. This has included a 2009 New York Times article which criticized the Hall for not including punter Ray Guy on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position. (At least two inductees, Sammy Baugh and Yale Lary, punted in addition to playing other positions.) Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame. There has also been criticism that certain players get overlooked because their team underproduced during their careers.|$|R
