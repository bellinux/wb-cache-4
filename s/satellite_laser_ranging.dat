40|$|While {{navigation}} {{systems for}} {{the determination of the}} orbit of the Global Position System (GPS) have proven to be very effective, the current research is examining methods to lower the error in the GPS satellite ephemerides below their current level. Two GPS satellites that are currently in orbit carry retro-reflectors onboard. One notion to reduce the error in the satellite ephemerides is to utilize the retro-reflectors via <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> measurements taken from multiple Earth ground stations. Analysis has been performed to determine the level of reduction in the semi-major axis covariance of the GPS <b>satellites,</b> when <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> measurements are supplemented to the radiometric station keeping, which the satellites undergo. Six ground tracking systems are studied to estimate the performance of the satellite. The first system is the baseline current system approach which provides pseudo-range and integrated Doppler measurements from six ground stations. The remaining five ground tracking systems utilize all measurements from the current system and <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> measurements from the additional ground stations utilized within those systems. Station locations for the additional ground sites were taken from a listing of <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> ground stations from the International <b>Laser</b> <b>Ranging</b> Service.

40|$|At the Institute of Technical Physics at the German Aerospace Center (DLR-TP), a {{proposed}} concept combines two methods of well established orbital observations: First, optical observations using passive reflection of sunlight, {{which is in}} constant use for characterizing space debris in GEO regions. Second, an active <b>satellite</b> <b>range</b> <b>laser</b> <b>ranging,</b> which {{has been used for}} decades to measure distances to cooperative LEO and MEO objects at accuracies down to few millimeters. In the new approach, passive optical observations shall first detect space debris objects in LEO regions during twilights and following guide a laser to illuminate the object for a high accurate range measurement. In the scope of this thesis, first a general assessment of the accuracy of initial orbit determination with three different space debris observation techniques (radar, passiveoptical and combined <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> and tracking) have been performed, to point out general advantages of the <b>laser</b> <b>ranging</b> methods regarding accuracies. Following, using ESA’s PROOF- 2009 (Program for Radar and Optical Observation Forecasting), different studies were performed to assess the general visibility of space debris in LEO regions. These studies have been undertaken both for the, currently under construction, DLR Space Debris Observatory in Stuttgart with the given hardware of this station as well as for more generalized hardware and locations. Results include both the characteristics of detected objects regarding their seizes, as well as variations of their amount over different viewing directions and seasons. Following, a FORTRAN tool has been written to further analyze these detected objects regarding their use for tracking and orbit determination. These final analyses have been performed for different PROOF runs. Results here show that from the total number of detectable objects only a fraction can be used for further determinations...|$|R
