50|$|On February 11, 2004, Anton Drel, {{the lawyer}} of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, {{announced}} his client {{was no longer}} a shareholder of Group Menatep and that Khodorkovsky had pulled out of the company on October 20, 2003, several days before he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Khodorkovsky held 59.5 percent of Group Menatep equaling roughly 26 percent of Yukos, worth $7.8 billion. Shortly after Khodorkovsky's arrest, Group Menatep pulled its <b>shareholder</b> <b>list</b> off its web site and revealed that Khodorkovsky had handed over control of a special trust that owned 50 percent of Menatep. Drel however said that Khodorkovsky had relinquished all his shares in the holding.The lawyer pointed out that the prosecutors' step of freezing 44 percent of Yukos' shares could be unlawful as Khodorkovsky did not own any shares in Menatep any longer. Menatep owned the frozen stake via two offshore vehicles, Yukos Universal and Hulley Enterprises. Drel further added that he could not disclose the name of the new holder of the shares. Analysts complained Yukos' ownership structure was getting murkier and murkier.|$|E

30|$|Currently, {{shareholder}} {{registration is}} mainly carried out internally by <b>shareholder</b> <b>list</b> and externally by business registration. However, such registration is not equivalent to confirmation of share rights. It is a declaratory procedure, mainly providing {{prima facie evidence}} against a third party (Hu and Zhu 2013). In addition, in recent years, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has gradually weakened the management of company establishment and equity registration (AntBlockchain 2016). Compared with traditional private enterprises, the relationship among investors {{and the relationship between}} investors and crowdfunded firms are looser. This creates strong demand for credible and effective shareholder rights registration and confirmation.|$|E

40|$|As complex {{networks}} in economics, we consider Japanese shareholding networks as they existed in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2003. In this study, we use as data <b>lists</b> of <b>shareholders</b> for companies <b>listed</b> {{on the stock}} market or on the over-the-counter market. The lengths of the <b>shareholder</b> <b>lists</b> vary with the companies, and we use lists for the top 20 shareholders. We represent these shareholding networks as a directed graph by drawing arrows from shareholders to stock corporations. Consequently, the distribution of incoming edges has an upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. This representation shows that for all years the distributions of outgoing degrees can be well explained by the power law function with an exponential tail. The exponent depends on the year and the country, while the power law shape is maintained universally. We show that the exponent strongly correlates with the long-term shareholding rate and the cross-shareholding rate.

40|$|Abstract. The Japanese {{shareholding}} network existing {{at the end}} of March 2002 is studied empirically. The {{network is}} constructed from 2, 303 listed companies and 53 non-listed financial institutions. We consider this network as a directed graph by drawing edges from shareholders to stock corporations. The lengths of the <b>shareholder</b> <b>lists</b> vary with the companies, and the most comprehensive lists contain the top 30 shareholders. Consequently, the distribution of incoming edges has an upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. The distribution of outgoing degrees is well explained by the power law function with an exponential tail. The exponent in the power law range is γ = 1. 7. To understand these features from the viewpoint of a company’s growth, we consider the correlations between the outgoing degree and the company’s age, profit, and total assets...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the international scene demonstrates {{the relevance of the}} debate regarding the role of <b>shareholders</b> in <b>listed</b> companies. For a long time, all attempts to encourage shareholder activism had been branded as an anachronistic return to the so-called “shareholder democracy”. In recent years, however, the assumption of equivalence between the increase of shareholders’ rights and the reduction of efficiency in the management of a company has been disproven, at least at the legislative level. The development of the Italian legislative framework {{in the last ten years}} has actively contributed to the strengthening of the role of <b>shareholders</b> in <b>listed</b> companies. In fact, the Italian legislator has not only transposed the European provisions (Directive 2007 / 36 /EC), which have facilitated the participation of shareholders in general meetings but, in addition, he has prepared a package of substantial competences that provide shareholders with the capability to influence corporate governance of the company and to express “publicly” their dissent against the activity of management, with possible impact on the market value of securities. In the light of the above, it is important to investigate the reasons and contents of the choices of European and national legislators, which (in line with the present trend in the world) have been made to encourage shareholder engagement in order to improve corporate governance of listed companies. Along this line of inquiry, the research project aims to examine the role that <b>shareholders</b> in <b>listed</b> companies have currently taken in Italy, first of all on the basis of the analysis of the positive framework and data available from recent general meetings.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{some of the}} institutional conditions that facilitated the development of equity markets in Brazil. A critical factor was the addition to corporate bylaws of protections for investors, which enabled relatively large corporations in Brazil to attract investors in large numbers. By availing themselves of this strategy, the firms generated a relatively low concentration of ownership before 1910. Archival evidence, such as company statutes and <b>shareholder</b> <b>lists,</b> reveals that the addition of voting rights to their bylaws, particularly maximum-vote provisions and graduated voting scales (which stipulated that less-than-proportional votes increase in parallel with shareholdings), allowed many Brazilian corporations to balance the relative voting power of their small and large investors. In companies that made such arrangements, the concentration of ownership and control was sharply lower than in the average company. Judging by the Brazilian companies examined for this article, it also appears that the concentration of control was significantly lower before 1910 than it is today. ...|$|R
