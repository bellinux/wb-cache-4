5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E

Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E

He tells Scully to keep Mulder away from her.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen <b>shut.</b> <b>The</b> congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time <b>shut.</b> <b>The</b> 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|In Trinidad and Tobago, the {{government}} set up shelters and sent home non-essential oil workers. Officials canceled flights and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> ports as a precaution. Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting. The {{threat of the}} storm caused a rise in unleaded oil prices. In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz. Rescue workers were mobilized {{in the capital city}} of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides. Ahead of the storm, the head of Sucre state declared a state of emergency, and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began. According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made. On August7, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the onslaught of the flooding rains. In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm. Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights. Later, about 1,000people evacuated from eastern Costa Rica, and another 40,000evacuated from portions of Nicaragua, Flights in the country were canceled due to the storm.|$|E
