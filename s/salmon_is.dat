5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> kosher.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the symbols}} are unique to Oregon, others are used by {{multiple}} states. For example, the western meadowlark, Oregon's state bird, is also an official symbol for Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming. The North American beaver is also the state animal of New York, and the Chinook salmon (sometimes known as the king <b>salmon)</b> <b>is</b> also the state fish of Alaska. The square dance and milk are commonly used state dances and state beverages, respectively.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and <b>salmon</b> <b>were</b> classified differently and <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> said to give individuals energy while meat makes you feel heavy and lazy. In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> smoked, this was traditionally done {{for a week or}} two but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|R

5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
25|$|Canned {{salmon in}} the U.S. is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} in canned form. Smoked <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer either to cold smoked salmon or to salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and boneless canned <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> also available.|$|E

25|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>is</b> {{a popular}} food. Classified as an oily fish, <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. <b>Salmon</b> <b>is</b> also a source of cholesterol, {{with a range of}} 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Salmon</b> [...] <b>is</b> {{the common}} name for {{several species of}} ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish {{in the same family}} include trout, char, {{grayling}} and whitefish. <b>Salmon</b> <b>are</b> native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean [...] (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of <b>salmon</b> have <b>been</b> introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. <b>Salmon</b> <b>are</b> intensively farmed {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|During these times, the Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>are</b> very {{susceptible}} to predation. Nearly 40% are eaten by trout alone. Other predators include other fish and birds..

50|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> {{decommissioned}} and stricken {{from the}} Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1977. In 1992 <b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> {{converted to a}} shallow water sonar target and sunk near Hudson Canyon, south of Long Island, as a bottom target on 5 June 1993.|$|R
25|$|Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>is,</b> by far, {{the species}} most often chosen for farming. It {{is easy to}} handle, it grows well in sea cages, {{commands}} a high market value and it adapts well to being farmed away from its native habitats.|$|E

25|$|The <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge plays {{key role in}} the tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him. However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> also one of the incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill and Fintan mac Bóchra.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the type}} of fish used depends on {{availability}} in a given region. Some common types are cod, halibut, flounder, tilapia or, in New England, Atlantic cod or haddock. <b>Salmon</b> <b>is</b> growing common on the West Coast, while freshwater catfish is most frequently used in the Southeast. In Canada, pollock, haddock, and halibut are popular choices, alongside cod.|$|E
25|$|The worlds' largest {{producer}} and market supplier of the Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> New Zealand. Marketed as king salmon, in 2009, New Zealand exported 5,088 tonnes of salmon equating to {{a value of}} NZ$61 million in export earnings. For the year ended March 2011, this amount had increased to NZ$85 million., New Zealand accounts for {{about half of the}} global production of Chinook salmon, and about half of New Zealand's production is exported. Japan is New Zealand's largest export market, with stock also being supplied to other countries of the Pacific Rim, including Australia.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, 22,000 coho <b>salmon</b> <b>were</b> stocked in the Salmon River, {{marking the}} {{beginning}} of the current era of salmon sportfishing on the river. Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>were</b> stocked beginning in 1970. Initial returns were poor, and would remain so until successful sea lamprey control began in 1972. By 1974, large <b>salmon</b> runs <b>were</b> observed regularly in the Salmon River, and steelhead were initially stocked beginning in that year as well.|$|R

25|$|The White <b>Salmon</b> <b>is</b> a glacier-fed river {{originating}} on {{the slopes}} of Mount Adams and emptying into the Columbia River. Condit Dam is about 3.3 miles (5.3km) upstream of the confluence. The area below the dam is part of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, while parts of the river upstream belong to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. The area is famous for its natural beauty and recreational activities such as whitewater rafting and fishing. Impoundment of the river in 1911 removed 33 miles (53km) of steelhead habitat and 14 miles (23km) of salmon habitat.|$|E
25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E
25|$|Farming {{in the sea}} (mariculture) for king <b>salmon</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} called sea-cage ranching. Sea-cage ranching takes place in large floating net cages, about 25 metres across and 15 metres deep, moored to the sea floor in clean, fast-flowing coastal waters. Smolt (young fish) from freshwater hatcheries are transferred to cages containing several thousand salmon, and remain there {{for the rest of}} their life. They are fed fishmeal pellets high in protein and oil. Most of this fishmeal is imported from Australia. The salmon are harvested when they are about two years old, weighing 2.5 to 4 kilograms. Sea cages are located in the Marlborough Sounds, Akaroa Harbour and Stewart Island.|$|E
50|$|After {{repairs and}} {{overhaul}} at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, <b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> assigned as a training vessel for the Atlantic Fleet. After the war's end, <b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> slated for disposal and was decommissioned on 24 September. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October, she was scrapped on 4 April 1946.|$|R
5000|$|At 206 cm (6 ft 9 in), <b>Salmon</b> <b>was</b> at the time, {{along with}} Carlton's Justin Madden, the tallest man {{to play in}} the AFL.

50|$|In the summer, salmon would swim {{up to the}} Pacific Rivers. Plateau {{fishermen}} learned {{many ways}} to trap <b>salmon.</b> Stakes <b>were</b> lined up to make a wall, stopping the salmon from swimming any further, and then the fish were {{pulled out of the}} water with a scoop. Most <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> smoked on a fire, and some of it was stored underground in pits. Other <b>salmon</b> <b>was</b> boiled in hot water to get oil.|$|R
