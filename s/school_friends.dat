5|$|Fleming endowed Bond {{with many}} of his own traits, {{including}} sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of <b>school</b> <b>friends,</b> acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E

5|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin while editing Coonskin, and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC. The characters of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based upon Bakshi's high <b>school</b> <b>friends,</b> Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. }} Warner Bros. had previously agreed to distribute Fritz the Cat before pulling their funding from that film, but {{were eager to}} option the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin, and greenlit the film in 1973. Several African American animators, including graffiti artists, were hired by Bakshi's studio, {{at a time when}} black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Following controversy over the film Coonskin, some black animators left Bakshi's studio in embarrassment, resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} Bad Brains concert, MacKaye and Nelson began {{playing in a}} punk band, the Slinkees, with <b>school</b> <b>friends</b> Grindle and Mark Sullivan. The Slinkees played a single show before Sullivan went to college. After a failed attempt to recruit MacKaye's friend Henry Garfield (later Henry Rollins), the band added Strejcek as the vocalist. The Slinkees soon renamed {{themselves}} the Teen Idles. After touring and practicing for several months, the band recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly laughing as they recorded. They also began playing at house parties and pizza parlors, and opened for Bad Brains at an art gallery, in a dilapidated row house in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, called Madam's Organ.|$|E
5|$|Andrić {{was later}} {{transferred}} to a prison in Zenica, where Perčinlić regularly visited him. The Austro-Hungarian Army declared Andrić a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed military service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for all of Austria-Hungary's political prisoners. His freedom of movement restored, Andrić visited Višegrad and reunited with several <b>school</b> <b>friends.</b> He remained in the town until July, when he was mobilized. Due to his poor health, Andrić was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the Reservospital in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb. There, Andrić again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a gathering place for dissidents and former political prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on {{the death}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and won an {{unexpected}} victory in the 1948 presidential election. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree. Although not highly educated, Truman was well read. When his high <b>school</b> <b>friends</b> went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I, and held a reserve commission as a colonel.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but is content to spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his <b>school</b> <b>friends</b> have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E
