50|$|In {{the rest}} of the <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone,</b> the hardier {{varieties}} of millet, along with peanuts and dry beans, are grown. Crop yields are far lower than they are in the south or near rivers and lakes. Farmers take every advantage of seasonal flooding to grow recession crops before the waters dry away, a practice particularly popular around Lake Fitri. The <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> is ideal for pasturage. Herding includes large cattle herds for commercial sale, and goats, sheep, donkeys, and some horses are common in all villages.|$|E
50|$|With the 1984-85 drought, {{transhumance}} patterns changed. Camels {{were brought}} farther south into the <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> {{in search of}} water. Cattle were herded even farther south, sometimes through Salamat Prefecture into Central African Republic.|$|E

50|$|At {{independence}} in 1960, the government established {{a goal of}} universal primary education, and school attendance was made compulsory until age twelve. Nevertheless, the development of standard curricula was hampered by {{the limited number of}} schools, the existence of two- and three-year establishments alongside the standard five- and seven-year collèges and lycées, and the Muslim preference for Quranic education. Even so, by the mid-1960s 17 percent of students between the ages of six and eight were in school. Quranic schools throughout the Saharan and <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones</b> teach students to read Arabic and recite Quranic verse. In Chad, modern Islamic secondary schools have included the Ecole Mohamed Illech, founded in 1918.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{the overall}} food {{sufficiency}} registered by Chad {{in these years}} served to underscore the problem of regional imbalances in cereal production. The <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> experienced a chronic shortfall in cereal production, whereas the soudanian zone traditionally had a cereal surplus. The soudanian zone was also the biggest producer of all subsistence food crops and of cash crops. It was estimated that the soudanian zone produced between 53 and 77% of Chad's total cereal production from 1976 to 1985, with the average falling in the 60- to 70-% range. But because the populations of the two regions were approximately equal, {{the lack of a}} good transport system and marketing mechanisms to allow the rapid transfer of the southern surplus to the northern zones was a constant problem. This danger was especially threatening during times of drought affecting the <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before {{the drought}} of the 1980s, the <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> held the largest herds, with about 80% {{of the total}} cattle herd. Smaller numbers of cattle {{were found in the}} soudanian zone, along with about 100,000 buffaloes used in plowing cotton fields. Camel herds were {{concentrated}} in the dry northern regions. Herders practiced transhumance—seasonal migrations along fairly well set patterns.|$|E

The whole area of Termit Massif and Tin Toumma desert is considered a biodiversity hotspot. Its arid land fauna consists of addax, dama and dorcas gazelles, cheetah, Barbary sheep and striped hyena, bustards (Nubian and Sudan) and spurred tortoise. It is also the habitat for the Critically Endangered dama gazelle.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Sahelian</b> <b>Zone</b> extends {{south of}} the Saharan Zone to within {{approximately}} 30 kilometres of the Senegal River. It forms an east-west belt with its axis running from Boutilimit through 'Ayoûn el 'Atroûs to Néma, including the Aoukar basin. The area is mostly made up of steppes and savanna grasslands. Herds of cattle, sheep, and goats move across this zone in search of pasturage.|$|E
50|$|The {{semiarid}} <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone,</b> or Sahel, forms a belt about 500 km wide {{that runs}} from Lac and Chari-Baguirmi prefectures eastward through Guéra, Ouaddaï, and northern Salamat prefectures to the Sudanese frontier. The climate in this transition zone between the desert and the southern soudanian zone is divided into a rainy season (from June to early September) and a dry period (from October to May).|$|E
50|$|Quranic schools {{throughout}} the Saharan and <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones</b> teach {{students to read}} Arabic and recite Quranic verse. Although traditional Islamic education {{at the secondary level}} has existed since the nineteenth century, students seeking advanced learning generally have studied in northern Cameroon, Nigeria, Sudan, or the Middle East. In Chad, modern Islamic secondary schools have included the Ecole Mohamed Illech, founded in 1918 and modelled after Egyptian educational institutions. Other schools included the Lycée Franco-Arabe, founded by the colonial administration in Abéché in 1952. The lycée offered a blend of Arabic, Quranic, and secular French education. Numerous observers believed that although the creation of a French-Islamic program of study was commendable, the administration's major objective was to counter foreign Islamic influence rather than to offer a viable alternative curriculum.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{followers}} of each tradition in Chad is unknown. Estimates made in 1962 suggested that 35 percent of Chadians practiced classical African religions, 55 percent were Muslims, and 10 percent were Christians. In the 1970s and 1980s, this distribution undoubtedly changed. Observers report that Islam has spread among the Hajerai and among other non-Muslim {{populations of the}} Saharan and <b>sahelian</b> <b>zones.</b> However, the proportion of Muslims may have fallen because the birthrate among the followers of traditional religions and Christians in southern Chad {{is thought to be}} higher than that among Muslims. In addition, the upheavals since the mid-1970s have resulted in the departure of some missionaries; whether or not Chadian Christians have been numerous enough and organized enough to have attracted more converts since that time is unknown.|$|R

40|$|In West Africa, {{especially}} in the Sahelian countries of Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali and Mauritania, erratic rainfall sequences within and between years has often led to a high uncertainty in rainfed crop production. Over the past three decades, severe food shortages attributed to drought have been frequently reported in several Sahelian countries, {{most of which are}} amongst the least developed of the world. Innovative and indigenous ways to achieve improved crop yields through integrated land and water management such as rainwater harvesting and soil water conservation have been successfully tested and, in some cases, adopted in West Africa. This paper highlights the successful interventions of improved indigenous rainwater harvesting/soil water conservation technologies such as Za? or tassa, stone rows and half-moon in the <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones</b> of West Africa over the past 10 years, and their contributions to enhancing food security and alleviating poverty.

40|$|Mobile pastoralists provide major {{contributions}} to {{the gross domestic product}} in Chad, but little information is available regarding their demography. The Lake Chad area population is increasing, resulting in competition for scarce land and water resources. For the first time, the density of people and animals from mobile and sedentary populations was assessed using randomly defined sampling areas. Four sampling rounds were conducted over two years in the same areas to show population density dynamics. We identified 42 villages of sedentary communities in the sampling zones; 11 (in 2010) and 16 (in 2011) mobile pastoralist camps {{at the beginning of the}} dry season and 34 (in 2011) and 30 (in 2012) camps at the end of the dry season. A mean of 64. 0 people per km 2 (95 % confidence interval, 20. 3 - 107. 8) were estimated to live in sedentary villages. In the mobile communities, we found 5. 9 people per km 2 at the beginning and 17. 5 people per km 2 at the end of the dry season. We recorded per km 2 on average 21. 0 cattle and 31. 6 small ruminants in the sedentary villages and 66. 1 cattle and 102. 5 small ruminants in the mobile communities, which amounts to a mean of 86. 6 tropical livestock units during the dry season. These numbers exceed, by up to five times, the published carrying capacities for similar <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones.</b> Our results underline the need for a new institutional framework. Improved land use management must equally consider the needs of mobile communities and sedentary populations...|$|R

40|$|In the {{semiarid}} Sahel, farmers commonly lay stone {{lines in}} fields to disperse runoff. This {{study was conducted}} in northern Burkina Faso to assess the chemical fertility of soil under a permanent, non-fertilised sorghum crop, which is the main production system in this area, 5 years after laying stone lines. The experimental design consisted of four plots in which stone lines had been laid. The spacing between the lines was 100 m in the first plot, 50 m in the second, 33 m in the third, and 25 m in the fourth. To determine soil chemical characteristics in relation to the stone line spacing patterns studied, soil samples were taken from subplots at regular and fixed distances from the lines {{at the start of the}} trial and then 5 years later. Under the continuous non-fertilised sorghum cropping system, the beneficial effect of stone lines on soil fertility was limited. Five years after installing stone lines, soil organic C, total N, available P and Na concentrations and soil pH had decreased. Within the plots, these same variables were higher upslope than downslope of stone lines, probably because of water storage and sediment accumulation in front of the stone lines. In plots where stone lines were relatively close together (< 33 m) the decrease in soil fertility was less. It is concluded that in <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones,</b> stone lines alone are not sufficient to insure the conservation of soil fertility. Combining soil and water conservation techniques with soil fertility management practices are needed to sustain soil productivity...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{conservation}} tillage may be ideal for the semi-arid tropics (SAT) {{in view of}} results from studies and tillage practices in the U. S. A. and Australia, studies conducted in semi-arid regions of Africa appear to {{support the use of}} conventional tillage systems. Some of the reasons for this apparent discrepancy are because of the physical properties of the soils in semi-arid Africa, particularly the <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones</b> where the soils are sandy, have high bulk densities and therefore low total porosities and form crusts upon wetting and drying. Consequently, no-till or reduced tillage systems that do not have the soil surface covered by residue in irder to prevent formation of crust as a result of raindrop impact, tend to lose water through runoff in a region where water economy is essential. Also, because these soils have inherently high bulk densities, conventional tillage systems appear to be suitable since they increase the macropores, reduce both bulk density and strength and thus ensure prolific root distribution and the resultant exploration of water and nutrients at greater soil depths. Notwithstanding, it seems that since most of the SAT soils are structurally unstable, further conventional tillage even though it has ephemeral advantages, may in the long term be exacerbating the problems of structural instability and their deleterious effect on water and soil conservation and therefore on crop production. We suggest that at this stage soil tillage research in the semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia should re-examine some of the concepts of {{conservation tillage}} in relation to soil physical properties and processes in order to obtain a tillage system that ensures high crop yields without destruction of the soil resource. ...|$|R

50|$|Chad {{has four}} {{bioclimatic}} zones. The northernmost Saharan zone averages less than 200 mm of rainfall annually. The sparse human population is largely nomadic, with some livestock, mostly small ruminants and camels. The central <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> receives between 200 and 600 mm rainfall and has vegetation ranging from grass/shrub steppe to thorny, open savanna. The southern zone, {{often referred to}} as the Sudanian zone, receives between 600 and 1000 mm, with woodland savanna and deciduous forests for vegetation. Rainfall in the Guinea zone, located in Chad's southwestern tip, ranges between 1000 and 1200 mm.|$|E
50|$|Detailed and {{reliable}} statistical information on Chad's agriculture was scarce {{in the late}} 1980s; most researchers viewed available statistics only as indicators of general trends. The one region for which figures were kept was the soudanian zone through survey coverage by officials of the National Office of Rural Development (Chad) (Office National de Dévelopment Rural)(ONDR), who monitored cotton production. These officials also gathered information on food production, but this effort was not carried out systematically. Survey coverage of the <b>sahelian</b> <b>zone</b> was first hampered, then prevented, by civil conflict from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Gently undulating landscapes {{are typical}} for {{large parts of}} the Sudanian and <b>Sahelian</b> <b>zones</b> of the West African {{semiarid}} tropics. Within this landscape a pattern of land types and soils, which is closely linked to the topography, can be distinguished. Thus low fertility drought sensitive soils (Alfisols) are found on uplands, whereas the more fertile soils of the lower slopes and lowlands (mainly Inceptisols) will be moist to wet. In response to these variations in land types and the unpredictable rainfall, which can cause both droughts and floods during the rainy season, the subsistence farmers have adopted distinct cropping patterns in order to minimize the risk of crop failure under the conditions of a low input agriculture. Consequently, cropping patterns which closely follow the toposequence have evolved, with millets grown on dry uplands and slopes, maize on moist lower slopes, sorghum on lower slopes, and rice on lowlands. The present study was conducted mainly in Upper Volta and provides a scientific basis for these cropping patterns by analysing the responses of three major cereal crops to land types and to sowing dates. Next, several high yielding, introduced, sorghum cultivars were tested to determine their adaptation to the local conditions and to formulate plant characteristics useful to plant breeders in selecting improved cultivars which would best meet the requirements of the local agriculture. It was concluded that to meet the large diversity in land types and rainfall conditions typical for the West African semiarid tropics, even an advanced type agriculture would require a range of technological options, in terms of improved varieties and cultural practices. Consequently, the likelihood that a single improved cultivar could replace the local cultivars is remote, as is the possibility of introducing a standard technological package...|$|R

40|$|In West Africa, tree {{preferences}} of wintering migratory birds (and African residents) were quantified {{in order to}} assess the importance of wintering conditions on distribution, abundance and trends of insectivorous woodland birds. This study encompassed 2000 plots between 10 - 18 °N and 0 - 17 °W, visited in October-March 2007 - 2015, and covered 183 woody species and 59 bird species. Canopy surface (measured in a horizontal plane) and birds present were determined in 308, 000 trees and shrubs. Absolute bird density amounted to 13 birds/ha canopy, on average, varying for the different woody species between 0 and 130 birds/ha canopy. Birds were highly selective in their tree choice, with no insectivorous birds at all in 65 % of the woody species. Bird density was four times higher in acacias and other thorny species than in non-thorny trees, and seven times higher in trees with leaves having a low crude fibre content than in trees with high crude fibre foliage. Salvadora persica shrubs, but only when carrying berries, were even more attractive. Overall, densities of migratory woodland birds were highest in the (thorny) trees of the <b>Sahelian</b> vegetation <b>zone.</b> This counterintuitive finding, with highest numbers of wintering birds in the driest and most desiccated parts of West Africa (short of the Sahara), also known as Moreau's Paradox, {{can be explained by the}} foliage palatability hypothesis. The <b>Sahelian</b> vegetation <b>zone</b> has always been subject to heavy grazing from large herbivores, and as a consequence woody species have evolved mechanical defences (thorns) to withstand grazing of large herbivores, at the expense of chemical defence against arthropods. South of the Sahel, with a much lower grazing pressure, thorny trees (rich in arthropods) are replaced by (usually non-thorny) trees with less palatable foliage and a higher crude fibre content, and hence with less arthropod food for insectivorous birds...|$|R
