5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> {{was brought in to}} test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} their 1994 tour, {{and after}} signing with the Warner Bros. Records' imprint label Giant Records, they released their 1995 album , consisting of covers of songs originally recorded by Sarah Vaughan, Glenn Miller, and Duke Ellington. Session guitarist Bruce Gaitsch handled the guitar {{work and the}} album featured guest appearances by Paul Shaffer of David Letterman fame, and Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. In early 1995 Keith Howland, {{who had been a}} studio musician and <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> based in Los Angeles, was recruited as Chicago's new permanent guitarist.|$|E
25|$|His {{original}} {{intention was}} to join the Merchant Navy but this was thwarted by his poor eyesight. Working at an aircraft factory, he joined the British Army {{on the eve of}} the Second World War but not before experiencing his first brush with acting, by working as a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> at the Manchester Palace of Varieties. Lowe served in the Middle East with the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry and took part in shows put on for the troops. At the war's end, he was discharged from the army, having served as a radar technician.|$|E

25|$|A {{brand new}} Godzilla suit was {{designed}} for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance. Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film. These cut scenes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese theatrical trailer. Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a <b>stage</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{was one of}} {{the first}} actresses to star in moving pictures. The first {{projected}} film was shown by the Lumiere brothers at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumiere brothers, Clément Maurice, approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of Hamlet. The scene was Prince Hamlet's duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> bang pieces of metal together in sync with the sword fight. Maurice's finished two-minute film, Le Duel d'Hamlet, was presented to the public at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition between 14 April and 12 November 1900. The short film became one of the most popular attractions of the Exposition. The sound quality on the disks and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the first examples of a sound film.|$|E
500|$|After the Hermits tour, the Who {{recorded}} {{their next}} single, [...] "I Can See for Miles", which Townshend {{had written in}} 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well. [...] Townshend called it [...] "the ultimate Who record", and was disappointed it reached only No.10 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.9. The group toured the US again with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, miming to [...] "I Can See For Miles" [...] and [...] "My Generation". Moon bribed a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{first visited}} Australia and New Zealand in 1984 to open The Unforgettable Fire Tour. After a 24-hour flight into Auckland, lead singer Bono {{was unable to}} adjust to the time {{difference}} between New Zealand and Europe. He left his hotel room during the night and met some people who showed him around the city. Greg Carroll was part of that group: he had met U2's production manager Steve Iredale and been offered a job helping the band for their upcoming concert on account of Greg's experience with local rock bands. They ended up taking Bono up One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie), one of the highest – and more spiritually significant to Māori people – of Auckland's largest volcanoes. Greg worked as a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> gently stopping people getting on stage, and was described as [...] "this very helpful fellah running around the place". U2's manager Paul McGuinness thought Carroll was so helpful that he should accompany the band {{for the remainder of the}} tour. The group helped him obtain a passport, and he subsequently joined them on the road in Australia and the United States as their assistant. He became very close friends with Bono and his wife Ali Hewson, and following the conclusion of the tour, he worked for U2 in Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{different}} endings {{were written}} by Bolt. The original ending, performed during the show's preliminary run in England, had Cromwell and Chapuys confront each other after More's execution and then exit the <b>stage,</b> <b>hand</b> in hand, chuckling with [...] "the self-mocking, self-indulgent, rather rueful laughter {{of the men who}} know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it".|$|E

2500|$|Born in Camberwell, London, Bernard {{was the son}} of Charles Bernard, (d.1894), a theatre manager, and his wife, Annie Allen, an actress. Oliver Bernard {{experienced}} an unhappy childhood in London and, on {{the death of his father}} in 1894, left for Manchester to take a job as a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> in a theatre.

He ultimately took a series of menial jobs at sea, before returning to London to take up scene painting with Walter Hann.|$|E
2500|$|Fujita was {{the second}} of five children, born on October 20, 1921 in Lawton while his father worked in the food {{industry}} in Oklahoma, enhancing his income further with gambling wins and moonlight in artistry and sign painting. Fujita and his siblings were encouraged to absorb {{the culture of the}} United States and become [...] "one hundred percent American". Fujita joined the American Boy Scouts upon moving to El Reno, and survived well under his father's healthy income during the Great Depression. It was at this time that he earned the nickname [...] "Foo", based on a childhood pet. His drawings of this cat attracted local media interest from The Abilene Reporter News in 1937, a local newspaper from Abilene, Texas. He obtained work as a cartoonist for a local school newspaper and as a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> in various theatre plays.|$|E
2500|$|The rapid-fire comedic {{interplay between}} Somers, Carroll, Blackman and audio {{operator}} Murray Tregonning {{was central to}} the show's success. Blackman kept up a near-constant stream of jokes and remarks, and he also provided {{the voice of the}} show's many invented characters; some were merely voiced, while others were seen in various forms, including [...] "Mrs McGillicuddy" [...] (a stock photo of a toothless old woman), [...] "Angel" [...] (a Barbie doll dressed as an angel and Chroma keyed into the scene), [...] "Norman Neumann" [...] (pronounced Noiman), a talking Neumann boom microphone, [...] "The Man From Jupiter" [...] and the character that became an icon of the show, cheeky [...] "schoolboy" [...] Dickie Knee (a ball with a school baseball cap and long black-haired wig, stuck on a stick) who would pop up in front of Daryl (operated by a <b>stage</b> <b>hand)</b> and make rude remarks.|$|E

2500|$|Bunker {{was born}} [...] "on New Year's Eve, 1933" [...] into a troubled family in Los Angeles. His mother, Sarah (née Johnston), was a chorus girl from Vancouver, and his father, Edward N. Bunker, a <b>stage</b> <b>hand.</b> His first clear {{memories}} were of his alcoholic parents screaming at each other, and police arriving to [...] "keep the peace." [...] When they divorced, Bunker {{ended up in}} a foster home at the age of five, but he felt profoundly unhappy and ran away. As a result, Bunker went through a progression of increasingly draconian institutions. Consistently rebellious and defiant, young Bunker was subjected to a harsh regime of discipline. He attended a military school for a few months, where he began stealing and eventually ran away again, ending up in a hobo camp 400 miles away. While Bunker was eventually apprehended by the authorities, this established a pattern he would follow throughout his formative years.|$|E
2500|$|George Bales, a <b>stage</b> <b>hand</b> at Fox Theater gave Jerry Garcia Heil's phone number, and Heil remembers Garcia {{calling to}} say [...] "Hey man, I heard {{you have a}} really big PA." [...] Heil had been toying and {{tinkering}} with the large speakers that the Fox had replaced months earlier with a new system. [...] Heil, {{one of the two}} organists at the Mighty Wurlitzer in the Fox (dating back to 1956) was given their old speakers which Heil built into his new sound system using the massive Altec Lansing A-4 speaker cabinets. Heil replaced the 15-inch speakers with JBL D140s, and added an array of four radial horns and ring tweeters all driven by McIntosh amplifiers. He has stated [...] "That made a huge difference. It was like a big 'hi-fi' system. Except for Bill Hanley of Hanley Sound (Medford, MA) no one was putting radial horns into PA systems; they were just doing speakers in columns, like the Vocalmaster. The horns are what give the system intelligibility — you can actually understand the lyrics." [...] His stack riggings resulted in an unusual frequency range from below 200Hz to well over 15kHz.|$|E
