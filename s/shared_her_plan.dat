Later on at a tavern during a port stop, Hook recognizes the same tune being sung by Ursula, and offers her a drink. She explains to Hook that her father kicked her out of his kingdom for disobeying him, so she stole a magical bracelet that allowed her to walk on land.

Hook tells Ursula that listening to her voice was the only thing that has ever taken away his lifelong pain.
