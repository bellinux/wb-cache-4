50|$|Cornforth {{was born}} in Willesden, London in 1909, and educated at University College School, where he was friends with Stephen Spender. In 1925 {{he went up to}} University College, London, graduating in 1929, and then went on to Trinity College, Cambridge where he was the only student on a <b>specialised</b> <b>course</b> in logic, taught by Moore, Braithwaite, and Wittgenstein. In 1931, after graduating, he was awarded a three-year {{research}} scholarship at Trinity. In the summer of the same year he joined the Communist Party, setting up the party's first organisation at Cambridge; and in the autumn married a fellow Cambridge student, Kitty Klugmann, sister of James. From 1933 Cornforth worked full-time for the Communist Party in East Anglia. Rejected for military service on medical grounds, during the Second World War Cornforth worked as a farm labourer. He published his first work, Science Versus Idealism, in 1946. In 1950 he was appointed as managing director of Lawrence & Wishart, a post he held until 1975, during which period he was responsible for the publishing of Marx's and Engels's Collected Works. Cornforth died in Islington, London, 1980, leaving a widow, Kathleen Elliott, his second wife.|$|E

After he returned from Sri Lanka, he was moved to the 9 Parachute Commando regiment which is a special force of the Indian Army that specialises in mountain operations. He served two six-month terms at Siachen. In 1997, he was sent to the United States for a <b>specialised</b> <b>course.</b> Wher he got first position during the course. He also spoke at the Pentagon during this mission. He was later deputed as aide-de-camp to the Chief of the Army Staff and was twice decorated with gallantry awards for combating militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. When the Kargil War broke out, he obtained special permission to go to the battlefield because at that time he was recovering from injuries, and his team recaptured the Zulu Ridge. After the Kargil War ended, his team was assigned the duty of fighting terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E
