40|$|An {{electrically}} operated knapsack sprayer of ten (10) liters capacity was developed using locally available materials and its performance evaluated. This device is developed {{to reduce the}} constant application of energy to throttle to regulate air pressure a problem in conventional knapsack sprayers. The major components include; tank, 12 volts electric water pump, 12 volts accumulator battery, <b>strap</b> (<b>belt),</b> delivery pipe and a sprayer handle together with lance and nozzle. Electric water pump that bended with the designed parameter was Mercedes Benz wind screen washer pump, powered by 12 volts, 2. 5 amperes battery (motorcycle type). Laboratory and field tests were conducted to determine flow rate, application rate and distribution rate. Basic hydraulic principles were considered for determining flow rate, while application rate was determined by effective use of walking speed on field. The {{results showed that the}} sprayer has a flow rate of 531 ml, application rate of 250 l/ha and a spray distribution area of 0. 000675 m 2. The result from the laboratory test indicated that decrease in liquid head leads to decrease in flow rate and vice versa. Efficiency of spray decreased with decrease in voltage of battery and application rate is influenced by walking speed. The sprayer is capable of spraying 250 l/ha in 4. 17 hrs at a walking speed of 0. 7 m/s. This device cannot be operated continuously for more than 2 hrs due to decrease in voltage. It is advisable for extra batteries to be carried along to the farm for large hectare spraying...|$|E

50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the <b>belt</b> <b>strap</b> may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the <b>strap</b> restrains the <b>belted</b> occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|Battle Monument {{is a large}} Tuscan column {{monument}} {{located on}} Trophy Point at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. Designed by Stanford White, it was dedicated on 30 May 1897 by surviving Civil War veterans. [...] The monument was financed by monthly contributions from the pay of the officers and soldiers of the regular army. [...] The granite column, standing 46 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter, is reputed {{to be the largest}} column of polished granite in the Western Hemisphere. [...] Inscribed on bronze <b>straps</b> <b>belting</b> the eight monumental [...] "cannon balls" [...] circling the column are the names of 2,230 Regular Army officers and soldiers who died for the Union during the Civil War. Designed by Frederick MacMonnies, a female statue sits atop the monument, representing [...] "fame". [...] The statue that now tops the monument is actually the second version of the statue. Just months after it was unveiled, MacMonnies agreed to replace the original statue after complaints that it was too large and awkward. Traditionally, the plebes at West Point made reference to the statue of Fame when giving the following reply to any upperclassman demanding to know [...] "How are they all?": [...] "They are all fickle but one, sir." [...] "Who is the one?" [...] "She who stands atop Battle Monument, for she has been on the same shaft since 1897;" [...] however, this is no longer current practice.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} at Chapter Nine that beginning in November 2013 there would begin {{a series of}} matches to determine the first Progress Tag Team champions.

5000|$|Hikers {{and outdoor}} sports enthusiasts {{sometimes}} use [...] "survival bracelets" [...] made of several feet of paracord which is woven into a compact and wearable form.

Young survivalists (Girl Scouts and boy scouts) are also taught the importance of using the paracord as a survival tool. On the other hand, the paracord is a poor choice for an emergency tourniquet as its small diameter will crush tissue without applying the needed pressure to stop bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Tablet Weaving (often card weaving in the United States) is a weaving {{technique}} where tablets or {{cards are}} used to create the shed through which the weft is passed.
