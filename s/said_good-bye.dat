500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I <b>said</b> <b>good-bye,</b> and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913 {{he had a}} {{temporary}} break-down partly from over-work, went to England on six months' leave, and soon after World War I broke out in August 1914, acted as a chaplain at the Liverpool camp. He applied for a year's {{leave of absence from}} his school to go to the front in 1916, but the council of the school would not grant it, and Waddy with much regret resigned and <b>said</b> <b>good-bye</b> to the school at the prizegiving on 16 June. He sailed on 22 August, and whether on a troopship, in camp in England, at the front in France or in Palestine, had the same understanding comradeship with the men as he had had with the boys of his school. He was invalided home to Australia in July 1918 and arrived in September. Soon afterwards he was offered a canonry of St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem, as Archdeacon for Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan then {{he was in charge of}} re-organizing the education work of the Anglican Church there. He was at Jerusalem for over five years, and in July 1924 was appointed secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.

60|$|Longmore {{afterwards}} {{remembered in}} favour of his friend's fine manner {{that he had not}} measured at this moment the dusky abyss over which it hovered. Hut a deepening subterranean echo, loudest at the last, lingered on his spiritual ear. For the present his keenest sensation was a desire to get away and cry aloud that M. de Mauves was no better than a pompous dunce. He bade him an abrupt good-night, which was to serve also, he <b>said,</b> as <b>good-bye.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{what had}} passed, Caldigate, of course, took his {{departure}} {{on the following}} morning. <b>Good-bye</b> <b>said</b> the old man, as the son grasped his hand, 'Good-bye.' He made no overture to come even {{as far as the}} hall in making this his final adieu.|$|R

5000|$|After a 15-minute introduction, {{during which}} Gombitová {{discussed}} her temporary comeback and rise to prominence, the conversation {{turned to her}} crash. When finally asked to recall that date, she responded with:I remember that day, even though it makes me sad thinking of it or when Im questioned about it. I remember that night, well, that afternoon when I called Janko Lehotský, I mean by phone, that I didnt feel well and I didnt {{want to go to}} the concert, if theres something he could do about it. Of course there wasnt, there was a concert in Brno, so we went. It was very bad weather, I can remember that.

And I, actually, didnt know who I belonged to. It was a very sad moment ... point in time. Well then, Janko didnt make a comment on anything and I, I didnt know, I mean, whether Im staying with Janko or whom in fact. And thats how we actually split up, <b>said</b> <b>good-byes</b> and went home. And well then, what happened just happened. Thats how I recall it. I dont know, guys, if they want to have their say. I see it like this.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it is mine to help you," [...] said Mark, {{an impulse}} of {{youthful}} enthusiasm and sympathy swelling his heart as his mind suddenly reverted {{to the morning}} when he left England, and <b>said</b> his last <b>good-bye</b> to the fair one with the golden hair and the rosebud mouth and [...] "such lovely blue eyes!" ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{was with}} me in the ship in which I had taken my passage [...] "home," [...] as I insisted on calling England, to his amusement, and when we had grasped hands for the last time and had <b>said</b> our last <b>good-bye,</b> he added this one more last word: [...] "Of all the people I have ever known you are the only one I don't know." ...|$|R
60|$|Later on he {{introduced}} me to Dr. Hervey, who loaded me down with Board of Health reports and pamphlets on the subject, and took me out to Kalihi, the Honolulu receiving station, where suspects were examined and confirmed lepers were held for deportation to Molokai.

Then, as often aforetime, we gathered {{together in the}} cheer of the red hearth-flame, while outside the wind of a winter twilight sang through fair white valleys brimmed with a reddening sunset, and a faint, serene, silver-cold star glimmered over the willow at the gate.|$|R
