He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid.

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on an eminently urban phenomenon, with the accent on urban. The phenomenon in question {{plays an important}} role in theories of modern urban culture. City <b>strolling</b> refers to the way we move along while walking through the city. City <b>strolling</b> often is understood exclusively under the hegemony of an optical regime, but this is one-sided. City <b>strolling</b> is related just as much to the bodily experience of the atmosphere of an area in the city. The paper first traces the origins of city <b>strolling.</b> Then it gives a phenomenological description of the phenomenon itself. A rough genealogy of city <b>strolling</b> follows, along with some hints for concepts of urban planning. Then the thesis is developed that city <b>strolling</b> is especially devoted to the exploration of the atmosphere of the city. This leads to a discussion of Michel de Certeau’s “rhetoric of walking” before drawing some conclusions and hinting at a phenomenon closely related to city <b>strolling</b> that has become current in contemporary discussions of urban culture: street art...|$|R
