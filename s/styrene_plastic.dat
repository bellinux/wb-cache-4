25|$|Some of the company's first promotional {{vehicles}} appeared {{about the}} same time as the museum pieces, and though they were not brass era, they were yet molded in plastic. One model was the Audi 100 sedan, the real car being one of the first Audis to be exported to the United States around 1969. This model was slightly larger than 1:43 scale, in a silver box with black lettering. The car was well detailed in <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic,</b> especially the front grille and also the floorpan and engine features on the plastic chassis. This model may have been one of the first promotionals offered by Cursor, and perhaps somewhat rare, because it is not mentioned in Force's (1990) book.|$|E
2500|$|A good {{vehicle for}} {{analysis}} is the 1923 Benz Diesel Lastkraftwagen 5K3. The truck was notable for being Mercedes Benz's first diesel. The model is {{five and a}} half inches long, and made of a sturdy, rather heavy styrene type plastic that seems heavier than the <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> used by American companies AMT or Jo-Han, the American promotional model and kit makers. It is also much more solid than most French Minialuxe models or early Brumm carriages and steam vehicles which seemed much more 'spidery' and delicate in the use of their plastic.|$|E
2500|$|It appears 1959 was {{a pivotal}} year for promotional model makers, and PMC in particular. Perhaps {{some of the}} company's decline {{had to do with}} the expense of {{engineering}} the new non-warping <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> mixed with the tooling required to make the ever more popular kits that other manufacturers took up. PMC's kits were very simple and not as well known as those of AMT, SMP or Jo-Han. As a company, Jo-Han did well, but was always the lesser of the Big Three (being AMT, MPC and JoHan. Venerable maker SMP was absorbed by AMT, but PMC was several rungs down the promo ladder by 1960 and gradually weakened through the decade.|$|E

50|$|Crazing {{occurs in}} some {{thermoplastics}} such as acrylonitrile butadiene <b>styrene</b> (ABS <b>plastic)</b> when stressed. It {{is a typical}} response in rubber toughening, where crazes are initiated at the surfaces of the rubber particles added to toughen the material.|$|R

2500|$|Chassis detail varied {{quite a bit}} in {{different}} models. Though more toy-like in execution, early International pickups had detailed plastic bases with engine, exhaust and suspension details clearly molded. Starting about 1954, though, most bases/chassis were made of metal, which apparently added structural strength for friction motors that started to be popular in many promotionals. For example, the 1955 Bel Air without friction motor had a chassis completely smooth and molded in plastic, while the 1954 Corvette, with [...] "spin-torque motor" [...] (as PMC called it), had a metal base. Though PMC offered no promotionals after 1960, other promotional model makers found the new and harder <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> durable enough to support the motor. Also, plastic bases did not rust over time.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors Corporation was {{a common}} client of Jo-Han, {{producing}} mainly 1/25 scale promo models. 1959 and 1960 Rambler station wagons were produced by Jo-Han. These were not offered in kit form - but the demand was not as great for station wagon kits. These were later re-issued by X-El Products and Okey Spaulding in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though perhaps not as collectible, the later issues were made in non-warping <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic.</b> The company also made Rambler Classic sedans and American convertibles for 1963-1965, however, the 1963 and 1964 versions were of a slightly larger 1:24 scale, apparently AMC wanted them that way. [...] Also interesting is that both the dealer promo and the dimestore versions of these Classics came with friction motors - as usually the promo versions did not.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of form liners, which vary based on the application. Single-use form liners are usually made of <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> and are normally discarded after the first use. Multi-use form liners are usually made of ABS plastic and range in number of uses from 2 to 10 or more. Multiple-reuse form liners are usually made of polyurethane, a heavy rubber material known for its reusability and used frequently by departments of transportation on sound walls, bridges and other applications. Other form liner materials used can include polystyrene foam, fiberglass, and even aluminum-- <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic,</b> ABS plastic, and urethane {{are considered to be}} the industry standard, and are most often specified in plans by architects and engineers.|$|E

The Super Rare chase {{pieces in the}} set are previews of the Jade Rebellion faction, with the ships Black Lotus and Tiger's Breath, as well as Zheng Li Kwan, a 3-point treasure switcher and Jade Rebellion captain. Participation prizes from WizKids for Approved Play tournaments included 18 Limited Edition crew members, printed on glossy cardstock instead of the more usual <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acrylonitrile {{butadiene}} <b>styrene</b> (ABS) <b>plastic</b> {{is commonly}} used in original equipment sport bikes and certain aftermarket fairing manufacturers due to its strong, flexible and light weight properties. The advantage of ABS over other plastics is that it combines the strength and rigidity of acrylonitrile and styrene with the toughness of polybutadiene rubber. The proportions of each property vary based on the targeted result.|$|R
50|$|It relies upon a small pump drip {{irrigation}} {{repeat cycle timer}} and perforated cap to drip the mineral solution over plant roots rather than misting them with an atomizer nozzle or spray nozzle as is done in proper, conventional aeroponics.

40|$|Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a volatile, toxic liquid {{used as a}} monomer in the {{manufacture}} of synthetic rubber, <b>styrene</b> <b>plastics,</b> acrylic fiber and adhesives. ACN is a potent neurotoxin and a carcinogen, which produces tumors in rats, particularly gliomas of the brain. A role for free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation in the toxicity of ACN has been suggested. We examined the ability of taurine, an antioxidant amino acid, to attenuate ACN-induced alterations in lipid peroxidation, cellular DNA fragmentation, GSH, vitamin C and vitamin E levels in blood and brain of rats. Rats were administered with ACN at a concentration of 100 ppm in drinking water and sacrificed after 14 and 28 days. The level of lipid peroxidation and the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants were assayed. The obtained data were compared with those obtained from ACN rats co-treated with taurine for 14 and 28 days. It was observed that taurine treatment counteracted the oxidative stress induced by ACN by reducing the levels of peroxidation, and enhancing the activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants...|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{sold only}} through mail order in 1984 as a kit without batteries, radio and charger, the Big Bear {{featured}} a plastic, tub-styled chassis, Mabuchi M480-RS motor, {{mechanical speed control}} and live axle rear suspension {{as opposed to an}} independent setup. Tires were wide, chevron-treaded implement-styled units and actually comprised the majority of the Big Bear's suspension. The shock absorbers were simple coilover units which allowed for limited suspension travel. Coil springs also served to hold the front bumper in place and absorb impact. The body was a highly detailed <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> Datsun pickup with driver figure and [...] "Big Bear" [...] decal set.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic: Royalex is a {{composite}} material, comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment. As a canoe material, Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics such as polyethylene. Royalex canoes are, however, more expensive than aluminium canoes or canoes made from traditionally molded or roto-molded polyethylene hulls. It is heavier, and less suited for high-performance paddling than fiber-reinforced composites, such as fiberglass, kevlar, or graphite. Rotational molding Roto-molded polyethylene is a cheaper alternative to Royalex. Production of Royalex ceased in 2014.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{cellulose}} acetate, {{the material}} {{used to create}} Lego bricks, {{was replaced by the}} more stable acrylonitrile butadiene <b>styrene</b> (ABS <b>plastic),</b> which is still used today. ABS is non-toxic, is less prone to discolouration and warping, and is more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals. Samsonite manufacturing in North America did not switch at the same time, and still used some degree of cellulose acetate in its Lego products.|$|R

3000|$|... 3 D {{printing}} {{technologies have}} developed and {{advanced to the}} point where 3 D CAD models can be effectively printed (Breen et al. [2003]; and Simondetti [2002]). These modeling techniques are defined to be “the process of joining materials to make objects from 3 D model data, usually layer upon layer” (Buswell et al. [2007]; and Lim et al. [2012]). Having the ability to create physical models through a printing process presents an opportunity to support traditional information delivery with an accurate, scaled representation of a three dimensional space. There are many models of 3 D printers with similar technologies. The printers work by essentially building up an object with individual thin layers of a material, such as plastics or starch. ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene <b>styrene)</b> <b>plastics</b> or PLA (polylactic acid) plastics are two of the more common plastic outputs. A 3 D printed model was selected to represent a physical model to test its applicability as a format for information display. Ultimately, the means to achieve the end result of a physical model are not relevant to the outcomes of the study, as the primary objective was to test a physical model as opposed to blueprints or a CAD model.|$|R

50|$|Parts are {{produced}} by injection of liquid <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> under very high pressure into complex steel molds. These molds are generally composed of two halves that sandwich the parts; however, 'slide molds' may consist of many steel components to allow greater levels of detail to be incorporated into a single sprue. Once the plastic cools, it {{is removed from the}} mold. In the 1960s and 1970s, typical vehicle kits might contain 50 to 200 individual parts. Today it is common for a single vehicle kit to contain from 300 to 1200 parts. Each part must be carefully cut from the 'sprue' (the plastic channels that allow the plastic to flow into the mold and which hold the parts in place), cleaned of any flaws or mold marks, and then assembled.|$|E
