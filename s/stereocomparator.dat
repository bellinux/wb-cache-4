5000|$|According to A. Schnell, this {{minor planet}} was {{probably}} named for Baroness Valentine Noémi von Rothschild (1886-1969) to celebrate her engagement to Baron Sigismund von Springer (1873-1927). Noémi von Rothschild's father, Baron Rothschild, had recently donated a <b>stereocomparator</b> to the Vienna Observatory.

5000|$|Pulfrich Peak (...) is a peak {{near the}} east part of Wild Spur on Arctowski Peninsula, {{on the west}} coast of Graham Land. Mapped by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) from photos taken by Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd. in 1956-57. Named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1960 for Carl Pulfrich (1858-1927), [...] "father of stereophotogrammetry," [...] who {{independently}} developed a <b>stereocomparator</b> in 1901 and developed the principle of the [...] "floating mark" [...] established by Franz Stolze.|$|E
5000|$|Hübl Peak (...) is a peak west of Stolze Peak on Arctowski Peninsula, on {{the west}} coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. It was mapped by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey from photos taken by Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd in 1956-57, and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for Artur Freiherr von Hübl (1853-1932), an Austrian {{surveyor}} who was head of the topographic section of the Militärgeographisches Institut, Vienna, and in 1894 designed a <b>stereocomparator</b> which was developed independently by Dr. Carl Pulfrich in 1901.|$|E
5000|$|In 1897 Finsterwalder {{addressed}} the German Mathematical Society, and he described {{some of the}} results of projective geometry he was applying to photogrammetry. His theory of large triangle meshes became known as the [...] "Finsterwaldersche fields method" [...] (1915). His analytical approach was laborious however, prompting development of analogue instrumentation with stereo measurement permitting faster optical/mechanical reconstruction of the photographic data arrays to determine object points. This was assisted by new technology; Carl Pulfrich's <b>stereocomparator</b> (1901) and Eduard Ritter von Orel's stereoautograph (1907), both instruments built by the company Carl Zeiss.|$|E

O. M., Zeiss PSK 1 and Hilger and Watts stereocomparators. Special attention is paid to the production model of the Hilger and Watts <b>stereocomparator,</b> which differs in several important respects from the prototype. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} stereophotogrammetric {{method is}} introduced {{to measure the}} three-dimensional geometry of articular surfaces in vitro. Information of this kind is particularly useful for mathematical joint models and anthropological studies. The method requires no specific equipment, such as a <b>stereocomparator,</b> contrarily to other techniques reported (e. g. Ghosh, 1983) and is relatively simple and inexpensive. The background of the method is outlined in the present paper, and results of accuracy and precision tests are presented. It is shown that an accuracy {{on the order of}} 0. 2 mm (95 % confidence interval) is well feasible in actual knee-joint evaluations, if the measuring procedure is conducted carefully. The method is illustrated by measuring and comparing the articular surface geometries of a bilateral pair of knee joints...|$|E
40|$|Stereograms mark a {{threshold}} in understanding visual perception. Modern study of stereopsis began with Wheatstone&#x 27;s {{invention of the}} stereogram and stereoscope (~ 1832), important tools in vision research and technical imagery ever since. Stereoscopic images formed with frieze and wallpaper patterns in illuminated Insular manuscripts such as the Book of Durrow (~ 680 CE), Lindisfarne Gospels (~ 700 - 720), and Book of Kells (~ 800) show that, long before spectacle-quality magnifying lenses (~ 1286), illuminators somehow copied multicolored, microscopically detailed designs _freehand_ with an accuracy unsurpassed in scientific instruments until the Renaissance (but well within the power of normally sighted humans&#x 27; stereoscopic discrimination). If the artists accomplished this feat by free fusion using the unaided eyes as a magnifying <b>stereocomparator,</b> as suggested, {{they should have been}} able to create autostereograms. Did they? Here I report two examples of an apparent stereopair from the Book of Durrow, which gives a sharp, strongly three-dimensional image that includes, among other symbols, an eye-shaped sign identified with mirages (Fig. 1). Apparently, precocious empirical knowledge of stereopsis played more than a technical role in the creation of some of the world&#x 27;s more famous graphic art...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 167 - 170. The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} near real time photogrammetric PC based system to study the {{regional}} body surface motions of human beings during respiration. By being able to measure the body surface motion of the human torso during breathing it is possible to evaluate the respiratory muscle functions, i. e. the functions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, the only skeletal muscles that are essential to life and which enable us to breathe. Previous studies in this field over the past years have successfully employed stereophotogrammetric analysis. The traditional photogrammetric method however was very time consuming in that it involved the taking of stereo pictures with 35 mm cameras, developing the negatives and measuring them in a <b>stereocomparator.</b> The time factor involved severely restricted the research to physiologic studies. For the study to be expanded so that it {{could be used as a}} diagnostic tool in the hospital ward environment the time to obtain the necessary results had to be considerably reduced and simplified. A near real time photogrammetric PC based system had to be designed to replace the traditional photogrammetric method. A near real time system was developed for capturing dynamic pictures of the breathing cycle of the patients using a pair of video cameras, a two channel split screen vision mixer and a video cassette recorder with digital storage, all mounted on a custom built hospital cot for easy use in the hospital ward. The images to be measured are selected by viewing the split screen in dynamic stereoscopic mode and selected images are captured on an IBM personal computer equipped with an image processing card. A computing package called TAG has been designed for easy use by non-photogrammetric personnel to evaluate stored images. TAG guides the user through the different processing stages from connecting the video machine to the IBM computer, transferring the selected images, measuring control and object points on the images, and processing the data...|$|E
40|$|I think Bart Kosko {{was right}} when he accused the Aristotelian {{mathematics}} of yes and no and of certainties, of being incapable of representing the world which in jàct {{is made up of}} nuances. The architect is well aware of this difficulty when he realizes that each architectural measurement carries with it an uncertainty which is extremely difficult to express in numbers and which, on the contrary, is perhaps more important than the measurement itself, since this is the sign of the hand of man and, at times, of the consummate experience of an artist. Kosko goes on to propose a new - fuzzy - logic according to Lofri Zadeh. And it appears that these fuzzy numbers with their amazing ability to incorporate uncertainty, have a future in architecture. Let's imagine we have a tridimensional model not mere/y reduced to a discrete schematic drawing of points and lines, but continuous, just like reality, or at least as continuous as possible in light of the reduction relationship that is typical of each architectural representation. Let's imagine a model which contains the vagueness of what is real, the poetic uncertainty of its measurements, capable of restoring, if necessary, the numbers of traditional representation without loosing the fuzzy trait of reality. I say that every surveyor, every planner and every architecture expert would want this type of model. No more doubts on the metric reliability ola survey done by others, without declaring and measuring the uncertainty. Well this model exists and is present/y being experimented at the laboratory of Photogrammetry of the Department of Representation and Survey at the University "La Sapienza" of Rome, in the framework of the "Finalized Project Cultural Heritage" of the National Council for Scientific Research. The DCM (Digital Continuous Model) as it has been called, simplifies the complex procedures of traditional survey enormously by unifying them while including the possible graphic representations. A DCM consists in a tridimensional photographic representation which can be examined {{with the help of a}} simple computer system, a screen and a pair of active glasses. It is not, however, just a simple stereoscopic photograph, but a continuous system of stereo photogrammetric models. Up to now, the examination of a photogrammetric stereo model was a privilege reserved for a few experts and needed specialist skills: the ability to use a <b>stereocomparator,</b> the ability to orient the model as well as complete visual tolerance of the strong contrasts typical of photogrammetry. Moreover, a photogrammetric survey always includes a series of models, therefore, once the study of the first model has ended one progresses to the second and so on, repeating the above-mentioned laborious procedures each time. With the DCM all this is a thing of the past: the viewing is immediate, the orientation procedures take place at the start, once and for all, and therefore may be ignored by the user, the passage from one model to another is fluid and automatic and consequent/y it feels as if there is just one image that can be viewed by moving around the object or by rising up off the ground in order to examine all the details. Furthermore, the system can measure distances and areas as well as drawing lines on the object with the methods used by any C 4 D. These lines can be projected on a p ian in order to obtain any type of graphic representation from the DCM. Theoretical/y, is the DCM a new representational method? To a certain extent it is, even if it would be more correct to consider the DCM as a 'generalization' of the graphic models already known. But the DCM has one additional virtue which I have already tried to underline: its ability to preserve the fuzzy quality of the real object...|$|E
