50|$|Gaskets are {{mechanical}} seals, usually ring-shaped, which <b>seal</b> <b>flange</b> joints. Gaskets vary by construction, {{materials and}} features. Commonly used gaskets are non-metallic (ASME B 16.21), spiral-wound (ASME B 16.20) and ring-joint (ASME B 16.20). Non-metallic gaskets are used with flat- or raised-face flanges. Spiral-wound gaskets are used with raised-face flanges, and ring-joint gaskets are used with ring-type joint (RTJ) flanges. Stress develops between an RTJ gasket and the flange groove when the gasket is bolted to a flange, leading to plastic deformation of the gasket.|$|R

5000|$|Flanges {{are flat}} rings {{around the end}} of pipes which mate with an {{equivalent}} flange from another pipe, the two being held together by bolts usually passed through holes drilled through the flanges. A deformable gasket, usually elastomeric, placed between raised faces on the mating <b>flanges</b> provides the <b>seal.</b> <b>Flanges</b> are designed to a large number of specifications that differ because of dimensional variations in pipes sizes and pressure requirements, and because of independent standards development. In the U.S. flanges are either threaded or welded onto the pipe. In the European market flanges are usually welded onto the pipe. In the US flanges are available in a standard 125 lb. bolt pattern as well as a 250 lb (and heavier) bolt pattern (steel bolt pattern). Both are usually rated at [...] A flanged joint is rigid and can bear both tension and compression as well as a limited degree of shear and bending. It also can be dismantled after assembly. Due to the rigid nature of the joint and the risk of excessive bending moment being imposed, it is advised that flanged pipework is not buried.|$|R

50|$|The {{fundamental}} concept {{underlying the}} improved sealability for constant seating stress gaskets are that (i) if the <b>flange</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces {{are capable of}} attaining a seal, (ii) the sealing elements are compatible with the process fluid and application, and (iii) the sufficient gasket seating stress is achieved on installation necessary to affect a seal, then {{the possibility of the}} gasket leaking in-service is greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.|$|R
40|$|The {{narrow channel}} (NC) {{facility}} design {{is based on}} the GALCIT Detonation Tube (GDT) test section design of Mike Kaneshige [3]. The main differences are 1) the design of the longitudinal bolted joint was simplified and 2) the keys for the flanges are not designed to assist with shear loading. The GDT side windows and PLIF window may be used in the NC facility. 304 SS was chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance. The yield strength is 275 MPa. 304 SS is non-magnetic and is therefore more difficult to grind on a table with magnetic locking. All four plates were blanchard ground (using mechanical locking to the table through some of the bolt holes which were drilled before grinding) by a subcontractor for Hales.

40|$|The {{modeling}} features {{used in a}} steady-state {{heat transfer}} problem using SINDA/FLUINT are described. The problem modeled is a 125 feet long, 3 inch diameter pipe, filled with liquid oxygen flow driven by a given pressure gradient. The pipe is fully insulated in five sections. Three sections of 1 inch thick spray-on foam and two sections of vacuum jacket. The model evaluates friction, turns losses and convection heat transfer between the fluid and the pipe wall. There is conduction through the foam insulation with temperature dependent thermal conductivity. The vacuum space is modeled with radiation and gas molecular conduction, if present, in the annular gap. Heat is transferred between the outer surface and surrounding ambient by natural convection and radiation; and, by axial conduction along the pipe and through the vacuum jacket spacers and welded <b>seal</b> <b>flanges.</b> The model makes extensive use of SINDA/FLUINT basic capabilities such as the GEN option for nodes and conductors (to generate groups of nodes or conductors), the SIV option (to generate single, temperature varying conductors), the SIM option (for multiple, temperature varying conductors) and the M HX macros for fluids (to generate strings of lumps, paths, and ties representing a diabatic duct). It calls subroutine CONTRN (returns the relative location in the G-array of a network conductor, given an actual conductor number) enabling an extensive manipulation of conductor (calculates an assignment of their values) with DO loops.

40|$|Cracks at the <b>seal</b> fillet <b>flange</b> and the strut pilot groove {{of primary}} turbine drain {{passage of the}} space shuttle main engine (SSME) high {{pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) were observed and reported.

Thus, a stress analysis was conducted to determine an influence of the various operation and installation loads on the stresses of the HPOTP main mounting flange. To do this, a 3 -D finite element model of the HPOTP housing was generated. A fairly comfortable margin of stresses at the flange fillet with respect to the yield stress of Inconel 718 is shown.

40|$|The Consolidated Incineration Facility, at the Department of Energy`s Savannah River Site, is {{designed}} to treat solid and liquid RCRA hazardous and mixed wastes generated by site operations and clean-up activities. During CIF`s pretrial burn campaigns in 1995, an appreciable amount of water was recovered from the HEPA housings. Questions were immediately raised as {{to the source of}} the water, and the degree of wetness of the filters during operation. There are two primary issues involved: Water could reduce the life expectancy and performance of the HEPA filters, housing, and associated ducting, and wet HEPAs also present radiological concerns for personnel during filter change-out. A similar phenomenon was noted at the Offgas Components Test Facility (OCTF), a 1 / 10 scale pilot of CIF`s air pollution control system. Tests at OCTF indicated the water`s most likely origin to be vapor condensing out from the flue gas stream due to excessive air in-leakage at housing door <b>seals,</b> ducting <b>flanges,</b> and actual holes in the ducting. The rate of accumulation bears no statistical correlation to such process parameters as steam flow, reheater outlet temperature and offgas velocity in the duct. Test results also indicated that the HEPA filter media is moistened by the initial process flow while the facility is being brought on line. However, even when the HEPA filters were manually drenched prior to startup, they became completely dry within four hours of the time steam was introduced to the reheater.

30|$|The <b>flange</b> <b>sealing</b> {{structure}} {{was used in}} a core holder under high temperature and high pressure. The overall upstream and downstream plunger pistons were located in the chamber for confining pressure test, so that the end face of a rock was effectively contacted with the piston of the holder. Using the flexible graphite to seal the confining pressure in the rock samples and holder overcomes the shortage of traditional equipments that they cannot be applied for testing at high temperature when rubber is used for sealing. Furthermore, the copper casing subjected to thermal treatment in the vacuum was used to isolate the rock samples and confining pressure, which can effectively transfer confining pressure and reliably resist high temperature and pressure, so as to work continuously. The pore pressure and confining pressure were loaded by utilizing the EDC servo control system, which can automatically control the pressure. When pore pressure or confining pressure changed, the servo control system was able to compensate pressure, so that pressure was maintained at a certain value and did not change with temperature or other conditions.|$|R
40|$|The Subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) which is latched to a subsea wellhead {{is one of}} several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and it is the most important and critical equipment, as it becomes the last line of protection against blowout. The BOP system used in Subsea drilling operations is considered a Safety – Critical System, with a high severity consequence following its failure. Following past offshore blowout incidents such as the most recent Macondo in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been investigations, research, and improvements sought for improved understanding of the BOP system and its operation. This informs the need for a systematic re-evaluation of the Subsea BOP system to understand its associated risk and reliability and identify critical areas/aspects/components. Different risk analysis techniques were surveyed and the Failure modes effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) selected to be used to drive the study in this thesis. This is due to it being a simple proven cost effective process that can add value {{to the understanding of the}} behaviours and properties of a system, component, software, function or other. The output of the FMECA can be used to inform or support other key engineering tasks such as redesigning, enhanced qualification and testing activity or maintenance for greater inherent reliability and reduced risk potential. This thesis underscores the application of the FMECA technique to critique associated risk of the Subsea BOP system. System Functional diagrams was developed with boundaries defined, a FMECA were carried out and an initial select list of critical component failure modes identified. The limitations surrounding the confidence of the FMECA failure modes ranking outcome based on Risk priority number (RPN) is presented and potential variations in risk interpretation are discussed. The main contribution in this thesis is an innovative framework utilising Multicriteria decision making (MCDA) analysis techniques with consideration of fuzzy interval data is applied to the Subsea BOP system critical failure modes from the FMECA analysis. It utilised nine criticality assessment criteria deduced from expert consultation to obtain a more reliable ranking of failure modes. The MCDA techniques applied includes the technique for order of Preference for similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy TOPSIS, TOPSIS with interval data, and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The outcome of the Multi-criteria analysis of the BOP system clearly shows failures of the Wellhead connector, LMRP hydraulic connector and Control system related failure as the Top 3 most critical failure with respect to a well control. The critical failure mode and components outcome from the analysis in this thesis is validated using failure data from industry database and a sensitivity analysis carried out. The importance of maintenance, testing and redundancy to the BOP system criticality was established by the sensitivity analysis. The potential for MCDA to be used for more specific analysis of criteria for a technology was demonstrated. Improper maintenance, inspection, testing (functional and pressure) are critical to the BOP system performance and sustenance of a high reliability level. Material selection and performance of components (<b>seals,</b> <b>flanges,</b> packers, bolts, mechanical body housings) relative to use environment and operational conditions is fundamental to avoiding failure mechanisms occurrence.

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted flange joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a flange joint assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed flange joints.

This gasketless flange {{includes}} a groove and an annular lip that is machined {{in one of the}} flange being in contact with the other flange to form a seal line when the flanges are assembled. In this study, first, fundamental dimensions are examined for PVC-U to obtain the best sealing performance. Then, the effects of material difference and flange nominal size on the sealing performance of new gasketless flange are investigated for two types of materials, 0. 25 % carbon steel (S 25 C JIS) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U JIS). It is found that the critical internal pressure where leakage appears is mainly controlled by the maximum normal stress at the annular lip for each material even if the flange nominal sizes are different. The gasketless flange made by PVC-U shows the higher critical internal pressure compared with the case of S 25 C if the same clamping forces are applied. The effect of stress relaxation for PVC-U on the sealing performance is also considered. Then, it may be concluded that this PVC-U gasketless flange also has good sealing performance...|$|R

[...] It was also particularly light, with a ready-to-run XUD9 weighing 157 kg, 15% less than a comparable diesel of the previous generation. However, if the cooling system is neglected or improperly bled after filling - needing a raised filling level because the expansion tank is not the highest point in the system - the engine has a tendency to blow its head gasket.

Because radiators (typical life 100,000 miles), generally have only just sufficient cooling capacity when new, in order to help get the engine to operating temperature quickly, silting causes significant problems.
