5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage one of the most <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle was one {{of three}} castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the {{aftermath}} of his northern campaign to capture York. Cambridge, or Grantabridge as it was then known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both strategically <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> at risk of rebellion. The initial building work was conducted by Picot, the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.|$|E

5|$|Marks of cadency are {{generally}} not used with crests, {{though it is not}} incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less <b>significant,</b> <b>and</b> are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage done}} to Eindhoven was <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> can be {{considered}} a victory for JG 3.

The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.|$|E

5|$|The fetal {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was {{looked at as}} part of the study for the reintroduction of F express service as it could reduce the impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require <b>significant</b> <b>and</b> expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E
