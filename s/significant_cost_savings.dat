5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

25|$|With {{software}} and other non-animal methods, {{there is also}} no expensive disposal of equipment or hazardous material removal. Some programs also allow educators to customize lessons and include built-in test and quiz modules that can track student performance. Furthermore, animals (whether dead or alive) can be used only once, while non-animal resources can be used for many years—an added benefit that could result in <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> for teachers, school districts, and state educational systems.|$|E
25|$|Those who reload {{with the}} primary goal of maximizing {{accuracy}} or terminal performance may end up paying more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this is especially true for military calibers which are commonly available as surplus. Maximum performance, however, requires the highest quality components, which are usually the most expensive. Reloaders who reload {{with the primary}} goal of saving money on ammunition, however, can make a few tradeoffs to realize <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> with a minimal sacrifice in quality.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{attempting}} to fully regain prestige by spending the additional money necessary to order liners that were {{fast enough to}} win back the Blue Riband from Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse or large enough to rival Oceanic in size, Cunard tried to maximize their profitability {{in order to remain}} solvent enough to fend off any takeover attempts by competing comglomerate International Mercantile Marine Co.. The three new ships were not especially fast, as they were designed for the immigrant trade, but provided <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> in fuel economy. The three ships became both instruments and models through which Cunard was able to successfully compete with its larger rivals – most notably IMM's lead company, White Star.|$|E

50|$|The CID {{deposits}} {{relative lack}} of consolidation and proximity {{close to the surface}} in most cases renders them liable to bulk mining with little or no need for drilling and blasting. This then is a <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> to miners, who can offset a lower revenue from Fe percentages in the ore via the ease of extraction. Also, in most cases, beneficiation can increase the in-situ iron grade several percent by washing out the majority of clay, carbonate and hydrous limonite cements.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} the NXEA franchise, Angel Trains {{opted to}} use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a {{test-bed}} unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new traction equipment. The DC motors, traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new AC motors, and 3-phase converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. Because AC motors are more reliable than DC ones and require significantly less maintenance, this should potentially bring <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings.</b> The work has the potential to extend the life of the Class 317 by up to 20 years. Angel Trains and Bombardier will evaluate the performance of the unit compared to a conventional Class 317.|$|E
25|$|Thrust was {{provided}} {{by a pair of}} 30kN axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. These were directly mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing. Each engine drove a 6-kW generator for the 28-V onboard electronics, as well as a hydraulic pump and a bleed air system for cabin pressurization. The wing itself was typically empty, fuel was contained within two internally-support self-sealing fuel tanks and an additional lace-support bag held within the upper fuselage. The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used to start the engine. An improvised method of starting the engine using compressed air was heavily discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators successfully operated the Canberra's engines in such a manner, the benefit being <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> over the use of cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Powder {{is another}} {{significant}} cost of reloading, and one {{over which the}} handloader has significant control. In addition to the obvious step of using a minimum charge, rather than a full power one, <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> may be obtained through careful powder choice. Given the same bullet and cartridge, a faster burning powder will generally use a smaller charge of powder than required with a slower powder. For example, a 44 Magnum firing a 240-grain lead semi-wadcutter could be loaded with either Accurate Arms #2, a very fast pistol powder, or #9, a very slow pistol powder. When using the minimum loads, 9.0 grains (0.58 g) of AA #2 yield a velocity of 1126ft/s (343m/s), and 19.5 grains (1.26 g) of #9 yield 1364ft/s (416m/s). For {{the same amount of}} powder, AA #2 can produce approximately twice as many rounds, yet both powders cost the same per weight.|$|E

500|$|As this {{specification}} {{was being}} studied by various manufacturers, {{the first of}} the political storms that were to dog the project reared its head, when Defence Minister Duncan Sandys stated in the 1957 Defence White Paper that the era of manned combat was at an end and ballistic missiles were the weapons of the future. Within a decade, this philosophy became thoroughly discredited, but at the time, and in the climate of the Cold War and [...] "mutual deterrence", the missile as a weapons system appeared to make some sense, especially as it seemed missiles would offer <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> over manned aircraft. This viewpoint was vigorously debated by the aviation industry and within the MOD for years. Senior RAF officers argued against the White Paper's premise, stating the importance of mobility, and that the TSR-2 could not only replace the Canberra, but potentially the entire V bomber force.|$|E

40|$|Networks on a Chip (NoC) {{commonly}} employ {{an irregular}} mesh topology because of variations in module sizes and shapes. Consequently, low cost routing {{techniques such as}} XY routing are inadequate, raising the need for low cost alternatives. In this paper we first define a hardware resource based cost model for comparing different routing mechanisms. Next, we propose three hardware efficient routing methods for irregular mesh topology NoCs. Our methods combine a fixed routing function (such as XY or “don’t turn”) and reduced size routing tables based on the known distributed and source routing techniques.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis has been to {{estimate}} the optimal speed for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), and examine how this has changed since the financial crisis in 2008. 1 The optimal speed will {{be compared with the}} development in actual speed for the VLCC fleet. We present two speed optimization models and provide results of optimal speed under different market conditions. According to our results, the actual speed of VLCCs has decreased with 16 % since mid 2008. Both optimization models suggest that optimal speed still is below actual speed. Our analysis further indicates that it exists a <b>significant</b> <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> potential from reduced speed. We have analyzed several effects of reduced speed, including environmental, legal and piracy effects. We conclude that these will not {{have a significant impact on}} the speed decision. Our findings indicate that under the current market conditions the VLCC fleet should continue to slow steam, and in fact further reduce speed as there still exists a <b>significant</b> potential for <b>cost</b> <b>savings...</b>|$|R
