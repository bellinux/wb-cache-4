5000|$|Along {{with the}} search report, a search opinion is also established. The search opinion {{and the search}} report form {{together}} the so-called extended <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report. Before April 1, 2010, {{a response to the}} search opinion was optional. Currently however, under new Rule 70a EPC, a reply to the search opinion is mandatory, within six months [...] "after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report" [...] (which is also the time limit for requesting examination). If no reply is filed to the search opinion, the application is deemed to be withdrawn. The search opinion is therefore a conventional office action with a given time period to respond.|$|R

50|$|In the European patent grant procedure, {{the mention}} of the {{publication}} of the <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report in the European Patent Bulletin marks the start of the six-month period for filing the request for examination, paying the examination fee, paying the designation fees, and paying the extension fees.|$|R
5000|$|The Search Divisions of the EPO {{establish}} search reports, named [...] "European search reports", on {{the basis}} of the claims, [...] "with due regard to the description and any drawings". The <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report established for a patent application is transmitted to the applicant together with copies of any cited documents.|$|R
5000|$|On August 25, 2015, Techdirt {{reported}} that its article {{commenting on the}} 2014 New York Times article had similarly been removed from <b>European</b> <b>search</b> due to a Right to be Forgotten request.

5000|$|Under [...] and , an {{examination}} request {{must also be}} made within six months from the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions {{the publication of the}} <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report. The examination fee is also due at that time. If no examination request is made, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.|$|R
5000|$|Article 123(1) EPC {{provides}} {{the right for}} an applicant, in proceedings before the European Patent Office (EPO), to amend its European patent application and for a patent proprietor (during opposition proceedings) the right to amend its European patent. This must however be done {{in accordance with the}} Implementing Regulations, considering that the applicant is given [...] "at least one opportunity to amend the application of his own volition." [...] According to the Implementing Regulations, amendments before receiving the (extended) <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report are generally not allowed, amendments are allowed in response to the extended <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report (i.e., in response to the communication under [...] ), and amendments are also allowed shortly after entry into European phase of a PCT application (namely, in response to the communication under [...] ), but formally any further amendment is subject to the consent of the Examining Division.|$|R
50|$|The King's Fifth (1966) is a children's {{historical}} novel by Scott O'Dell {{that was the}} inspiration for the cartoon TV series The Mysterious Cities of Gold.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>search</b> {{report is}} drawn up {{in respect of}} a European patent {{application}} {{on the basis of}} the claims, with due regard to the description and any drawings. In addition, the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or a European patent application is determined by the claims, with the description and drawings being used to interpret the claims.|$|R
50|$|All the Contracting States {{party to}} the EPC {{at the time of}} filing of a European patent {{application}} are deemed to be designated in the request for grant of a European patent, i.e. upon filing of the application.

40|$|The Web {{has become}} a {{worldwide}} source of information and a mainstream business tool. It is changing the way people conduct the daily business of their lives. As these changes are occurring, {{we need to understand}} what Web searching trends are emerging within the various global regions. What are the regional differences and trends in Web searching, if any? What is the effectiveness of Web search engines as providers of information? As part of a body of research studying these questions, we have analyzed two data sets collected from queries by mainly European users submitted to AlltheWeb. com on 6 February 2001 and 28 May 2002. AlltheWeb. com is a major and highly rated <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engine. Each data set contains approximately a million queries submitted by over 200, 000 users and spans a 24 -hour period. This longitudinal benchmark study shows that <b>European</b> Web <b>searching</b> is evolving in certain directions. There was some decline in query length, with extremely simple queries. <b>European</b> <b>search</b> topics are broadening, with a notable percentage decline in sexual and pornographic searching. The majority of Web searchers view fewer than five Web documents, spending only seconds on a Web document. Approximately 50 % of the Web documents viewed by these European users were topically relevant. We discuss the implications for Web information systems and information content providers...|$|R

40|$|The {{most popular}} and widely used search engines are from the United States where search engine {{technology}} originated. However, a lot of <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engines have emerged during the last ten years, {{the most important of}} these being EuroSeek and AlltheWeb. <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engines are often developed with a more limited user group in mind, such as the speakers of a certain language or a particular country. They can be a better choice if your interests have a local European focus. A good place to start is for instance combined news and blog search engines. There are also at least two sizable web search engines in Europe with their own unique web indexes. One of these, Exalead, in fact offers more advanced search functions than any other web search engine today. In this context it is important to remember that the overlap between results from different search engines are generally overstated. The difference between relevance ranking algorithms employed by different search engines also means that the first few screens with results will vary considerably between search engines. Therefore using only one search engine is never recommendable. Particularly interesting experiments have been made by search engine developers in France. Examples are the visual interactive maps used by the meta search engine Kartoo and the graphically innovative user interface of Ujiko. The earlier mentioned Exalead offers many ways to refine search queries and also browse results using previews of web pages with keywords marked out. Wikio is the name of a news and blog search engine with Web 2. 0 aspirations in which you can contribute with articles of your own, vote on articles and create personalised news pages. In Sweden there have been developments in image search technology including content-based search, facial recognition and more secure family filters. Of particular interest among other <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engine advances is the interface of Quintura from Russia. With Quinturas interactive word clouds it is easy to preview how adding new search terms would change query results, before actually applying these terms. The European Union has contributed funding to <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engines project during the last few years. The most ambitious, the joint French-German Quaero project, unfortunately failed but two different branches have continued separately as Quaero and THESEUS. Another project is PHAROS and like Quaero it is focused on multimedia search whereas THESEUS is text-oriented and concerned with the semantic web. In 2007 The Article 29 Working Party of the European Union has been pushing the issue of protecting the search engine users privacy. They have corresponded with Google and as an outcome there have indeed been changes to the privacy policies of the four dominant US search engines. In Europe there have also been concerns about the use of copyrighted texts in news search engines. In fact there have been several legal disputes and in some cases Google has lost like in Belgium and Norway. Additionally some prominent Europeans have feared that the popular Google Book Search would be entirely dominated by English-language literature. It is therefore satisfying to see that during the last two years some major European libraries with big collections of French, German and Spanish literature have joined the Google Book Search...|$|R
40|$|A {{presentation}} and examination of opinions and perceptions among early visitors to Tahiti - from Samuel Wallis's discovery in 1767 {{to the arrival}} of the missionaries in 1797 - focusing on the most common themes discussed among the navigators and seamen: sex and promiscuous women, beautiful nature and easy access to food, but also negative aspects such as theft, violence, war and human sacrifice. Also under discussion is European perceptions of Tahitian religion and society, comparisons (made by the visitors) between Tahiti and Europe, and the <b>European</b> <b>search</b> for the Tahitian "character". One of the primary aims of the thesis is to investigate the viability of the "noble savage" myth...|$|R

5000|$|The {{programme}} for accelerated {{prosecution of}} European patent applications, or PACE programme, [...] "enables applicants {{who want their}} applications processed rapidly to obtain the <b>European</b> <b>search</b> report plus opinion under , the first examination report and any communication under [...] within tight deadlines". As of January 1, 2016, a written, online request ("PACE request") must be filed, using a [...] "dedicated request form (EPO Form 1005)", to request acceleration under the PACE programme. The PACE requests are excluded from public inspection. As of 2009, accelerated processing under PACE {{was reported to be}} requested in only 6.3% of files. An enquiry by the applicant to know when the next communication is to be expected is not regarded as a request for accelerated prosecution.|$|R

It is based on a network of National Inventories of 43 member countries and represents an important effort for the preservation of world's agrobiological diversity by providing information about the large genetic diversity kept by the collaborating collections. Moreover, EURISCO also assists its member countries in fulfilling legal obligations and commitments, e. g. with respect to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, the Second Global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture of the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, or the Convention on Biological Diversity.

5000|$|On March 29, 2016, Ixquick was {{discontinued}} in the United States - officially [...] "merged" [...] {{with the}} same company's Startpage search engine (a search engine affiliated with Google, reportedly {{with some of the}} privacy features of Ixquick, but using Google searches). Users entering ixquick.com are now automatically re-routed to startpage.com. However, at the end of Ixquick's merger notice (linked from the Ixquick's new home page), the company reports: [...] "We think you're going to love StartPage, but if you prefer original Ixquick search results, don't worry. They are still available at ixquick.eu." [...] Ixquick had long declared, on its home page and/or linked pages, that it operated in compliance with European Union privacy standards, and it apparently retains its original <b>European</b> <b>search</b> engine, at present (April, 2016) - though obviously downplaying it in favor of moving Ixquick.com patrons to Startpage.|$|R

That night, Carol, now also dressed in leopard skins, joins the other leopard-woman. Together, they {{crept into the}} camp. The brunette killed Professor Grant and destroyed the photographs from Carol's camera {{which he had been}} developing. The distraught Liz had taken sleeping pills when no one could locate her friend, and was groggy when Carol appeared in her tent. [...] "Elizabeth, it's me, your best friend Carol." [...] "We thought you'd been lost in the jungle..." [...] "It's just as well. Come!" [...] The two blondes left the camp and joined the other leopard-woman in the jungle. [...] "You will be initiated immediately, and death will be abolished eternally!" [...] Just as Liz realized {{what they were going to}} do, the two leopard-women plunged their fangs into her neck. In Liz's struggles, the original leopard-woman was knocked down and the choker she wore to fasten her neck together split. Her severed head rolled free and she perished as blood gushed from her neck.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} consumer behaviour in online travel information search. Based on Engel-Kollat-Blackwell Model, ATR and TAM theory, {{the study was}} designed to discover similarities and differences between European and Asian students in pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase stages. The study was conducted by qualitative research; a semi-structured interview was selected to be the research method, in order to unearth more detailed data through flexible conversation. According to the findings, European and Asian students have similar perspectives on the six selected determinants influencing the attitude towards the use of the Internet, including the perceived usefulness, the perceived ease of use, previous experience, others’ opinions, online security and inconsistency. Besides, the students in both groups are proved to have a repeating search habit. Despite the similarities, students from Europe and Asia have different travel information sources and searching purposes. While Asian students tend to use online travel information for a specific trip, <b>European</b> <b>search</b> for the information not only for trips but also for fun and social. Asian students also use guide books as alternative sources more often. In addition, Asian students may encounter more difficulties than their European counterparts due to the deficiency in the language backgrounds...|$|R
