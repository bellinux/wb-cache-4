This paper uses a feedback model to describe the general system transition process and identify key issues in the dynamics of system transition, with particular emphasis on stakeholder cost-benefit dynamics and <b>safety</b> <b>approval</b> processes. Finally, in addition to identifying dynamics and barriers to change the paper proposes methods for enabling transition through the use of levers such as incentives, mandates, and infrastructure development. The implementation of ADS-B is studied as a pathfinding technology for planned Air Transportation System changes. The paper states that overcoming stakeholder barriers and ensuring efficient <b>safety</b> <b>approval</b> and certification process are the key enablers to the successful implementation of ADS-B.

5000|$|On 7 June 2013, the Danish Ministry of Transport {{decided to}} {{implement}} one-man operation on the tendered Coastal Line, {{which led to}} the sacking of 50 guards. The one-man operation is set to start from 15 December 2013. Meanwhile, sickness absence among the sacked guards rose to six times the normal levels, resembling [...] "sick-out" [...] strike action. This compelled the train operating company DSB Øresund to offer the sacked guards a [...] "stay healthy bonus" [...] of up to 5000 Danish kroner per month (about US$900 or UK£600). The <b>safety</b> <b>approval</b> of one-man operation on the Coastal Line is part of a joint DSB one-man operation project, which entails that the Coastal Line will not be one-man operated before DSB has managed to obtain <b>safety</b> <b>approval</b> for other lines first. In August 2015 DSB stated that they would reevaluate whether or not they would implement one man operation on the Coastal Line. DSB stated at the same time, that they did not expect one man operation to be implemented on the Coastal Line in 2015.|$|R

50|$|Almost {{fifty years}} later, {{following}} unease after the Second Boer War that the British Army had been ill-equipped, a new office called the Ordnance Board was created.

The Ordnance Board, and its name, survived within the Ministry of Defence until the mid-1990s when it was renamed the Defence Ordnance Safety Group.

Safety assessment in rail technology is an activity {{that has to be}} carried out prior to application for <b>safety</b> <b>approval.</b> Three areas are identified for railways: • European wide regulated area (e. g. high speed directive 96 / 48 /EG and the Technical Specifications Interoperability), • Nationally regulated area, • Voluntary area, • Other transport systems. The authorities in the different areas are different national authorities. Regarding "other transport systems ” there might even be different authorities in the same country, as e. g. in Germany. Organisations and their interrelation that are concerned with safety assessment are described...|$|R
