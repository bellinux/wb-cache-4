500|$|Beginning in {{the days}} after the {{broadcast}} of [...] "Death on the Rock", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the London Evening Standard printed a story about Proetta's husband; the piece—citing the Gibraltar Police press officer—claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, The Sun labelled her [...] "the tart of Gib". Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet The Daily Telegraph which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in Gibraltar's 1967 referendum. In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued The Sun and other newspapers for libel and won <b>substantial</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{documentary}} attracted considerable controversy. On 26 April, {{two days}} before the programme was scheduled for broadcast, Sir Geoffrey Howe telephoned the chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to request that the authority delay the broadcast until after the inquest {{on the grounds that it}} risked prejudicing the proceedings. After viewing the programme and taking legal advice, the IBA decided on the morning of 28 April that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] should be broadcast as scheduled, and Howe was informed of the decision. Howe made further representation to the IBA that the documentary would be in contempt of the inquest; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to allow the broadcast. The programme was broadcast at 21:00 (GMT) on 28 April. The following morning, the British tabloid newspapers lambasted the programme, describing it as a [...] "slur" [...] on the SAS and [...] "trial by television", while several criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. Over the following weeks, newspapers repeatedly printed stories about the documentary's witnesses, in particular Carmen Proetta, who gave an account of seeing McCann and Farrell shot without warning by soldiers who arrived in a Gibraltar Police car. Proetta subsequently sued several newspapers for libel and won <b>substantial</b> <b>damages.</b> The Sunday Times conducted its own investigation and reported that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had misrepresented the views of its witnesses; the witnesses involved later complained to other newspapers that [...] "The Sunday Times" [...] had distorted their comments.|$|E
