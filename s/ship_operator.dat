The remaining two Slite ships, Athena and Kalypso were auctioned in August 1993. SF Line made a bid for the Kalypso, but both ships ended up sold to the newly established Malaysian cruise <b>ship</b> <b>operator</b> Star Cruises. In 1995 SF Line changed their name into Viking Line.|$|E
500|$|By then, {{the rivalry}} between the FW boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon {{came down to}} a race. The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister <b>ship</b> <b>Operator,</b> as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express, so one day in July, the Conveyor's Captain Shannon {{challenged}} Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek. The rules were rather odd, as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could run right through. As the race progressed, it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat, as she had stayed ahead {{for most of the}} race, despite having to stop several times. At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor, but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent [...] when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor. Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again. Fortunately Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met {{and that there was no}} serious damage. In fact, when Browne arrived in Quesnel, he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again.|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{engineer}} for the bridge project was James B. Eads, a self-taught engineer and accomplished diver and salvage <b>ship</b> <b>operator.</b> [...] During the Civil War Eads aided the Union by designing ironclads. The {{foot of the}} St. Louis bridge {{on the west bank}} was at the relatively wide Washington Avenue, giving it the advantage of allowing heavy road and rail traffic. Congress had prohibited Eads from building a suspension bridge across the Mississippi due to multiple recent failures, and a truss bridge favored by many bridge builders at the time would require at least five separate spans. Thus, Eads and his German assistants, Henry Flad and Charles Pfeifer, settled on an arch bridge design with three spans.|$|E
2500|$|The ship {{arrived at}} the {{scrapyard}} in Alang, India on Friday, 13 June 2008. On Thursday, 19 June the ship was beached at Plot 109 of the Alang scrapyard. Although partially beached, scrapping did not start immediately, when an international lobby group initiated by former Finnjet passenger Risto Kempas managed to negotiate a halt into the breaking at the Rishi Ship Breaker's facility. The fine overall condition of the vessel had impressed the breaker into considering of the ship having more value if returned to traffic. [...] Several parties then searched for potential buyers and the work culminated into a Finnish <b>ship</b> <b>operator</b> sending a three-man team to inspect Finnjet during the August of that year. The team discovered only loose items such as mattresses, fridges, television sets and furniture {{had been removed from}} the ship, along with some consoles in accordance to Indian laws. However, the damp Indian climate had encrusted Finnjet completely with mold in just three months. She had become unsalvageable for the potential buyers and full breaking was initiated on 12 September 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{shipping}} industry {{operates in}} a regulatory framework, where the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{is the leading}} regulatory body. The role of the IMO is to propose maritime regulations to its member states. The successful implementation of a maritime regulation depends on how many member states adopt it. However, many maritime regulations are not adequately implemented worldwide. As a result, <b>ship</b> <b>operators</b> have found themselves in an uncomfortable position in developing their business.

40|$|Abstract –Piracy {{continues}} to be a very real problem for <b>ship</b> <b>operators,</b> <b>ship</b> owners, cargo owners, insurance companies, flag states, and host states. Fortunately, the nature and locations of modern day acts of piracy tend to be fairly predictable and are concentrated in certain regions of the world. Potential acts of maritime terrorism are highly unpredictable and pose a worldwide threat since terrorists may attack a country’s interests abroad. Commercial <b>ship</b> <b>operators</b> can take concrete steps to help defend themselves against maritime terrorism and piracy. Many ship self defense countermeasures against piracy and maritime terrorism are simple and inexpensive to implement. Developing a thorough ship security plan is essential for commercial ship self defense. I...|$|R

40|$|The study {{determined}} the compliance {{of the domestic}} <b>shipping</b> <b>operators</b> at Batangas Port to Republic Act 9295 also known as Domestic Shipping Development Act of 2004. It described {{the profile of the}} respondents in terms of age, sex, designation, and department/office where the respondents work; determined how the domestic <b>shipping</b> <b>operators</b> at Batangas Port comply with Republic Act 9295; identified the problems encountered by the respondents in implementing Republic Act 9295. The researcher made use of descriptive correlational method. The study revealed that majority of the respondents fall on adult age, female and with considerable number of years working at a government agency overseeing the maritime industry. The domestic <b>shipping</b> <b>operators</b> of Batangas Port very much complied with the provisions of Republic Act 9295. The respondents disagreed that there were problems encountered in the law implementation. Such include shipping operators’ failure to observe schedule of trips, aging manpower and personal limitations in doing fieldworks as well as implementation of the mandatory vessel retirement program, checking if the deputized agency conducts security inspection prior to ships’ departures routes and failure of the operators to maintain its vessels in safe and serviceable condition, implementing of rules on over-tonnaging and schedule of trips reservation. The respondents’ profile variables were not contributory to the compliance of domestic <b>shipping</b> <b>operators</b> at Batangas Port to Republic Act 9295. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{shed some}} light on the risks and returns of asset-light <b>ship</b> <b>operators,</b> who are in the {{business}} of executing voyages mainly through chartered vessels, by applying principles from basic maritime economics and modern financial theory. By adapting the Fama-French multi-factor model to identify the main risk factors of freight, fuel price, vessel speed, default and voyage complexity for <b>ship</b> <b>operators,</b> I present a framework for explaining why <b>ship</b> <b>operators</b> should be able to earn a net positive return on their business model. In addition to economic theory, the ideas in this thesis were also formed with knowledge of the practical world which were obtained through interviews with and data provided by industry practitioners. It is hoped that by giving attention to this segment of the shipping industry, further academic research will be encouraged. Likewise, industry practitioners stand to benefit greatly from the academic research already done on freight markets and would ideally be inspired to apply some of the ideas in this thesis and other modern economic tools to improve their business operations. nhhma...|$|R
