40|$|Levels of {{antibodies}} (AB) to nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) in blood serum and brain direct current (DC) potentials were measured at 3 groups of 6 - 9 -years old children (schizophrenic children, children with <b>schizotypic</b> <b>disorder</b> and control group). Significant elevation of AB level to NGF and lowering of DC potentials in left temporal region with relative low DC potentials in all brain cortex regions {{were observed in}} schizophrenic children as compared with norm. A lowering of intensity of cerebral energy exchange in schizophrenic speaks for disturbance of brain functional activity with most significant inhibition of dominant hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} a {{predominantly}} piecewise pattern of the EEG that was formed in the 1970 s– 1980 s [1 – 3] and developed in subsequent years [4 – 6] {{made it possible to}} create nonparametric methods of structural EEG analy-sis [7, 8]. These methods are efficiently used for estima-tion of changes in functional [9] and pathological [10] states of the human brain. However, up to now, the description of the structural characteristics of the EEG with nonparametric methods has been mainly based on the amplitude characteristics of the signal [11]. In a pre-vious work [12], we suggested that functionally signif-icant structural EEG features also manifest themselves in the variability of its autocorrelation characteristics. To quantitatively estimate this EEG characteristic, we introduced the index of EEG autocorrelation structure variability (CSV), which makes it possible to distin-guish rearrangements of this structure above the level of the stochastic variability of this index [11]. The purpose of this work was to compare the CSV indices in healthy adolescents and adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Analysis of the variability of the EEG autocorrela-tion structure was performed for EEG records obtained from 45 10 - to 14 -year-old boys with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (schizophrenia (childhood-onset), <b>schizotypic</b> <b>disorder,</b> or schizoaffective psychosis) with comparatively homogeneous symptoms. A clinical characterization of these adolescents was provided by experts from the National Center of Mental Health of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The control group consisted of 39 healthy 11 - to 13 -year-old boys. Monopolar EEG recordings 1 – 2 min in duration were carried out with eight pairs of symmetrical electrode...|$|E
40|$|Schizotypy {{represents}} a latent personality organisation reflecting a putative liability for schizophrenia spectrum <b>disorders.</b> <b>Schizotypic</b> traits include anomalies in cognition (e. g., hallucinations), socio-emotional function (e. g., constricted affect), and behaviour (e. g., odd behaviour and language) {{that do not}} meet the clinical threshold for psychotic disorders. This thesis presents a series of studies investigating schizotypal measurement across ethno-cultural settings, examining cognitive antecedents and outcomes of schizotypy, and a schizotypal-continuum exploration into electrophysiological function. Studies 1 - 3 examined the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) as a measurement tool for schizotypy. These studies re-evaluated the domain structure of the English SPQ and the German SPQ, and developed and evaluated a Malay translation of the SPQ. Further, through the evaluation and development of these measures, schizotypy was explored within the framework of ethnic and cultural identities. This included evaluations between African Caribbeans in the UK and Trinidad, with White British participants; Malay and Chinese participants in Malaysia, and; central European White participants from Austria and southern Germany, with a similar cultural (migrational) group in the UK. Studies 4 a and 4 b concerned schizotypy, cognitive processes, and conspiracy ideation. From an initial pilot, associations were established with conspiracy ideation, included as a prima facie outcome of disordered thinking. A follow-up study showed that analytic thinking mediated the relationship between Odd Beliefs or Magical Thinking (but not Ideas of Reference) and belief in conspiracy theories. Study 5 investigated whether a combination of high schizotypal ratings and abnormal electrophysiological function could be established. Second, this study allowed for a unique comparison between culture and ethnicity, within the assessment of electrophysiological function. Finally, this study allowed for an investigation into associations between the domains established in Study 1 (namely, Cognitive-Perceptual, Paranoid, Disorganised, and Negative) and electrophysiological function. Results indicated little evidence of association between the schizotypy and schizophrenia literature; that is, there was no apparent electrophysiological deficits for high schizotypal individuals and no ethno-cultural influence. Further, the results of the regression indicated no support for associations at the higher-order domain level and electrophysiological function. Taken together, these studies informed the schizotypal literature through multiple routes. Indeed, this thesis addressed both the personality (cognitive outcomes) and clinical (electrophysiological) nature of schizotypy with the foundation of a thorough measurement examination...|$|R
