Large abundances of {{chlorine}} oxide (ClO) were first detected in the fresh plume of a Delta rocket in May of 1998 from the NASA WB- 57 during the Air Force RISO campaign by the CORE instrument developed at UC Irvine. Similar abundances were detected a month later in the plume of an ATLAS II rocket. Although the maximum ClO observed in these plumes was twenty-five times larger than the highest values ever observed in the perturbed polar vortices, in a new study, [M. N. Ross, et al., Geophys. Res. Lett., 2000, in press] could not account for observed ozone losses based on known chlorine photochemistry. New measurements were obtained in plumes of Delta, Atlas, and Athena rockets in 1999 during ACCENT with the CORE instrument augmented with a modified LiCor non-dispersed infrared detector for fast-response measurements of carbon-dioxide (CO 2).

50|$|The {{propellant}} {{particle size}} distribution has a profound impact <b>on</b> APCP <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> performance. Smaller AP and Al particles lead to higher combustion efficiency but also lead to increased linear burn rate. The burn rate is heavily dependent on mean AP particle size as the AP absorbs heat to decompose into a gas before it can oxidize the fuel components. This process may be a rate-limiting step in the overall combustion rate of APCP. The phenomenon {{can be explained by}} considering the heat flux to mass ratio: As the particle radius increases the volume (and, therefore, mass and heat capacity) increase as the cube of the radius. However, the surface area increases as the square of the radius, which is roughly proportional to the heat flux into the particle. Therefore, a particle's rate of temperature rise is maximized when the particle size is minimized.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} variations due to acceleration loads {{imposed on}} spinning solid propellant <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> are investigated. The four potentially most significant modes of acceleration-induced phenomena are identified {{from a study}} of the literature and modeled. The four modes are a mechanical mode which deals with deformations of the propellant and case: a thermodynamic mode which covers acceleration-induced combustion phenomena; a stress mode which covers the stressed propellant's effect on burn rate; and a gas dynamic mode which deals with changes in gas flow in the chamber and through the nozzle. Simplified models of each mode are developed or taken from the literature and are added to an internal ballistics evaluation computer program. The resulting analysis is the first to include all of the modes. In order to do this an original analysis of the mechanical and stress modes was necessary. However, the analysis shows that the stress mode is not important for the circular perforated grains studied. The other effects are shown to have a significant influence <b>on</b> solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> performance.
