40|$|Property {{rights are}} social {{institutions}} that define and delimit {{the range of}} privileges granted to individuals of specific resources, such as land and water. They are the authority to determine different forms of control over resources thus determining the use, benefits and costs resulting from resource use. That is, they clearly specify who can use the resources, who can capture the benefits from the resources, and who should incur costs of any socially harmful impact resulting {{from the use of}} a resource. In order to be efficient property rights must be clearly defined by the administering institution whether formal or informal and must be accepted, understood and respected by all the involved individuals and should be enforceable. These institutions influence the behaviour of individuals hence the impact on economic performance and development. The thesis has attempted to determine how the <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights to land and water affects the development of smallholders in the Kat River Valley. Data was collected from 96 households who were selected using random sampling. To capture data, a questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interviews. Institutional analysis and ANOVA were used for descriptive analysis to describe the property rights situation, security of property rights and the impact of property rights on the development of smallholder farming. The results show that individual land rights holders have secure rights to land and water resources while communal smallholders and farmers on the invaded state land have insecure rights to land and water resources. The results from institutional analysis show that the <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights negatively affects development of all smallholder farmers in the Kat River Valley. There are various institutional factors that negatively affect development of smallholder farmers in the Kat River Valley. Based on the research findings, some policy recommendations are made.

40|$|Flooding is {{a simple}} routing {{technique}} {{that can be used}} to transmit data from one node to every other node in a network. The focus of this paper is to investigate improvements to flooding techniques used in ad hoc wireless networks. Recent work has focused on using topological information to reduce the number of broadcasts. The number of broadcasts necessary to flood the network was the major performance metric used to compare previous neighborhood-based flooding algorithms. We build upon this foundation by first presenting a Parameterized Neighborhood-Based Flooding (PNBF) algorithm, which provides a single platform for the performance comparison of various multi-hop neighborhood-based flooding algorithms. We also introduce and motivate the use of additional performance metrics, including total number of collisions and percentage of nodes that receive the message, for comparing flooding algorithms. An analysis is given of how different network properties, such as average node degree, communication patterns, affect the performance of the different neighborhood-based flooding algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of handling a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> where <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> ad hoc networks along with the relative importance of the performance criteria are taken into consideration.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the phenomenon whereby settlements with ostensibly similar socio- economic status exhibited significantly different physical outcomes, {{such as in the}} quality of houses, spatial arrangements and available services. The {{study investigated}} three related questions. Firstly, given the similarity in the levels of incomes, {{what is the relationship between}} property rights and physical development outcomes in low income settlements? Secondly, what are the underlying mechanisms and processes by which these physical developments are produced? Thirdly, what is the relationship between formal and informal institutions and organisations in the production of the built environment? Corresponding to these questions were three hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that, at any given level of average incomes, different strengths <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights have differential effects on physical development outcomes. The second hypothesis was that different property rights are associated with different mechanisms and processes in the physical development process and thirdly that <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> extra-legal <b>property</b> rights require State mechanisms in the production of the built environment. Using a theoretical, conceptual and analytical framework provided by the new institutional economics, the study employed the comparative institutional analysis methodology to determine the influence of three types <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights on the production of the built environment in Zambia. These rights were categorised as informal, semi-legal and legalised, and are to be found respectively in Mindolo North, Chipata and Ipusukilo, three settlements in Kitwe selected as case studies. Empirical data was collected using household surveys, focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews and observations. The study finds that stronger property rights are associated with better quality physical development outcomes. Furthermore, the study finds that different types <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights are associated with different mechanisms and processes for the production of the built environment.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the interaction between}} the reinforcement of environmental laws and the stability of beneficiary families in agrarian reform settlements, in a context of increasing environmental concerns pressured by climate change. The study compares two modalities of land regulation in the Amazon Settlement Projects (PA) and Sustain-able Development Projects (PDS). The former is a conventional modality, where govern-mental apparatus {{has not been able to}} reinforce even general national environmental rules. The latter is a so-called Special Settlement, where environmental concerns were incorporated into the concept of this land regulation instrument and, at least theoretical-ly, rules would be more strictly reinforced. Integrating quantitative and qualitative data, we examine four issues involved in the interactions between stability on the land and reinforcement of environmental laws: forms of accessing land, the legal <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>property,</b> actual places <b>of</b> residence, and conditions for family farming. Results show that the modality of land regulation per se does not affect the mobility of families from agrarian reform settlements, which remains high under either modality. Evidence from the field elicits how the search for a land without landlords, with conditions to work for oneself, is at the core of why families leave hard-earned reformed plots behind to pursue new opportunities...|$|R

Waqf property (held in charitable trust for religious purposes) is {{an important element in}} Muslim societies, and has been subject to large-scale transfer to Jewish control since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 (‘redeemed’ for the Jewish people).

Mutawallis (managers of waqf) have to undertake 'forum shopping’ for search for the most suitable court (between Israeli civil and shari’a courts and the Palestinian shari’a court) to get and enforce a favourable judgment, but the new structures leave Palestinians with no legal authority over the administration of the waqf system.
