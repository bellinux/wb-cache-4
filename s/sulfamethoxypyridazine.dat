When administered alone sulfonamides are not efficacious in treating malaria but co-administration with the antifolate pyrimethamine, most commonly as fixed-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar), produces synergistic effects sufficient to cure sensitive strains of malaria.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPharmaceuticals and {{personal}} care products (PPCPs) have emerged as a major class of contaminants, given their widespread usage and known biological effects. Sulphonamides are synthetic antibacterial agents widely used in veterinary practice {{for the treatment of}} infections and to promote the growth of food-producing animals. Traditional sewage treatment procedures are unable to get rid of these compounds effectively. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a promising technology for treating wastewaters containing <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> pharmaceuticals via O 3 and UV/TiO 2 process. This study performs batch experiments {{to determine the effects of}} operating parameters on the degradation efficiencies of <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine.</b> The degradation was studied by monitoring the intermediates employing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation coupled to an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry (API-MS) system operating under selected ion monitoring (SIM). Results show that complete removal of all <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> was achieved within 80 min of ozonation at the concentration of O 3 (3 ppm) at different pH runs. The ozonation of <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> demonstrated the best degradation efficiency for runs at pH 8, followed by runs at pH 6 and pH 11. The ozonation imposed <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> with a time dependence that appeared to follow pseudo first-order kinetics.

Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %.

40|$|Field {{application}} of livestock manure introduces colloids and veterinary antibiotics, e. g. sulfonamides (SAs), into farmland. The presence of manure colloids may potentially intensify the SAs-pollution to soils and groundwater by colloid-facilitated transport. Transport of three SAs, sulfadiazine (SDZ), <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> (SMPD), and sulfamoxole (SMOX), {{was investigated in}} saturated soil columns with and without manure colloids from sows and farrows, weaners, and fattening pigs. Experimental results showed that colloid-facilitated transport of SMOX was significant {{in the presence of}} manure colloids from fattening pigs with low C/N ratio, high SUVA 280 nm and protein C, while manure colloids from sows and farrows and weaners had little effect on SMOX transport. In contrast, only retardation was observed for SDZ and SMPD when manure colloids were present. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of colloids and SAs were replicated well by a newly developed numerical model that considers colloid-filtration theory, competitive kinetic sorption, and co-transport processes. Model results demonstrate that mobile colloids act as carriers for SMOX, while immobile colloids block SMOX from sorbing onto the soil. The low affinity of SMOX to sorb on immobile colloids prevents aggregation and also promotes SMOX's colloid-facilitated transport. Conversely, the high affinity of SDZ and SMPD to sorb on all types of immobile colloids retarded their transport. Thus, manure properties play a fundamental role in increasing the leaching risk of hydrophobic sulfonamides...|$|E
40|$|Pneumocystis jirovecii {{is a major}} {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{that causes}} Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and results in {{a high degree of}} mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The drug of choice for PCP is typically sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or dapsone in conjunction with trimethoprim. Drug treatment failure and sulfa drug resistance have been implicated epidemiologically with point mutations in dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) of P. jirovecii. P. jirovecii cannot be cultured in vitro; however, heterologous complementation of the P. jirovecii trifunctional folic acid synthesis (PjFAS) genes with an E. coli DHPS-disrupted strain was recently achieved. This enabled the evaluation of SMX resistance conferred by DHPS mutations. In this study, we sought to determine whether DHPS mutations conferred sulfa drug cross-resistance to 15 commonly available sulfa drugs. It was established that the presence of amino acid substitutions (T 517 A or P 519 S) in the DHPS domain of PjFAS led to cross-resistance against most sulfa drugs evaluated. The presence of both mutations led to increased sulfa drug resistance, suggesting cooperativity and the incremental evolution of sulfa drug resistance. Two sulfa drugs (sulfachloropyridazine [SCP] and <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> [SMP]) that had a higher inhibitory potential than SMX were identified. In addition, SCP, SMP, and sulfadiazine (SDZ) were found to be capable of inhibiting the clinically observed drug-resistant mutants.

Under stress conditions such as starvation or antibiotic exposure, Borrelia burgdorferi can develop round body forms, which are a type of persister bacteria that are not killed by current Lyme antibiotics. To identify more effective drugs that are active against the round bodies of B. burgdorferi, we established a round body persister model induced by amoxicillin and screened the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug library consisting of 1581 drug compounds and also 22 drug combinations using the SYBR Green I/propidium iodide (PI) viability assay. We identified 23 drug candidates that have higher activity against the round bodies of B. burgdorferi than either amoxicillin or doxycycline. Eleven of these scored better than metronidazole and tinidazole which have been previously described to be active against round bodies. While some drug candidates such as daptomycin and clofazimine overlapped with a previous screen against stationary phase B. burgdorferi persisters, additional drug candidates active against round bodies we identified include artemisinin, ciprofloxacin, nifuroxime, fosfomycin, chlortetracycline, sulfacetamide, <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> and sulfathiozole. Two triple drug combinations had the highest activity against round bodies and stationary phase B. burgdorferi persisters: artemisinin/cefoperazone/doxycycline and sulfachlorpyridazine/daptomycin/doxycycline. These findings confirm and extend previous findings that certain drug combinations have superior activity against B. burgdorferi persisters in vitro, even if pre-treated with amoxicillin.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{adaptation of}} the Bratton-Marshall procedure for sulfonamides has been developed. As sulfonamidesexhibit varying degrees of protein binding, applica-hon of the method to plasma is dependent upon release of these compoundsprior to automated dialysis. This release is effected by the acidification of the sample. The results obtained with and without this preliminary acidification are discussed. A TTEMPTS to apply the automated procedure for p-aminohippuric acid (1) to the assay of sulfanilamide derivatives in plasma have not been successful. The reason {{for the lack of}} success has been the poor recov-ery of the sulfonamide in the presence of plasma proteins, due to pro-tein binding. This phenomenon prevented the efficient dialysis of the drug from the plasma to the recipient dialysate to be analyzed. It was decided to acidify the plasma prior to the dialysis step, thereby releas-ing the protein-bound sulfonamide. Among the various sulfonamide compounds used to test the assay method, three were chosen {{on the basis of their}} present clinical usage (sulfisoxazole, * sulfadimethoxine,t <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine)</b> and two were chosen as representatives of a highly protein-bound compound (sulfaethylthiadiazole) and a poorly-bound compound (sulfanilamide).

The developed method was validated showing limits of detection ranging from 0. 12 (ampicillin) to 3. 94 ng/g (amoxicillin), instrumental and analytical linearity coefficients above 0. 99 in both standard and matrix-based solutions as well as relative recoveries ranging from 71 % (cefoperazone) to 115 % (cefazolin). Repeatability of the method was in the range of 1 – 9 % (RSD %), whereas reproducibility ranged from 3 % to 13 % (RSD %). The developed and validated method was finally applied to the analysis of real feed samples. The results showed 10 out of 18 analytes to be present in at least one sample and all 14 samples to contain at least one analyte.

Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 1. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The within- and between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 4 % and 1. 0 to 3. 8 % respectively. The method was applied to the determination of sulfonamides in human serum and urine and in poultry muscle and eggs, after solid-phase extraction and subsequent derivatization of the extracts. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for the determination of sulfonamides in foods of animal origin. The detection limits varied from 0. 25 to 0. 30 μg L- 1 in serum, 0. 10 to 0. 25 μg L- 1 in urine samples, 1. 0 το 8. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle and 1. 0 to 5. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg samples and were much lower than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). In the second method, the derivatives of twelve sulfonamides (sulfaguinidine, sulfanilamide, sulfisomidine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine,</b> sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) were separated on a monolithic silica column, Chromolith Performance RP- 18 (100 x 4. 6 mm) using the same binary system (methanol- 0. 05 mol L- 1 acetate buffer pH 3. 4) as above, but with different gradient elution programme. In order to maximize the reaction yield and the sensitivity of the method, the critical derivatization parameters (medium pH, fluorescamine concentration and reaction time) were studied using the univariate approach and optimized. Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 3. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The withinand between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 6 to 3. 2 % and 0. 9 to 3. 3 % respectively. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated, according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, for the determination of sulfonamides in poultry muscle and eggs following solid-phase extraction. The method was also applied in human serum and urine. The detection limits varied from 2. 0 to 17. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle, 2. 0 to 15. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg, 0. 30 to 5. 0 μg L- 1 in human serum and 0. 25 to 2. 5 μg L- 1 in urine samples. In terms of sensitivity, the conventional column, Inertsil ODS- 3, offers lower detection limits for all sulfonamides. On the other hand, correlation coefficients are higher with the monolithic column, indicating better linearity. Seperation efficiency is also superior with the monolithic column, which enables analytical runs under lower back pressure at shorter time. Both analytical procedures were new, fast, simple, selective and highly sensitive. Additionally, the combined use of a monolithic column with fluorescence detection in order to determine sulfonamides by pre-column derivatization with fluorescamine, in human biological fluids, poultry muscle and egg samples, was applied {{here for the first time}} in the literature. ...|$|E
40|$|The TRIC-Taiwan- 1 - 1958 {{strain of}} {{elementary}} body virus isolated from a trachoma patient on Taiwan {{has been proven}} capable of reproducing trachoma by experimental inoculation of six human volunteers. Virus material derived from the seventh passage in embryonated hen eggs caused the clinical picture of trachoma in every inoculation, even at the dilution of 10 – 4 of infected yolk sacs (approximately 1 EID 50). There was a similar clinical picture with each inoculation beginning with an acute follicular conjunctivitis which progressed for 4 months and then persisted with chronic changes until 9 months when treatment was begun. The illness was generally more acute than would be expected in natural trachoma. That trachoma was reproduced was shown by {{the involvement of the}} cornea with epithelial keratitis and pannus, and by the occurrence of gelatinous follicles and eventual cicatrization of the conjunctiva. These clinical findings were supported by repeated demonstrations of typical inclusion bodies of Halberstaedter-Prowazek from conjunctival and even corneal cells, by repeated reisolation of elementary body virus in egg yolk sacs, and by the development of complement-fixing antibody with a "specific" trachoma antigen in each volunteer. Control inoculations with adenovirus type 4 and normal yolk sac showed different clinical and laboratory findings. Experimental trachoma vaccine was given to three of the volunteers to study its effect on the course of illness. An antibody response to the vaccine was demonstrated and there was a modification of disease in the volunteers receiving vaccine. While the three volunteers who received placebo each developed cross-infection of their uninoculated eye and had an acute reactivation of the bilateral disease after 1 to 2 months of antibiotic eye ointment therapy, the vaccinated volunteers remained free of infection in uninoculated eyes and showed no relapse after ointment therapy. Treatment with <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine,</b> a sulfa drug with prolonged action, proved to be an effective and relatively simple method of therapy for experimental trachoma...|$|E
40|$|Sulfisoxasol (SI), {{as well as}} sulfisomezole (MS 53), <b>sulfamethoxypyridazine</b> (SMP) and {{sulfadimethoxine}} (SDM), {{the so-called}} long acting sulfa drugs, was given to persons, both normal and with kidney disturbances; and their plasma concentrations, amounts excreted in the urine, and renal clearance values. were determined. The results are summarized as follows: When normal persons were injected intravenously with SI, its plasma concentrations became more or less stable in 20 minutes. Thereafter, the larger the amount given, the quicker was the fall in plasma concentrations. When the drugs under test were given orally to normal persons, the rise in plasma concentrations of MS 53 and SMP was considerably quick, reaching the highest levels in 3 to 4 hours. On the other hand, the plasma concentration of SDM rose very slowly, reaching the highest levels in about 10 hours. Especially small was the acetylated rate of SDM, which was only 7. 7 % in 24 hours. Of all the drugs under test, SMP and SDM excreted in 24 hour urine of normal persons were particularly small in percentage. Only 27. 0 and 19. 5 %, respectively, of the amounts given were excreted. When plasma concentrations of the unconjugated portion of SI were more than 10 mg/dl in normal persons, its renal clearance values tended to increase gradually, while they remained within a certain range when plasma concentrations were less than 10 mg/dl The clearance value in the latter cases was 19. 21 cc/min on the average. The renal clearance values of unconjugated portions of MS 53, SMP and SDM in normal persons were 12. 56 cc/min, 1. 47 cc/min and 1. 81 cc/min, respectively, on the average, irrespective of urine volume. The renal clearance values of the acetylated portions of MS 53, SMP and SDM were greater than those of their unconjugated portions. In patients with kidney diseases or diabetes mellitus, the renal clearance value of the unconjugated portion of SI was correlated to a high degree with GFR (γ= 0. 8250), sharply reflecting glomerular function...|$|E
