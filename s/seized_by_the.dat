5|$|A second expedition, {{under the}} praetor Publius Varinius, was then {{dispatched}} against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius {{seems to have}} split his forces {{under the command of}} his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slaves.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the Baltic Fleet and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in mid-1906. While on a Mediterranean cruise, she helped survivors of the 1908 Messina earthquake. Tsesarevich was not very active during the early part of World War I and her bored sailors joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in early 1917. Now named Grazhdanin, the ship participated in the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917, during which she was lightly damaged. The ship <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution in late 1917 and decommissioned the following year. Grazhdanin was scrapped in 1924–1925.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers {{were left with}} worthless bonds.

The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, Union Bank of Switzerland reached CHF 6.96billion of assets, {{narrowly}} edging {{ahead of}} Swiss Bank Corporation {{to become the}} largest bank in Switzerland. The rapid growth was punctuated by the 1967 acquisition of Interhandel (Industrie- und Handelsbeteiligungen AG, the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie), which made UBS {{one of the strongest}} banks in Europe. Interhandel had become cash-rich when a dispute concerning GAF Materials Corporation, a subsidiary formerly known as General Aniline & Film and <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. government during the war, was resolved in 1963 and the subsidiary was disposed of.|$|E
5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Pollock was {{appointed}} as captain on , a German cruise liner which was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States government {{for use as}} a military transport ship. She was rechristened George Washington in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1, 1917. That December, she set out with her first load of troops. During the war, Pollock successfully transported 60,000 American soldiers to France in 18 round trips. In 1918, the George Washington was tasked to deliver President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference, though Pollock would not make the trip. He was reassigned on September 29, 1918.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in 1918, Moltke, {{together}} with most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end when she was scuttled by her crew, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them from being <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Navy. The wreck of Moltke was raised on 10 June 1927, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau was {{returned}} to troopship duties after the project was abandoned, but at 12:02 on 2 May 1943, she was sunk by a mine off Gedser. Potsdam was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen, where she spent {{the remainder of the}} war. Following the German defeat, the ship was <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British on 20 June 1946 as a war prize, who commissioned her as a troop transport under the name Empire Fowey.
