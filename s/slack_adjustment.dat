50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety belts with emergency locking retractors for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate lap belts previously used. A center lap safety belt with <b>slack</b> <b>adjustment</b> was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|E
30|$|Note that if u_r^* < 0 {{for some}} r and u_r'^* = 0 {{for the other}} r′, then the weak and strong DCs coexist on the kth DMU. We {{consider}} it as the strong DC, so indicating technology innovation on undesirable outputs. Here, {{it is important to}} add that u_r^* < 0 for all r is the best case because an increase in any desirable output always decreases an amount of undesirable outputs. Meanwhile, if u_r^* < 0 is identified for some r, then it indicates that there is a chance to reduce an amount of undesirable output(s). Therefore, we consider the second case as an occurrence of DC. The three concerns (e.g., multiple solutions and <b>slack</b> <b>adjustment)</b> on UC are also applicable to DC. Finally, {{it is important to note}} that this section solves the second pitfall.|$|E

To meet such water security challenges, policy makers need to evaluate water use efficiency at the regional or basin level because the prosperity of city agglomerations is indispensable to the sustainable development of the region or basin. To solve the issue, this paper adopts a non-directional distance function {{within the framework of}} environmental production technology to measure water use efficiency. Based on the distance between actual water use efficiency and the ideal efficiency, it calculates the potential reduction space of water input and pollutants by <b>slack</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Added to the Malmquist index, it forms a non-radial Malmquist water use performance index, which can be divided into technological change and technical efficiency change, to measure dynamic water use efficiency. Further, water use efficiency change is analyzed from the perspectives of technological improvement and institutional construction. Bohai Bay city agglomeration, a typical water-deficient city agglomeration in China, is taken as a case study, and data on water resource, environment, and economy from 2011 to 2014 have been used. In conclusion, there is much space for water use efficiency improvement on the whole. However, even having considered potential reduction space of water input and pollutant discharge under current environmental production technology, it is still not enough to support the city agglomeration’s sustainable development. To relieve current potential water safety hazards, not only technical improvement but also institution innovation for highly efficient water use should be kept accelerating in Bohai Bay region. In terms of urban water management in developing countries, the research conclusion is of theoretical and practical significance...|$|E
40|$|China's major wheat {{producing}} areas play {{a crucial}} role in ensuring domestic grain production and food security more generally and it is therefore of significance, both empirically and theoretically, to investigate the current situation and future tendencies of the sector. Based on input- and output-oriented DEA models, overall technical efficiency was estimated for the sector, and both radial and <b>slack</b> <b>adjustments</b> were calculated. The course of the dynamic adjustments was identified and presented for factor inputs over the past decade. The results show that the radial adjustments have exhibited a decreasing trend, while structural, <b>slack</b> <b>adjustments</b> have practically disappeared. The course of the dynamic adjustments suggests that there has been a transformation from labor-intensive to land-intensive and capital-intensive operations which will continue to dominate China's wheat production sector. As a consequence, to optimize factor inputs and reduce radical and <b>slack</b> <b>adjustments,</b> it seems necessary that the major wheat producing areas reduce labor inputs; enhance land-intensive operations; and increase agricultural mechanization...|$|R
40|$|Using an input–oriented DEA {{model with}} the {{assumption}} of VRS, this paper develops a framework on agricultural production efficiency including 2 outputs and 6 inputs. The data source is a survey to 99 household farms of Hebei province, China, conducted by the authors in 2010. According to the efficiency scores of DEA, the sampled farms are divided into three types, {{and the status of}} returns to scale for each farm is examined as well. Slack analysis of the outputs shows that comparing with net profit, ratio of net profit can be increased with a larger margin. Meanwhile, the radial and <b>slack</b> <b>adjustments</b> indicate the inefficient and redundant amounts of the inputs, respectively. In the second stage, effects of a variety of social and natural determinants are assessed, with the adoption of an Ordinal Logistic Regression model. Based on the empirical findings, policy recommendations are put forward, concerning the circulation of basic agricultural factors of land, labor, etc.; strengthening the construction of public agricultural infrastructures, particularly the irrigation facilities; deepening the institutional reforms to extend quality seeds and advanced agricultural technologies; and the closer integration of the public services and credit markets supporting the agriculture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relative}} technical efficiency of institutions {{operating in a}} market that has been significantly affected by environmental and market factors in recent years, the Hong Kong banking system. These environmental factors are specifically incorporated into the efficiency analysis using the innovative slacks-based, second stage Tobit regression approach advocated by Fried et al (1999). A further innovation is that we also employ Tone's (2001) slacks-based model (SBM) to conduct the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), {{in addition to the}} more traditional approach attributable to Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) (1984). The results indicate: high levels of technical inefficiency for many institutions; considerable variations in efficiency levels and trends across size groups and banking sectors; and also differential impacts of environmental factors on different size groups and financial sectors. Surprisingly, the accession of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China, episodes of financial deregulation, and the 1997 / 98 South East Asian crisis do not seem to have had a significant independent impact on relative efficiency. However, the results suggest that the impact of the last mentioned may have come via the adverse developments in the macro economy and in the housing market.

40|$|The {{documentation}} of asymmetric cost behavior {{in response to}} changes in demand has attracted much scholarly attention over the past decade. Most studies propose that this cost asymmetry {{is due to the}} influence of management expectations on their deliberate resource allocation decisions. This study examines empirically the effect of management expectations on cost asymmetry, and, principally, the tension between these expectation-based decisions and constrains imposed on these decisions by two economic drivers of the cost asymmetry — the availability of initial <b>slack</b> resources and <b>adjustment</b> costs. Using the tone in the forward-looking statements (FLS) of a sample of 10 -K reports as a measure of management expectations, we document a positive and significant relation between the favorableness of management FLS tone and the degree of cost stickiness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that managers’ expectation-driven decisions can reverse the previously documented anti-sticky cost behavior imposed by high slack resources. Notably, we find the impact of management expectations on the degree of cost asymmetry is strongest when both the initial amount of slack resources and the magnitude of the adjustment costs are high. Conversely, when both the magnitude of the adjustment costs and the initial amount of slack resource are low, management expectations have no impact on the degree of cost asymmetry. Our combined evidence supports the theoretical explanation in the literature that management expectations influence their resource allocation decisions, and indicates that other economic determinants may need to be considered when assessing the impact of these decisions on a firm’s cost structure...|$|R
