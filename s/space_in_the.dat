40|$|International audienceLook-Up Table (LUT) based Digital PreDistortion (DPD) {{is widely}} used for Power Amplifier (PA) linearization. In this paper, two LUTs of {{different}} spacing structures are compared with each other.

The other one is uneven <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> in-LUT domain and even <b>spacing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> out-LUT domain. These two LUT structures are adopted in DPD based on MP model and linearly interpolated LUT. The performance of the two LUT structures in DPD is compared by using Matlab and simulation results are analyzed.

30|$|In {{order to}} define a Hausdorff {{topology}} and to prove some existing results (including Baire’s theorem), George and Veeramani [7] slightly modified the concept of fuzzy metric space introduced by Kramosil and Michálek. It {{is well known that}} all fuzzy (quasi-)metric <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of George and Veeramani are also fuzzy (quasi-)metric <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of Kramosil and Michálek. Hence, the results we will prove also include fuzzy metric <b>spaces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of George and Veeramani (see also [40]).|$|R

5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
