50|$|The {{church is}} {{characterized}} by a small nave with apse, covered by a gable in turn supported by wooden trusses with decorated warping. The flooring is made of terracotta brick, while the walls are painted in a light colored parchment, itself decorated with polychrome <b>socket</b> <b>boxes.</b> Preceding the altar there are a round arch and a tympanum above it, which depicts two angels in prayer. In the tympanum there is an oval inside which is enclosed a radial cross termed Salus Mundi. The vault of the presbytery is decorated with a blue sky with gold stars. The presbytery contains an altar made of stone, which is separated {{from the rest of the}} church by a balustrade in gothic style and in the same material.|$|R
5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical <b>socket</b> <b>boxes.</b> Various groups would leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|R
50|$|A pattress {{may be made}} {{of metal}} or plastic. In the United Kingdom, surface-mounted boxes in {{particular}} are often made from urea-formaldehyde resin, or alternatively PVC, and usually white. Wall boxes are commonly made of thin galvanised metal. A pattress box is made to standard dimensions and may contain embedded bushings (in standard positions) for the attachment of wiring devices (switches and <b>sockets).</b> Pattress <b>boxes</b> themselves {{do not include the}} corresponding faceplates.|$|R
5000|$|... mIRC {{scripting}} is {{not limited}} to IRC related events and commands. There is also support for COM objects, calling DLLs, <b>sockets</b> and dialog <b>boxes,</b> among other things. This allows the client to be used {{in a variety of ways}} beyond chatting, for example as an IRC bot, a media player, a web HTML parser, or for other entertainment purposes such as mIRC games.|$|R
40|$|Working paper ENSM-SE CMP WP 2009 / 15 This paper {{deals with}} using {{simulation}} as a decision support tool for estimating {{the impact of}} Radio Frequency IDentication (RFID) technologies within biological sample storage areas (called biobanks). Several indicators, including inventory reliability or human resource utilization, are compared and discussed for different scenarios of use of the technologies. A special emphasis is put on the so-called re-warehousing activity, which RFID makes possible and consists in reassigning tubes to empty <b>sockets</b> when <b>boxes</b> are emptied. For this particular activity, optimization algorithms are developed and embedded in the simulator. Results demonstrate the potential interest of RFID in biobanks {{and the value of}} simulation for estimating and optimizing such complex socio-technical systems. pdfautho...|$|R
50|$|A typical TAE {{installation}} is a multi-socket {{junction box}} {{with at least}} one N connector and one F connector <b>socket</b> in the <b>box,</b> but having usually two N and one F connector. Up to three N connectors are possible. Network service enters the box and connects to pins 1 and 2 on the right-most N connector. Service is daisy-chained from pins 5 and 6 on the N connector to pins 1 and 2 on the next N connector to the left. The F connector is attached to pins 5 and 6 on the last N connector {{at the end of the}} chain.|$|R
50|$|The LNB {{is usually}} a small box {{suspended}} on one or more short booms, or feed arms, {{in front of the}} dish reflector, at its focus (although some dish designs have the LNB on or behind the reflector). The microwave signal from the dish is picked up by a feedhorn on the LNB and is fed to a section of waveguide. One or more metal pins, or probes, protrude into the waveguide at right angles to the axis and act as antennas, feeding the signal to a PCB inside the LNB's shielded box for processing. The lower frequency IF output signal emerges from a <b>socket</b> on the <b>box</b> to which the coaxial cable connects.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to use FMS {{with nothing more than}} a keyboard, but anything more responsive than a trainer or slow flyer really needs analog control, such as a twin-stick gamepad controller or PC joystick. Many sources, including radio manufacturer Hitec, make cables to interface most brands of R/C transmitters with the program via the buddy <b>box</b> <b>socket</b> and a computer's USB, microphone or serial port. This adds realism as well as useful transmitter features like trims, dual rates and exponential. A limited amount of exponential can be selected in FMS's setup menu, however. Hitec's website markets their interface cable as a direct connection to FMS and includes a download link on their website.|$|R
50|$|Several {{explicit}} {{scenes of}} gore were cut {{in order to}} avoid an X rating, including Maddy's death, who originally had a sickle jammed through her neck; Ben's death, which showed Jason crushing his head into a bloody pulp; Kate's death revealed the gory aftermath of a party horn to her eyeball; we see Eddie's head hit the floor; a shot of Russell's face splitting open with a large blood spurt; Dan's original death had Jason ripping out his guts; Amanda Shepard's death originally showed Jason stabbing her from behind, with the resulting blade going through her chest and subsequent blood hitting Dr. Crews; Dr. Crews's death showed Jason's tree-trimming saw violently cutting into his stomach, sending a fountain of blood and guts in the air; Melissa's original death had Jason cleaving her head in half with an axe with a close-up of her eyes still wriggling in their <b>sockets.</b> The <b>boxed</b> set DVD release of all of the films and the single deluxe edition have all these scenes available as deleted scenes in rough workprint footage; however, the deluxe edition features more additional footage than the boxed set.|$|R
50|$|A {{domestic}} single British {{telephone line}} installation {{will have a}} single master <b>socket</b> or line <b>box</b> in the premises, which is provided by BT or another service provider: this socket is the demarcation point between the customer-owned and maintained on-premises wiring, and the telephone network. For installations using the NTE5 line box (NTE for network termination equipment), the demarcation point is actually within the socket: {{the lower half of}} the front plate and associated wiring is the customer's, while the permanent wiring on the non-removable section behind this, remains the responsibility of the service provider. Customers are not permitted to access the wiring in a master socket without a removable lower section. Plug-in extension kits are available for customers with this type of installation. The two wires from the exchange are denoted the B leg at −48V relative to ground when the line is not in use and the A leg which is near ground potential when the line is not in use. The A leg goes to pin 5 and the B leg to pin 2 in the master socket. (Although all equipment will work with a reversed line, so a reverse wired socket is not strictly a fault.) When current is flowing on the line, the B leg voltage collapses to nearer ground and the A leg voltage moves nearer to the B leg voltage. The exact voltage drop is a function of the distance to the exchange, and the network wiring type.|$|R
