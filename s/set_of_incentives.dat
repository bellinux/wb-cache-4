40|$|Abstract: In credit {{contracting}} under asymmetric information, lenders formulate <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>incentive</b> compatible {{contracts that}} consider collateral {{and interest rates}} simultaneously as a mechanism to reveal the borrower’s ex ante risk level. In this paper, we design an experiment to test how moral hazard due to ex ante asymmetric information affects the screening models by Bester (1985, 1987). Our experimental results confirm that by appropriately combining collateral with the interest rate, borrowers with different risk levels are separated, even in moral hazard settings...|$|R
40|$|Political {{momentum}} and funding for combatting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to build. Numerous major international and national initiatives aimed at financially incentivising {{the research and}} development (R&D) of antibiotics have been implemented. However, it remains unclear how to effectively strengthen the current <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>incentive</b> programmes to further accelerate antibiotic innovation. Based on a literature review and expert input, this study first identifies and assesses the major international, European Union, US and UK antibiotic R&D funding programmes. These programmes are then evaluated across market and public health criteria necessary for comprehensively improving the antibiotic market. The current <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>incentive</b> programmes are an important initial step to improving the economic feasibility of antibiotic development. However, {{there appears to be a}} lack of global coordination across all initiatives, which risks duplicating efforts, leaving funding gaps in the value chain and overlooking important AMR goals. This study finds that incentive programmes are overly committed to early-stage push funding of basic science and preclinical research, while there is limited late-stage push funding of clinical development. Moreover, there are almost no pull incentives to facilitate transition of antibiotic products from early clinical phases to commercialisation, focus developer concentration on the highest priority antibiotics and attract large pharmaceutical companies to invest in the market. Finally, it seems that antibiotic sustainability and patient access requirements are poorly integrated into the array <b>of</b> <b>incentive</b> mechanism...|$|R

Our characterization shows that symmetric auctions can yield a large variety of discriminatory outcomes such as revenue maximization and affirmative action. We also characterize the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> implementable outcomes when individual rationality holds in an ex-post rather than an interim sense. This additional requirement may prevent the seller from maximizing revenue...|$|R
