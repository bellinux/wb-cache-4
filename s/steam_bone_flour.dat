There was no statistical difference in the cane yields obtained with the use of superphosphate, degelatinated and <b>steamed</b> <b>bone</b> meal, "serranafosfato", "hiperfosfato", Argelian phosphate, and a local rock phosphate (Morro do Serrote). Superphosphate and the two types of bone meal were statistically better than a type of phosphorated bauxite, but {{there was no difference between}} this and the remaining treatments. b) In "massapê-salmourão" soils of low acidity there was no statistical difference between the applications of phosphorus as superphosphate, degelatinated bone meal, "fertifós", and "hiperfosfato"; all these treatments were better than rock phosphate (Morro do Serrote) ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different fertilizers applied to the substrate in the cultivation of Kalanchoe luciae Raym. -Hamet. Cuttings measuring 6 cm in height and 12 cm in diameter were cultivated in 1. 5 L pots containing the substrate (1 soil: 1 sand: 1 vermiculite). In this experiment, the effect of the fertilization based on NPK 10 : 10 : 10 was evaluated with and without the addition of a fertilizer mixture composed of 5 g <b>bone</b> <b>flour,</b> 5 g dolomite limestone, and 50 g ground charcoal, this proportion that was used for each 1. 5 L substrate. After 60 days, an increase in the number of leaves, which was proportional to the increase in the doses of NPK applied, was verified. Even though the plants presented higher number of leaves (18. 34) and higher height (18. 73 cm) for the substrate with 1. 5 g L- 1 of NPK 10 : 10 : 10, plants did not reach the compact aspect suggested by some producers. The addition of fertilizer mixture presented no effect on the leaves number and neither to the plant height, however, it was observed that the plants that received the fertilizer mixture presented the fifth leaf with bigger diameter. None of the treatments favored the formation of one of the most important characteristics of this species, the reddish color on the borders of the leaves. As suculentas apresentam grande importância comercial, mas, as informações sobre o cultivo destas plantas ainda são escassas, especialmente em relação à fertilização durante a fase de crescimento. Neste trabalho, objetivou-se avaliar o efeito de diferentes adubações no substrato para cultivo de Kalanchoe luciae Raym. - Hamet. Mudas com 6 cm de altura e 12 cm de diâmetro foram cultivadas em vasos de 1, 5 L, contendo o substrato (1 terra: 1 areia: 1 vermiculita). Avaliou-se, nesse experimento, o efeito de adubações à base de NPK 10 : 10 : 10, com e sem adição de uma mistura de adubos composta de 5 g de farinha de osso, 5 g de calcário dolomítico e 50 g de carvão vegetal triturado, proporção essa, utilizada para cada 1, 5 L de substrato. Após 60 dias, verificou-se que o aumento do número de folhas foi proporcional ao aumento das doses de NPK aplicadas. Apesar de apresentarem maior número de folhas (18, 34) e maior altura das plantas (18, 73 cm) para o substrato com 1, 5 g L- 1 de NPK 10 : 10 : 10 as plantas não atingiram o aspecto compacto sugerido por alguns produtores. Não houve efeito da adição da aplicação da mistura de adubos sobre o número de folhas formadas e altura da planta, entretanto, observou-se que as plantas que receberam a mistura de adubos apresentaram maior diâmetro da 5 ª folha.

5000|$|Archeological {{excavations}} at Wygate Park in Spalding {{have shown}} {{that there has been}} occupation in this area from at least the Roman period, when this part of Lincolnshire was used for the production of salt. It was a coastal siltland. At Wygate Park salt making seems to have come to an end by the mid-3rd century AD; climatic change and flooding may have made such activities difficult, causing the practice to die out. The settlement's name is derived from an Anglian tribe, the Spaldingas, who settled in the area during the 6th century. They may have retained their administrative independence within the Kingdom of Mercia into the late 9th century, when Stamford became one of the Five Boroughs of the East Midlands under Danish control after years of invasion and occupation. In John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887), Spalding was described as a:"market town and par. with ry. sta., Lincolnshire, on River Welland, 14 m. SW. of Boston, 12,070 ac., pop. 9260; P.O., T.O., three Banks, two newspapers. Market-day, Tuesday. Spalding is an important railway centre, while the river has been made navigable to the town for vessels of from 50 to 70 tons. It is situated in a rich agricultural district, and has a large trade, by river and by rail, in corn, wool, coal, and timber. It has also <b>flour,</b> <b>bone,</b> and saw mills, breweries, and coach works.

5000|$|Having {{spent eight}} months in Europe on Nekrasov's money (2,500 rubles {{according}} to Chukovsky), suddenly accused the later of underpaying him and an ugly scandal broke out. In January 1862, Uspensky asked Chernyshevsky to summon {{a court of}} arbitration to resolve the financial issue, the latter refused, and said that should such a hearing ever take place, he will be on Nekrasov's side. In early1862, Uspensky severed all ties with the magazine and retired to Stupino, very ill and depressed. This self-imposed exile lasted {{for a short time}} as Otechestvennye Zapiski, Lev Tolstoy, and Ivan Turgenev began encouraging Uspensky to return to writing. Turgenev, who at the time himself was openly accusing Nekrasov of financial wrongdoings, accepted Uspensky's version of events wholeheartedly. In 1862, Tolstoy invited Uspensky to teach Russian grammar to his Yasnaya Polyana school. Some years later Tolstoy told one of his guests, Zakharyin: [...] "I rate Nikolai Uspensky much higher than the second one, Gleb, who's well behind in terms of both realism and artistry." [...] After a quarrel with Tolstoy, Nikolai Uspensky moved to Spasskoye, Turgenev's estate where the latter granted him a plot of land. Again, this stay was short, as one relative stated: [...] "Being carried away at the time with ideas of agricultural innovations, Nikolai Vasilyevich began cultivating his soil in peculiar manner, fertilizing it with salt and <b>steamed</b> animal's <b>bones...</b> None of this worked of course and he, knowing nothing about agriculture, has left Spasskoye disgruntled." [...] For several years Uspensky travelled through Russia, teaching in numerous schools and gymnasiums in Tula governorate, Orenburg, Saint Petersburg, and back at Yasnaya Polyana again, never staying at one place for long. Finally, driven by financial difficulties, he returned to Spasskoye to sell the land he had been given. Horrified, Turgenev asked his manager to interfere, [...] "Should this man be so dishonest as to sell this plot to a third party?" [...] he wondered in a letter. Negotiations proved futile and only after Turgenev agreed to buy back his own land that Uspensky agreed to leave the estate, still accusing the host of [...] "having taken back his own gift." [...] Turgenev wrote to Polonsky: [...] "Nikolai Uspensky is a finished man, we might as well forget about him." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{educational}} program of agricultural extension has been {{sponsored by the}} Cherry County Extension Service. 359 families subscribed 1630. 40 {{for the support of}} the work in 1939. The commissioners provided office space valued at 180. 00. Other income provided 288. 58 making a total operating fund of 2, 103. 38. Expenditures for operating costs during the year were 180. 00 for office space and 1671. 29 for carrying on the program. Mr. Jake Stasch of Nenzel, Mr. A. J. Galloway of Kilgore, and Mr. O. J. Dau of Cody were appointed members of the finance committee. They directed the canvass for subscriptions {{with the help of the}} precinct solicitors. The program of work directed special emphasis to the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program, to pasture improvement, to herdquality improvement and to livestock marketing. The 4 -H agricultural clubs specialized in herd quality. The home economics program for both 4 -H clubs and adult women gave attention to foods, clothing and home management. Demonstrational variety and type plats of wheat, oats and sorghums were planted in the county. Komar wheat yielded 17. 5 bushels per acre as compared to 16. 3 bushels of Ceres, and 14. 3 bushels of Reward. Dry weather, grasshoppers and wind destroyed the oats tests. Most of the sorghum plats were destroyed by hail and heavy rain in June. Leoti Red sorgo produced two and three-fourths ton of cured fodder per acre compared to 2. 4 tons of atlas, 2 tons of Cheyenne, and an estimated 3 / 4 ton of corn fodder. The acreage of grain sorghums was more than doubled this year and totaled 4, 274 acres. The forage sorghums increased from 11, 960 acres in 1938 to 13, 625 acres in 1939. In the early 19302 ̆ 7 s, the sandhills were carrying maximum numbers of livestock. The drouth has accumulated since 1930 to a total deficiency of 38 inches of rainfall. Cattlemen here had to cut down their herds and get more range in their ranching units. The range program, pasture improvement program of the county extension service and the pasture-forage-livestock program have made the ranchers conscious of the need for conserving grasslands. 429, 948 acres of Cherry County pastures were rested in 1939 in addition to those regularly left tor winter pasture. 195 additional wells were installed in 1938 and 242 more during 1939. The average acreage served by one well has been reduced from 1111 acres to 1028. Landscaping, yard beautification and garden information was given at the time of farm and home visits, by office interviews, by news items, and by a beautiful flower and vegetable exhibit at the county fair. 41 ranchers and farmers planted 19, 700 Clarke-McNary seedlings. Blueprints and bills of material service was given for the construction of a horse barn, a 2 -car garage, a grain elevator, 2 livestock feeders and a sale barn. Turkey growers were given monthly service bulletins. Feeding, management, and breed improvement information was extended to all growers whose name was available. Turkey production in the county was greatly increased. Quality improvement program for beef cattle was conducted by means of 4 -H clubs, cooperation with the breeders association and calf shows held in connection with association sales, at a special event in Mullen and at the county fair. Protein supplements and mineral supplements as a balance to the needs of range cattlemen was discussed at two series of community meetings and as a port of the pasture-forage-livestock program. Cottonseed cake and soybean cake have been proved to be more economical than other sources of proteins. <b>Steamed</b> <b>bone</b> meal, by furnishing a good source of phosphorus is an important mineral source. Control of calf scours, calf diphtheria, and the latest information concerning Bang 2 ̆ 7 s disease were the subjects of discussion at community meetings and during the progress of pasture-forage-livestock visits. Bot control and sleeping sickness control in horses was continued. The latter malady has been almost entirely eradicated during the 1939 year. With an A. C. P. depleting goal of 102, 976 acres for the county the summary of performance showed that 73, 464 acres were planted to depleting crops. 3, 096 acres of wheat were planted as compared to a wheat allotment of 3, 565. 429, 948 acres of range were deferred or rested between May 15 and October 1. 242 wells were installed. 76 ranchers and farmers cooperated with the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program. 98 visits were made to 61 different ranches and farms. District finish-up clinics and recognition meetings were conducted at Valentine and at Mullen. 8 Cherry County ranchers were awarded recognition by the sponsoring business firm organizations at these district meetings. Two were awarded honorable mention at the Omaha state meet. The Land-Use committee assisted to coordinate the credit facilities of FSA, FCA, and the land bank. Thelr policies were outlined and discussed with representatives of the production credit association and the local banking agencies. Collections are reported much greater than new amounts loaned for the current year. FCA reports collection of total amount on their books tor the county as being more than 60 percent. A livestock brand directory With 1800 brands of herds maintained in the county was published as a 6 -page supplement to the 1938 Cherry County atlas. Cooperated with and assisted the various livestock agencies with promotion of livestock sales services. Sales from Cherry County members of the new feeder cattle association are estimated to exceed 39, 000 head. Added to the purebred sales, the valuation of livestock sold by members at organizations assisted is estimated to exceed 2, 000, 000. 00. 28 clubs enrolled 405 ladies tor the home demonstration program. Six lessons were demonstrated. A total of 148 regular members and 10 associate members enrolled for 172 4 -H club projects. 99 regular members, and 7 associate members completed their projects. 18 clubs were organized as follows: 5 beef cattle clubs completed 41 of 47 enrolled 1 colt club completed 7 of 7 enrolled 2 cooking clubs completed 15 of 24 enrolled 1 canning club completed 8 of 8 enrolled 5 clothing clubs completed 27 of 38 enrolled 2 home management clubs completed 5 of 11 enrolled 1 girls room club completed 7 of 11 enrolled 1 fix-it club completed 1 of 11 enrolled 88 persons used 26 tons of grasshopper bait for protecting crops to make an estimated saving of 16, 525. 00...|$|R
