30|$|Please {{notice that}} while Eq. (5.4) in [2] is {{consistent}} <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results</b> and applies to both inhibitory and excitatory coupling, inequality (5.5) holds only for positive coupling.|$|R

30|$|The results (1), (4) of Dou-Du {{are given}} as corollaries of Theorem 3. Result (2) is proved by Schwarz’s inequality. Also is shown, that (3) cannot be {{compared}} <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>result.</b>|$|R
30|$|Generally, the {{chlorophylls}} exhibit strong absorption in {{the blue}} and red regions of the solar spectrum [24]. However, they show poor absorption in the green region, which is consistent <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the Pd(100) -(√ 5 ×√ 5) -O {{structure}} formed by adsorption of 0. 8 ML of oxygen by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), High Resolution Core Level Spectroscopy (HRCLS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). We show that a recent tensor Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) analysis of the Pd(100) -(√ 5 ×√ 5) -O structure is incompatible <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results</b> from this structure. A new model that is consistent <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results</b> is suggested.

30|$|So, we {{can think}} that the {{numerical}} experiments are consistent <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results</b> in Section  3, that is to say, the implicit Euler compensated method performs better stability than current numerical methods of order 0.5.|$|R

30|$|The organophosphorus {{insecticides}} including malathion {{may lead}} to degeneration of the germ and Leydig cells.

30|$|Furthermore, data of Lang et al.

Their confidence limits, again, correspond well <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>results</b> and confirm the extent of variation to be expected.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{establish}} some new nonlinear retarded integral inequalities of Gronwall-Bellman type with two variables.
