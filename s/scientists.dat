5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of <b>scientists</b> who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government <b>scientists,</b> who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing <b>scientists,</b> Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, <b>scientists</b> know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped <b>scientists</b> answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Each year, <b>scientists</b> from 28 {{different}} nations conduct experiments not reproducible in {{any other}} place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 <b>scientists</b> operate research stations; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.

5|$|In 2017 Canadian <b>scientists</b> recreated an extinct {{horse pox}} virus to {{demonstrate}} that the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab {{at a cost of about}} $100,000, by a team of <b>scientists</b> without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed. Although the <b>scientists</b> performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E
5|$|Japanese <b>scientists</b> and {{engineers}} {{have contributed to}} the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots —though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000. Japan boasts the third highest number of <b>scientists,</b> technicians, {{and engineers}} per capita in the world with 83 <b>scientists,</b> technicians and engineers per 10,000 employees.|$|E

5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American <b>scientists</b> (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the <b>scientists</b> polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of <b>scientists</b> surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among <b>scientists</b> who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and <b>scientists.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Christian <b>Scientists</b> came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms.

5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The <b>scientists</b> marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the <b>scientists,</b> assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French <b>scientists</b> {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were {{temporarily}} {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the <b>scientists</b> were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French <b>scientists</b> and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E
