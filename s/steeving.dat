He calls it the Lisbon bean-pod, from its exact resemblance to that vegetable, and affirms it to be the most curious of European craft, which we can readily believe. [...] "Take a well-grown bean-pod," [...] he says, [...] "and put it on its convex edge, and then put two little sticks, one in the centre and one at the bows, raking forward, for the masts, and another in the bows, <b>steeving</b> up, for the bowsprit, and another astern for a boomkin or outrigger, and then you have before you the boat in question." [...] These boats carry a lateen sail, sail very fast, and are much used on the waters of the Tagus as fishing-boats and trawlers.|$|E
5000|$|In present-day American {{waterfront}} usage, a stevedore {{is usually}} a person or a company who manages the operation of loading or unloading a ship. In the 1800s, the word was usually applied to black laborers or slaves who loaded and unloaded bales of cotton and other freight on and off riverboats. In Two Years Before the Mast (1840), the author Richard Henry Dana, Jr. describes the <b>steeving</b> of a merchant sailing ship in 1834. This was the process of taking a mostly-full hold and cramming in more material. In this case, the hold was filled with hides from the California hide trade up to four feet below the deckhead (equivalent of 'ceiling'). [...] "Books" [...] composed of 25-50 cattle skins folded into a bundle were prepared, and a small opening created {{in the middle of}} one of the existing stacks. Then the book was shoved in by use of a pair of thick strong pieces of wood called steeves. The steeves had one end shaped as a wedge which was placed into the middle of a book to shove it into the stack. The other ends were pushed on by means of block and tackle attached to the hull and overhead beams and hauled on by sailors.|$|E
