5000|$|While a firm's present {{cost of debt}} is {{relatively}} easy to determine from observation of interest rates in the capital markets, its current cost of equity is unobservable and must be estimated. Finance theory and practice offers various models for estimating a particular firm's cost of equity such as the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM. Another method is derived from the Gordon Model, which is a discounted cash flow model based on dividend returns and eventual capital return from the sale of the investment. Another simple method is the Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium (BYPRP), where a <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> premium is added to the firm's long-term debt interest rate. Moreover, a firm's overall cost of capital, which consists of the two types of capital costs, can be estimated using the weighted average cost of capital model.|$|E

This paper assumes that public policy should intrinsically be concerned with people’s expected welfare, rather than their preferences, which sometimes implies a degree of paternalism.

5000|$|In free-market economies, {{technological}} advances lead {{to increases in}} productivity, but {{at the expense of}} older, less-efficient means of production, creating a level of <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> for which the compensation (in theory) is the return on capital. This rate or return is a reflection of all of the perceived risks associated with the capital financing of the means of production, including technology risks. From a capital finance point of view, advances in technology are the classic definition of systemic market risk. The outflow of this condition is the [...] "creative destruction" [...] of a portion of the means of production as evidenced by businesses discontinuing the production of obsolete products and/or the cessation of business activities that are no longer profitable. In its purest form, capitalism entails a constant level of creative destruction of a portion of the means of production and the increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the subject economy reflects the growth after the losses due to economic obsolescence have been reconciled. Accordingly, increases in GDP provides a substantive measurement that demonstrates that capitalism does not in effect create an economic construct where one party can only make a gain {{at the expense of the}} other party (i.e.: if one party could only profit at the expense of another party, then it would be impossible to achieve any nominal growth in GDP).|$|E

Women who had higher objective risk of breast cancer, as defined by the Gail et al. algorithm (M. H. Gail et aL, J. Nati.

However, when objective and <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> were included in a multivariate model, only <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> predicted stages of change.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> when driving and drivers' subsequent memory for everyday driving situations. Relationships are considered {{in the context of}} the wider literature on arousal and memory. In the first study subjects drove a set route around Cambridge giving verbal risk ratings; they then performed an unexpected free recall task. Drivers tended to recall situations which they had previously rated as risky. A series of laboratory studies explored this result. In these studies subjects watched films of actual driving situations in a simulator and were given subsequent recognition tests. In the first laboratory study <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> was only associated with improved recognition sensitivity for the most potentially dangerous situations. In generally safe situations feelings of risk appeared to impair recognition. These results were replicated in two further laboratory studies using different judgment tasks and stimuli. These results could be explained by <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> causing the focusing of attention in driving with a consequent enhancement of memory for central details at the expense of memory for peripheral details. To directly test the attention focusing hypothesis a laboratory study defined central information with respect to risk in driving situations. Then an on-road study found that drivers did indeed recall more central details than would be expected from risky situations. There thus appear to be two relationships between <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> and memory in driving. The first is an overall tendency for subjects to recall risky situations. This is assumed to be largely because such events are rare and distinctive. The second is a tendency for subjects to recall central details of risky situations at the expense of peripheral details. This is consistent with recent studies on attention focusing in eyewitness testimony. Some implications of these results for eyewitness testimony and for the psychology of driving are considered...|$|E

40|$|What does 'likely' mean, when {{respondents}} {{estimate the}} risk to become a victim of crime? We apply prospect theory to derive hypotheses of framing-effects on perceptions of risk. Victimization risks can either be interpreted as gains (?being spared of offences?) or as losses (?becoming a victim of crime?). Because losses are perceived as more severe, respondents will state lower subjective victimization probabilities in the loss-frame, compared to the gain-frame. We demonstrate such a framing-effect with data from an experimental survey. Furthermore, we show that the meaning of vague quantifiers varies with the frequency and {{the severity of the}} event. Respondents assign to the same vague quantifiers (e. g. 'unlikely') higher likelihoods in terms of percentages for frequent and for less severe events than for infrequent and for severe events. Because respondents do not use vague quantifiers consistently, it is problematic to compare <b>subjective</b> <b>risks</b> for different victimizations...|$|R

40|$|Background. We {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the role of objective risk status and <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> beliefs in influenza vaccination decisions during the recent rationing of influenza vaccine. Method. A random sample of 300 Americans, obtained through random-digit dialing, was interviewed regarding influenza vaccination practices and beliefs in September 2004 and again in March 2005. Results. One-half of individuals {{at high risk of}} influenza did not know that they were at high risk and, therefore, were not vaccinated. Respondents at high objective risk {{were more likely to report}} having been vaccinated than respondents who were not at high objective risk (36 % vs. 6 %, respectively; odds ratio, 8. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 65 – 18. 88). However, a more powerful predictor of self-reported vaccination was <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> (64 % vs. 7 %, respectively; odds ratio, 24. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 12. 18 – 48. 09). <b>Subjective</b> <b>risk</b> fully mediated the relationship between objective risk and vaccination. Other predictors of vaccination included physician recommendation, habit, prior vaccination intention, belief that the influenza vaccine is safe and effective, perceived likelihood of getting influenza, and trait neuroticism. Conclusion.

40|$|Insurance {{offices are}} {{directly}} interested in {{reduction of the}} number and extend of haphazard damages because they have influence on the financial results of insurance business. Therefore insurers apply different technical insurance measures to counteract haphazard damages. The offices carry on also preventive activities connected with certain financial expenditure. As a rule the state puts them under obligation to do so because insurance activities are kept under state control. Imposing obligation of preventive activity on insurance offices the state is positive that insurers who liquidate damages and investigate their causes are particularly predestinated {{to take part in}} effective preventing losses. Another reason for the participation of insurance offices in preventive activity is the conviction that to some extent insurance protection affects unfavourably the preventive attitudes of the insurants and may add to the so called <b>subjective</b> <b>risks.</b> The purpose of insurance prevention is to offset that influence of insurance.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between subjective and objective risk tolerance {{is illustrated by}} expected utility analyses of portfolios. Optimal portfolios were derived for one, 5, and 20 year investment horizons for 6 major financial asset categories. The important aspects of objective risk tolerance are the proportion of an investor's total wealth (including human wealth) in financial assets, and the investment horizon. Even investors with very low <b>subjective</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance levels should have aggressive portfolios if their horizons are 20 years or more. Key Words: Risk tolerance, Portfolios, Investment In investing for long term goals, the allocation of asset categories in the portfolio {{is one of the}} most crucial decisions. Most people are not willing to take above average risks to obtain above average returns on their investments (Avery & Elliehausen, 1986). It is likely that many investors focus too much on short term volatility, especially for investing for retirement. Many financial planners stress the concept of the client’s risk tolerance, and give questionnaires to assess risk tolerance.
