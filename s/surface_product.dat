Tumor volume calculations from imaging studies correlated with volumetric measurements from histological sections (r 2 = 98. 5 %) and illustrated natural tumor progression (9 to 225 mm 3).

The surface energy of polycarbonate was found to increase (60 percent) during UV/O 3 treatment. However, calculations on PMMA were hampered by the formation of a water soluble <b>surface</b> <b>product.</b> On PTFE surfaces, the UV/O 3 treatment etched the surface causing large increases in surface roughness, rendering contact angle measurements impossible.

The quality of homogeneous flat <b>surface</b> <b>products,</b> like paper sheets, steel slabs, textiles, and glasses, plays a crucial role in raising the profile of the manufacturing companies. This paper presents a new approach for defect detection using the Levene’s test, which is used for testing the homogeneity of variances of samples drawn from the same population. It is assumed that the variances of samples taken from the same population are equal. Occurrence of defects results in a Levene’s test measure that is higher than some critical value indicating that the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected. Noise immunity of the proposed technique is ensured through pre-filtering the fabric image using the Wiener filter that is an edge preser-ving filter. The robustness to variations of the sliding window size and the structures of fabric is analyzed. The major advantages of the proposed technique are the low computational complexity and noise immunity while maintaining high accuracy. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of alkali {{adsorption}} on the agglomeration of particles of bauxite, kaolinite, emathlite, lime, and two types of coal ash. An agglomeration (adhesion) temperature is defined which characterizes the adhesion propensity of particles. Using a small fluidized bed, a unique experimental technique is developed to measure this agglomeration point in-situ. The effects of alkali adsorption on the agglomeration characteristics of the substrates are determined. The agglomeration temperature of all substrates decreases as the alkali content increases. At low alkali loadings, alkali adsorption enhances particle agglomeration by forming new compounds of lower melting points. At high alkali concentrations, adhesion and agglomeration are caused by a layer of molten alkali which covers the exterior of the particles. Alkali surface composition of particles is studied using a Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM). Results indicate that the alkali surface concentration decreases as agglomeration temperature increases. SAM depth profiling data provides information on the variations of alkali loading across particles. These results show that an alkali <b>surface</b> <b>product</b> layer is formed where most of the alkali adsorbed is concentrated. The use of additives to scavenge alkali vapors is further studied in a pilot scale downflow combustor under more typical combustion conditions. SAM surface analyses of additive particles indicate three mechanisms of alkali capture. Alkali adsorption by reaction, alkali surface condensation, and alkali nucleation and coagulation with additive particles. These mechanisms may occur independently or simultaneously depending primarily on the alkali vapor concentration and the temperature profile along the combustion furnace. A mathematical model is developed to represent the kinetics and mechanisms of the alkali adsorption and agglomeration process. Modeling results indicate that the adsorption-reaction process is influenced by diffusion of alkali through the <b>surface</b> <b>product</b> layer. The model predictions of the alkali adsorbed as a function of minimum agglomeration temperature agree very well with the experimental results. Alkali-additive interactions in a downflow combustor are also modeled to predict the mechanisms of alkali capture and the overall alkali removal efficiency. Model predictions of the alkali capture agree well with the experimental results...|$|E

A prototype global landslide hazard assessment framework has been developed to evaluate how landslide susceptibility and satellite-derived precipitation estimates can be used to identify potential landslide conditions in near-real time. Preliminary analysis of this algorithm suggests that forecasting errors are geographically variable due to the resolution and accuracy of the current susceptibility map and the application of satellite-based rainfall estimates.

40|$|Reaction {{mechanisms}} for oxidation of the Si(100) surface by atomic oxygen were studied with high-level quantum mechanical methods {{in combination with}} a hybrid QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/Molecular Mechanics) method. Consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results, three structures, “back-bond”, “on-dimer”, and “dimer-bridge”, {{are found to be}} the most stable initial <b>surface</b> <b>products</b> for O adsorption (and in the formation of SiO 2 films, i. e., passive oxidation). All of these structures have significant diradical character. In particular, the “dimer-bridge” is a singlet diradical. Although the ground state of the separated reactants, O+Si(100), is a triplet, once the O atom makes a chemical bond with the surface, the singlet potential energy surface is the ground state. With mild activation energy, these three <b>surface</b> <b>products</b> can be interconverted, illustrating the possibility of the thermal redistribution among the initial <b>surface</b> <b>products.</b> Two channels for SiO desorption (leading to etching, i. e., active oxidation) have been found, both of which start from the back-bond structure. These are referred to as the silicon-first (SF) and oxygen-first (OF) mechanisms. Both mechanisms require an 89. 8 kcal/mol desorption barrier, in good agreement with the experimental estimates of 80 − 90 kcal/mol. “Secondary etching” channels occurring after initial etching may account for other lower experimental desorption barriers. The calculated 52. 2 kcal/mol desorption barrier for one such secondary etching channel suggests that the great variation in reported experimental barriers for active oxidation may be due to these different active oxidation channels...|$|R
