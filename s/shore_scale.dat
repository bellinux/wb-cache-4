One of the most prospective ways for scrap tires reuse is a production of composite materials [2] This research must {{be considered as a}} continuation of previous investigations [3, 4]. It is devoted to the clarification of some functional properties, which are considered important for the view of practical applications, of the composite material. Some functional properties of the material were investigated, for instance, the compressive stress at different extent of deformation of sample (till 67 % of initial thickness) (LVS EN 826) [5] and the resistance to UV radiation (modified method based on LVS EN 14836) [6]. Experiments were realized on the purposefully selected samples. The results were evaluated in the correlation with potential changes of Shore C hardness (<b>Shore</b> <b>scale,</b> ISO 7619 - 1, ISO 868) [7, 8]. The results showed noticeable resistance of the composite material against the mechanical influence and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The correlation with the composition of the material, activity of binder, definite technological parameters, and the conditions supported during the production, were determined. It was estimated that selected properties and characteristics of the material are strongly dependent from the composition and technological parameters used in production of the composite material, and from the size of rubber crumb. Obtained results show possibility to attain desirable changes in the composite material properties by changing both the composition and technological parameters of examined material...|$|E

The hypothesis that grazing by limpets determines the upper limit of distribution of this red algal turf was tested on moderately exposed shores in Portugal and Britain. We also aimed to assess whether the grazing effect is modified at various spatial scales. Grazers were excluded by fences, with half-fenced and unfenced controls. Exclusion plots were rapidly colonised by green ephemeral algae in the months immediately after {{the beginning of the}} experiment (summer); these algae were later replaced by perennial algae. The percentage cover of turf-forming macroalgae showed a significant increase at both locations. The upper limit of distribution extended more than 50 cm on most of the shores studied. In contrast, control and half-fenced plots remained devoid of algae. After 2 years, ungrazed plots were mainly colonised by a red algal turf (e. g. Caulacanthus ustulatus, Gelidium spp., Laurencia pinnatifida) in Portugal, while canopy cover (Fucus serratus and Himanthalia elongata) dominated in Britain in marked contrast to the grazed plots. Physical factors acting at both local and geographical scales may explain these differences. However, although physical factors probably have an important influence on the identity, size and abundance of sublittoral fringe macroalgae, grazers {{play a major role in}} directly setting their upper limits.

40|$|Hardness {{is among}} the most {{important}} attributes of an object that humans learn about through touch. However, approaches for robots to estimate hardness are limited, {{due to the lack of}} information provided by current tactile sensors. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel method for hardness estimation, based on the GelSight tactile sensor, and the method does not require accurate control of contact conditions or the shape of objects. A GelSight has a soft contact interface, and provides high resolution tactile images of contact geometry, as well as contact force and slip conditions. In this paper, we try to use the sensor to measure hardness of objects with multiple shapes, under a loosely controlled contact condition. The contact is made manually or by a robot hand, while the force and trajectory are unknown and uneven. We analyze the data using a deep constitutional (and recurrent) neural network.

We examined which mechanism explains our finding that a planktonic developer Turbo coronatus coronatus (Gastropoda) had significantly longer spines on its shell on more exposed <b>shores</b> at <b>scales</b> of < 2 km.

The EC project SITAR developed innovative solutions to this challenge, in particular {{through the development of}} acoustic methods and instrumentation for imaging waste barrels/containers of small dimensions. The study and experimental verification of ?Multiple-Aspect Scattering? techniques were achieved through scaled experiments in our tank facilities, using real types of seabed representative of European <b>shores</b> and <b>scaled</b> targets. High-frequency (238 kHz) bistatic scattering is investigated with a 5 -degree of freedom robotics system, enabling the positioning of the source and hydrophones at different distances from each other, and at different depths in the water column. This set-up is a scaled-down version of the SITAR sea trials performed in September/October 2003 in the Stockholm Archipelago, except that it offers a totally controlled laboratory environment. We measured the acoustic scattering of the targets and the background (silt) seabed, imaged with a highly directional beam at 45 ° grazing angle. These measurements were taken {{as a function of the}} bistatic angle (in-plane, 10 ° and 20 ° away) and the scattering angle (22 ° to 73 °). The results presented here focus on the variations of target scattering with target orientation (end-on, diagonal, broadside-on, as well as vertical) and target type (e. g. solid vs. fluid-filled, plain vs. ribbed). The relative orientation of the targets can be deduced from the variations with scattering angle. Their shape and content yield distinct acoustic characteristics when viewed at different bistatic angles.

Hierarchical experiments were conducted at three spatial scales with nesting present within each scale: small scale (within a rocky <b>shore</b> population), intermediate <b>scale</b> (regions separated by 70 km) and large scale (450 -km separation between two states: Victoria and Tasmania).

Within this analysis, a model for morphodynamics developed in Australia is utilized and assessed. The morphodynamics model is a model of morphological sequences thought to result from variations in energy dissipation over the surf zone. The model combines both circulation theory and morphology together and the beach is analysed in all three dimensions. The major aims of this thesis were to determine whether the behavior of North Bay Beach can be described by a morphodynamic model, and whether variability alongshore at North Bay Beach is explained by morphodynamics. Aims were achieved by specific measurement and observation of the process environment, beach profiles, and beach cusps of North Bay Beach, Kaikoura. Methods include littoral environment observations (LEOs), beach profile surveys, documentation of cusp, occurrence or extinction and wavelengths, sediment sampling of cusp horns and bays, and the compilation of wind and weather data. Morphodynamic beach state was indicated by way of a surf scaling factor. Results indicate a relationship between beach cusps and wave approach, explicable by the edge wave theory utilized by morphodynamics. Beach profile results show North Bay Beach as morphodynamically reflective - reflecting rather than dissipating wave energy at the <b>shore.</b> Surf <b>scaling</b> factor analysis indicates that North Bay Beach experiences intermediate morphodynamic beach states as well, although this is not reflected in the morphology of the beach as a whole as the model predicts. Due to these inconsistencies, the specific morphodynamics model presented proved inconclusive. However, it is clear that North Bay Beach is more reflective than it is dissipative. On this point, the conceptual basis of morphodynamics proved appropriate. It provided a link between the known morphology, sediment, and morphological responses of North Bay Beach, and the lesser known, difficult to measure, process environment. However, the morphodynamic model needs "fine tuning", i. e. possibly more defined beach states in the sequence to adapt highly reflective, mixed sand and gravel beaches such as North Bay Beach...|$|R

Three locations, SW Ireland, the Isle of Man and the west coast of Sweden, which cover {{a large part of the}} European range of this species, were selected to investigate variability over a large spatial scale (100 s of kilometres). Two smaller <b>scales,</b> <b>shore</b> (1000 s of metres) and site (10 s of metres) nested within each location were also used. In addition, temporal variation over two 6 mo periods was also examined in the Isle of Man and Ireland. Most variability for all population parameters occurred over the largest spatial scale (location). This was a direct result of differences between Sweden and the other 2 locations, the Isle of Man and Ireland, which showed highly similar levels of all population parameters. The population of S, balanoides at the Swedish location was characterised by high growth rates, large size, high levels of mortality and a large turnover of bare space. At the spatial scale 'shore', only 1 population parameter, the growth rate of recruits, showed variability. At the smallest scale of 'site', all parameters showed significant variability except growth rate of adults. Calculation of variance components showed that differences between replicates (spatial scale: < 0. 5 m) accounted for little of the overall variability, in general less than the scales of site and shore.

40|$|Engineering design {{considerations}} of artificial coastal structures were tested to resemble {{as far as}} possible the nearest natural equivalent habitat, ecologically valuable rocky shores, as a potential management option. Coastal areas around the world attract urbanisation but these transitional areas between sea and land are inherently vulnerable to risk of flooding and erosion. Thus hard structures are often built in sensitive coastal environments to defend assets such as property and infrastructure (roads, railways, ports) against rising and stormy seas. The design, construction and maintenance of hard defences should wherever possible incorporate ecological considerations to enhance biodiversity, including maintaining or restoring natural habitats and wild species to ensure favourable conservation status. Artificial habitats are less topographically complex than natural rocky <b>shores,</b> at millimetre <b>scales</b> in terms of surface roughness, centimetre to meter scales for crevices and pools to tens, hundreds and occasionally thousands of meters for variation in tidal height and wave action gradients. The habitat value of design features of an existing seawall and breakwater, such as areas of different slope and orientation, and the presence of crevices and pools, that are analogous to habitat created by topographical features on a natural shore, were demonstrated by their ability to support distinct assemblages of species. X Furthermore, evidence is provided that a greater variation in the type of design features led to a higher species diversity occupying the structure, and included species that would otherwise not be present on the structure. The long term succession on artificial structures and the biodiversity reached on intertidal coastal defence structures is described to inform understanding of timescales over which successional processes operate. As a consequence of succession, artificial structures of large extent eventually resemble natural rocky shores of the same exposure. Increased surface heterogeneity of concrete armour units on Plymouth Breakwater by drilling holes was effective in adding habitat and increasing local species diversity. These can be added at the construction stage or post construction. In a real case study, added recessed pools, holes and surface texture during the construction of a tidal defence sea wall at Shaldon made heterogeneous surfaces to add habitat and influence species diversity, without compromising the engineering function or aesthetics of the structure. This study provides coastal engineers and decision makers with well researched practical design options to inform future construction and maintenance of coastal defence structures that will encourage specific outcomes to mitigate the negative environmental impact of artificial structures and contribute to conservation priorities...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the method of constructive parameters calculation of the elastic elements, which are used in electrical connectors of flexible printed cables. Electrical connectors characterized {{by the fact that}} the contact pair is needed to provide pressure. It is also important to know the optimum ratio between stability of the contact connection and the necessary value of the transition resistance. These ratios are studied sufficiently for discrete electrical connectors, however for connectors of flexible printed cables this theme is not explored enough. The purpose of this work is to develop methods that will allow to carry out calculations for elastic elements, which provide communication, and to determine the size of case elements for electrical connectors. We consider two types of connectors. First are removable electrical connections where it is necessary to find a compromise between the resistance value and the separating (engaging) force. Second are permanent connections, where counts only the value of the transition resistance. For the first type of connectors were considered a simple form of the liner, in the shape of a rubber block, as in this case, the pressure should be created only by the compression of the liner and fixing it. It is important to get accurate results of the pressure calculation for removable electrical connections, because in this case we consider especial shape of elastomeric liner, which allows to create the pressure not only by compression of the liner, but by deformation it as a spring. For this task, the engaging force was specified on the basis of already known facts. It was important to set the amount of deformation that defines the shape and size of the liner and the case. We solved the problem of transition from the units of measuring hardness, specified in the technical specifications of rubber, to the value of the Young's modulus used in the calculations of constructive parameters of connectors. We got an analytic dependence that can be used to find the Young's modulus for a known value of hardness on a <b>scale</b> <b>Shore</b> A. We gave examples of the amount of compression calculation in the elastomeric liner to provide a reliable contact for specified values of the transition resistance for the removable and permanent connectors based on flexible printed cable...|$|R
40|$|Coastal defence {{structures}} (CDS) are propagating globally. Growing {{environmental concerns}} are driving modications to traditional coastal engineering methods through environmentally-enhancing designs which promote biodiversity and socio-economic benefits. Despite {{a number of}} tested ecologically-sensitive designs, {{there is still a}} gap between research concepts and practical implementations to coastal engineering designs. I investigated design methods for CDS to improve their role as surrogate habitats for coastal assemblages, thus creating more sustainable coastal protection for engineering and maintaining biodiversity. I focused on four key knowledge gaps to identify novel, sustainable and, more importantly, practical methods of designing ecologically sensitive coastal protection: (1) the extent of biological and topographic dissimilarity between natural and artificial <b>shores</b> at different <b>scale</b> levels; (2) the use of porous CDS as multifunctional designs for coastal engineering; (3) the use of 3 D printing in coastal engineering to design complexity into defence structures; and finally, (4) the impacts of intertidal and subtidal species and their role as natural coastal protection methods. To address the first knowledge gap, I surveyed seven natural and artificial shores on the South coast, UK, comparing the biological communities and topographic complexity on each shore at three different scale levels. I found that species characteristic of natural and artificial shores differ, and natural shores tend to be characterised by species such as fucoids and some foliose red algae, while artificial shores are largely characterised by invertebrate species. For the second knowledge gap, I surveyed a porous CDS during a groyne reduction process, and compared the coastal assemblages colonising the internal and external habitats of the structure. The results showed significant differences in species richness and diversity on internal habitats to external. For the third knowledge gap, I explored the use of 3 D printing to design-in complex habitat features to enhance biodiversity on artificial structures. This study showed colonisation of some coastal species, but more importantly identified key limitations when using this novel material in coastal engineering, which are fundamental at this preliminary stage. Finally, to address the last knowledge gap, I investigated the impact of eight intertidal and subtidal mimic species on wave velocity. The results showed significant reductions in wave velocity due to the presence of all mimics, particularly longer and more flexible species. Additionally, I compared the impact of five different designed tile units on wave velocity. I found significant differences in wave velocity reduction among all tile designs, particularly between units of varying orientations. To conclude my thesis, I summarise the key findings and evaluate these outcomes {{in the context of their}} application to sustainable coastal engineering. I then outline challenges and practical methods for designing sustainable and multifunctional coastal defence schemes...|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} time, plywood has lost market share to {{competitors}} such as waferboard and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB). Improvement in plywood production and plywood performance is required to make plywood competitive with other wood based panel products. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine {{the possibility of using}} microwave for drying rotary cut veneer, (2) to investigate treatment methods for veneer both before and after fabrication of panels using diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI), (3) to test the characteristics of veneer and panels visually and mechanically. The experimental (preliminary and main research topics) approach to addressing this question involves investigating the characteristics of high performance panel products. All experimental designs used in this study are factorial ANOVA models for different factorial levels. A one factorial design was used to analyse the effect of moisture content (0 % and 10 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of veneer samples, and the effect of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of small cube wood samples. A two factorial design was used to investigate uptake of MDI in veneer and plywood treatments. The variables tested included three concentrations of MDI (50 %, 60 % and 70 %) and three levels of soaking times (5. 10, and 15 minutes). Another two factorial design was used to analyse the effects of five levels of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) and three levels of temperature setting (60, 100, and 140 C) on the curing time of MDI solution for small cube wood samples. Analysis of the effects of edge sealing (sealed and unsealed) and pressure type (low and high pressure) on the uptake MDI and Copper Naphthenate was analysed using a two factorial design. The study shows that microwave drying of veneer is technically feasible to cope with veneer drying problems, which at the present time poses a "bottleneck" and is the major consumer of thermal energy used in plywood production. Microwave drying is characterised by having low within charge variability in moisture content after drying; no drying defects and has no effect on the glueability of plywood. However, some importance aspects of the use of microwaves should be taken into account- in designing a commercial drying process. These include: the position, condition, type of wave guide covers and the power level of microwave. Microwave power had a significant effect on drying time. The higher the microwave power used the shorter the drying time. The highest uptake of solid MDI in plywood samples was obtained with 70 MDI following 10 minutes soaking (51 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 MDI (45 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (41 kg/m 3) respectively. The highest solid MDI uptake in radiata pine veneer was obtained with 70 % MDI following 10 minutes soaking (115 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 % MDI (94 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (71 kg/m 3) respectively. Investigation into the curing processes indicated that the best temperature for curing MDI solution was 60 C. Microwave energy could not be applied for curing MDI treated samples. Microwaving resulted in substantial losses of MDI solution from the wood blocks. Pressure impregnation of MDI, increased the uptake of resin compared to soaking techniques. The highest uptake of solid MDI for plywood samples was obtained with 70 % MDI in unsealed samples using high pressure treatment (359 kg/m 3). This was followed by the treatment of plywood which had been edge sealed and high pressure treated (208 kg/m 3), sealed and low pressure treatment (71 kg/m 3) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (51 kg/m 3), respectively. The highest uptake of Copper Naphthenate in plywood samples was obtained for edge-sealed and high pressure treatment (0. 92 % wt/wt Cu) followed by unsealed and high pressure treatment (0. 88 % wt/wt Cu), unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 45 % wt/wt Cu) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 51 % wt/wt Cu), respectively. MDI solution applied to plywood and veneers by immersion improved the surface qualities of these products. The surfaces were smoother, more rigid; there was water resistance compared to untreated samples. Water absorption was limited to 8 kg/m 3 after 5 minutes exposure compared to 84 kg/m 3 for untreated plywood. The average surface hardness of MDI treated veneers (82) was 4 points (in <b>Shore</b> C <b>scale)</b> higher than untreated veneers (78). The greatest hardness was obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (85), followed by 60 % (83) and 70 % (78) MDI solutions. The average surface hardness of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment (85) was 6 points higher than untreated plywood (79). When MDI was applied by pressure impregnation surface hardness scores of 90 were obtained. The average shear strength of MDI treated veneer (0. 183 kN) is 35 % higher than untreated veneers (0. 135 kN). The highest values were obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (0. 202 kN), followed by 70 % (0. 178 kN) and 60 % (0. 169 kN) MDI solutions. The average shear strength of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment was 0. 125 kN. This was 24 % higher than untreated plywood (0. 101 kN). This shear strength value is 19 % higher when compared to that for Cu Naphthenate treated plywood using pressure treatment (0. 105 kN). It can be concluded that MDI resin can be used to improved the water resistance, surface hardness and strength properties of veneer and plywood. Cu naphthenate (in kerosene) preservative can also be used for treating finished plywood without affecting the strength properties of treated plywood.
