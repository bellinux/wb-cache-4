There is a slight scalloped effect at the outer edges of the purple weft made with tapestry weaving. There {{is part of a}} selvedge which is complete for the divided purple band, including the narrow yellow band in the center, but if there was selvedge along the wider yellow sections it has been worn away. The end <b>selvedge</b> <b>warps</b> look like they were turned back into the weaving.; Fairly clean, but worn. Part of the yellow weft and most of the purple weft are stained. One small interior hole. Several areas of damaged or missing wefts that leave exposed warps. The yellow weft still shows some luster...|$|R
40|$|Narrow {{strip of}} woven wool fabric which {{includes}} a <b>selvedge.</b> The <b>warp</b> is unevenly blended green and brown/gold, the weft is brown.; The selvedge is torn in several spots. The fabric contains numerous holes and tears. It is somewhat dirty with several small bits of plant material adhering to the surface. Also, on one side, a 3 cm long piece of very worn 2 -ply yellowed natural yarn has begun to felt {{to the surface of}} the woven fabric...|$|R
40|$|Large {{fragment}} of a tapestry roundel {{with a small}} section of background and parts of both <b>selvedges.</b> The <b>warp</b> and the background weft are 2 -ply yellow and the roundel weft is brown. Most of the patterning was created using yellow weft wrapping.; Very dirty, with small amounts of black encrusted mud. Very worn with several small interior holes and larger edge tears. There are damaged wefts that leave exposed warps. Some of the weft-wrapping has worn away. Raw edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Fragment A - The above {{measurement}} is {{not strictly}} {{warp and weft}} as parts of this badly damaged fragment are {{at right angles to}} other parts. This is a pale brown fragment of woven wool fabric that has been folded and sewn to four other fragments with coarse linen yarn.; Fragment B - Fragment of woven undyed linen fabric sewn between four other fragments with coarse linen stitches. The yarn is very unevenly spun.; Fragment C - Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with remnants of tapestry patterning in dark green/blue and red/purple along with undyed linen. Edges are folded and sewn and there is a 3 -ply sewing yarn at the edges, also.; Fragment D - The above measurements are not strictly warp and weft, the fragment is in two pieces that were sewn at right angles to each other. They are still attached to each other by one weft yarn. One piece has been sewn to the fragments below with coarse linen yarn. The other piece is attached to fragment F by one linen stitch. Fragment D is a fine woven fragment with linen warp and wool weft. There are tiny bits of this fragment caught in some of the stitching of fragment C. Fragment E - Fragment of pale brown woven wool fabric attached to other fragments by coarse linen stitches. This fragment has part of a selvedge along one edge.; Fragment F - Yellowed woven wool fabric. It is the bottom layer of this group of attached fragments.; Fragment A - Very dirty and deteriorated. It is in several pieces kept together with sewing. The weft is damaged in several places, leaving exposed warps.; Fragment B - Dirty and very worn. Brittle. Some plant material has adhered to the surface. Fragment C - Very dirty, with some encrusted mud, and worn. There are several interior pinholes and a few edge tears. Fragment D - Very dirty and worn. Fragmented. Edges are frayed. Fragment E - Very dirty and worn. This fragment is almost in two pieces. It is held together by only two <b>selvedge</b> <b>warps.</b> Fragment F - Has a large section of the interior missing (very large edge tear) ...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of a woven wool {{tapestry}} {{with brown}} warp and red, black, purple, blue, green/blue, olive green, white and yellow weft. A row of eight multi-colored birds, outlined in black, crosses {{the center of}} the fragment. Above and below the birds there are red bands with a row of small black diamonds outlined in white. There is a border of warp loops enclosing three white yarns (two are zzS, the third is two zzS yarns that have been Z-twisted together) along the edge below the birds. There are six picks of yellow weft between the red bands and the border. Along the opposite edge there is a section with a very crude finish of overcast white stitches which enclose two white yarns across the edge. The balance of this edge is unfinished with loose warps that are up to 3 cm long. The two warp-wise edges have plain <b>selvedges.</b> The <b>warp</b> and most of the weft yarns are plied.; Fairly clean with bright colors. There is some wear from abrasion. Some of the tapestry slits have stretched into holes. Some of the black yarn outlining the birds has deteriorated...|$|R
