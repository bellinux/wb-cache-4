40|$|The {{morphology}} of fibres {{consists of}} crystalline and noncrystalline domains forming the microfibrillar structure. Microvoids {{are present in}} form of inter- and intrafibrillar free spaces. In the presentation the microvoid system of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(propylene) (PP) fibres was studied by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Commercial PET textile fibres were treated in different media and the influence on fibre homogeneity was followed by SAXS. Conventional water dyeing and hot air treatment of PET fibres have caused considerable changes in the microvoid system. The influence of these two treatment media {{on the structure of}} inner surface is very alike and even higher than the influence of supercritical fluids at the same temperature. PP technical fibres were manufactured on a laboratory <b>spin-drawing</b> device and subsequently drawn at different drawing conditions on a laboratory drawing device. The drawing has influenced the microvoid system of fibres, with drawing the size and volume fraction of voids have increased, resulting in spinodal change of the microvoid system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermotropic {{liquid crystal}} polymer (TLCP) / poly(ethylene 2, 6 -naphthalate) (PEN) were {{prepared}} by a melt blending, and were melt spun by a <b>spin-draw</b> process. In this study, we suggest novel drawing technology using the CO 2 laser that can directly and uniformly heat up fiber inside to prevent the formation of ununiform structures in conventional heat drawing process. The properties of the heat/laser drawn TLCP/PEN blend fibers were superior to those of any other handled fibers, and were rather more excellent than those of TLCP/PEN blend fibers annealed at 1358 C for 10 min. It was confirmed that the CO 2 laser draw-ing {{made it possible to}} achieve the optimal drawing effect by draw ratio. The combined heating and CO 2 laser-drawing method has a great potential for industrial applications as a novel fiber-drawing process, and it can also be applied con-tinuously to conventional <b>spin-draw</b> system. 2007 Wile...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} our {{research}} were to optimize the melt spinning of filaments spun from plastic-grade polypropylene poly-mer and to compare the structural characteristics of as-spun filaments obtained from plastic- and fiber-grade polymers. The melt spinning of polypropylene filaments was carried out on an Extrusion Systems Ltd. laboratory <b>spin-draw</b> devi-ce. The spinning process was optimized {{in order to avoid}} the onset of spinline instabilities and spinline diameter fluctua-tions and was carried out as gravitational spinning with no-take-up application. From measurement of the average mo-lecular weight and molecular weight distribution, some degradation of molecules and narrowing of molecular weight di-stribution in both types of as-spun filaments was determined. At both tested as-spun filaments, produced by rapid coo-ling of an extruded jet, only the spherulitic structure composed of Î±-monoclinic crystals was established. In comparison to the filaments spun from the fiber-grade polymer, filaments spun from the plastic-grade polymer had higher density, melting enthalpy, and higher crystallinity, resulting in higher tenacity of these filaments...|$|R
40|$|Three {{groups of}} fibers of Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and PET/silica (2 wt%) nanocomposites were {{obtained}} {{at the same}} melt-spinning conditions and different drawing conditions. Through analyzing the modulus-strain curves of two fibers of each group, which prepared under the same conditions, we found that: the two fibers nearly have the same modulus value at the first peak of modulus-strain curve (Mod- 1), while the modulus value of PET/silica nanocomposites fiber is always {{higher than that of}} pure PET fiber at the second peak of modulus-strain curve (Mod- 2). The results of wide-angle X-ray scattering indicated that: the crystallinities of the two fibers are almost equal, but the chains orientation in amorphous region of PET/silica nanocomposites fiber is higher than that of pure PET fiber. Generally, at the same <b>spin-draw</b> processing conditions, the fiber with higher chain orientation in amorphous regions will has lower strain (related to the Mod- 2). However, PET/silica nanocomposites fiber has higher strain (related to the Mod- 2) as it has higher chains orientation in amorphous region. We think that the nanoparticles play an important role to change the microstructure of PET/silica nanocomposites fiber. There might be strong interaction between the nanoparticles and PET chains in amorphous region, which will lead to higher modulus.
