40|$|Reactive alkenes from {{petrochemical}} {{industries are}} known {{to play an important}} role in the formation of ozone in Houston, Texas. In this work we developed a fast-response detector of ethylene based on laser photo-acoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) and used it onboard the NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft to measure ethylene in industrial plumes around Houston in the summer of 2006. The new LPAS instrument was evaluated by comparison with measurement results from a whole air sampler (WAS), and the two measurements agreed within the combined measurement uncertainties. Emission fluxes of ethylene were estimated (1) by integrating the measured ethylene concentration across the width of industrial plumes, (2) by multiplying the concentration with the orthogonal wind speed measured from the aircraft, and (3) by assuming that the emissions are homogeneously distributed across the height of the boundary layer as estimated using aircraft ascents and descents. The estimated ethylene fluxes were compared with the results of simultaneous <b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation</b> <b>Flux</b> (SOF) measurements inside a mobile laboratory, and the agreement was within a factor of 2. Previous work had indicated that current inventories underestimate alkene emissions in Houston by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. These findings were confirmed both by the aircraft and SOF measurements. The measured mixing ratios of ethylene were compared between the results from 2006 and an earlier mission in 2000.

The measurements have been compared to emission inventories and have been conducted in parallel with airborne plume studies. The SOF measurements show that the hourly gas emissions from the large petrochemical and refining complexes in the Houston Ship Channel area and Mount Belvieu during September 2006 corresponded to 1250 +/- 180 kg/h of ethene and 2140 +/- 520 kg/h of propene, with an estimated uncertainty of about 35 %. This can be compared to the 2006 emission inventory value for ethene and propene of 145 +/- 4 and 181 +/- 42 kg/h, respectively. On average, for all measurements during the campaign, the discrepancy factor is 10. 2 (+ 8,- 5) for ethene and 11. 7 (+ 7,- 4) for propene. The largest emission source was Mount Belvieu, NE of the Houston Ship Channel, with ethene and propene emissions corresponding to 440 +/- 130 kg/h and 490 +/- 190 kg/h, respectively.

The method is based on measuring infrared (2. 5 - 15 µm) intensity spectra of the sun from a moving platform, vehicle or ship. In order to obtain the flux from a particular emission source, the vehicle is driven in such as way that the detected solar light traverses across the actual emission plume. The flux is then obtained as the integrated sum of the retrieved path averaged concentrations, multiplied by the wind speed. The main uncertainty for the method is {{in the assessment of}} the wind field. The retrieval code has been tested and compared to other published codes for alkanes, HCl and SO 2, with generally good agreement. Results from a validation experiment utilizing SF 6 trace gas shows that if averaging enough data, 10 traverses, accuracies of 10 - 20 % are obtained from simple emissions sources. Another tracer experiment, simulating emission from a crude oil tank showed an error of 50 % when measuring in the near field where meteorological disturbances are caused by the tanks.

The aim was to extend already known techniques with a new, smaller, more robust, and inexpensive instrument. The instrument was developed to be applicable {{in connection with the}} <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> <b>flux</b> (SOF) method. The method makes use of the molecular absorption of infrared light in the atmosphere using the Sun as a background source and information about the wind speed to determine the amount of emission in terms of mass per time. The instruments which were usually used to measure the column density of the gases are highly sophisticated, comparatively huge and expensive. Two basic techniques are applied to realize this instrument depending on its application for measurements of emissions from industries or volcanoes. The industries, especially petrochemical industries and refineries, emit a high amount of alkanes. Due to their broad absorption features in the infrared broadband radiometry is used to measure their column density. In the volcanic application hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride are of high interest. They have very narrow absorption features, thus gas correlation spectroscopy is applied in this instrument to quantify their amount. To find suitable bandpass filters for the broadband radiometry application a software (qesof) was used to simulate their behaviour. Other simulations based on the HITRAN database were conducted to find appropriate parameters for the gas cells and bandpass filters used for the gas correlation spectroscopy application.

The studies were carried out in several large conglomerates of oil refineries and petrochemical industries in Southeast and East Texas in 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2012. The measured alkane emissions from the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) have been fairly stable between 2006 and 2011, averaging about 11, 500 kg/h, while the alkene emissions have shown greater variations. The ethene and propene emissions measured from the HSC were 1511 kg/h and 878 kg/h, respectively, in 2006, while dropping to roughly 600 kg/h for both species in 2009 and 2011. The results were compared to annual inventory emissions, showing that measured VOC emissions were typically 5 - 15 times higher, while for SO 2 and NO 2 the ratio was typically 0. 5 - 2. AP- 42 emission factors were used to estimate meteorological effects on alkane emissions from tanks, showing that these emissions may have been up to 35 - 45 % higher during the studies than the annual average. A more focused study of alkene emissions from a petrochemical complex in Longview in 2012 identified two upset episodes, and the elevation of the total emissions during the measurement period due to the upsets was estimated to be approximately 20 %. Both meteorological and upset effects were small compared to the factor of 5 - 15, suggesting that VOC emissions are systematically and substantially underestimated in current emission inventories...|$|E

Studies have repeatedly shown that such emissions are often poorly understood, underestimated, and thereby not properly {{accounted for in}} emission inventories and regional atmospheric chemistry models, especially for emissions of VOCs. A better understanding and quantification of industrial VOC emissions is crucial for combating ground-level ozone, a serious problem facing most of the world's larger urban areas. This thesis presents results {{from a number of}} measurement campaigns primarily conducted in the area around Houston, Texas, USA, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of oil, gas and petrochemical industries. In the campaigns, the two flux measurement methods <b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation</b> <b>Flux</b> (SOF) and Mobile DOAS were used to quantify emissions of VOCs (alkanes and alkenes), SO 2, NO 2, and formaldehyde (HCHO) from the largest industrial conglomerates in the area. Measured emissions are compared to industry estimates reported to emission inventories, showing discrepancies of up to an order of magnitude for VOCs but not for SO 2 and NO 2. Emission factor models are used to estimate effects on VOC emissions of unrepresentative meteorological conditions during the measurement campaigns. These effects are determined to be too small to explain the discrepancies between measurements and reported emissions seen for VOCs. A plume chemistry model is applied to a number of cases where formaldehyde were detected together with significant amounts of alkenes in order to assess whether the formaldehyde could be explained as a secondary pollutant from the oxidation of alkenes. The results of the modeling shows that secondary emissions can only explain {{a small fraction of the}} measured formaldehyde flux in most cases, suggesting that most of the formaldehyde emissions measured from local sources were primary emissions. Secondary emissions are, however, still believed to be the largest source of formaldehyde further downwind from sources...|$|E

In order to complement the arsenal of instruments for fugitive gas measurements a new instrument has been developed following a theoretical investigation of a previous master thesis. The new instrument is a so called non dispersive spectrometer which will replace the infrared spectrometer in a <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> <b>flux</b> (SOF) instrument, currently used at the Radio and Space department. This new device is aimed to be inexpensive, light weight and robust. In the SOF method gas flux measurements are conducted using the sun as the light source and by observing the amount of light transmitted through the plume of gas. Further, wind speed data are used to determine gas emission flux in mass per time units. In this work the non-dispersive spectrometer was designed, built and tested in the laboratory {{as well as in}} the field. In the instrument the sun, from a so called solar tracker, is transmitted through an entrance opening with 2. 54 cm in diameter. The light is further transmitted through a filter wheel, with a set of bandpass filters, to a PbSe infrared light sensor that records the varying voltage reading for each filter consequently as the wheel rotates at a speed of 6 to 7 Hz. Thereafter, filter transmittance measurements are used to calculate the alkane column density. The filters are also used to compensate for the presence of water and methane as well as a slope in detector sensitivity over operating region. In a field test, the non-dispersive spectrometer was combined with a solar tracker and positioned on a pickup car. Measurements were then conducted downwind a refinery revealing alkane mixture carbon number of 4. 6 and emission estimation of 122 kg/h. This was consistent with SOF measurements that were being conducted in parallel...|$|E
40|$|Satellite and {{aircraft}} observations {{made during the}} 2006 Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS) detected strong urban, industrial and power plant plumes in Texas. We simulated these plumes using the Weather Research and Forecasting – Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with input from the US EPA's 2005 National Emission Inventory (NEI- 2005), in order to evaluate emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the cities of Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. We compared the model results with satellite retrievals of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) columns and airborne in-situ observations of several trace gases including NO x {{and a number of}} VOCs. The model and satellite NO 2 columns agree well for regions with large power plants and for urban areas that are dominated by mobile sources, such as Dallas. However, in Houston, where significant mobile, industrial, and in-port marine vessel sources contribute to NO x emissions, the model NO 2 columns are approximately 50 %– 70 % higher than the satellite columns. Similar conclusions are drawn from comparisons of the model results with the TexAQS 2006 aircraft observations in Dallas and Houston. For Dallas plumes, the model-simulated NO 2 showed good agreement with the aircraft observations. In contrast, the model-simulated NO 2 is ~ 60 % higher than the aircraft observations in the Houston plumes. Further analysis indicates that the NEI- 2005 NO x emissions over the Houston Ship Channel area are overestimated while the urban Houston NO x emissions are reasonably represented. The comparisons of model {{and aircraft}} observations confirm that highly reactive VOC emissions originating from industrial sources in Houston are underestimated in NEI- 2005. The update of VOC emissions based on <b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation</b> <b>Flux</b> measurements during the field campaign leads to improved model simulations of ethylene, propylene, and formaldehyde. Reducing NO x emissions in the Houston Ship Channel and increasing highly reactive VOC emissions from the point sources in Houston improve the model's capability of simulating ozone (O 3) plumes observed by the NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft, although the deficiencies in the model O 3 simulations indicate that many challenges remain for a full understanding of the O 3 formation mechanisms in Houston...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} flaring {{efficiency}} at the Borealis low-pressure plant in Stenungsund was conducted {{using a new}} patented method called <b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation</b> <b>Flux</b> (SOF), in combination with {{a new type of}} direct measurement of flow rate and ethylene concentration in the flare stack. The SOF method is based on the measurement of hydrocarbon concentrations over a cross-section of the emission plume. Multiplied by wind speed, this gives the flux of gas through the cross-section, i. e., the source emission in kg·s- 1. In the measurements, the sun was used as the light source. An infrared FTIR spectrometer linked to a sun tracker was placed on top of a van that was driven {{in such a way that}} the sunlight shone through a cross-section of the plume being measured. From the size of the molecular fingerprints in the infrared solar spectra, the concentration of ethylene and other constituents can be calculated. The results show that the flare we studied has a good combustion efficiency of about 98 % at high loads (> 1100 kg·h - 1), but that at low loads, which are the normal operating conditions most of the time, it has a significantly lower efficiency (50 - 90 %). Emissions thus appear to vary between 20 and 50 kg/h irrespective of load – a result that is consistent with other long-term FTIR measurements taken outside the plant. Similar emission results were also obtained during the course of the project from a newly installed flare, so that the problem does not appear to be specific to the flare that we studied. From the measurements in this study it can be concluded that a major contributing factor in the poor efficiency is an overdose of steam at low operating loads, as a result of trying to avoid soot formation by optimizing flare combustion at high loads. The problem can presumably be solved by introducing some form of dynamic steam metering linked to combustion load, or by eliminating the presence of ethylene at low operating loads. The direct flare stack measurements show that the heating value is generally low, and that theoretically we could therefore expect poorer efficiency levels. It was not possible to demonstrate this unambiguously in the present study, however, since the steam and ethylene levels were generally covariant. Only in a few cases did we find a low efficiency at low ethylene concentration, independent of steam quantity...|$|E

NASA’s Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiments (SAGE, SAGE II, and SAGE III) together have provided over 25 years of quality <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> data, a data record which has been an important resource for the scientific exploration of atmospheric composition and climate change. Herein, we describe an improvement to the processing of SAGE data that corrects for a previously uncorrected short-term time-dependence in the calibration function. The variability relates to the apparent rotation of the scanning track with respect to the face of the sun due to the motion of the satellite. Correcting for this effect results in a decrease in the measurement noise in the Level 1 line-of-sight optical depth measurements of approximately 40 % in the middle and upper stratospheric SAGE II and III observations where it has been applied.

The instrument {{consists of a}} digital mobile solar tracker that is coupled to a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) of 0. 5  cm − 1 resolution and a UV–visible spectrometer (UV–vis) of 0. 55  nm resolution. The instrument is used to simultaneously measure the absorption of ammonia (NH 3), ethane (C 2 H 6) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) along the direct solar beam from a moving laboratory. These direct-sun observations provide high photon flux and enable measurements of vertical column densities (VCDs) with geometric air mass factors, high temporal resolution of 2  s and spatial resolution of 5 – 19  m. It is shown that the instrument line shape (ILS) of the FTS is independent of the azimuth and elevation angle pointing of the solar tracker. Further, collocated measurements next to a high-resolution FTS at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (HR-NCAR-FTS) show that the CU mobile SOF measurements of NH 3 and C 2 H 6 are precise and accurate; the VCD error at high {{signal to noise ratio}} is 2 – 7  %. During the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) from 21 July to 3 September 2014 in Colorado, the CU mobile SOF instrument measured median (minimum, maximum) VCDs of 4. 3 (0. 5, 45)  [*]×[*]  10 16  molecules cm − 2 NH 3, 0. 30 (0. 06, 2. 23)  [*]×[*]  10 16  molecules cm − 2 NO 2 and 3. 5 (1. 5, 7. 7)  [*]×[*]  10 16  molecules cm − 2 C 2 H 6. All gases were detected in larger 95  % of the spectra recorded in urban, semi-polluted rural and remote rural areas of the Colorado Front Range. We calculate structure functions based on VCDs, which {{describe the}} variability of a gas column over distance, and find the largest variability for NH 3. The structure functions suggest that currently available satellites resolve about 10  % of the observed NH 3 and NO 2 VCD variability in the study area. We further quantify the trace gas emission fluxes of NH 3 and C 2 H 6 and production rates of NO 2 from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) using the mass balance method, i. e., the closed-loop vector integral of the VCD times wind speed along the drive track. Excellent reproducibility is found for NH 3 fluxes and also, to a lesser extent, NO 2 production rates on 2 consecutive days; for C 2 H 6 the fluxes are affected by variable upwind conditions. Average emission factors were 12. 0 and 11. 4  gNH 3  h − 1  head − 1 at 30  °C for feedlots with a combined capacity for [*]∼[*]  54   000 cattle and a dairy farm of [*]∼[*]  7400 cattle; the pooled rate of 11. 8  ±  2. 0  gNH 3  h − 1  head − 1 is compatible with the upper range of literature values. At this emission rate the NH 3 source from cattle in Weld County, CO (535   766 cattle), could be underestimated by a factor of 2 – 10. CAFO soils are found to be a significant source of NO x. The NO x source accounts for [*]∼[*]  1. 2  % of the N flux in NH 3 and has the potential to add [*]∼[*]  10  % to the overall NO x emissions in Weld County and double the NO x source in remote areas. This potential of CAFO to influence ambient NO x concentrations on the regional scale is relevant because O 3 formation is NO x sensitive in the Colorado Front Range. Emissions of NH 3 and NO x are relevant for the photochemical O 3 and secondary aerosol formation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Measurement of {{atmospheric}} temperature {{as a function}} of pressure, T (P), is key to understanding many atmospheric processes and a prerequisite for retrieving gas mixing ratios and other parameters from <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> measurements. This paper gives a brief overview of the <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> measurement technique followed by a detailed discussion of the mechanisms that make the measurement sensitive to temperature. Methods for retrieving T (P) using both broadband transmittance and refraction are discussed. Investigations using measurements of broadband transmit-tance in two CO 2 absorption bands (the 4. 3 and 2. 7 µm bands) and refractive bending are then presented. These in-vestigations include sensitivity studies, simulated retrieval studies, and examples from SOFIE. ...|$|R
50|$|The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) is {{a series}} of remote sensing {{satellite}} instruments used to study the chemical composition of earth's atmosphere. Specifically, SAGE has been used to study the Earth's ozone layer and aerosols at the troposphere through the stratosphere. The SAGE instruments use <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> measurement technique to determine chemical concentrations in the atmosphere. <b>Solar</b> <b>occultation</b> measurement technique measures sunlight through the atmosphere and ratios that measurement with a sunlight measurement without atmospheric attenuation. This is achieved by observing sunrises and sunsets during a satellite orbit. Physically, the SAGE instruments measure ultraviolet/visible energy and this is converted via algorithms to determine chemical concentrations. SAGE data has been used to study the atmospheres aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and other trace gases.|$|R
40|$|NOMAD (Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery) {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{instruments}} on board the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, scheduled for launch in March 2016. It consists of a suite of three high-resolution spectrometers - SO (<b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation),</b> LNO (Limb, Nadir and Occultation) and UVIS (Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer). Based upon the characteristics of the channels and the values of Signal-to-Noise Ratio obtained from radiometric models discussed in (Vandaele et al., 2015 a, 2015 b; Thomas et al., 2016), the expected performances of the instrument in terms of sensitivity to detection have been investigated. The analysis led to the determination of detection limits for 18 molecules, namely CO, H 2 O, HDO, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, H 2 CO, CH 4, SO 2, H 2 S, HCl, HCN, HO 2, NH 3, N 2 O, NO 2, OCS, O 3. NOMAD should have the ability to measure methane concentrations < 25 parts per trillion (ppt) in <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> mode, and 11 parts per billion in nadir mode. Occultation detections as low as 10 ppt could be made if spectra are averaged (Drummond et al., 2011). Results have been obtained for all three channels in nadir and in <b>solar</b> <b>occultation...</b>|$|R
40|$|NOMAD is a {{suite of}} three spectrometers that will be {{launched}} in 2016 {{as part of the}} joint ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission. The instrument contains three channels that cover the IR and UV spectral ranges and can perform <b>solar</b> <b>occultation,</b> nadir and limb observations, to detect and map a wide variety of Martian atmospheric gases and trace species. Part I of this work described the models of the UVIS channel; in this second part, we present the optical models representing the two IR channels, SO (<b>Solar</b> <b>Occultation)</b> and LNO (Limb, Nadir and Occultation), and use them to determine signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for many expected observational cases. In <b>solar</b> <b>occultation</b> mode, both the SO and LNO channel exhibit very high SNRs > 5000. SNRs of around 100 were found for the LNO channel in nadir mode, depending on the atmospheric conditions, Martian surface properties, and observation geometry. NOMAD has been made possible thanks to funding by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) and financial and contractual coordination by the ESA Prodex Office. The research was performed as part of the “Interuniversity Attraction Poles” programme financed by the Belgian government (Planet TOPERS).
