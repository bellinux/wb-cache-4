50|$|The mine is {{circular}} {{and has a}} very rounded appearance, with {{a central}} metal cap that covers the mine's safety device, a large screw. The mine is unusual in that it uses five igniter/fuzes linked to a central detonator {{by a series of}} flame tubes. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to press down on {{one or more of the}} igniters, compressing a spring and allowing two steel striker retaining balls to escape, releasing the striker, which is forced upwards by a second spring. The striker hits a percussion cap at the top of the igniter, the flash from which travels along a flame tube to a metal chamber in the centre of the mine. If the <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> is removed then the flash is free to ignite the detonator, which in turn detonates the main charge.|$|E

40|$|Thoracoscopically-assisted {{anterior}} spinal instrumentation {{is being}} used widely to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Recent studies have showed that screws placed thoracoscopically could counter the aorta or entrance into the spinal canal. There are a few studies defining the anatomic landmarks to identify {{the relationship between the}} aorta and the thoracic vertebral body using quantitative measurement for the sake of safe placement of thoracoscopic vertebral screw in anterior correction for AIS. The CT scanning from T 4 to T 12 in 64 control subjects and 30 AIS patients from mainland China were analyzed manually. Parameters to be measured included the angle for <b>safety</b> <b>screw</b> placement (α), the angle of the aorta relative to the vertebral body (β), the distance from the line between {{the left and the right}} rib heads to the anterior wall of the vertebral canal (a), the distance from the left rib head to posterior wall of the aorta (b), the vertebral body transverse diameter (c) and vertebral rotation (γ). No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to age or sex. Compared with the control group, α angle from T 7 to T 10, β angle from T 5 to T 10 and b value at T 9, T 10 were significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The a value was significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The c value showed no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, to place the thoracoscopic vertebral screw safely, at the cephalad thoracic spine (T 4 –T 6), the maximum ventral excursion angle should decrease gradually from 20 ° to 5 °, the entry-point of the screw should be close to the rib head. For apical vertebrae (T 7 –T 9), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased gradually from 5 ° to 12 °. At the caudal thoracic spine (T 10 –T 12), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased, the entry-point should shift 3 ∼ 5  mm ventrally...|$|E

All studies regarding accuracy and <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> in scoliosis represent idiopathic scoliosis using various techniques such as free-hand, navigation, image intensifier, etc., for screw insertion. Anatomies of vertebrae and pedicle are distorted in scoliosis, hence accurate and safe placement of pedicle screw is prerequisite for surgery. Between 2004 and 2006, 37 consecutive patients, average age 20  years (9 – 44  years), of neuromuscular scoliosis were operated with posterior pedicle screw fixation using free-hand technique. Accuracy of pedicle screws was studied on postoperative CT scan. Placement up to 2  mm medial side and 4  mm lateral side was considered within-safe zone. Of the 1, 009 screws, 273 screws were displaced medially, laterally or on the anterior side showing that 73 % screws (68 % in thoracic and 82. 5 % in lumbar spine) were accurately placed within pedicle.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe internal fixation of fractures in bone {{with the aid of}} plates and screws is a common procedure in orthopaedic surgery. The prevention of over-tightening is entirely dependent upon the skill and judgement of the surgeon. The research reported here proposed two independent methods for the prevention of overtightening of orthopaedic screws. The first method developed by this research was a mathematical model for predicting the maximum torque that may be applied to a screw before over-tightening occurs. Use of the model would allow surgeons to set a torque-limiting device to prevent over-tightening during surgery. The model would also allow the surgeon to predict the maximum pullout force that screwlbone interface can withstand before failure occurs. The second method developed in this research to prevent over-tightening was the automated screwdriver. It was shown that the automated screwdriver could detect the onset of tightening thus preventing over-tightening without the aid of the mathematical model. The automated screwdriver was demonstrated to perform the following tasks:- (i) Pre-tapping (ii) Tightening of non-self-tapping and self-tapping screws. (iii) Insertion of self-drilling external screws. This research has conclusively demonstrated that both the proposed methods for the prevention of over-tightening orthopaedic screws are a contribution to orthopaedic surgery. The Author recommends that the mathematical model and the automated screwdriver are both further developed to prevent over-tightening and increase the speed and <b>safety</b> of <b>screw</b> insertion in surgery...|$|R

Self-tapping screws usually provide good holding ability and operation efficiency in wood working projects. In recent years, self-tapping screws, especially medium and large sizes, have drawn attention in timber engineering for connection application in Europe. They are not just an alternative fastener {{that can be used for}} timber connection. Certain requirements for current structure design and construction details need to be verified in the interest of <b>safety.</b> Most self-tapping <b>screws</b> can be laid out with small spacing and edge distance without the risk of splitting wood, which often happens with bolted connections. Uibel and Blaß [1] tried to identify suitable spacing and distance for self-tapping screws with corresponding minimum timber thickness. They further modeled a moving load during the screw-in process with factors of wood density, screw-in speed, angle between screw axis and growth ring tangent. The resulted split areas were simulated mostly by a FE model. This gave practical information about the application of self-tapping screws to timber construction.|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{reference}} {{surgical treatment}} for unstable posterior pelvic fracture is percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation, isolated or {{in association with}} other techniques. As {{there is a risk}} of passage outside the bone when performing screw fixation under fluoroscopy, new image-guidance techniques have been developed: fluoronavigation, peroperative 3 D navigation, CT-linked navigation, etc. Since September 2011, our department has performed iliosacral screw fixation under CT control linked to navigation so as to optimize screw positioning. This innovative technology has been used in neurosurgery in our center since 2007, for disc implants, spinal fracture, vertebral arthrodesis and intracerebral localization. Material and methodsSix patients were treated by iliosacral screw fixation for posterior pelvic ring fracture lesion. The O-ARM (Medtronic®) computer-assisted surgical navigation system was used, combining surgical navigation and peroperative 3 D imaging. This kind of osteosynthesis is suitable for non-displaced or prereduced fracture. A radiation dose report is drawn up at end of surgery. DiscussionPostoperative course does not differ from other percutaneous osteosynthesis techniques, combing the advantages of a percutaneous approach (reduced infection and blood-loss rates, etc.) while optimizing iliosacral screw positioning. To date, no radiation overexposure has been found. ConclusionThe precision and <b>safety</b> of iliosacral <b>screw</b> fixation are now unequalled, meeting the basic computer-assisted surgery principles of reduced morbidity without overexposure to ionizing radiation. Indications for computer-assisted surgery should therefore be extended to iliosacral pathologies (arthritic, tumoral and inflammatory), non-displaced acetabular fracture, etc...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Minimal-invasive {{placement}} of screws into the posterior column of the acetabulum (PC) is challenging. Due to the saddle-shaped {{curvature of the}} medial cortical border of the PC, the standard fluoroscopic views of the pelvis cannot provide the desired <b>safety</b> during <b>screw</b> insertion. The {{aim of this study}} was to define a view tangentially to the medial cortex of the PC and to evaluate its accuracy and inter-observer reproducibility. METHODS: Radio-dense markers on the medial cortex of the PC along the axis of a PC screw were brought in line and landmarks of the new "Down the PC" view were determined. Kirschner wires were placed into the PC of a pelvis composite model and five pelvic cadaver specimens in a total of 34 different correct and incorrect positions. Based on either only the "Down the PC" view, only the standard views, or a combination of both, three fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons had to decide if the inserted wires were in bone in the posterior column or had exited cortex, and if they penetrated the acetabulum. Sensitivity, specificity, and the intra-class correlation coefficient were calculated. RESULTS: A view using three radiographic landmarks (pelvic brim, medial cortical wall of the body of the ischium, ischial spine) was found. Sensitivity and specificity to detect perforation out of the bone were 1. 00 and 0. 97 for the "Down the PC" view, 0. 46 and 0. 97 if only the standard views were used, and 1. 00 and 0. 95 for a combination of both. Sensitivity and specificity to detect intra-articular wire placement were 1. 00 and 0. 96 for the "Down the PC" view, 0. 72 and 0. 95 if only the standard views were used, and 0. 94 and 0. 99 for a combination of both. Inter-observer agreement using only the "Down the PC" view was excellent with an ICC of 0. 92 for perforation and ICC of 0. 82 for intra-articular wire placement. CONCLUSIONS: The "Down the PC" view is a useful addendum in the orthopaedic trauma surgeon's tool box. Using simple landmarks, it is easily to reproduce and thereby shows excellent accuracy and inter-observer agreement in order to detect medial perforation or intra-articular implant position...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{fixation}} {{techniques are}} in common used to stabilize vertebral fractures and correct severe scoliosis. Consolidation of injured vertebrae with neighbouring intact vertebra {{is the goal}} in the former case whilst fusion of the vertebrae in a corrected position is aimed at in the latter case. Degenerative spine diseases are not considered in this paper. Classical instrumentation consists of rods (e. g., Cotrel-Dubousset, Harrington, Luque-Galveston) attached to the bone by means of hooks or wires. More recently, transpedicular screws are introduced as an alternative bone/implant interface. Comparing the results of several studies, the posterior pedicle screw based devices demonstrate the ability to produce the most rigid constructs. However, the insertion of pedicle screws implicates a relatively high complication risk and its success strongly depends {{on the experience of}} the surgeon. Incorrect drilled holes or malplacement of the screws can result in nerve root injuries and fracture of the pedicle. Studies reported complication ratios up to 30 % with substantial neurological implications. A certain degree of automation of the critical actions may be necessary to enhance the <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> insertion. Two techniques of computer assisted spine surgery are compared. Both techniques permit a computer assisted surgical planning based on CT images. During operation the first system permanently observes the position of the drill relative to the spine and informs the surgeon on the deviation of the actual drill path to the planned drill path. The second system uses a pre-operative surgical planning to design and construct a mechanical drill guide, fitting perfectly on the patient's spine. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In cervico-thoracic {{junction}} (CTJ), the use {{of strong}} fixation device such as pedicle screw-rod system is often required. Purpose {{of this study is}} to analyze the anatomical features of C 7 and T 1 pedicles related to screw insertion and to evaluate the <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> insertion at these levels. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent posterior CTJ fixation with C 7 and/or T 1 included in fixation levels. Seventeen patients had tumorous conditions and two with post-laminectomy kyphosis. The anatomical features were analyzed for C 7 and T 1 pedicles in 19 patients using computerized tomography (CT). Pedicle screw and rod fixation system was used in 16 patients. Pedicle violation by screws was evaluated with postoperative CT scan. Results: The mean values of the width, height, stable depth, safety angle, transverse angle, and sagittal angle of C 7 pedicles were 6. 9 ± 1. 34 mm, 8. 23 ± 1. 18 mm, 30. 93 ± 4. 65 mm, 26. 42 ± 7. 91 degrees, 25. 9 ± 4. 83 degrees, and 10. 6 ± 3. 39 degrees. At T 1 pedicles, anatomic parameters were similar to those of C 7. The pedicle violation revealed that 64. 1 % showed grade I violation and 35. 9 % showed grade II violation, overall. As for C 7 pedicle screw insertion, grade I was 61. 5 % and grade II 38. 5 %. At T 1 level, grade I was 65. 0 % and grade II 35. 0 %. There was no significant difference in violation rate between the whole group, C 7, and T 1 group. Conclusion: C 7 pedicles can withstand pedicle screw insertion.

40|$|Background: Pedicle screw {{fixation}} {{is the most}} preferred method of stabilizing unstable spinal fractures. Pedicle screw placement may be difficult in presence of fractured posterior elements, deformed spine, gross instability and spinal pathology. Challenging spine-fracture fixation {{is defined as the}} presence of {{one or more of the}} following: 1) obscured topographical landmarks as in ankylosing spondylitis, 2) fractures in occipitocervical or cervicothoracic regions and 3) preexisting altered spinal alignment. We report a series of pedicle screw insertion with guidance of navigation in difficult fixation problems [...] Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients [hangman&#x 2032;s fracture (n= 3), odontoid fracture (n= 4), C 1 C 2 fracture (n= 1) and spinal fracture with coexistent ankylosing spondylitis (n= 6) ] underwent posterior stabilization. Intraoperatively after surgical exposure, images were acquired by Iso-C 3 D C-arm and transferred to navigation system. Instrumentation was performed with navigational assistance. Postoperatively, placements of pedicle screws were evaluated with radiographs and CT scan. Results: Sixty-seven pedicle screws (cervical, n= 33; thoracic, n= 6; lumbar, n= 26; sacral n= 2) and 15 lateral mass screws were inserted with navigation guidance. The average time of image data acquisition by Iso-C 3 D C-arm and its transfer to workstation was 4 minutes (range, 2 - 6 minutes). Postoperative CT scan revealed ideal placement of screws in 63 pedicles (94 &#x 0025;), grade 1 cortical breaches (&# 60; 2 mm) in 3 pedicles (4. 5 &#x 0025;) and grade 2 cortical breach (2 - 4 mm) in one pedicle (1. 5 &#x 0025;). There were no neurovascular complications. Deep infection was encountered in one case, which settled with debridement. Conclusions: Intraoperative Iso-C 3 D C-arm based navigation is a useful adjunct while stabilizing challenging spinal trauma, rendering feasibility, accuracy and <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> placement even in difficult situations...|$|R
40|$|Lateral mass (LM) screws are {{commonly}} used in posterior instrumentation of the cervical spine because of their perceived <b>safety</b> over pedicle <b>screws.</b> A possible complication of cervical LM screw placement is vertebral artery injury or impingement. Several screw trajectories have been described to overcome the risks of neurovascular injury; however, each of these techniques relies on the surgeon’s visual estimation of the trajectory angle. As the reliability hereof is poorly investigated, alignment with a constant anatomical reference plane, such as the cervical lamina, may be advantageous. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether alignment of the LM screw trajectory parallel to the ipsilateral cervical lamina reliably avoids vertebral artery violation in the sub-axial cervical spine. 80 digital cervical spine CT were analysed (40 female, 40 male). Exclusion criteria were severe degeneration, malformations, tumour, vertebral body fractures and an age of less than 18 or greater than 80 years. Mean age of all subjects was 39. 5  years (range 18 – 78); 399 subaxial cervical vertebrae (C 3 –C 7) were included in the study. Measurements were performed on the axial CT view of C 3 –C 7. A virtual screw trajectory with parallel alignment to the ipsilateral lamina was placed through the LM. Potential violation of the transverse foramen was assessed and the LM width available for screw purchase measured. There was no virtual violation of the vertebral artery of C 3 –C 7 with lamina-guided LM screw placement. LM width available for screw purchase using this technique ranged from 5. 2 to 7. 4  mm. The sub-axial cervical lamina is a safe reference plane for LM screw placement. LM screws placed parallel to the ipsilateral lamina find sufficient LM width and are highly unlikely to injure the vertebral artery, even in bi-cortical placement. Placing LM screws parallel to the lamina appears favourable over conventional techniques...|$|R
40|$|Parameters of the {{position}} of the aorta in previous reports were determined for anterior surgery. This study evaluated the relative position of the aorta to the spine by new parameters, which could enhance the <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> placement. Three parameters were defined in a new Cartesian coordinate system. We selected an entry point of a left pedicle screw as the origin. The transverse plane was determined to include both the bases of the superior facet and to be parallel to the upper endplate of the vertebral body. A line connecting the entry points of both sides was defined as the X-axis. The angle formed by the Y-axis and a line connecting the origin and the center of the aorta was defined as the left pedicle–aorta angle. The length of a line connecting the origin and the aorta edge was defined as the left pedicle–aorta distance. Distance {{from the edge of the}} aorta to the X-axis was defined as the pedicular line–aorta distance. These parameters were measured preoperatively in 293 vertebral bodies of 24 patients with a right thoracic curve. We simulated the placement of the pedicle screw with variable length and with some direction error. We defined a warning pedicle as that when the aorta enters the expected area of the screw. Sensitivity analysis was performed to find the warning pedicle ratio in 12 scenarios. The left pedicle–aorta angle averaged 29. 7 ° at the thoracic spine and − 16. 3 ° at the lumbar spine; the left pedicle–aorta distance averaged 23. 7 and 55. 2  mm; the pedicular line–aorta distance averaged 18. 3 and 51. 0  mm, respectively. The ratio of warning pedicles was consistently high at T 4 – 5 and T 10 – 12. When a left pedicle screw perforates an anterior/lateral wall of the vertebral body, the aorta may be at risk. These new parameters enable surgeons to intuitively understand {{the position}} of the aorta in surgical planning or in placement of a pedicle screw...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pedicle screws {{are being}} used {{commonly}} {{in the treatment of}} various spinal disorders. However, use of pedicle screws in the pediatric population is not routinely recommended because of the risk of complications. The present study was to evaluate the <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screws</b> placed in children aged less than 10 years with spinal deformities and to determine the accuracy and complication (early and late) of pedicle screw placement using the postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Materials and Methods: Thirty one patients (11 males and 20 females) who underwent 261 pedicle screw fixations (177 in thoracic vertebrae and 84 in lumbar vertebrae) for a variety of pediatric spinal deformities at a single institution were included in the study. The average age of patients was 7 years and 10 months. These patients underwent postoperative CT scan which was assessed by two independent observers (spine surgeons) not involved in the treatment. Results: Breach rate was 5. 4 % (14 / 261 screws) for all pedicles. Of the 177 screws placed in the thoracic spine, 13 (7. 3 %) had breached the pedicle, that is 92. 7 % of the screws were accurately placed within pedicles. Seven screws (4 %) had breached the medial pedicle wall, 4 screws (2. 3 %) had breached the lateral pedicle wall and 2 screws (1. 1 %) had breached the superior or inferior pedicle wall respectively. Of the 84 screws placed in the lumbar spine, 83 (98. 8 %) screws were accurately placed within the pedicle. Only 1 screw (1. 2 %) was found to be laterally displaced. In addition, the breach rate was found to be 4. 2 % (11 / 261 screws) with respect to the vertebral bodies. No neurological, vascular or visceral complications were encountered. Conclusions: The accuracy of pedicle screw placement in pedicles and vertebral bodies were 94. 6 % and 95. 8 % respectively and there was no complication related to screw placement noted until the last followup. These results suggest that free-hand pedicle screw fixation can be safely used in patients younger than 10 years to treat a variety of spinal disorders...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{shoulder}} arthroplasty (RSA) {{has been}} a proposed surgical treatment for severe rotator cuff deficiency associated with arthritis. Favourable clinical results {{for this type of}} prosthesis have been reported from short- and mid-term follow-up studies. However, the high revision rate (5 % - 33 %) at long-term follow up (i. e. greater than 6 years) is a concern. One of the principal factors leading to RSA failure is glenoid component loosening with an incidence of 5 % - 38 %. Therefore, one objective of this project is to investigate factors leading to long-term glenoid loosening. As various glenosphere positions have been proposed to minimize scapular notching, the other objective is to predict fixation strengths associated with these new surgical techniques. Scapular notching {{is one of the most}} frequently reported complications for Delta RSA, due to the high postoperative incidence of 50 % to 96 %. In this thesis, the study of scapular notching showed negative effects on the inferior <b>screw</b> <b>safety</b> and safety of the bone close to the screw. The study of initial stability showed that scapular notching may not destroy the good environment for bony ingrowth. Strain-induced bone remodelling {{has been a}}n important factor for the bone loss after hip and knee joint prosthesis implantations. Effects of this factor on the bone loss after Delta RSA implantations were investigated. The results showed that bone resorption was considerable in the region close to the back of metagelene and the middle stem with a mean reduction of postoperative bone apparent density of approximately 63 % at 8 -year follow up. Thereby, postoperative bone loss could be caused by three factors: strain-induced bone resorption, scapular notching and osteolysis induced by the polyethylene wear particles. In this study, prosthesis fixations in the case of inferior positioning and downward tilting of the glenosphere were assessed using two parameters: strain-induced bone resorption and initial stability. It was found that inferior positioning may lead to early bone resorption due to the inferior shift of postoperative glenohumeral force. The downward tilting may cause significant increase of bone-prosthesis micromotions and may result in poor initial stabilities of glenoid prosthesis.

40|$|Object Recent {{years have}} been marked by {{efforts to improve the}} quality and <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> {{placement}} in spinal instrumentation. The aim of the present study is to compare the accuracy of the SpineAssist robot system with conventional fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement. Methods Ninety-five patients suffering from degenerative disease and requiring elective lumbar instrumentation were included in the study. The robot cohort (Group I; 55 patients, 244 screws) consisted of an initial open robot-assisted subgroup (Subgroup IA; 17 patients, 83 screws) and a percutaneous cohort (Subgroup IB, 38 patients, 161 screws). In these groups, pedicle screws were placed under robotic guidance and lateral fluoroscopic control. In the fluoroscopy-guided cohort (Group II; 40 patients, 163 screws) screws were inserted using anatomical landmarks and lateral fluoroscopic guidance. The primary outcome measure was accuracy of screw placement on the Gertzbein-Robbins scale (Grade A to E and R [revised]). Secondary parameters were duration of surgery, blood loss, cumulative morphine, and length of stay. Results In the robot group (Group I), a perfect trajectory (A) was observed in 204 screws (83. 6 %). The remaining screws were graded B (n = 19 [7. 8 %]), C (n = 9 [3. 7 %]), D (n = 4 [1. 6 %]), E (n = 2 [0. 8 %]), and R (n = 6 [2. 5 %]). In the fluoroscopy-guided group (Group II), a completely intrapedicular course graded A was found in 79. 8 % (n = 130). The remaining screws were graded B (n = 12 [7. 4 %]), C (n = 10 [6. 1 %]), D (n = 6 [3. 7 %]), and E (n = 5 [3. 1 %]). The comparison of "clinically acceptable" (that is, A and B screws) was neither different between groups (I vs II [p = 0. 19]) nor subgroups (Subgroup IA vs IB [p = 0. 81]; Subgroup IA vs Group II [p = 0. 53]; Subgroup IB vs Group II [p = 0. 20]). Blood loss was lower in the robot-assisted group than in the fluoroscopy-guided group, while duration of surgery, length of stay, and cumulative morphine dose were not statistically different. Conclusions Robot-guided pedicle screw placement is a safe and useful tool for assisting spine surgeons in degenerative spine cases. Nonetheless, technical difficulties remain and fluoroscopy backup is advocated...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In spine surgery, {{intraoperative}} {{computed tomography}} (CT) and fluoroscopy-based navigation systems have demonstrated {{significant improvements in}} accuracy and <b>safety</b> of pedicle <b>screw</b> placement when compared to freehand technique [1]. Evaluation of pedicle screw placement is assessed in terms of pedicle breaches typically detected through visual inspection of the CT and fluoroscopic images [2, 3]. However, {{it is not yet}} possible to use intraoperative images to quantitatively assess the accuracy of pedicle screw insertion by comparing with a predefined insertion planning. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively assess the accuracy of pedicle screw insertion using intraoperative fluoroscopic images and compare the achieved screw placement with a predefined insertion planning. Materials and methods The study was conducted using a synthetic model of a lumbar spine. The testbed consisted of a clamping device and a reference block (Figure 1 a). The clamping device consisted of five template supports, produced by additive manufacturing, to rigidly fix the lumbar spine by means of fastening screws. A global reference frame (R 0) was defined fixed to the reference block. The test bed was scanned using a CT-scanner and a virtual 3 D CT model of the test bed was reconstructed for the planning of the pedicle screw insertion. The insertion planning consisted of ten sets of desired entry point, desired orientation axis and desired target point, defining the ten desired placement of screws in the pedicles of the five lumbar vertebrae. The insertion planning was recorded by storing pedicle screws coordinates (desired entry and target points and orientation axis) expressed in the reference frame R 0. One operator freehandly performed the insertion of the pedicle screws (Figure 1 b). The operator received a print with frontal, axial and lateral views for each pedicle screw and was instructed to respect the insertion planning as accurately as possible. Three parameters were used to evaluate the insertion accuracy. The error in the entry point (mm) was computed as the linear difference between desired and achieved entry points. The error in the orientation axis (°) was computed as the angular difference between desired and achieved insertion axes. The error in the target point (mm) was computed as the linear difference between desired and achieved target points. Fluoroscopic images of the test bed with the inserted screws have been acquired using the new Siemens Artis Zeego II intraoperative imaging robotic system (Figure 1 c). The set of fluoroscopic images was reconstructed in 3 D and the inserted screws were extracted using ITK-Snap segmentation software. Then, each 3 D model of the inserted screws was loaded in Paraview visualization and computation software. For each screw, one operator measured numerically the coordinates of the achieved entry point, orientation axis and target point in the reference frame R 0, and computed the errors in the desired pedicle screw insertion. The errors in the desired pedicle screw insertion computed numerically with the intraoperative fluoroscopic images were compared to reference mechanical measurements. The inserted screws were digitized with a precision of 1 µm using a Microscribe coordinate measuring machine (Figure 1 d). The initial inserted-screw dataset consisted of measurement points expressed in the reference frame R 0. Each measurement dataset was fitted to a least-square axis following guidelines for metrology and standards in mechanical engineering. The errors in the desired entry point, orientation axis and target point were then calculated using Matlab numerical computation software (Figure 1 e). Results Of the ten inserted screws, visual inspection of the synthetic lumbar spine and visual inspection of the intraoperative fluoroscopic images did not reveal any pedicle breach. The errors in the desired entry point, orientation axis and target point of the inserted screws, are presented in Table I. The difference between the errors computed numerically with the intraoperative fluoroscopic images and mechanically with the coordinate measuring machine, averaged - 0. 8 mm for the entry points, - 0. 1 ° for the orientation axes and - 0. 3 mm for the target points of the inserted screws. The maximum differences were found in the right pedicle of L 5 vertebra (- 3. 3 mm, 1. 8 ° and 0. 9 mm for entry point, orientation axis and target point respectively). Discussion This study showed the feasibility to compute the achieved errors on a predefined pedicle screw insertion planning using intraoperative fluoroscopic images with a very good accuracy when compared to reference mechanical measurements. The results observed here are currently undergoing clinical validation with complementary in vivo studies. Once completed, the quantitative accuracy measurement methodology using intraoperative fluoroscopic images that has been developed for the present study may be useful to investigate further pedicle screw insertion performed with the aid of several assistance technologies such as navigation and robotic systems.

40|$|More {{than half}} of all {{pregnant}} women experience low back and/or pelvic pain of whom one-third has severe complaints. In most cases the pelvic pain disap­pears within a few months after delivery, either spontaneously or after con­servative treatment. In a minority of patients the pain persists even after a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program and may cause severe disability. Some patients may even be wheelchair bound or bedridden. After failure of all con­servative treatment, surgical fixation of the pelvic ring may prove one of the last remaining options for those women. Internal fixation of the pelvic ring is commonly used in unstable pelvic fractures. For pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain (PLBP), surgical fixation of the symphysis and sacroiliac joints (SIJ) has only been described in a few case reports and small series. In this thesis the biomechanical properties of different fixation techniques of the pelvic ring are investigated. Main subject of this thesis is surgical fixation of the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joints in patients severely disabled by pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain. In literature different nomenclature, definitions and classifications are used for pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain. Therefore in chapter two the com­plaints, diagnostic tests and criteria for the diagnosis pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain are discussed to establish the diagnosis pregnancy re­lated low back and pelvic pain. The following criteria were the most constant for the diagnosis PLBP: pain in one or both sacroiliac joints which originated during pregnancy or directly after delivery. The pain may radiate into the legs and is frequently accompanied by pain in the symphyseal region and pain in the groins especially at adduction of the hips. Usually complaints increase dur-ing exercise, which may impair Activities of Daily Life (ADL), like walking, climb­ing stairs, lifting objects and turning over in bed. In severe cases, patients walk with short steps and a waddling gate. The best validated pain provocation tests are the posterior pelvic pain provocation test (PPPP) and the active straight leg raising test (ASLR). The aetiology and pathogenesis of pregnancy-related low back and pelvic pain (PLBP) are subject of debate. Hormonal influences (relaxine) and mechanical effects (pelvic instability, postural changes and trauma) have been proposed as causative factors. A physiological increase in the width and vertical mobility of the pubic symphysis during pregnancy and a decrease af-ter delivery is described. Some authors reported a relationship between the severity of the pelvic pain and the amount of separation and movement of the symphysis, but the strength of the correlation varied widely in literature. Fur­thermore, a review is given of the conservative and operative treatment op­tions and the different surgical fixation techniques of the pelvic ring. In chapter three to six the results of our in vitro studies into the biomechanical properties of sacroiliac screw fixation are described. In unstable pelvic fractures, sacroiliac screws {{are one of the most}} commonly used methods for internal fixa­tion of the posterior pelvic ring and have the advantage of percutaneous place­ment. In order to determine the stability of different configurations and combi­nations of sacroiliac screw fixations, cadaveric pelves were loaded in a stand­ardised way. Translation and rotation stiffness of the fixation and the load to failure were measured using a three-dimensional video system. In chapter three to five sacroiliac screw fixation was tested in a biomechanical model represent­ing partial and completely unstable pelvic fractures, because in this model the stability of the fixed fracture depended largely on the stiffness of the osteosyn­thesis, which allowed a better comparison of the different fixation techniques. In pregnancy-related low back and pelvic pain, the structural integrity of the pelvic ring is intact. Therefore we used an intact isolated sacroiliac joint as a model in chapter six. In chapter three we compared different configurations of sacroiliac screws in order to find the optimal number and positioning in the sacral vertebral body. In 12 embalmed human pelvises a Tile C pelvic fracture was created, consisting of a symphysiolysis and sacral fractures on both sides. After cutting the pubic symphysis, the left and right sacroiliac joint were loaded separately as baseline measurements. Each of the sacral fractures was fixed with one of the following methods: one sacroiliac screw in the first sacral vertebral body, two screws convergingly in the first sacral vertebral body or one screw in the first and one in the second sacral vertebral body. The pubic symphysis was not stabilised, to limit the influence of the anterior fixation on the comparison of the screw tech-niques. The stiffness of the intact posterior pelvic ring was superior to any screw technique. The techniques with two screws showed a significantly higher load to failure and rotation stiffness than the moethod with one single screw in the first sacral vertebral body. There were no differences between the two tech­niques utilising two screws. The addition of a second screw seems to prevent rotation and improves the load to failure. In chapter four we studied whether the stability of partially unstable pelvic frac­tures can be improved by combining plate fixation of the symphysis with a posterior sacroiliac screw. In 6 specimens a Tile B 1 (open book) pelvic fracture was created, by cutting the pubic symphysis and the anterior sacroiliac liga­ments. The pelves were loaded intact and after fixation of the fracture to 300 N, avoiding failure levels, and subsequently up to 700 N. The results showed no significant difference between isolated plate fixation and combined plate and sacroiliac screw fixation in either absolute displacements of the symphysis or sacroiliac joints or the stiffness. In addition, movements and stiffness of the fix­ated pelves were similar to the intact situation. Load to failure was only reached in one of the six cases. In all other cases the fixation of the pelvis to the frame failed before failure of the fixation itself. In these cases a load of about 1000 N or more could be applied. This suggests that the fixation could withstand even higher forces. Generally this is well above the force exerted by the upper body under physiological conditions. The addition of a sacroiliac screw in a Tile B 1 fracture does not give significant additional stability and we recommend iso­lated plate fixation in Tile B 1 fractures. Chapter five describes the stiffness and strength of combined anterior and pos­terior fixation under dynamic loading conditions in order to see if stability can be maintained in completely unstable (Tile C 1) pelvic fractures. In 12 pelvic specimens a symphysiolysis and sacral fracture were created. We compared the intact situation to anterior plate fixation combined with one or two sacro­iliac screws. Each pelvis was loaded 2000 times, with a maximum of 400 N, in the intact situation and after fixation with one of the two techniques. Further­more the load to failure and the number of cycles before failure were deter­mined. Translation and rotation stiffness of the intact pelvis were superior to the fixated pelvis. No difference in stiffness was found between the techniques with one or two sacroiliac screws. However a significantly higher load to failure and significantly more loading cycles before failure could be achieved using two sacroiliac screws compared to one screw. A better grip of the screws was a significant predictor of longer endurance of the fixated pelvis during loading. In this study embalmed aged pelves could be loaded repeatedly with a force which equals the upper body weight in adults. The fact that the average trauma patient is younger, suggests that direct postoperative weight bearing could be possible if these results are confirmed in further research. In chapter six we investigated whether 1 or 2 sacroiliac screws supply addi­tional stiffness to the intact sacroiliac joint, in order to make an estimation of the biomechanical properties of surgical stabilisation of the sacroiliac joint in PLBP patients. In 12 hemipelves baseline measurements of the intact sacroiliac joint without fixation were obtained, after which all sacroiliac joints were fix­ated sequentially with one and with two sacroiliac screws. In 10 cycli each hemipelvis was loaded to a maximum of 400 N. For the technique with two screws a significantly higher translation and rotation stiffness and less displace­ment of the sacroiliac joint were found compared to the baseline. The differ­ence between one screw and the non fixated sacroiliac joint situation was less marked, but still significant for the translation stiffness. The rotation stiffness however showed no difference between one sacroiliac screw and the baseline. No significant difference could be found between the two screw techniques. In chapter seven we report on the functional outcome of internal fixation of the pelvic ring in a group of 58 patients suffering from severe pregnancy-related low back and pelvic pain in whom all conservative treatment has failed. Results were prospectively evaluated with the Majeed score, and endurance of walk-ing, sitting and standing. The surgical technique consisted of a symphysiodesis and bilateral percutaneous placement of two sacroiliac screws under fluoroscopic guidance. With a follow-up of on average 2. 1 years, the difference between pre- and postoperative Majeed score indicated that an improvement of over 10 points was achieved in 69. 8 % and 89. 3 % of the patients at 12 and 24 months respectively. Furthermore, a significant increase was found in walk-ing distance, endurance of sitting and standing and all Majeed score items (pain, work, sitting, sexual intercourse, walking aids, gait unaided and walking dis­tance). Improvement in mobility implied that of the 20 women who were wheel-chair-bound and of the eight women who were bedridden before the opera­tion, only four of the first group and four of the latter were using a wheelchair. The most important complications were irritation of nerve roots (8. 6 %), non union of the symphysis (15. 5 %), failure of the symphyseal plate (3. 4 %) and pulmonary embolism (1. 7 %). In this preliminary study surgical fixation of the pelvic ring yielded satisfactory results in severe PLBP patients in terms of pain relief, and improvement in ADL functions, although these results should be confirmed in a randomised clinical trial. Malpositioning of sacroiliac screws may lead to serious neurological complica­tions due to intrusion of the screws in the sacral foramina or vertebral canal. In chapter eight the <b>safety</b> of sacroiliac <b>screw</b> positioning using peroperative inlet and outlet fluoroscopy is assessed. We compared the correlation between screw position on peroperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiographs and postop­erative CT scan. The radiographs, CT scan and charts from 88 patients, in whom the posterior pelvic ring was stabilised for several indications, were reviewed retrospectively. Seven of the 88 patients had neurological complaints and were reoperated. All complaints resolved completely and no permanent neurologi­cal damage occurred. Positioning both sacroiliac screws in the first vertebral body had a significantly lower rate of neurological complaints compared to positioning the lower screw in the second vertebral body. Malpositioning on CT scan correlated most accurately with neurological complaints, while no cor­relation between peroperative position and neurological deficit was found. 285 screws were reviewed and, depending on the type of imaging (X-ray or CT scan) 2. 1 % to 6. 8 % of the screw showed malpositioning. In several cases the malpositioned screws did not cause any complaints. Postoperative radiographs did not show to have any additional value above peroperative radiographs. In conclusion, percutaneous sacroiliac screws can be positioned safely, in experi­enced hands, without permanent neurological injury. In chapter nine the histological findings of the symphysis pubis of patients with severe pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain are analysed. Traumatic and degenerative changes of the pubic symphysis during and after pregnancy have been described in a few autopsy studies from the first half of the twentieth century, when mortality during pregnancy and labour was not exceptional. The relation of these changes with pelvic pain has never been described. A group of 15 women, who were seriously disabled by pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain, underwent internal fixation of the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints after all other conservative treatment had failed. These were the first patients of the study described in chapter seven. The histological changes of the symphyseal specimens removed during surgical fixation of these patients were compared to the symphysis of five healthy women. Vascular pro­liferation, callus formation, rupture of fibres, disturbance in the orientation of the fibres, and deposition of fibrinous material were seen in patients. A signifi­cant difference between the patients and the control group was found for rup­ture of fibres, and disturbance in the orientation of the fibres. No significant correlations could be detected between any of the pre- and postoperative outcome measures and individual or total histological characteristics. In con­clusion, degenerative changes of the symphysis pubis were found more often in patients with severe pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain than in control women. Finally, recommendations for further research are given in chapter ten. For a highly selected group of women, severely disabled by pregnancy related low back and pelvic pain, the results of surgical fixation of the pelvic ring seem promising in terms of pain relief and increased walking distance. However, these results should be confirmed in a randomised controlled trial. Furthermore, tests with prolonged dynamic loading and clinical studies are required to imple­ment the results of the biomechanical investigations in the postoperative weight bearing regimen for patients with unstable pelvic fractures. In the fu­ture, CT guided navigation and robotic insertion may result in a lower risk of peroperative neurological damage due to more accurate positioning of sacro­iliac screws...|$|R
