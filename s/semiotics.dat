5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called <b>semiotics.</b> Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E

40|$|Panel 3. 27 - Cultural Studies and Modes of Literary KnowledgeThis paper aims at (1) {{rewriting}} the Fredric Jameson’s interpretation of Algirdas Greimas' <b>semiotic</b> square; (2) analyzing “Legend of Purple Hairpin”, {{one of the}} most famous Cantonese Opera in Hong Kong, by using the new interpretation of <b>semiotic</b> square, or <b>Semiotic</b> Table. It is through narrative that the dissemination of value, among human groups and across generations, forms culture. Analyzing narrative is thus an important tool in culture studies. Folklorist Vladimir Propp invented method of narrative analysis which was theorized as “semiotic square”, an underlying structure of signification, by linguist Algirdas Greimas. Applying Greimas' <b>semiotic</b> square, Fredric Jameson is able to analyze ideological practice of text. However, even Fredric Jameson admitted that Greimas' <b>semiotic</b> square is too abstract. The fundamental methodological problem when applying Greimas' <b>semiotic</b> square is that it is intuitional rather than operational. This paper rewrites Greimas' <b>semiotic</b> square as “semiotic table”. Turning to <b>Semiotic</b> table, <b>semiotic</b> square is developed as an operational methodology in cultural studies.

25|$|<b>Semiotics</b> {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within <b>semiotics</b> that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as <b>semiotics</b> of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} software PowerPoint {{has significant}} influence on evaluations of professional and academic success, and has attracted considerable attention from both social commentators and researchers in various fields. Existing research on PowerPoint considers the software, slideshows created with it, and PowerPoint-supported presentations in isolation {{from each other and}} is therefore unable to promote better understanding of the interaction between the software's design and its use. This article proposes a model for exploring this interaction. Specifically, it introduces a multimodal social <b>semiotic</b> approach to studying PowerPoint as a <b>semiotic</b> practice comprising three dimensions - the software's design, the multimodal composition of slideshows, and their presentation - and two <b>semiotic</b> artefacts, the software and the slideshow. It discusses the challenges each dimension presents for discourse analysis and social <b>semiotic</b> research, focusing especially on the need to step away from the notion of text and to develop a holistic, non-logocentric, and adaptive multimodal approach to researching <b>semiotic</b> technologies. Using PowerPoint as a case study, this article takes a step toward developing a social <b>semiotic</b> multimodal theory of the relation between <b>semiotic</b> technologies, or technologies for making meaning, and <b>semiotic</b> practices. 27 page(s...|$|R

Such a model is shown to facilitate the negotiation of a wider range of meanings than otherwise available, particularly revealing underlying assumptions of the model/artist/viewer social relationships. It is concluded that no drawing practice is beyond the realm of the <b>semiotic,</b> and that <b>semiotic</b> analysis is applicable across the whole domain of drawing, including the gestural, as a means of generating meaning...|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, {{at its most}} basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via <b>semiotics</b> – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and <b>semiotics,</b> argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E
50|$|As discourse, an enouncement (statement) {{is not a}} unit of <b>semiotic</b> signs, but an {{abstract}} construct that allows the <b>semiotic</b> signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements.

40|$|<b>Semiotic</b> {{engineering}} {{is based upon}} the <b>semiotic</b> theory of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which focuses on communication between designers and users. <b>Semiotic</b> engineering tries to improve users’ interpretation through meta- communication and emphasizes that designers should play the role of legitimate interlocutors in interactive systems.

In this paper, we explore several contributions of <b>semiotic</b> engineering to software engineering and discuss how the theory can facilitate the creation of comprehensive artifacts.
