Subsequently, a poll was posted on the 2K Games operated Cult of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration. To determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the winning entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.|$|E

25|$|Almost all vipers have keeled scales, {{a stocky}} build {{with a short}} tail, and due to the {{location}} of the venom glands, a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide range of light levels.

The human eye, through adaptation of the iris and other methods, adjusts constantly {{to adapt to a}} broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide range of light conditions.|$|E

25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mental feedback loop.|$|E
25|$|The lack of R18+ and X18+ {{ratings for}} games {{has been the}} subject of {{complaint}} in the gaming community, particularly on the basis that there is no reason why adults should not be able to see content in games that they would <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson who has vetoed every attempt to induce one. Following his resignation after the 2010 South Australian elections there appears to be no likelihood of a future veto in the face of public opinion supporting the new classification. In August 2008, Australian video game show Good Game announced that a meeting of the Attorneys-General in March of that year resulted in a decision that the Australian public would be consulted before a final decision on the status of a R18+ rating for video games would be made.|$|E

500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying [...] "it's a sensual record and I wanted to do something more organic." [...] Describing the album cover, Donwood said: [...] "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a rainbow but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> puddle." [...] The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The [...] "discbox" [...] release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.|$|E
500|$|Thietmar of Merseburg {{writes that}} Stephen {{received}} the crown [...] "with the favour and urging" [...] of Emperor Otto III (r. 996–1002), implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor's suzerainty before his coronation. On the other hand, all of Stephen's legends emphasize {{that he received}} his crown from Pope Sylvester II (r. 999–1003). Kristó and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen [...] "received the crown and consecration" [...] from the Pope, but not without the Emperor's consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1075–1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had [...] "offered and devotedly surrendered" [...] Hungary [...] "to Saint Peter" [...] (that is to the Holy <b>See).</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> contrasting report, Stephen's Greater Legend states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Modern historiansincluding Pál Engel, and Miklós Molnárwrite that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to {{the years of the}} reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his First Book of Laws that he governed his realm [...] "by the will of God".|$|E
