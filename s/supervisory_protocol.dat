It is the simplest of the telephone signaling systems, and uses {{the presence or absence of}} loop current to indicate the off-hook and on-hook loop states, respectively. It is used primarily for subscriber line signaling.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a <b>supervisory</b> <b>protocol</b> that targeted {{preparation of}} behavior support plans by administrative staff {{at a school}} for children with developmental disabilities. Using a multiple baseline design, the protocol was applied sequentially to three components of behavior support plan preparation. Intervention procedures includedgoal specification, action directives, and performance feedback. The administrative <b>supervisory</b> <b>protocol</b> increased and maintained proper completion of the behavior support plan components. Aspects of systems-focused change are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{protocol}} conversion problem requires synthesis of a supervisor {{so that the}} overall system implements a service specication dened over only the external set of events|a partial specication. In this paper we show that by suitably dening a family of marked languages, this problem {{can be reduced to}} the nonblocking supervisory control problem over the entire event set. We show that minimally permissive supervisors for achieving a given service specication need not exist in general. Finally, we present an on-line control computation algorithm of linear complexity that when possible implements the service specication eectively by executing only a minimal controlled plant behavior. Keywords: Discrete event systems, <b>supervisory</b> control, <b>protocol</b> conversion, partial specication 1 Introduction Most research on supervisory control of discrete event systems is concerned with speci- cations on the entire event set over which a given discrete event system evolves. However, in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”In an {{aircraft}} {{electric power system}} (EPS), a super-visory control unit must actuate a set of switches to distribute power from generators to loads, while satisfying safety, reliability and real-time performance requirements. To reduce expensive re-design steps in current design methodologies, such a control problem is generally addressed based on minor incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions, since {{it is difficult to}} estimate the impact of earlier design decisions on the final implementation. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for the design space exploration and virtual prototyping of EPS <b>supervisory</b> control <b>protocols,</b> following the platform-based design (PBD) paradigm. Moreover, we describe the modeling infrastructure that supports the methodology. In PBD, design space exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification towards a final implementation, by mapping higher-level behavioral models into a set of library components at a lower level of abstraction. In our flow, the system specification is captured using SysML requirement and structure diagrams. State-machine diagrams enable verification of the control protocol at a high level of abstraction, while lower-level hybrid models, implemented in Simulink, are used to verify properties related to physical quantities, such as time, voltage and current values. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a prototype EPS control protocol design. I...|$|R
