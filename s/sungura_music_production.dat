40|$|This {{paper is}} lyrical and {{philosophical}} examination on hope and optimistic {{struggle in the}} <b>sungura</b> <b>music</b> of Tongai Moyo (1968 - 2011), a Zimbabwean singer-song writer and musician (guitarist) who produced 14 albums in a career span ning over two decades and thus demonstrated the indispensability of optimistic thriving and victory-centered African consciousness. The argument maintained in the article is that a trajectory of thought that is marked by the necessity of possibility and purposeful human agency is discernible in the music of Tongai Moyo. It is emphasized that Tongai Moyoâ€™s vision as embedded and reflected in his music is rewarding {{for the people of}} Africa, and around the world. It is further argued that Tongai Moyo takes <b>sungura</b> <b>music</b> to greater heights because his art celebrates victorious thought, while castigating pessimism as impoverishing. Last, the article contends that Tongai Moyo was an Afrocentric musician who breaks the seemingly developing trend in <b>sungura</b> <b>music</b> circles where utter pessimism and victimhood are projected as the only condition of life...|$|R

40|$|The Millennials, today’s pupils and students, is {{the first}} {{generation}} {{to grow up with}} tools for interactive communication and media production. Many students choose to study <b>music</b> <b>production</b> in higher education establishments. Therefore <b>music</b> <b>production</b> is an emerging subject and important research topic. The aim of this thesis is to develop knowledge of <b>music</b> <b>production</b> and to identify key skills necessary for music producers and <b>music</b> <b>production</b> teachers. Three sub-studies were performed to investigate what characterizes <b>music</b> <b>production,</b> both in an educational context and as a professional activity. In the first study, a Desktop <b>Music</b> <b>Production</b> project in a municipal music school was investigated. Observations and interviews were used as data collection methods. The results show that teachers need to be multi skilled to teach musicproduction. In addition to standard teaching skills they need to have extensive knowledge of music technology and relevant contemporary knowledge about trends in youth culture and popular music. In the second study students' views on important learning outcomes in <b>music</b> <b>production</b> were investigated. Questionnaires and group interviews were used to collect data. The results show that <b>music</b> <b>production</b> is a topic that includes various types of content. Issues regarding music, technology, music industry, personal development and employability were of central importance to the students. In the third study eleven professionals were interviewed, all <b>music</b> <b>production</b> teachers or active music producers. The main result was that the skills required for both music producers and <b>music</b> <b>production</b> teachers are varied and extensive. Psychology and leadership, music, technology, ethics, law and copyright, entrepreneurship and cultural timing are particularly relevant to <b>music</b> <b>production.</b> Based on these results, a model for education in <b>music</b> <b>production</b> is presented. <b>Music</b> <b>production</b> also differs from traditional music education. In addition to traditional musical and pedagogic skills it requires technical competence from the teachers. Men dominate <b>music</b> <b>production</b> teaching, {{and the vast majority of}} professional music producers are also men. Technological developments are affecting young people's musical skills, and therefore it’s a challenge for music teachers to meet pupils and students who already have advanced knowledge of <b>music</b> <b>production</b> and are eager to learn more...|$|R

This article analyses the various characteristics of electronic dance <b>music</b> <b>production</b> in the cloud that are engaging international collaborators across global space, tracing how shifts away from traditional studio settings have redefined notions of <b>music</b> <b>production,</b> and how new technologies have impacted on interaction between music producers.
