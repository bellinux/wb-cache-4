40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>activity</b> is {{typically}} viewed {{as part of}} an engaged lifestyle that may help mitigate the deleterious effects of advanced age on cognitive function. As such, <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> has been examined in relation to cognitive abilities later in life. However, longitudinal evidence for this hypothesis thus far remains inconclusive. The current study sought to clarify the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> and cognitive function over time using a coordinated data analysis approach across four longitudinal studies. A series of multilevel growth models with <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> included as a covariate is presented. Four domains of cognitive function were assessed: reasoning, memory, fluency, and semantic knowledge. Results suggest that baseline <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> is related to some, but not all, cognitive functions. Baseline <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> levels failed to predict rate of decline in most cognitive abilities. Changes in <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> were not consistently associated with cognitive functioning.

40|$|Contrary to {{the number}} of {{research}} reporting the effects of <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> on cognitive decline and dementia, there is not much known about the influence of <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> on the neuropathology. Therefore, the present study will explore the association between <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> and brain volume and WML, and will verify the association between <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> and cognitive function. The data of the SMART-study is used. Three questions about the frequency of social contact of the participants with neighbors, family and friends formed the factor <b>Social</b> <b>Activity.</b> WML and brain volume was measured and normalized for intracranial volume. Cognition is measured with the 15 -word learning test. Linear regression analysis is used for the statistical analyses. The findings show that people with low levels of <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> with neighbors have larger brain volume (B=. 642; 95 % CI=. 132 to 1. 151 %; p=. 014). People with low levels of <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> with neighbors (B=. 256; 95 % CI=. 004 to. 507 %; p=. 046) and family (B=. 270; 95 % CI=. 022 to. 519 %; p=. 033) have more WML.

These results are compared to people with high levels of <b>Social</b> <b>Activity.</b> The mixed results indicate that social ties influence the relation between <b>Social</b> <b>Activity</b> and brain volume and cognition.

40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to ascertain changes in life and <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> among elderly myocardial infarction (hereafter MI) patients in two years after leaving hospital and to identify their causes. Methods: Ten persons aged over 65 who had the first MI were visited during a period to two years after being released from hospital to carry out a prospective study. A semi-structured interview was conducted and the <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> indicator was used to measure <b>social</b> <b>activity.</b> Results : The score of the <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> indicator was thelowest in the third month after leaving hospital, which then increased up to the twelfth month. However, it dropped two years after leaving hospital. In the high activity level five cases made a good recovery in their <b>social</b> <b>activity</b> and quality oflife. On the other hand, in two cases their recovery remained only at about 5096.

5000|$|In {{the social}} sciences, the term [...] "normative" [...] has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, {{but may also}} relate, in a sociological context, {{to the role of}} {{cultural}} 'norms'; the shared values or institutions that structural functionalists regard as constitutive of the social structure and social cohesion.

His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed <b>social</b> <b>activities</b> with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E
