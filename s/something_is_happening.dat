Stone said, [...] "It's like the parents are all nuts that live in the town. The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is really the only one in town who believes the kids when they say (<b>something)</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening,</b> when the kids are actually right and it's the town that's crazy." [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was also the first episode in which Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mother, was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who was previously a crack whore and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and actually featured on the cover of [...] "Crack Whore Magazine", much to Cartman's shock and dismay.|$|E

6000|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the reference to our perceptions, which introduces an irrelevant psychological suggestion, I will take a different illustration, namely, stellar photography. A photographic plate exposed on a clear night reproduces {{the appearance of the}} portion of the sky concerned, with more or fewer stars according {{to the power of the}} telescope that is being used. Each separate star which is photographed produces its separate effect on the plate, just as it would upon ourselves if we were looking at the sky. If we assume, as science normally does, the continuity of physical processes, we are forced to conclude that, at the place where the plate is, and at all places between it and a star which it photographs, <b>SOMETHING</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> which is specially connected with that star. In the days when the aether was less in doubt, we should have said that what was happening was a certain kind of transverse vibration in the aether. But it is not necessary or desirable to be so explicit: all that we need say is that SOMETHING happens which is specially connected with the star in question. It must be something specially connected with that star, since that star produces its own special effect upon the plate. Whatever it is must be the end of a process which starts from the star and radiates outwards, partly on general grounds of continuity, partly to account for the fact that light is transmitted with a certain definite velocity. We thus arrive at the conclusion that, if a certain star is visible at a certain place, or could be photographed by a sufficiently sensitive plate at that place, <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> there which is specially connected with that star. Therefore in every place at all times a vast multitude of things must be happening, namely, at least one for every physical object which can be seen or photographed from that place. We can classify such happenings on either of two principles: ...|$|E

50|$|Pingelapese is a Micronesian {{language}} spoken on the Pingelap atoll and {{on two of}} the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese utilizes both duplication and triplication of a verb or part of a verb to express that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> for certain duration of time. No reduplication means that something happens. A reduplicated verb means that <b>something</b> <b>IS</b> <b>happening,</b> and a triplication means that something is STILL happening. For example, saeng means ‘to cry’ in Pingelapese. When reduplicated and triplicated, the duration of this verb is changed.|$|E
