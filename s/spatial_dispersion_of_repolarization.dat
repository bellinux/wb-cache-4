40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe study {{compared}} {{the influence of}} sympathetic stimulation on transmural and <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> between LQT 1 and LQT 2 forms of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). BACKGROUNDCardiac events are more associated with sympathetic stimulation in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 or LQT 3 syndrome. Experimental {{studies have suggested that}} the interval between Tpeak and Tend (Tp-e) in the electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects transmural dispersion of repolarization across the ventricular wall. METHODSWe recorded 87 -lead body-surface ECGs before and after epinephrine infusion (0. 1 μg/kg/min) in 13 LQT 1, 6 LQT 2, and 7 control patients. The Q-Tend (QT-e), Q-Tpeak (QT-p), and Tp-e were measured automatically from 87 -lead ECGs, corrected by Bazett’s method (QTc-e, QTc-p, Tcp-e), and averaged among all 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, which reflect the potential from the left ventricular free wall. As an index of <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> the dispersion of QTc-e (QTc-eD) and QTc-p (QTc-pD) were obtained among 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, and were defined as the interval between the maximum and the minimum of the QTc-e and the QTc-p, respectively. RESULTSEpinephrine significantly increased the mean QTc-e but not the mean QTc-p, resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} mean Tcp-e in both LQT 1 and LQT 2, but not in control patients. The epinephrine-induced increases in the mean QTc-e and Tcp-e were larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2, and were more pronounced when the averaged data were obtained from 24 -leads than from 87 -leads. Epinephrine increased the maximum QTc-e but not the minimum QTc-e, producing a significant increase in the QTc-eD in both LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients, but not in control patients. The increase in the QTc-eD was larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 patients. CONCLUSIONSOur data suggest that sympathetic stimulation produces a greater increase in both transmural and <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 syndrome, and this may explain why LQT 1 patients are more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation...|$|E

The corrected RT(RTc) (peak point of the R wave − positive maximum peak of the first derivative of the T wave interval corrected using the Bazett formula) interval and T(peak-end) -c interval from the 187 channels were calculated.

40|$|Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) is a heritable disease {{associated with}} ECG QT interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and {{sudden cardiac death}} in young patients. Among genotyped individuals, mutations in genes encoding repolarizing K+ channels (LQT 1 :KCNQ 1; LQT 2 :KCNH 2) are present in approximately 90 % of affected individuals. Expression of pore mutants of the human genes KCNQ 1 (KvLQT 1 -Y 315 S) and KCNH 2 (HERG-G 628 S) in the rabbit heart produced transgenic rabbits with a long QT phenotype. Prolongations of QT intervals and action potential durations were due to the elimination of IKs and IKr currents in cardiomyocytes. LQT 2 rabbits showed {{a high incidence of}} spontaneous sudden cardiac death (> 50 % at 1 year) due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Optical mapping revealed increased <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> underlying the arrhythmias. Both transgenes caused downregulation of the remaining complementary IKr and IKs without affecting the steady state levels of the native polypeptides. Thus, the elimination of 1 repolarizing current was associated with downregulation of the reciprocal repolarizing current rather than with the compensatory upregulation observed previously in LQTS mouse models. This suggests that mutant KvLQT 1 and HERG interacted with the reciprocal wild-type α subunits of rabbit ERG and KvLQT 1, respectively.

Design. Monophasic action potential (MAP) were sequentially recorded from 28 Â± 3 sites in seven different regional areas of the right atrium: lateral, anterior and posterior wall, septum, sinoatrial node (SAN), appendage, and near the tricuspid annulus (TA) in 10 healthy pigs using the CARTO mapping system. Results. The activation time (AT), MAP duration (MAPd) and end <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time (EOR) <b>of</b> the whole right atrium were 68 Â± 7, 239 Â± 20 and 270 Â± 23 ms, respectively.

40|$|<b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time (or {{recovery}} time) {{is known}} to be pro-arrhythmic, but not much is known about the rate-dependency <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> in <b>repolarization</b> time. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how heterogeneity in structure and function influence the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time following normal and premature beats in simulated human left ventricular tissue. The modelling tools were (1) geometrical models of tissue and fibre; (2) two cell models including a simple and a biophysically detailed human ventricular cell models; and (3) a monodomain model of ventricular tissue. During decreasing stimulus (S 1 S 2) intervals, dispersion in repolarization time remained constant for normal beats while changed greatly for premature beats. In 2 D tissue with structural discontinuities and no fibre orientation, the structural discontinuity was found to produce increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> and slowing <b>of</b> propagation in the region between two structural discontinuities. In 3 D tissue with functional heterogeneity (including a linear or a non-linear change in fibre orientation), the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time produced at different S 1 S 2 intervals depended on the differences in local restitution. Thus longer S 1 S 2 intervals could produce greater <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time than shorter S 1 S 2 intervals. Speed of depolarization conduction was also depended on the differences in local restitution. Therefore, combination of anisotropy and fibrosis could suppress the speed of depolarization conduction for premature beats in the mid-myocardial region of heterogeneous tissues composed of three ventricular cell types. The results suggest that 3 D cubes of anisotropic fibrosis heterogeneous tissue may promote tissue vulnerably to ventricular arrhythmia. In an anatomically detailed left ventricular wedge with functional heterogeneity, long and short S 1 S 2 intervals could produce greater <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time than 3 D cubes of tissues. These simulations have implications for our understanding of arrhythmias in the whole heart. Restitution profiles <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time and profiles <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> in <b>repolarization</b> time (not action potential duration) may be used for estimating abnormal changes in <b>repolarization</b> time <b>of</b> premature beats and arrhythmia risk. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{nifekalant}} hydrochloride (NIF) {{has been}} demonstrated to suppress ventricular tachyarrhythmias, especially electrical storms, the mechanism by which it does so is still unclear. We {{examined the effects of}} NIF on the <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> (SDR) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock. Methods and Results: In 35 patients with oral amiodarone and β-blocker therapy, and an ICD, we recorded the 87 -lead electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm (CONTROL- 1 group) under general anesthesia, and just after the termination of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) by ICD shock, with or without NIF administration. In all recordings, the corrected QT interval (QTc) was measured in each lead. The dispersion of QTc (QTc-D; maximum QTc minus minimum QTc) was also measured. Compared with that in the CONTROL- 1 group, the QTc-D exhibited significant deterioration after ICD shock (61 ± 14 and 90 ± 19  ms 1 / 2, respectively; p< 0. 05). However, after the termination of induced VF by ICD shock with NIF administration, the QTc-D did not differ significantly from that in the CONTROL- 1 group (63 ± 20 and 61 ± 14  ms 1 / 2, respectively). Conclusions: NIF suppressed the deterioration of the SDR after ICD shock.

40|$|Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a {{life-threatening}} arrhythmia that develops {{as a consequence}} of a reduction in the repolarization reserve of cardiac cells leading to amplification of electrical heterogeneities in the ventricular myocardium {{as well as to the}} development of early afterdepolarization-induced triggered activity. Electrical heterogeneities within the ventricles are due to differences in the time course of repolarization of the three predominant cell types that make up the ventricular myocardium, giving rise to transmural voltage gradients and a dispersion of repolarization that contributes to the inscription of the electrocardiographic T wave. A number of non-antiarrhythmic drugs and antiarrhythmic agents with class III actions and/or the various mutations and cardiomyopathies associated with the long QT syndrome reduce net repolarizing current and amplify <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> thus creating the substrate for re-entry. This results in a prolongation of the QT interval, abnormal T waves, and development of TdP. Agents that prolong the QT interval but do not cause an increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) do not induce TdP, suggesting that QT prolongation is not the sole or optimal determinant for arrhythmogenesis.

40|$|Sympathetic {{activity}} and <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> (DOR) have been implicated as mechanisms that promote arrhythmia vulnerability {{yet there are}} no direct measurements {{of the effects of}} autonomic nerve stimulation on DOR. Rabbit hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus with full sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, and were optically mapped to measure action potential durations (APDs) and DOR (Apex-Base) over the left ventricles. DOR was measured under sinus rhythm, during bilateral sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) and right and/or left vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and was compared to DOR during isoproterenol (100 nM) or acetylcholine (1 μM) infusion. In sinus rhythm, repolarization started at the apex and systematically progressed towards the base. SNS (10 – 15 Hz) increased DOR by 29 % (from ΔAPD = 17 ± 0. 7 to − 22 ± 1. 6 ms, n= 6) and reversed DOR as the direction of repolarization from apex → base in sinus rhythm shifted to base → apex in 5 – 15 s after SNS. DOR flipped-back to its sinus rhythm DOR pattern 115 ± 15 s after the interruption of SNS. During right or left VNS, there was no change in the direction of DOR but bilateral VNS increased and reversed DOR to base → apex direction. Infusion of isoproterenol or acetylcholine increased DOR but did not alter the direction of repolarization sequences. These findings demonstrate that bilateral autonomic activity (SNS or VNS) cause reversible shifts of apex-base DOR and that the spatial heterogeneities of autonomic effects on the ventricles are most likely due to a greater innervation at the base than the apex of the heart...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concept that}} the {{interval}} between the peak (T(peak)) and the end (T(end)) of the T wave (T(p-e)) is a measure <b>of</b> transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time is widely accepted but has not been tested rigorously by transmural mapping of the intact heart. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the relationship of T(p-e) to transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> by correlating local repolarization times at endocardial, midmural, and epicardial sites in the left and right ventricles with the T wave of the ECG. METHODS: Local activation times, activation-recovery intervals, and repolarization times were measured at 98 epicardial sites and up to 120 midmural and endocardial sites in eight open-chest dogs. In four of the dogs, long-term cardiac memory was induced by 3 weeks of ventricular pacing at 130 bpm because previous data suggest that, in this setting, delayed epicardial repolarization increases transmural dispersion. The other four dogs were sham operated. RESULTS: In sham dogs, T(p-e) was 41 +/- 2. 2 ms (X +/- SEM), whereas the transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time was 2. 7 +/- 4. 2 ms (not significant between endocardium and epicardium). Cardiac memory was associated with evolution of a transmural gradient of 14. 5 +/- 1. 9 ms (P <. 02), with epicardium repolarizing later than endocardium. The corresponding T(p-e) was 43 +/- 2. 3 ms (not different from sham). In combined sham and memory dogs, T(p-e) intervals did not correlate with transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> times. In contrast, <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> <b>of</b> the whole heart (measured as the difference between the earliest and the latest moment <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> from all left and right ventricular, endocardial, intramural, and epicardial recording sites) did correlate with T(p-e) (P <. 0005, r = 0. 98), although the latter underestimated total repolarization time by approximately 35 %. The explanation for this finding is that parts of the heart fully repolarize before the moment of T(peak).

BackgroundElevated levels of air pollution are associated with cardiac arrhythmias through mechanisms yet to be elucidated. MethodsEach of 25 volunteers (18 to 50 years of age) had four 2 -h exposures to 150 μg/m 3 CAP; 120 parts per billion O 3; CAP + O 3; and filtered air (FA). Exposure-induced changes (Δ = 5 -min epochs at end-start) in <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> were determined from continuous 12 -lead electrocardiographic recording. ResultsSpatial dispersion of repolarization assessed by corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval increased significantly for CAP + O 3 (0. 17 ± 0. 03, p < 0. 0001) exposure only, remaining significant when factoring FA (CAP + O 3 − FA) as control (0. 11 ± 0. 04, p = 0. 013). The influence on repolarization was further verified by {{a significant increase in}} ΔQT dispersion (for CAP + O 3 compared with FA (5. 7 ± 1. 4, p = 0. 0002). When the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio of heart rate variability (a conventional representation of sympathetic-parasympathetic balances) was included as a covariate, the effect estimate was positive for both corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval (p = 0. 002) and ΔQT dispersion (p = 0. 038). When the high-frequency component (parasympathetic heart rate modulation) was included as a covariate with corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval, the effect estimate for high frequency was inverse (p = 0. 02). ConclusionsCAP + O 3 exposure alters dispersion of ventricular repolarization in part by increasing sympathetic and decreasing parasympathetic heart rate modulation. Detection of changes in repolarization parameters, even in this small cohort of healthy individuals, suggests an underappreciated role for air pollutants in urban arrhythmogenesis...|$|E

BackgroundThe LQT 1 form is more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation and more responsive to beta-blockers than either the LQT 2 or LQT 3 forms. MethodsEighty-seven-lead, body-surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded before and after epinephrine infusion (0. 1 μg/kg body weight per min) in the absence and presence of oral propranolol (0. 5 – 2. 0 mg/kg per day) in 11 LQT 1 patients and 11 LQT 2 patients. The Q-Tendinterval, the Q-Tpeakinterval and the interval between Tpeakand Tend(Tp-e), representing TDR, were measured and averaged from 87 -lead ECGs and corrected by Bazett’s method (corrected Q-Tendinterval [cQTe], corrected Q-Tpeakinterval [cQTp] and corrected interval between Tpeakand Tend[cTp-e]). The dispersion of cQTe(cQTe-D) was obtained among 87 leads and {{was defined as the}} interval between the maximum and minimum values of cQTe. ResultsPropranolol in the absence of epinephrine significantly prolonged the mean cQTpvalue but not the mean cQTevalue, thus decreasing the mean cTp-evalue in both LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients; the differences with propranolol were significantly larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 (p < 0. 05). The maximum cQTe, minimum cQTeand cQTe-D were not changed with propranolol. Propranolol completely suppressed the influence of epinephrine in prolonging the mean cQTe, maximum cQTeand minimum cQTevalues, as well as increasing the mean cTp-eand cQTe-D values in both groups. ConclusionsBeta-blockade under normal sympathetic tone produces a greater decrease in TDR in the LQT 1 form than in the LQT 2 form, explaining the superior effectiveness of beta-blockers in LQT 1 versus LQT 2. Beta-blockers also suppress the influence of sympathetic stimulation in increasing TDR and SDR equally in LQT 1 and LQT 2 syndrome...|$|E

Tight coupling between activation times (AT) and action potential duration (APD) were observed in rat experiments but not in pig. Linear correlation analysis found slopes of - 1. 03 ± 0. 59 and - 0. 26 ± 0. 13 for rat and pig, respectively (p < 0. 0001). In rat, maximal dispersion of APD was 11. 0 ± 3. 1 ms but dispersion of repolarization time (RT) was relatively homogeneous (8. 2 ± 2. 7, p < 0. 0001). However, in pig no such difference was observed between the dispersion of APD and RT (17. 8 ± 6. 1 vs. 17. 7 ± 6. 5, respectively). Localized elevations of APD (12. 9 ± 8. 3 %) were identified at ventricular insertion sites of rat hearts both in experiments and simulations. Tissue geometry and action potential (AP) morphology contributed significantly to determining influence of electrotonic modulation. Simulations of a rat AP in a pig geometry decreased the slope of AT and APD relationships by 70. 6 % whereas slopes were increased by 75. 0 % when implementing a pig AP in a rat geometry. A modified pig AP, shortened to match the rat APD, showed little coupling between AT and APD with greatly reduced slope compared to the rat AP. Electrotonic modulation of repolarization by the activation sequence is especially pronounced in small hearts with murine-like APs. Tissue architecture and AP morphology play an important role in electrotonic modulation of repolarization...|$|E

We have correlated the ventricular repolarization sequence with simultaneously recorded T waves. Nine pig hearts were Langendorff-perfused (atrial pacing, cycle length 650 ms). Local activation and repolarization times were derived from unipolar electrograms sampling the ventricular myocardium. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time was determined along 4 anatomic axes: left ventricle (LV) -right ventricle (RV), LV:apico-basal, LV:anterior-posterior, and LV:transmural. The heart was immersed in a fluid-filled bucket containing 61 electrodes to determine Tp (Tpeak in lead of maximum integral), TpTe (Tp to Tend), and TpTe_total (first Tpeak in any lead to last Tend in any lead). Repolarization was nonlinearly distributed in time. RT 25 (time at which 25 % of sites were repolarized, 288 ± 26 ms) concurred with Tp. TpTe was 38 ± 8 ms, and TpTe_total was 75 ± 9 ms. TpTe_total correlated with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time in the entire heart (73 ± 18 ms), but not with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> times along individual axes (LV-RV, 66 ± 17 ms; LV:apico-basal, 51 ± 18 ms; LV:anterior-posterior, 51 ± 27 ms; mean LV:transmural, 14 ± 7 ms; all n= 9).

The heart {{functions as a}} mechanical pump that propels blood through the circulatory system. Blood flows from the body into the right atrium, {{and then into the}} right ventricle where it gets pumped into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. Blood gets oxygenated in the lungs, flows into the left atrium, and then into the left ventricle where it gets pumped through the aorta to different organs of the body. Ventricular fibrillation (VF), identified as disorganized and ineffective quiver of the ventricles, is the most serious ventricular arrhythmias. When VF occurs, the heart is unable to pump blood. Sudden cardiac arrest follows. About 220, 000 deaths from heart attacks in the United States each year are thought to be caused by VF. Alternans, a periodic beat-to-beat short-long alternation in action potential duration (APD), {{is considered to be a}} precursor of VF. In extended cardiac tissue, electrical alternans can be either spatially concordant (SCA, all cells oscillate in phase) or spatially discordant (SDA, cells in different regions oscillate out of phase). SDA gives rise to an increase in the <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> which is thought to be proarrhythmic. In this dissertation, I use a mapping model with two beats of memory, a simple but powerful tool to study cardiac dynamics and their relation to VF at the level of single cell and a spatially coupled cell strand. Ventricular myocytes are connected electrically by gap junction channels formed mainly by connexin 43 (Cx 43) and, to a smaller extent, Cx 45. Decreased and heterogeneous expression of Cx 43 is a common feature in animal heart failure models. Ephaptic coupling is an electric field mechanism of propagation. It relies on the presence of narrow cleft space between neighboring cells, which is resistively connected to the extracellular space. Emerging evidence suggests a more active role for ephaptic coupling in mediating intercellular electrical communication when gap junctions are reduced in a homogeneous manner. Here, I explore the effect of ephaptic coupling when Cx 43 expression is reduced in a heterogeneous fashion. For this purpose, I use a physiologically detailed ionic channel model with their gating kinetics applied in a two dimensional tissue model of electrically coupled cardiac cells...|$|E

Diabetic patients have increased cardiovascular mortality, in which malignant ventricular arrhythmias seem to be implicated. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of diabetes on ventricular repolarization parameters responsible for an increased susceptibility to malignant ventricular arrhythmias and/or sudden death. METHODS: We selected a group of 110 diabetic patients and a group of 110 controls with the same distribution of age, gender and race.

40|$|Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is a {{ventricular}} tachycardia {{that can result}} in sudden death. Risk factors include the congenital long QT syndrome, but also acquired factors including drugs that prolong the repolarization (QT interval). If concerns exist about the cardiac safety of (novel) drug, an animal model {{can be used to}} further evaluate the cardiac safety. An example is the canine chronic complete AV-block model, which is used in this thesis. In this model, artificially complete AV-block is created by radiofrequency ablation. The resulting idioventricular rhythm is much slower than the sinus rate (bradycardia), but also causes an abnormal ventricular activation pattern and AV-dyssynchrony. This results in an acute drop in cardiac output. This is almost completely restored on the long-term, associated with ventricular remodeling. The ventricular remodeling includes structural, contractile and electrophysiological adaptations of the myocardium and is linked to an enhanced susceptibility to TdP. After remodeling, under general anesthesia, administration of a class III anti-arrhythmic drug (dofetilide) causes TdP in about 75 % of the dogs. Only recently it was shown that not only bradycardia, but also the abnormal ventricular activation plays a role in electrical remodeling and arrhythmogenesis. Most important aim of this thesis was to further explore the role of abnormal ventricular activation. First, the proarrhythmic effect of the combination of bradycardia and chronic, dyssynchronous ventricular activation (DVA) was investigated. For this purpose AV-block was created, followed by right ventricular apical pacing at lowest captured rate. After a remodeling period, dofetilide induced TdP in 75 % of the dogs, which is comparable to what is normally observed dogs with chronic idioventricular rhythm. In a subsequent study the effect of DVA in absence of chronic bradycardia was studied. This also increased the susceptibility to dofetilide-induced TdP. DVA adversely affects the mechanical function of the heart and therefore currently cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is widely used as a treatment of DVA due to left bundle branch block in patients with chronic heart failure. CRT is applied by biventricular pacing using a conventional right ventricular lead and an additional lead positioned in the latest activated left ventricular area. This results in a more synchronous activation pattern and improves the left ventricular mechanical function. We studied the effects of CRT on electrical remodeling and arrhythmogenesis of TdP in the dogs with chronic DVA and found that chronic CRT could reverse the DVA induced increased susceptibility to TdP. The DVA-induced electrical remodeling was different than expected. The considerable increased susceptibility to TdP caused by the combination of DVA and bradycardia was not associated with a significant prolongation of QT interval and beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (an important predictor of TdP in the model of dogs with AV-block). However, in an additional mapping study prolongation of repolarization in the left ventricle was found, but this was limited to the early-activated regions. As a consequence this is masked if the QT is measured. Interestingly, the induction of ectopic beats in this experiment could be linked to large local (<b>spatial)</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> suggesting that spatial dispersion was involved in the arrhythmogenesis of the ectopic beats...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between key {{features of the}} cardiac electrical activity, such as electrical restitution, discordant alternans, wavebreak, and reentry, and the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been characterized extensively under the condition of constant rapid pacing. However, {{it is unlikely that}} this scenario applies directly to the clinical situation, where the induction of ventricular tachycardia (VT) typically is associated with the interruption of normal cardiac rhythm by several premature beats. To address this issue, we have developed a general theory to explain why specific patterns of premature stimuli increase dynamic heterogeneity of repolarization and precipitate conduction block. The theory predicts that conduction block is caused by (1) creation of a spatial gradient in diastolic interval (DI) by waves traveling at slightly different velocities (ie, conduction velocity dispersion) and (2) amplification of the spatial gradient in DI over subsequent action potentials, secondary to a strong dependence of action potential duration on the preceding DI (ie, a steep action potential duration restitution function). Tests of this theory have been conducted in computer models of homogeneous tissue, where increased <b>spatial</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> during premature stimulation can be attributed solely to the development of dynamical heterogeneity, and in a canine model exhibiting spontaneously occurring VT and sudden death. Our results thus far indicate that the probability of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the animal model is highest for those sequences predicted to cause conduction block in the computer model. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying these observations will help to identify key electrical phenomena in the onset of VT and fibrillation. Drug and electrical therapies can then be improved by targeting these specific phenomena. Accession Number: 17993329. Language: English. Language Code: eng. Date Revised: 20100916.
