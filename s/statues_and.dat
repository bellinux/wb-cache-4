Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitian's silver and gold <b>statues,</b> <b>and</b> Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor.|$|E

5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} {{policies were}} {{closely associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the <b>statues</b> <b>and</b> having them melted for immediate minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors.

In his own palace, <b>statues</b> <b>and</b> portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as <b>statues</b> <b>and</b> portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the <b>statues</b> <b>and</b> panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of.

To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E

In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
