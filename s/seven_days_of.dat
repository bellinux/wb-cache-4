5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> 940mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1982, Vulcan XM597 broke its probe while {{attempting}} to refuel in flight, while returning from a mission over the Falkland Islands. With insufficient fuel to reach its base on Ascension Island, the pilot discarded classified information over the Atlantic Ocean and diverted to Rio de Janeiro. Shortly after entering Brazilian airspace, the Brazilian Air Force sent two Northrop F-5s to escort the British plane until it landed on Galeão Air Force Base. This led to high-level diplomatic talks between the UK and Brazil, which remained neutral during the Falklands War. After <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> detainment, the Vulcan and its crew were allowed to return home {{on the condition that}} XM597 played no further part in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bioweapons that caused the <b>Seven</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems poised to attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides {{it away from the}} village.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. <b>Seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Since West Virginia was {{admitted}} to the Union on June 20, 1863, during the American Civil War, 34 men have served as governor. Two, Arch A. Moore Jr. (West Virginia's 28th and 30th governor) and Cecil H. Underwood (West Virginia's 25th and 32nd governor), served two nonconsecutive terms in office. The longest-serving governor was Moore, who served for three terms over twelve years. The state's first governor, Arthur I. Boreman, served the most consecutive terms, resigning a week before the end of his third term. Daniel D.T. Farnsworth was Senate President at the time; he filled the last <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Boreman's term and remains the shortest-serving governor. Underwood has the unusual distinction of being both the youngest person to be elected as governor (age 34 upon his first term in 1957) and the oldest to both be elected and serve (age 74 upon his second term in 1997; age 78 {{at the end of his}} second term in 2001).|$|E

5|$|The 11.73 {{million people}} tuned into the episode marked a 3percent viewership {{increase}} from the season eight finale (11.44 million), and a 13percent {{increase from the}} previous season premiere (10.38million). The episode's 4.4 Nielsen rating in the 18–49demographic was a 7percent increase from the season eight finale and previous season premiere, which both received 4.1 18–49 ratings. The Nielsen score additionally registered the show as the week's highest rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18–49demographic, placing behind CBS's The Big Bang Theory (5.0) and ABC's Modern Family (5.5). <b>Seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> time-shifted viewing added on an additional 1.5 rating points in the 18–49demographic and 3.28 million viewers, bringing the total viewership for the episode to 15.01 million viewers with a 5.9 Nielsen rating in the 18–49demographic.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire {{victories}} {{during the}} Third Transjordan attack {{resulted in the}} occupation of many miles of Ottoman territory and the capture of the equivalent of one Ottoman corps. Meanwhile, {{the remnants of the}} Fourth Army were forced to retreat in disarray north to Damascus, along with the remnants of the Seventh and Eighth Armies after the EEF victories during the Battle of Sharon and Battle of Nablus. Fighting extended from the Mediterranean Sea during these <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> battle, resulting in the capture of many thousands of prisoners, and extensive territory. After several days pursuing remnant columns, Desert Mounted Corps captured Damascus on 1 October. The surviving remnants of Yildirim Army Group which escaped Damascus were pursued north during the Pursuit to Haritan when Homs was occupied and Aleppo was captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Army Force. Soon after, on 30 October, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, ending the Sinai and Palestine campaign.|$|E
5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> consumption.|$|E

5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>seven</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> its release, The Last of Us {{sold over}} 1.3 million units, {{becoming}} the biggest video game launch of 2013 at the time. Three weeks after its release, the game sold over 3.4 million units, and was deemed the biggest launch of an original game since 2011's L.A. Noire and the fastest-selling PlayStation 3 game of 2013 at the time. The game became the best-selling digital release on PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3, though numerical sales figures were not disclosed; this record was later beaten by Grand Theft Auto V. The Last of Us ultimately became the tenth best-selling game of 2013. By August 2014, the game had sold eight million copies: seven million on PlayStation 3 and one million on PlayStation 4. It {{is the third}} best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time. In the United Kingdom, the game remained atop the charts for six consecutive weeks, matching records set by multi-platform titles. Within 48 hours of its release, The Last of Us generated more than the £3 million earned by Man of Steel in the same period. The game also topped the charts in the United States, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Spain, and Japan.|$|E
