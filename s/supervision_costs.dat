On the other hand, with modular construction, walls, floors, ceilings, and rafters are all built at the same time, and then brought together in the same factory to form a building. This process can allow modular construction times of half that of conventional, stick-built construction.|$|E

Existing state-of-the-art approaches demand extensive amount of supervised training data from trained pathologists. In this work we synthesize in an unsupervised manner, large histopathology image datasets, suitable for supervised training tasks. We propose a unified pipeline that: a) generates a set of initial synthetic histopathology images with paired information about the nuclei such as segmentation masks; b) refines the initial synthetic images through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to reference styles; c) trains a task-specific CNN and boosts the performance of the task-specific CNN with on-the-fly generated adversarial examples. Our main contribution is that the synthetic images are not only realistic, but also representative (in reference styles) and relatively challenging for training task-specific CNNs. We test our method for nucleus segmentation using images from four cancer types. When no supervised data exists for a cancer type, our method without <b>supervision</b> <b>cost</b> significantly outperforms supervised methods which perform across-cancer generalization.

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>supervision</b> <b>costs,</b> the labor {{cost of an}} enterprise (plantation) in the system of slavery consists {{of the cost of}} acquiring the slaves and the subsistence compensation given out to the slaves. In this paper, we leave aside the issue of <b>supervision</b> <b>costs</b> previously taken up in the theoretical literature on slavery, and focus on these two peculiar components of labor costs. We analyze the implications of this cost structure on the levels of profitability, efficiency and determination of equilibrium wages, and compare them to systems with free labor markets, along a continuum of demand side Cournotic competition. For this purpose, we first use a model characterized by a decreasing returns to scale technology, and show, parallel to the findings of Vedder, et. al. (1990), that the equilibrium subsistence wage in the system of slavery is strictly lower than the marginal product of labor. We then extend the model, given the same technology and preferences, to free labor markets covering possibilities ranging from monopsony to perfect competition in the limit, and obtain a second and perhaps more striking result: Differently from equilibria in imperfectly competitive free labor markets, slavery and perfect competition equilibria are Pareto optimal. Furthermore, our comparisons across labor market scenarios suggest that the resistance of slaveholders to the abolishment of slavery {{is directly related to the}} expected level of demand side competition in the free labor market which would replace slavery. Finally, we show that the conclusions derived from our analysis would remain generally valid under a constant returns to scale technology as well.

40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including <b>supervision</b> <b>costs.</b> These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} <b>supervision</b> <b>costs</b> of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a motor pump is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a motor pump and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a motor pump. While on plots without a motor pump the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a motor pump, the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a motor pump drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, contract, supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E

30|$|Firm’s {{characteristics}} such as firm age and size are the main factors in determining the credit rationing. In general, firm age is considered as a key indicator of a firm’s quality since its longevity {{is an indication of}} survival ability, quality management and increased positive image (Diamond 1991). In the credit market, FIs do not prefer young firms as borrower because information asymmetry between financial institutions and young firms is more critical as banks do not have enough time to monitor such type of firms. Moreover, the young firms have relatively less opportunity to build up a good relationship with fund suppliers. An empirical study from Dunkelberg (1998) shows that due to less reputation and credit constraint, the information asymmetries of young firms are growing. To assess the creditworthiness, young firms are in difficult position for their poor image and goodwill. In addition, young firms have the high probability to be the default for high <b>supervision</b> <b>cost</b> and lower collateral values (Boocock and Woods 1997). Thus, relatively the new and younger firms use fewer FIs’s loan than older firms (Nichter and Goldmark 2009) due to fear of losing their collateral or they have enough fund.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} shared {{services}} has been heavily promoted by UK central government, reportedly offering {{a mechanism to}} reduce costs and improve service performance. This advocacy of shared services has advanced ahead of academic research and evidence. This thesis aims to assess whether using this model results in reduced costs and improved performance in local government. A theory-driven research framework is {{used to assess the}} impact of using this form of partnership. The dominant theoretical rationale underpinning shared services is the intention to create a partnership to generate economies of scale, achieving reduced costs and improved performance. The model is thought to benefit from effective relationships which reduce <b>supervision</b> <b>costs,</b> and is dependent on effective implementation processes. The research project also incorporates counter-perspectives, which suggest there are limits to economies of scale, and potential challenges to the partnership relationship. The findings of the study indicate that, firstly, in comparison with other models of service delivery, clients of shared services report a more negative perception of performance. Secondly, it seems respondents in those authorities using shared services extensively are more likely to perceive that performance has declined. Thirdly, qualitative data indicate that shared corporate services have been implemented in a limited form, most often constituting a shared management arrangement, perceived to deliver cost reduction but with little evidence of performance improvement. Finally, the findings offer limited evidence of economies of scale, although the data provides some support for the notion that high-trust partnership relationships can reduce <b>supervision</b> <b>costs,</b> and conversely, finding that partnership working can also result in disruption or dysfunction which may bring the partnership to an end. The thesis offers recommendations for theory, research and policy.

To this end, {{there has been some}} success in recognition of simple objects and actions in video; however most of this work requires strongly supervised training data. The <b>supervision</b> <b>cost</b> of these approaches therefore renders them economically non-scalable for real world applications. In this paper we address the problem of learning to annotate and retrieve semantic tags of human actions in realistic video data with sparsely provided tags of semantically salient activities. This is challenging because of (1) the multi-label nature of the learning problem and (2) realistic videos are often dominated by (semantically uninteresting) background activity un-supported by any tags of interest, leading to a strong irrelevant data problem. To address these challenges, we introduce a new topic model based approach to video tag annotation. Our model simultaneously learns a low dimensional representation of the video data, which dimensions are semantically relevant (supported by tags), and how to annotate videos with tags. Experimental evaluation on three different video action/activity datasets demonstrate the challenge of this problem, and value of our contribution.
