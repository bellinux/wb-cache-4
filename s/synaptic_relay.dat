The cardiovascular response to L-glu {{stimulation of the}} LH was blocked by pretreatment of the ventrolateral portion of the periaqueductal gray matter (vIPAG) with CoCl(2) (1 mM/ 100 nL), indicating {{the existence of a}} <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay</b> of the hypotensive pathway in that area. Furthermore, the response to L-glu Was blocked by pretreatment of the vIPAG with 2 nmol/ 100 nL of the selective NMDA-receptor antagonist LY 235959 and was not affected by pretreatment with 2 nmol/ 100 nL of the selective non-NMDA-receptor antagonist NBQX, suggesting a mediation of the hypotensive response by NMDA receptors in the APAG.

40|$|Paired, {{simultaneous}} recordings {{were made}} in anaesthetized cats from the peripheral and central axons of individual tactile and kinaesthetic sensory fibres. The aim {{was to determine whether}} failure of spike propagation occurred at any of the three major axonal branch points in the path to their cuneate target neurones, and whether propagation failure may contribute, along with synaptic transmission failures, to limitations in transmission security observed for the cuneate <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay.</b> No evidence for propagation failure was found at the two major axonal branch points prior to the cuneate nucleus, namely, the T-junction at the dorsal root ganglion, and the major branch point near the cord entry point, even for the highest impulse rates (∼ 400 impulses s− 1) at which these fibres could be driven. However, at the highest impulse rates there was evidence at the central, intra-cuneate recording site of switching between two states in the terminal axonal spike configuration. This appears to reflect a sporadic propagation failure into one of the terminal branches of the sensory axon. In conclusion, it appears that central impulse propagation over group II sensory axons occurs with complete security through branch points within the dorsal root ganglion and at the spinal cord entry zone. However, at high rates of afferent drive, terminal axonal propagation failure may contribute to the observed decline in transmission security within the cuneate <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay...</b>|$|E

40|$|Some {{processes}} in nervous tissue are essentially discontinuous in nature, others, like heat {{and carbon dioxide}} production, and positive after-potential, are cumulative; they tend to develop in some relation {{to the number of}} impulses carried, not infrequently to appear in measurable form only after a number of actions have been compressed into a limited time. In such conditions of activity not only are cumulative processes demonstrable in nerve, but indications of their influence may be found in the altered responsiveness of simple <b>synaptic</b> <b>relays</b> and of neuromuscular junctions. The usual sequel to a period of tetanic stimulation in junctional tissues is a more or less prolonged increase in the transmitted response to standard, iterative, but infrequently elicited pre-junctional nerve volleys into which train of volleys the tetanus has been interpolated (2, 7, 10, 11, 23, 35, etc.). The observed phenomena have been called post-tetanic facilitation, or post-tetanic potentiation; the latter designation is to be preferred.

40|$|The {{question}} whether general tetanus {{arises from the}} independent sum of multiple local tetani or results from {{the actions of the}} transynaptic tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) in higher brain centres remains unresolved. Despite the blood-borne dissemination of TeNT from an infected wound, the access to the central nervous system is probably prevented by the blood–brain barrier. However, several long-term sequelae (e. g. autonomic dysfunction, seizures, myoclonus, and sleep disturbances) present after the subsidence of muscle spasms might be indicative of central actions that occur farther away from lower motoneurons. Subsequently, the obvious entry route is the peripheral neurons followed by the transynaptic passage to the brain. We aimed at describing the pathophysiological correlates of TeNT translocation using the oculomotor system as a comprehensive model of cell connectivity and neuronal firing properties. In this study, we report that injection of TeNT into the medial rectus muscle of one eye resulted in bilateral gaze palsy attributed to firing alterations found in the contralaterally projecting abducens internuclear neurons. Functional alterations in the abducens-to-oculomotor internuclear pathway resembled in part the classically described TeNT disinhibition. We confirmed the transynaptic targeted action of TeNT by analysing vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP 2) immunoreactivity (the SNARE protein cleaved by TeNT). VAMP 2 immunoreactivity decreased by 94. 4 % in the oculomotor nucleus (the first <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay)</b> and by 62. 1 % presynaptic to abducens neurons (the second <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay).</b> Thes...|$|E

40|$|Male moths {{possess a}} highly {{specialized}} olfactory system comprised of two segregated sub-arrangements dedicated to processing information about plant odors and pheromones, respectively. Communication {{between these two}} sub-systems has been described at the peripheral level, but relatively {{little is known about}} putative interactions at subsequent <b>synaptic</b> <b>relays.</b> The male moth faces the challenge of seeking out the conspecific female in a highly dynamic odor world. The female-produced pheromone blend, which is a limited resource serving as guidance for the male, will reach his antennae in intermittent pockets of odor filaments mixed with volatiles from various plants. In the present study we performed calcium imaging for measuring odor-evoked responses in the uni-glomerular antennal-lobe projection neurons (analog to mitral cells in the vertebrate olfactory bulb) of Helicoverpa armigera. In order to investigate putative interactions between the two sub-systems tuned to plant volatiles and pheromones, respectively, we performed repeated stimulations with a selection of biologically relevant odors. We found that paired stimulation with a plant odor and the pheromone led to suppressed responses in both sub-systems as compared to those evoked during initial stimulation including application of each odor stimulus alone. The fact that the suppression persisted also after pairing, indicates the existence of a Hebbian-like plasticity in the primary olfactory center established by temporal pairing of the two odor stimulation categories...|$|R
40|$|Although {{stimulation}} of cutaneous limb afferents {{has been shown}} to evoke crossed extension reflexes in unanaesthetised decerebrate or spinalised animals, here we show that {{stimulation of}} cutaneous nerves evokes crossed inhibition rather than excitation of contralateral extensor motoneurones in anaesthetised, spinal cord intact cats. Single pulse stimuli delivered to the saphenous, sural or superficial peroneal nerves evoked IPSPs in a high proportion of contralateral motoneurones including those of knee and ankle extensors. These IPSPs had thresholds of less than 1. 5 times the threshold of the most excitable fibres and so large myelinated afferents contributed to them. The relative latencies of IPSPs evoked by stimulation of the contralateral superficial peroneal and sural nerves were longer than those evoked via ipsilateral pathways by approximately 1 ms, suggesting that {{there are at least three}} <b>synaptic</b> <b>relays</b> in the crossed reflexes. The IPSPs evoked by stimulation of both ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous nerves had minimal latencies suggesting at least three synaptic delays. Like IPSPs evoked by group II afferents, the frequencies of occurrence of crossed IPSPs evoked by stimulation of cutaneous afferents were significantly reduced after spinal transection and the IPSPs recorded after spinalisation were significantly smaller. These findings are consistent with the recent proposal that dorsal horn neurones, which receive input from cutaneous afferents and contact premotor commissural interneurones may mediate the crossed inhibition...|$|R

Synaptic connectivity {{in this system}} is characterized by an n + 1 pattern of convergence, where each ganglion cell receives one very strong primary input and a variable number (n) of weak secondary inputs that are subthreshold in strength. To test whether pairs of secondary nicotinic EPSPs can summate to fire action potentials and thus mediate ganglionic gain in the rat superior cervical ganglion, we recorded intracellularly at 34 &# 176; C and used graded presynaptic stimulation to isolate individual secondary synapses. Weak EPSPs in 40 of 53 neurons had amplitudes of 0. 5 – 7 mV (mean 3. 5 &# 177; 0. 3 mV). EPSPs evoked by paired pulse stimulation were either depressing (n = 10), facilitating (n = 9) or borderline (n = 10). In 15 of 29 cells, pairs of weak secondary EPSPs initiated spikes when elicited within a temporal window < 20 ms, irrespective of EPSP amplitude or paired pulse response type. In 6 other neurons, we observed novel secondary EPSPs that were strong enough to straddle spike threshold without summation. At stimulus rates < 1 Hz straddling EPSPs appeared suprathreshold in strength. However, their limited ability to drive firing could be blocked by the afterhypolarization following an action potential. When viewed in a computational context, these findings support the concept that weak and straddling secondary nicotinic synapses enable mammalian sympathetic ganglia to behave as use-dependent amplifiers of preganglionic activity...|$|R

We made simultaneous recordings from sympathetic cutaneous vasoconstrictor (CVC-type) fibres supplying back skin (hairy) and tail (hairless) in urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated rats. The animal's trunk was shaved and encased in a water-perfused jacket. Both tail and back skin CVC-type fibres were activated by cooling the trunk skin, and independently by the resultant fall in core (rectal) temperature, but their thresholds for activation differed (skin temperatures 38. 8 ± 0. 4 °C versus 36. 8 ± 0. 4 °C, core temperatures 38. 1 ± 0. 2 °C versus 36. 8 ± 0. 2 °C, respectively; P < 0. 01). Back skin CVC-type fibres were more responsive to skin than to core cooling, while the reverse applied to tail fibres. Back skin CVC-type fibres were less responsive than tail fibres to prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) microinjected into the preoptic area. Spectral analysis showed no significant coherence between tail and back skin CVC-type fibre activities during cooling. After preoptic PGE 2 injection, a coherent peak at 1 Hz appeared in some animals; this disappeared after partialization with respect to ventilatory pressure, indicating that it was attributable to common ventilatory modulation. Neuronal inhibition in the rostral medullary raphé by microinjected muscimol (2 mm, 60 – 120 nl) suppressed both tail and back skin CVC-type fibre activities, and prevented their responses to subsequent skin cooling. These results indicate that thermoregulatory responses of hairless and hairy skin vessels are controlled by independent neural pathways, although both depend on <b>synaptic</b> <b>relays</b> in the medullary raphé...|$|R
40|$|The {{brain stem}} reticular {{formation}} {{plays an important}} role in determining consciousness and arousal. Modulation of cholin-ergic neurotransmission in this region alters the sleep-wake cycle. In the present study, we examined the effect of the direct application of cholinergic agents into the pontine reticular nu-cleus on anesthetic requirements and recovery and antinoci-ception in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with 24 -gauge guide cannulas 1. 0 mm above the oral portion of pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) while under pentobarbital anesthesia with the use of a stereotaxic apparatus. After recovery from surgery, animals were randomly assigned to one of the follow-ing protocols: minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), recovery time, tail-flick latency, or motor blockade. All measurements were performed after carbachol microinjection into the PnO after pretreatment with atropine or mecamylamine. Carbachol injection into the PnO significantly reduced MAC of halothane and prolonged recovery in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreat-ment with atropine reversed MAC reduction by carbachol, and both atropine and mecamylamine shortened recovery time un-der carbachol. In unanesthetized rats, carbachol produced an-tinociceptive effects as reflected by a change in tail-flick latency response. Atropine and mecamylamine inhibited antinocicep-tive effects of carbachol. These results suggest that cholinomi-metic injection into the PnO modulates the anesthetic state produced by halothane, suggesting participation of this area in the mechanisms in the brain that generate the anesthetic state. The brain stem reticular formation has been the target of much research in attempts to define consciousness and arousal (Meyer, 1970; Steriade et al., 1993; Steriade, 1996; Coenen, 1998).

40|$|Abstract Most {{crustaceans}} live in aquatic {{environments and}} chemoreception is their dominant sensory modality. Crustacean chemoreception is mediated by small cuticular sense organs (sensilla) occurring on all body parts, with the antennules (first antennae), second antennae, legs, and mouthparts representing the major chemosensory organs. Chemoreceptive sensilla of crustaceans {{are divided into}} bimodal sensilla which comprise a few mechano- and some chemoreceptor neurons and occur on all appendages and aesthetascs which are innervated by 40 – 500 olfactory receptor neurons and exclusively occur on the antennular outer flagellum. Olfactory receptor neurons differ from chemoreceptor neurons of bimodal sensilla in having spontaneous activity, inhibitory responses, and autonomous bursting, but both types of receptor neurons mainly respond to small water-soluble molecules such as amino acids. The dichotomy in sensilla structure {{is reflected in the}} organi-zation of the associated CNS pathways. Olfactory receptor neurons selectively innervate a synaptic region in the midbrain, the olfactory lobe, which is organized into dense substructures called glomeruli.

40|$|Data {{based on}} dual {{intracellular}} recordings from neocortical and thalamic neurons in anesthetized cats are presented {{to support the}} assumption that bisynaptic inhibition of thalamocortical (TC) neurons, induced by synchronous cortical volleys through a prior <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay</b> in GABAergic thalamic reticular (RE) neurons, may overcome the direct excitation of TC neurons. This effect occurs during cortical augmenting responses mimicking sleep spindles as well as during the self-sustained, post-augmenting activity. Although TC volleys directly produce cortical potentials, the cortex uses its own machinery to elaborate oscillatory responses that outlast thalamic stimuli, whereas, simultaneously, TC neurons remain under a prolonged hyperpolarization arising in RE neurons. This pattern suggests that, during slow-wave sleep, when TC neurons are unable to process faithfully fast recurring signals from the external world because of their inhibition, intracortical activity may underlie processes accounting for some forms of mental activity. Opposite activity patterns in cortical and TC neurons are also observed during spike-wave seizures, which are generated in cortex and are associated with steady inhibition in a majority of TC neurons. The inability of TC neurons to transfer signals {{from the outside world}} during spike-wave seizures may accoun...|$|E

While mechanisms of olfactory sensory axon targeting are reported, molecular regulation of mitral cell dendritic growth and refinement are unclear. During embryonic development, mitral cell dendritic distribution overlaps with olfactory sensory axon terminals in the olfactory bulb. In this study, we investigate whether olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium influence mitral cell dendritic outgrowth in vitro. We report a soluble trophic {{activity in the}} olfactory epithelium conditioned medium which promotes mitral/tufted cell neurite outgrowth. While the trophic activity is present in both embryonic and postnatal olfactory epithelia, only embryonic but not postnatal mitral/tufted cells respond to this activity. We show that BMP 2, 5 and 7 promote mitral/tufted cells neurite outgrowth. However, the BMP antagonist, Noggin, fails to neutralize the olfactory epithelium derived neurite growth promoting activity. We provide evidence that olfactory epithelium derived activity is a protein factor with molecular weight between 50 - 100 kD. We also observed that Follistatin can effectively neutralize the olfactory epithelium derived activity, suggesting that TGF-beta family proteins are involved to promote mitral/tufted dendritic elaboration...|$|E
40|$|Corticothalamic fibres, which {{originate}} from layer VI pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, provide excitatory synaptic inputs to both thalamic relay neurons and reticular neurons; reticular neurons in turn supply inhibitory inputs to thalamic relay neurons. Pyramidal cells in layer VI in the mouse somatosensory cortex highly express mRNA encoding kainate receptors, which facilitate or depress transmitter release at several synapses {{in the central}} nervous system. We report here that contrary modulation of transmitter release from corticothalamic fibres onto thalamic relay and reticular neurons is mediated by activation of kainate receptors in mouse thalamic ventrobasal complex and thalamic reticular nucleus. Exogenous kainate presynaptically depresses the synaptic transmission at corticothalamic synapses onto thalamic relay neurons, but facilitates it at corticothalamic synapses onto reticular neurons. Meanwhile, the lemniscal synaptic transmission, which sends primary somatosensory inputs to relay neurons, is not affected by kainate. In addition, GluR 5 -containing kainate receptors {{are involved in the}} depression of corticothalamic <b>synaptic</b> transmission onto <b>relay</b> neurons, but not onto reticular neurons. Furthermore, synaptically activated kainate receptors mimic these effects; high-frequency stimulation of corticothalamic fibres depresses <b>synaptic</b> transmission onto <b>relay</b> neurons, but facilitates it onto reticular neurons.

40|$|Characterizing the {{responsiveness}} of thalamic neurons {{is crucial}} to understanding the flow of sensory information. Typically, thalamocortical neurons possess two distinct firing modes. At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully <b>relay</b> <b>synaptic</b> inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing...|$|R
40|$|Nociception {{involves}} {{detection of}} tissue damage by specialized receptors; nociceptors. These convey {{information to the}} first <b>synaptic</b> <b>relays</b> in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Within the dorsal horn itself are the dorsal horn neurons which {{can be divided into}} two broad classes, based on their axonal projections: projection neurons and interneurons. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK 1 r), the main target for substance P, is expressed by most projection neurons and many interneurons in the dorsal horn. These NK 1 r-expressing neurons show a bimodal size distribution in lamina I. The 1 st part of the project tested the hypothesis that large NK 1 r-immunoreactive cells in this lamina are projection neurons, while the small cells are interneurons. Rats were anaesthetised and received injections of tracers into two supraspinal areas that are likely to label all contralateral lamina I projection neurons. The rats were re-anaesthetized and perfused 3 days later and 1341 NK 1 r-positive cells were analysed, of which 441 were retrogradely labelled. Cross-sectional soma areas of projection neurons were larger than those of cells that were not retrogradely labelled. This difference was highly significant. Nearly all (99. 4 %) of the NK 1 r-expressing cells that were not retrogradely labelled had soma areas 200 microm 2) neurons and interneurons, with a significantly higher proportion in the larger cells, after all types of noxious stimulation. There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of pERK expression between the three morphological classes (fusiform, pyramidal and multipolar) of lamina I NK 1 r-expressing projection neurons after these stimuli. Most of the giant cells contained pERK after noxious cutaneous stimuli, but few did so following noxious deep stimulation. Only a few of laminae III-IV NK 1 r-expressing projection cells contained pERK after noxious deep or visceral stimulation, and the labelling in these was very weak. Results from the present study indicate that different types of neurons have different roles in conveying nociceptive information. The superficial dorsal horn (SDH) is also a vital area for modulating nociception and contains large number of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. Glutamate, released by primary afferents and local excitatory neurons, acts on G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlus). Group I mGlus (mGlu 1 and mGlu 5) are strongly expressed in the SDH. It has been reported that intrathecal administration of the mGlu 1 / 5 agonist 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induces spontaneous nociceptive behaviours, which are ERK-dependent. In the 3 rd part of the project, ERK phosphorylation in mGlu 5 -expressing neurons following the administration of DHPG was investigated. Anaesthetized rats underwent a laminectomy procedure. DHPG or saline was applied to their exposed lumbar cord for 8 minutes after which they were perfused. Sections from the lumbar spinal cord were immunoreacted to reveal mGlu 5, pERK and one of various markers for excitatory or inhibitory interneurons. Following DHPG (but not saline), numerous pERK-positive cells were seen in the SDH, particularly lamina II, and the great majority of these were mGlu 5 -positive. ERK phosphorylation was detected in both inhibitory and excitatory mGlu 5 -expressing cells, suggesting that type I mGlus have a complex role in nociceptive processing...|$|R

I examined this phenomenon in rats by using theta band oscillations of the local field potential to signify sniffing as a sensorimotor process. Olfactory bulb (OB) theta oscillations are coherent {{with those in the}} dorsal hippocampus (HPC) during odor sniffing in a two-odor olfactory discrimination task. Coherence is restricted to the high-frequency theta band (6 - 12 Hz) associated with directed sniffing in the OB and type 1 theta in the HPC. Coherence and performance fluctuate on a time scale of several minutes. Coherence magnitude is positively correlated with performance in the two-odor condition but not in extended runs of single odor conditional-stimulus-positive trials. Simultaneous with enhanced OB-HPC theta band coherence during odor sniffing is a significant decrease in lateral entorhinal cortex (EC) -HPC and OB-EC coherence, suggesting that linkage of the olfactory and hippocampal theta rhythms is not through the <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay</b> from OB to HPC in the lateral EC.

Granule cells (GCs) are characterised by {{a limited number of}} excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (4 typically), which allowed us to investigate the cell’s input space extensively. Here, we present some results of our information theoretic analy-sis (mutual information, and stimulus-specific information) of the transmission properties of a single GC obtained by using both a detailed mathematical model and whole-cell patch recordings in slices. Our findings indicate that a ma-jor amount of information is conveyed by the spike time correlations across the inputs and that long-term synap-tic plasticity affects the information transmission process significantly. Interestingly, long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) increases the average amount of information trans-mitted, but not necessarily the contribution of the most in-formative set of stimuli. In addition, the effect of Golgi cell inhibition on mossy fibre-granule cell information trans-fer has been investigated using numerical simulations only. Synchronisation of Golgi cells improved information trans-mission through the mossy fibre-granule cell relay.

Differential 2 -deoxyglucose uptake was also observed in the somata of projection neurons (mitral cells) and interneurons (periglomerular and granule cells).

H., Patlak, C. S., Pettigrew, K. D., Sakurada, O. & Shinohara, M. (1977) J. Neurochem. 28, 897 [...] 916]. Based on results obtained by the two methods, it is suggested that the glomerulus as a whole serves as a functional unit of activity. The high-resolution results are interpreted in terms of the well-characterized synaptic organization of the olfactory bulb and also serve to illustrate the capability of the 2 -deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique to map metabolic activity in single neurons of the vertebrate central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Bidirectional {{interactions}} between neurons and glial cells {{are crucial to}} the genesis of pathological pain. The mechanisms regulating these interactions {{and the role of}} this process in <b>relaying</b> <b>synaptic</b> input in the spinal dorsal horn remain to be established. We studied the role of glutamate transporters in the regulation of such interactions. On pharmacological blockade of glutamate transporters, slow inward currents (SICs) appeared spontaneously and/or were evoked by peripheral synaptic input in the spinal superficial dorsal horn neurons, including the spinothalamic tract neurons. We showed that the SICs were induced by the release of glutamate from glial cells. On inhibition of glutamate uptake, the stimulation-induced, synaptically released glutamate activated glial cells and caused glial cells to release glutamate. Glial-derived glutamate acted on extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mainly composed of NR 2 B receptors and generated SICs, which led to depolarization and action potential generation in superficial spinal dorsal horn neurons. Thus glutamate transporters regulate glutamatergic neuron–glia interactions at spinal sensory synapses. When glutamate uptake is impaired, glial cells function like excitatory interneurons—they are activated by peripheral synaptic input and release glutamate to activate postsynaptic neurons in spinal pain pathways...|$|R
40|$|Spines are {{specialized}} neuronal membrane structures, often localized {{at sites}} where <b>synaptic</b> information is <b>relayed</b> from one cell {{to another in}} the central nervous system. By electron immunomicroscopy {{we have found that}} the mammalian Shaw family potassium channel Kv 3. 1 is localized on spine-like protrusions, adjacent to postsynaptic membranes of bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus. As direct characterization of the electrophysiological behavior of ion channels in such structures is difficult, we have used Kv 3. 1 -transfected CHO cells to create artificial spine-like membrane compartments. Membrane patches were sucked into microelectrodes to form small, cell-attached vesicles with dimensions comparable to those of the neuronal structures. Currents mediated by the Kv 3. 1 channel in these vesicles undergo rapid and complete inactivation, in contrast to their noninactivating behavior in whole-cell recordings. This apparent inactivation is caused by the rapid depletion of K+ from the vesicle and the slow refilling of K+ into the vesicle compartment from the bulk cytoplasm. Our data provide evidence that compartmentalized ionic transients can be generated in spine-like membrane structures and support the view that the localization of ion channels in spine-like structures may influence responses to synaptic stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Background The dorsal {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (dLGN) of {{the mouse}} has been an {{important}} experimental model for understanding thalamic circuit development. The developmental remodeling of retinal projections has been the primary focus, however much less is known about the maturation of their <b>synaptic</b> targets, the <b>relay</b> cells of the dLGN. Here we examined the growth and maturation of relay cells during the first few weeks of life and addressed whether early retinal innervation affects their development. To accomplish this we utilized themath 5 null (math 5 −/−) mouse, a mutant lacking retinal ganglion cells and central projections. Results The absence of retinogeniculate axon innervation led to an overall shrinkage of dLGN and disrupted the pattern of dendritic growth among developing relay cells. 3 -D reconstructions of biocytin filled neurons frommath 5 −/− mice showed that in the absence of retinal input relay cells undergo a period of exuberant dendritic growth and branching, followed by branch elimination and an overall attenuation in dendritic field size. However, math 5 −/− relay cells retained a sufficient degree of complexity and class specificity, as well as their basic membrane properties and spike firing characteristics. Conclusions Retinal innervation plays an important trophic role in dLGN development. Additional support perhaps arising from non-retinal innervation and signaling is likely to contribute to the stabilization of their dendritic form and function...|$|R
40|$|Dual transneuronal tracing {{is a novel}} viral tracing {{methodology}} {{which employs}} two recombinant viruses, each expressing a different reporter protein. Peripheral injection of recombinant pseudorabies viruses {{has been used as}} a powerful method to define neurons that coordinate outputs to various peripheral targets of motor and autonomic systems. Here, we assessed the feasibility of recombinants of rabies virus (RV) vector for dual transneuronal tracing in the central nervous system. First, we examined whether two different RV-vectors can double label cells in vitro, and showed that efficient double labeling can be realized by infecting targeted cells with the two RV-vectors within a short time interval. The potential of dual transneuronal tracing was then examined in vivo in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, using the chain of projections from CA 3 pyramidal cells to CA 1 pyramidal cells and subsequently to entorhinal cortex. Six days after the injection of two RV-vectors into the left and right entorhinal cortex respectively, double-labeled neurons were observed in CA 3 bilaterally. Some double-labeled neurons showed a Golgi-like labeling. Dual transneuronal tracing potentially provides a powerful and sensitive method to study issues such as the amount of convergence and divergence within and between circuits in the central nervous system. Using this sensitive technique, we established that single neurons in CA 3 are connected to the entorhinal cortex bilaterally with only one <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay.</b> © 2009 Ohara, Inoue, Yamada, Yamawaki, Koganezawa, Tsutsui, Witter and Iijima...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothalamic}} supraoptic nucleus (SON) in the rat contains neurons that synthesize either vasopressin (VP) or oxytocin (OT) {{and receives}} inputs from medullary nuclei. While VP neurons receive inputs from noradrenergic {{cells in the}} caudal ventrolateral medulla (cVLM), no pathway from medullary nuclei had yet been described that would account for the excitation of OT neurons produced by gastric stimuli. Retrograde tracer experiments revealed a direct pathway from the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) to the SON, made up of axons arising from noradrenergic and non-noradrenergic neurons. Immunocytochemistry experiments identified putative transmitter substances in non-noradrenergic neurons as inhibin-$ beta$ and somatostatin- 28 (SS- 28). During intracellular recording experiments, SS- 28 hyperpolarized and reduced the spontaneous activity of SON neurons, an effect that was reproduced by the fragment SS- 28 (1 - 12), but not by SS- 14. In the majority of cases, discrete in vivo electrical stimulation of the caudal NTS caused primarily an enhancement of the electrical activity of VP and OT neurons in the SON. Experiments were also undertaken to study the organization of afferents to VP and OT neurons. Transient bilateral blockade of neuronal function in the VLM abolished the caudal NTS-evoked excitation of VP neurons, but not of OT neurons. This data suggests that stimuli such as hypovolemia may be relayed from the NTS to supraoptic VP neurons via a <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay</b> in the cVLM. Oxytocin neurons would receive direct NTS input that may transmit visceral or somatic stimuli...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{well-established}} link between hyperbilirubinaemia and hearing loss in paediatrics, but the cellular mechanisms {{have not been}} elucidated. Here we used the Gunn rat model of hyperbilirubinaemia to investigate bilirubin-induced hearing loss. In vivo auditory brainstem responses revealed that Gunn rats have severe auditory deficits within 18 h of exposure to high bilirubin levels. Using an in vitro preparation of the auditory brainstem from these rats, extracellular multi-electrode array recording from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) showed longer latency and decreased amplitude of evoked field potentials following bilirubin exposure, suggestive of transmission failure at this <b>synaptic</b> <b>relay.</b> Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirmed that the electrophysiological properties of the postsynaptic MNTB neurons were unaffected by bilirubin, with no change in action potential waveforms or current-voltage relationships. However, stimulation of the trapezoid body was unable to elicit large calyceal EPSCs in MNTB neurons of hyperbilirubinaemic rats, indicative of damage at a presynaptic site. Multi-photon imaging of anterograde-labelled calyceal projections revealed axonal staining and presynaptic profiles around MNTB principal neuron somata. Following induction of hyperbilirubinaemia the giant synapses were largely destroyed. Electron microscopy confirmed loss of presynaptic calyceal terminals and supported the electrophysiological evidence for healthy postsynaptic neurons. MNTB neurons express high levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Nitric oxide has been implicated in mechanisms of bilirubin toxicity elsewhere in the brain, and antagonism of nNOS by 7 -nitroindazole protected hearing during bilirubin exposure. We conclude that bilirubin-induced deafness is caused by degeneration of excitatory synaptic terminals in the auditory brainstem. 7578...|$|E
50|$|The spike-and-wave pattern seen {{during an}} absence seizure {{is the result}} of a {{bilateral}} synchronous firing of neurons ranging from the neocortex (part of the cerebral cortex) to the thalamus, along the thalamocortical network. The EEG “spike” of the spike-and-wave complex corresponds to the depolarization of the neuronal membrane potential, also called a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS). The initial understanding behind the mechanism of the PDS was that it was caused by a very large EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) in the absence of <b>synaptic</b> inhibition, which <b>relayed</b> the action potentials in the neurons by triggering activation of voltage-gated channels. The voltage-gated sodium channels cause transitory sodium current into the cell, which generates the action potential. The voltage-gated calcium channels also have some effect on the depolarization of the cell, but the effect is minimal compared to the sodium channels. However, the increasing concentration of intracellular calcium leads to greater activation of calcium-activated potassium channels. These calcium-activated potassium channels, along with the voltage-gated potassium channels, contribute to the repolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane. In an epileptic seizure, there are periods of a sustained depolarization, which cause a train of action potentials followed by a repolarization and hyperpolarization phase. The train of action potentials constitutes the “spike” phase, and the repolarization and hyperpolarization constitute the “wave” phase.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} {{cells of}} the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), synaptic responses evoked by optic tract (OT) stimulation give rise to long-lasting, high-amplitude depolarizations known as plateau potentials. These events are mediated by L-type Ca 2 + channels and occur during early postnatal life, a time when retinogeniculate connections are remodelling. To better {{understand the relationship between}} L-type activity and dLGN development we used an in vitro thalamic slice preparation which preserves the retinal connections and intrinsic circuitry in dLGN and examined how synaptic responses evoked by OT stimulation lead to the activation of plateau potentials. By varying the strength and temporal frequency of OT stimulation we identified at least three factors that contribute to the developmental regulation of plateau activity: the degree of retinal convergence, the temporal pattern of retinal stimulation and the emergence of feed-forward inhibition. Before natural eye opening (postnatal day 14), the excitatory <b>synaptic</b> responses of <b>relay</b> cells receiving multiple retinal inputs summated in both the spatial and temporal domains to produce depolarizations sufficient to activate L-type activity. After eye opening, when inhibitory responses are fully developed, plateau activity was rarely evoked even with high temporal rates of OT stimulation. When the bulk of this inhibition was blocked by bath application of bicuculline, the incidence of plateau activity increased significantly. We also made use of a transgenic mouse that lacks the β 3 subunit of the L-type Ca 2 + channel. These mutants have far fewer membrane-bound Ca 2 + channels and attenuated L-type activity. In β 3 nulls, L-type plateau activity was rarely observed even at young ages when plateau activity prevails. Thus, in addition to the changing patterns of synaptic connectivity and retinal activity, the expression of L-type Ca 2 + channels is a requisite component in the manifestation of plateau activity...|$|R
40|$|Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) extend axons to the {{accessory}} olfactory bulb (AOB) where they form <b>synaptic</b> connections that <b>relay</b> pheromone {{signals to the}} brain. The projections of apical and basal VSNs segregate in the AOB into anterior (aAOB) and posterior (pAOB) compartments. Although some aspects of this organization exhibit fundamental similarities with the main olfactory system, the mechanisms that regulate mammalian vomeronasal targeting are not as well understood. In the olfactory epithelium (OE), the glycosyltransferase beta 3 GnT 2 maintains expression of axon guidance cues required for proper glomerular positioning and neuronal survival. We show here that beta 3 GnT 2 also regulates guidance and adhesion molecule expression in the vomeronasal system {{in ways that are}} partially distinct from the OE. In wildtype mice, ephrinA 5 (+) axons project to stereotypic subdomains in both the aAOB and pAOB compartments. This pattern is dramatically altered in beta 3 GnT 2 (-/-) mice, where ephrinA 5 is upregulated exclusively on aAOB axons. Despite this, apical and basal VSN projections remain strictly segregated in the null AOB, although some V 2 r 1 b axons that normally project to the pAOB inappropriately innervate the anterior compartment. These fibers appear to arise from ectopic expression of V 2 r 1 b receptors in a subset of apical VSNs. The homotypic adhesion molecules Kirrel 2 and OCAM that facilitate axon segregation and glomerular compartmentalization in the main olfactory bulb are ablated in the beta 3 GnT 2 (-/-) aAOB. This loss is accompanied by a two-fold increase in the total number of V 2 r 1 b glomeruli and a failure to form morphologically distinct glomeruli in the anterior compartment. These results identify a novel function for beta 3 GnT 2 glycosylation in maintaining expression of layer-specific vomeronasal receptors, as well as adhesion molecules required for proper AOB glomerular formation...|$|R
