40|$|When {{applying}} {{high strength}} bolts in friction connections, a load-bearing capacity depends on pretension {{force in the}} bolts {{as well as on}} friction coefficient found on friction surfaces. It is important to get the reliable value of the pretension force, so friction connections often undergo experimental research. In order to use strain gauges, which are inserted into the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank,</b> <b>bolts</b> need to be calibrated before we even use them in experimental research.

30|$|The {{modelling}} {{of contacts}} between various components {{plays a major}} role in the performance of the connection. The bolt pre-tension and friction are the most critical parameters. The forces are transmitted by friction between members as a result of bolt pre-tensioning. The contact pairs are web angles to beam web/column flange, <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> to <b>bolt</b> hole, and bolt head to respective components. Out of these, the contact between <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> and <b>bolt</b> hole is frictionless, whereas the others are friction contact. The interaction consists of two components, one normal to the surface and the other tangential to the surface. The tangential component consists of relative motion between the surfaces and frictional shear stress, if connection is made up of HSFG bolts. Hard contact is given between the surfaces, i.e., the surfaces separate, when the contact pressure between them becomes zero or negative. While in contact the normal and shear forces are transmitted from one surface to another. Thus, a suitable value of friction coefficient should be given such that the frictional forces resist relative sliding of the surface. To simulate the exact connection behaviour, finite sliding contact pair definition is given between the two surfaces, one of which is the master and other is slave surface. The master surface should be a discontinuous surface and the surface intersecting the master is called slave surface.|$|R
40|$|Superelastic {{shape memory}} alloys (SMAs) {{have the ability}} to recover their {{original}} shape after experiencing large strains. End-plate connection with using superelastic long <b>shank</b> SMA <b>bolts</b> is proposed in this paper. By using strong beam-weak bolt cluster design methodology and special configurations to strength beam ends, a superelastic hinge is expected to form in column flange. To validate the mechanical behavior of the proposed beam-to-column connection, both quasi-static tests and numerical analysis are conducted with cyclic transverse loads applied on the beam ends. The results indicate the connection deformations concentrate on the long <b>shank</b> SMA <b>bolts</b> upon loading and the bolt cluster rotates around the axis near beam flange. By using the super elastic effect, the SMA bolts recover most elongations and the connection recovers to its original shape after experiencing 0. 02 rad interstorey drift angle.

3000|$|FE {{modelling}} including mesh discretization, boundary conditions, loading method, {{and method}} of static FE analysis using ABAQUS standard of top- and seat-angle connections was discussed elaborately in the author’s previous literatures (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002). In those and other (Pirmoz et al. 2009) research articles, the stress-deformation pattern developed by FE analyses showed that plastic yielding initiated at {{the toe of}} the tension angle’s fillet, followed by yielding in the area under the tension bolt head for thinner angles (e.g., for the cases of 0.7 ex 3 / [...].- 0 pt 0.7 ex 8 ^" [...] angle thickness), and {{in the areas of}} tension bolthole for the cases of thicker angles. Thus, it is noted that as the tension angle thickness increases, the zone of plastic yielding moves toward the centreline of the bolthole of the vertical leg. Shen and Astaneh-Asl (1999) also found similar deformation history of the connections in their experimental programs and observed that plastic deformations were developed in the vertical leg of top-angle and horizontal leg of seat-angle for connections with thinner angles, whereas the plastic deformations were formed at the central line of the column bolts of top-angle’s vertical leg together with <b>shank</b> areas of <b>bolts</b> for relatively thick angles. Simultaneously, FE analysis results showed that the stresses higher than the yield point were generated in the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> near the <b>bolt</b> head. It indicates that the nonlinear behaviour of the connection differs from some assumptions of Kishi–Chen’s power model. With this background, the place of formation of the upper plastic hinge in the top angle’s vertical leg has been revised and an additional plastic hinge is supplied in the tension bolts according to the results of tests (Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999) and FE analyses (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002; Pirmoz et al. 2009) for the proposed prediction model in determining the ultimate connection moment.|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} with a monotonically incremental loading scheme for all connection models imitating experimental loading procedure. The connection models are analyzed in three loading steps. In the first step, a prescribed force, 40  % of minimum tensile strength of bolt, {{is applied to the}} pretension node of a predefined section of the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank.</b> As a result, the length of <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> at the pretension section changes by the amount necessary to carry the prescribed load. In the second step, the prescribed bolt load is replaced by changing the length of pretension section back to the initial length. Bolt pretension force of all models (excluding A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6) is prescribed as 40  % of the ultimate strength of bolt. For connection models A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6, corresponding values are 0, 20 and 60  % of the ultimate strength of bolt, respectively. Thus, A 1 Po connection model designated with subscript ‘Po’ as listed in Table  2 is analyzed considering zero pretension force of bolts. In the third step, bending moment is introduced to the beam-to-column connection by employing vertical displacement of the middle section of plane Z–X of the stub column (Fig.  3). Automatic load increment scheme is preferred because ABAQUS can select the precise incremental rate to attain the optimum computational efficiency.|$|R
2500|$|Even when {{designed}} as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded - thus it operates initially as a friction joint. [...] When the lateral force becomes sufficient to overcome this friction, the clamped elements move until {{the sides of the}} holes bear against the <b>shank</b> of the <b>bolt.</b> [...] This movement - [...] "slip into bearing" [...] - usually starts and stops very suddenly, often releasing elastic energy in the associated elements, resulting in a loud - but harmless - bang.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of work by the author in measuring and monitoring loads in bolts using an ultrasonic extensometer. A {{number of cases of}} bolted joints are covered. These include, a clamped joint with clearance fit between the bolt and hole, a clamped joint with the bolt in an interference fit with the hole, a flanged joint which allows the flange and bolt to bend; and a shear joint in a clevis and tang configuration. These applications were initially developed for measuring and monitoring preload in the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter critical joints but are also applicable for monitoring loads in other critical bolted joints of structures such as transportation bridges and other aerospace structures. The paper explains how to setup a model to estimate the load factor and accuracy for the ultrasonic preload application in a clamped joint with clearance fit. The ultrasonic preload application for clamped joint with bolt in an interference fit {{can also be used to}} measure diametrical interference between the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> and hole; and interference pressure on the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank.</b> Model and experimental data are given to demonstrate use of ultrasonic measurements in a shear joint.

While literature exists to predict failure modes at ambient temperature, there is no method for failure mode prediction for elevated temperatures where ductility is critical to avoid collapse. Galvanised M 20 structural bolt assemblies and bolt material from a single batch have been tested under tension at a range of temperatures and strain-rates typical of those experienced in fire. Turned-down bolt test data produced stress-strain curves characteristic of different microstructures at ambient temperature, despite a tempered-martensitic microstructure being specified in the standards.

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint.

For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|R
