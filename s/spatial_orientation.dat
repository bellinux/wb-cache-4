5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation.</b> The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E

This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E

Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation,</b> and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

A featurebased segmentation approach to the object detection problem is pursued, where the features are computed over multiple <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations</b> and frequencies. The method proceeds as follows: A given image is passed through a bank of even-symmetric Gabor filters. A selection of these filtered images is made and each (selected) filtered image is subjected to a nonlinear (sigmoidal like) transformation. Then, a measure of texture energy is computed in a window around each transformed image pixel. The texture energy ("Gabor features"), and their spatial locations, are inputted to a squared-error clustering algorithm.

Both griya and puri consist of multiple courtyards instead of single courtyard.

Each subdivision follows the same importance, and so the subdivision located in the kaja-kangin direction is always the most auspicious where {{the most important of}} the family shrines are usually located.

25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation.</b> For example, a person's spatial memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's spatial memory is needed to learn the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map. Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.|$|E
25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation,</b> because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E

40|$|Gold (Au) {{nanoparticles}} particularly nanorods {{are actively}} exploited as imaging probes {{because of their}} special nonblinking and nonbleaching absorption, scattering and emitting properties that arise from the excitation of surface plasmons.

By simultaneously recording defocused images and two-photon luminescence intensities for {{a large number of}} single AuNRs, we correlate their defocused images with their three-dimensional <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations.</b> As many AuNRs can be monitored in parallel, defocused imaging of single AuNRs is a high throughput sensing technique that allows us to obtain their <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations</b> within one frame in situ and real-time. The probe size can be down to several nanometers, which is highly desirable in order to minimize any potential interference from the probe itself. Furthermore, the sensing property is insensitive to the excitation polarization and the distribution of the probe aspect ratio, which allows AuNRs of any length in a proper regime to be used as orientation sensors without changing the laser frequency and polarization. These unique features make the orientation probes proposed here outstanding candidates for optical imaging and sensing in material science and biology...|$|R

25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation</b> and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation,</b> and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E
25|$|The ocean's {{surface is}} closely {{approximated}} by an equipotential surface, (ignoring ocean currents) {{commonly referred to}} as the geoid. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's gradient, there are no tangential forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed <b>spatial</b> <b>orientation</b> relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. Gravitational forces follow an inverse-square law (force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance), but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.|$|E
40|$|Circuits of {{mutually}} supported elements (MSEs) {{can produce}} novel 3 -dimensional spatial structures. In {{the creation of}} a circuit, the basic concept is that the primary members rely on each other for support. These novel structural arrangements may give rise to complexity in the configuration geometry and structural behaviour due to {{the creation of a}}n eccentricity between elements. An experimental programme was designed to aid understanding of the primary behaviour of structures composed of MSEs. This investigation concentrated on the structural performance, under applied static loading, of a dodecahedric MSE space structure. The main objectives of the experimental investigation were to confirm behaviour as being linear elastic within a predermined appied load range, to understand the distribution of stress and the displacements of the structural elements, later to be compared with that predicted by numerical modelling. Displacements of closed MSE circuits with different <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations</b> were considered. Differences in the recorded strains were also considered. The experiment highlighted the difficulties associated with monitoring MSE circuits, particularly support stiffness and displacements of circuits with arbitrary 3 -dimensional <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations.</b> The recorded strains were complex in nature in as far as they included the effects of axial forces, bi-axial bending, shear and torsion.

Neuronal activation was identified by immuno-/hybridization histochemistry for Fos or c-fos mRNA expression. Labyrinthectomized and/or stationary controls showed only sporadic Fos-labeled neurons in individual brainstem nuclei, confirming the otolithic origin of c-fos expression in test animals. In response to linear acceleration in 3 -D space, Fos-labeled neurons were observed throughout the rostro-caudal and medio-lateral lengths of the medial vestibular nucleus (MV), spinal vestibular nucleus (SpV), the ventral part of the lateral vestibular nucleus, group x, and group y. Dense subpopulations {{were found in the}} middle/caudal half of SpV, centro-lateral part of MV, and middle/caudal half of group y. Some of these areas were innervated by otolith afferent terminals. The superior vestibular nucleus was the only region within the vestibular nuclear complex where neurons were sensitive only to horizontal linear accelerations, i. e. 2 -D <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations.</b> Similar to the vestibular nuclear complex, neurons within the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus were sensitive to linear acceleration in 3 -D space and these were located mostly in the caudal half.

50|$|The second aspect draws {{heavily from}} George Lakoff's and Mark Johnson's work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors {{whenever}} possible to better explain their external world. Humans {{also have a}} basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations</b> such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other <b>spatial</b> <b>orientations</b> such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus {{the point here is}} that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.|$|R
