25|$|DSHS {{was most}} {{concerned}} about Biryukova's mental health, given her OCD diagnosis and past hospitalizations, following a complaint from the person who delivered the child. They also found the father, Alan Morgan, a convicted felon, problematic. Authorities in Florida had taken a child from his home there. The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> {{she did not even}} know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, with lost prestige, a divided party, {{and with her}} {{campaign}} resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. [...] Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. [...] The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. [...] Nevertheless, the perception grew {{that she did not}} have any vision for what she would do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. [...] In response, she <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> [...] "I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone". Her campaign material continued to just refer to [...] "Lenore". [...] She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private.|$|E
2500|$|Within a few years, Trafficante owned or held {{stakes in}} both The Tropicana and The Sans Souci (the only casinos {{which had been}} {{operating}} in Havana for several years prior to 1955). Both clubs served drinks and meals which just about covered the operating costs. The profits from gambling amounted to approximately $5,000 a day, after [...] "deductions". [...] It was suspected that he also had behind-the-scenes interests in other syndicate owned Cuban gambling casinos namely those at, the Habana Riviera, the Nacional, the Sevilla-Biltmore, the Capri and the Havana Hilton. The newer casinos averaged even higher profits while the profits of the two original casinos remained {{more or less the}} same. Ironically, [...] Lansky and Trafficante both avoided gambling. [...] "Bartenders don't drink, because they see the consequences", Trafficante <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> [...] "I know the odds are stacked against the players." [...] According to a 1958 Treasury Department investigation The Tropicana casino (along with those at The Capri and The Nacional) were rumored to be using [...] "bust-out dice" [...] and [...] "rigged equipment." [...] According to their information the slot machines were [...] "rigged for a very low pay off, due to the extremely high take off of the proceeds by officials." ...|$|E

[...] "He's so modest," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> and Chatteris pretended not to hear and went rather pink. Ever and again he attempted to deflect the talk towards the Sea Lady and away from himself, but he was hampered by his ignorance of her position.|$|E
6000|$|The {{others were}} willing, and {{they passed through}} Forty second street to Broadway and then turned southward. The street was filled with wagons, trucks and trolley cars, and the {{sidewalk}} appeared to [...] "overflow with folks," [...] as Sam <b>said.</b> <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> a man was giving {{some sort of an}} exhibition in a store window and here the crowd was so great they had to walk out into the gutter to get past.|$|E
50|$|That {{having been}} <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> in the text, Mars is {{explicitly}} referenced as {{visible in the}} night sky, just before {{one of the two}} halves of the moon appears. This may however indicate that the humans in the novel have misidentified Earth as Mars, in parallel with their believing that Mars is Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Geographically, Ilanji is the {{centroid}} of a triangle whose three corners are {{the towns of}} Senkottai, Courtallam and Tenkasi, {{each of which is}} located approximately 3 km from Ilanji. As a result, some people call it [...] "Triplet City" [...] in Tirunelveli district. It is also bounded by two rivers, the Sitraru (Therkaru) and the Kundaru (Vadakkaru). It's also <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> in time, a river flowed through the town.|$|R
50|$|Martins, despite {{playing in}} the Indian I-League, {{believes}} that he has {{what it takes to}} play for his birth country Nigeria. According to Martins {{he had a chance to}} play for the Nigerian U20s but AFC Cup commitments and the Dempo president failing to tell Martins on time stopped that from happening. Martins also <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> an official from the Nigeria Football Federation arrived in India to watch him play a match and that he would be watching Martins.|$|R
5000|$|Wang Shenzhi died in 925 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Wang Yanhan, who in turn was killed around the new year 927 by his adoptive brother Wang Yanbing and younger {{biological}} brother Wang Yanjun, who then succeeded him.

50|$|In April 2016, two Russian jets {{flew over}} the US {{destroyer}} USS Donald Cook almost a dozen times, American officials <b>said.</b> <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> the jets were so close - about 9m (30ft) - that they created wakes in the water around the ship. The jets had no visible weaponry and the ship took no action.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876, Kate {{moved to}} Fort Griffin, Texas, where in 1877 she met Doc Holliday. Doc <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> that he {{considered}} Kate his intellectual equal. Kate introduced Holliday to Wyatt Earp. [...] The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox’s boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but {{spent most of his}} time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently.|$|E
50|$|Dunn {{aspired to}} become a show-business {{personality}} in his own right, and so in time he appeared in promotional material for the B105 FM Morning Crew as himself. He used the 'Agro' character {{as a kind of}} alternative, more uninhibited personality (for example, when making prank telephone calls). The puppet itself was seldom seen during the 2000s. Dunn <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> that Agro was 'in a suitcase somewhere'. More recently, Agro has appeared in promotional material for Zinc 96.|$|E
50|$|It is {{said that}} most of the editing {{decisions}} were worked out in an accountant's spreadsheet book and the pencil edit plan resembled flow charts. Chapman has <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> in the editing process he stood there in the room, bits of footage hanging from clips all around him. He felt crushed by the force of his vision and he was a breath away from quitting. Even at the first screening, Chapman was exhausted and unsure but as he left the room, Steve McQueen watching at the back, grabbed Chapman and told him that he was blown away by the film.|$|R
5000|$|At first President Wilson was {{not very}} {{responsive}} to the women's protest. At points he even seemed amused with it by tipping his hat and smiling. It was <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> Wilson even invited them in for coffee. At other points in time, he ignored the protests altogether, such as when the Sentinels protested {{on the day of}} his second inauguration ceremony. [...] As the Sentinels continued to protest, the issue became bigger and Wilson's opinion began to change. Although he continued to dislike the Silent Sentinels, he began to recognize them as a group seriously presenting him with an issue.|$|R

5000|$|On 11 December 1973 {{during a}} debate {{on the fate of}} the {{community}} on the Toronto Islands, Harris, a Controller at the time, was firmly against the idea of retaining the houses. He <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> [...] "These people have launched as vicious a propaganda campaign as I've ever seen. You can see the fine hand of Island public relations in this City proposal. I've had it with their heart-rending stories." [...] It is ironic that Joyce Trimmer, Harris' successor as mayor originally lived on the Toronto Islands.|$|E

50|$|During {{filming of}} Birdemic, Nguyen {{instructed}} star Whitney Moore not to socialize with her costar Alan Bagh after filming. On the commentary, Moore said they didn't get permits to film at specific locations, instead just showing up, and sometimes getting kicked out. She <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> they were filming {{on a public}} jogging trail, and Nguyen started yelling at joggers who were getting in the shot. Moore {{told him not to}} yell at people who weren't associated with the film, and he responded by refusing to talk to her for three weeks. He gave her direction using her costar Bagh as an intermediary.|$|R
5000|$|Pietro Antonio Stefano Mascagni ( [...] ; 7 December 1863 [...] - [...] 2 August 1945) was an Italian {{composer}} most {{noted for}} his operas. His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria Rusticana caused {{one of the}} greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Leoncavallo, was a [...] "one-opera man" [...] who could never repeat his first success, L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres. Mascagni <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> Iris was performed in Italy more often than Cavalleria (cf. Stivender).|$|R
5000|$|... "The C.I.A. {{had access}} to secret army jails and to written reports {{summarizing}} the interrogation of suspected leftists, according to Mr. Caballero and two American officials. The Americans also said the C.I.A. knew the Honduran Army was killing prisoners. The American officials <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> in 1983 the C.I.A. demanded the killings stop. In 1984, a C.I.A. agent was recalled from Honduras after a prisoner's relative identified him as having visited a secret jail, two American and one Honduran official said. According to Mr. Caballero, the agent was a regular contact between the interrogators and the C.I.A. Thus {{it seems likely that}} the C.I.A. was aware that killings were continuing.|$|R
5000|$|For a time, Schleifstein {{was hidden}} {{by his father}} {{with the help of}} two anti-fascist German prisoners, but he was {{eventually}} discovered. The SS guards took a liking to him and came to treat him as a [...] "camp mascot", having a small camp uniform made for him and having him take part in morning appells, where he would salute the guard and report, [...] "All prisoners accounted for." [...] Nonetheless, when there were formal inspections by visiting Nazi officials, Schleifstein had to be hidden {{and he said he was}} once lined up for execution but was saved by his father's intervention. His father was valued for his service making saddles and harnesses. Schleifstein also <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> he became very ill and had to live at the camp hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Brunette {{eventually}} surrendered, and Tolsen {{was photographed}} leading him {{away in his}} first arrest of his career. However, in their haste to arrest Brunette, federal agents missed Vandenbush, who easily escaped amid the chaos. The following morning, NYPD Commissioner Lewis Valentine and the New Jersey Police Commissioner issued public statements criticizing the FBIs breaking of its agreement with police and putting lives at risk, while allowing Vandenbush to escape. Hoover dismissed these objections, which he referred to as [...] "unjustified and petty criticism". When Vandenbush was captured by New York authorities two months later, the fugitive claimed {{he had been on}} his way to meet with Brunette but was warned off by the obvious presence of the FBI. He also <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> during the raid he was close enough to [...] "tap J. Edgar Hoover on the shoulder." ...|$|E
5000|$|Flynn {{was once}} opposed to {{waterboarding}} and other extreme interrogation techniques that {{have now been}} banned; however, according to an August 2016 Washington Post article, he <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> {{in the context of}} Trump's apparent openness to reinstating such techniques, that [...] "he would be reluctant to take options off the table." [...] In May 2016, Flynn was asked by an Al Jazeera reporter if he would support Trump's stated plan to [...] "take out the families" [...] of people suspected of being involved in terrorism. In response, Flynn stated, [...] "I would have to see the circumstances of that situation." [...] In an interview with Al Jazeera, Flynn criticized the U.S. reliance on drones as a [...] "failed strategy", stating that [...] "what we have is this continued investment in conflict. The more weapons we give, the more bombs we drop, that just ... fuels the conflict." ...|$|E
50|$|Roughly {{ten minutes}} after the last {{communication}} between Oscar November and air traffic control at St Mary's, a request was made by air traffic control that the St Mary's lifeboat be launched. Shortly thereafter, they also contacted RNAS Culdrose that Oscar November was overdue, and requested that the search and rescue helicopters be put on stand-by. The lifeboat, , launched around midday, {{around the same time}} as the search and rescue helicopter was scrambled from Culdrose. The Navy's Westland Wessex helicopter arrived at the accident site first, but lacking sufficient information to pinpoint the crash location, and with fog banks still around, the pilot landed at St Mary's for more information. Langley-Williams <b>said</b> that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> the helicopter had been right above them, but unable to see them in the fog.|$|R

He says he is haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation's existence. [...] "If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan's very existence would have been in peril".

[...] After moderator Gwen Ifill introduced the candidates, where they came out, Palin asked Biden, [...] "Can I call you Joe?" [...] He replied affirmatively. She <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> [...] "I may not answer the questions the way the moderator and you want to hear." [...] Critics said she was avoiding the debate itself, while her supporters could make the claim that she was answering the questions to [...] "Joe six-pack" [...] or [...] "hockey moms."
