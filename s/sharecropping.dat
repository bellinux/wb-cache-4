5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a <b>sharecropping</b> system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house {{in exchange for a}} third or a half of their crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, <b>sharecropping</b> was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced labor of imprisoned black men and women, through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end with the Civil War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, <b>Sharecropping</b> and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E
40|$|We {{tested a}} {{theoretical}} model with the Marshallian inefficiency (H 1) and threat of eviction (H 2) hypotheses having opposite effects on land productivity on <b>sharecropped</b> plots. The model also assumes that kinship contracts may eliminate or reduce the Marshallian inefficiency (H 3) and threat of eviction (H 4) effects on land productivity. Our empirical findings {{were consistent with}} H 2 and H 4 being true. We found higher land productivity on <b>sharecropped</b> plots than on share tenants' own plots and higher land productivity on <b>sharecropped</b> plots of nonkin than of kin tenants. The nature of the data allowed controlling for unobservable household characteristics through household fixed effects and for observable plot characteristics. Analyses with and without plot characteristics revealed that these findings were stronger with plot characteristics than without them. Based on the plausible assumption that observable plot characteristics are positively correlated with unobservable plot characteristics this strengthens our conclusion. The results are also supported by first-order stochastic dominance analysis. <b>Sharecropped</b> plots' output value distribution unambiguously dominated the output value distribution from share tenants' own plots. Nonkin <b>sharecropped</b> plots' output value distribution also first-order stochastically dominated the output value distribution from kin <b>sharecrop</b> plots.

5|$|The Fasci Siciliani , {{short for}} Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily {{in the years}} between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained {{the support of the}} poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of <b>sharecropping</b> and rental contracts.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or <b>sharecropping</b> in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{industry}} attracted people {{from within the}} borders of the United States, and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the South, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative <b>sharecropping</b> system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, {{increasing}} mechanization virtually {{brought the}} institution of <b>sharecropping</b> {{to an end in}} the United States. The <b>sharecropping</b> system in the U.S. increased during the Great Depression with the creation of tenant farmers following the failure of many small farms throughout the Dustbowl. Traditional <b>sharecropping</b> declined after mechanization of farm work became economical in the mid-20th century. As a result, many sharecroppers were forced off the farms, and migrated to cities to work in factories, or become migrant workers in the Western United States during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Maggie {{pointed out}} that <b>sharecropping</b> was {{economically}} inefficient in a free market. However, many outside factors make it efficient. One factor is slave emancipation: <b>sharecropping</b> provided the freed slaves of the USA, Brazil and the late Roman Empire with land access. It is efficient also {{as a way of}} escaping inflation, hence its rise in 16th-century France and Italy.|$|E
25|$|In settler {{colonies of}} colonial Africa, <b>sharecropping</b> was {{a feature of}} the {{agricultural}} life. White farmers, who owned most of the land, were frequently unable to work the whole of their farm for lack of capital. They therefore allowed African farmers to work the excess on a <b>sharecropping</b> basis. In South Africa the 1913 Natives' Land Act outlawed the ownership of land by Africans in areas designated for white ownership and effectively reduced the status of most sharecroppers to tenant farmers and then to farm laborers. In the 1960s, generous subsidies to white farmers meant that most farmers could afford to work their entire farms, and <b>sharecropping</b> faded out.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>sharecropping</b> {{system was}} {{primarily}} a post-Civil War development, it did exist in antebellum Mississippi, especially in the northeastern part of the state, an area with few slaves or plantations, and most likely existed in Tennessee. <b>Sharecropping,</b> along with tenant farming, was a dominant form in the cotton South from the 1870s to the 1950s, among both blacks and whites.|$|E
25|$|Jeffery Paige made a {{distinction}} between centralized <b>sharecropping</b> found on cotton plantations and the decentralized <b>sharecropping</b> with other crops. The former is characterized by political conservatism and long lasting tenure. Tenants {{are tied to the}} landlord through the plantation store. Their work is heavily supervised as slave plantations were. This form of tenure tends to be replaced by wage slavery as markets penetrate. Decentralized <b>sharecropping</b> involves virtually no role for the landlord: plots are scattered, peasants manage their own labor and the landowners do not manufacture the crops. Leases are very short which leads to peasant radicalism. This form of tenure becomes more common when markets penetrate.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{models on}} moral hazard provide {{competing}} predictions on the incentive-risk relationship. These predictions are derived under {{the assumptions of}} homogeneous agents and exogenous risk. However, the existing empirical evidence {{does not account for}} risk-aversion heterogeneity and risk endogeneity. This paper uses a well-built database on tenancy contracts to address these issues. Detailed information on cropping activities is used to measure the exogenous risk. Risk-aversion heterogeneity and other self-selection problems are addressed through a portfolio schedule and a subsample of farmers who simultaneously own and <b>sharecrop</b> different farms. This controlled exercise finds a direct relation between incentives and exogenous risk...|$|R

25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of <b>sharecropping,</b> such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from <b>sharecropping,</b> it was useful {{to have as many}} Blacks as possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sharecropping</b> {{is a form}} of {{agriculture}} in which a landowner allows a tenant to use the land in return for a share of the crops produced on their portion of land. <b>Sharecropping</b> has a long history and there are a wide range of different situations and types of agreements that have used a form of the system.

50|$|The 1971 census {{revealed}} {{that there were}} 616,700 farms in Haiti, and that an average holding of 1.4 hectares consisted of several plots of less than 1 hectare.

The survey concluded that the largest farms made up only 3 {{percent of the total}} number of farms and that they comprised less than 20 percent of the total land. It also documented that 60 percent of farmers owned their land, although some lacked official title to it. Twenty-eight percent of all farmers rented and <b>sharecropped</b> land.

25|$|In Reconstruction-era United States, <b>sharecropping</b> {{was one of}} {{few options}} for penniless freedmen to support {{themselves}} and their families. Other solutions included the crop-lien system (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the former slave rents his land but keeps his entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage, but keeps none of their crop). <b>Sharecropping</b> {{was by far the}} most economically efficient, as it provided incentives for workers to produce a bigger harvest. It was a stage beyond simple hired labor, because the sharecropper had an annual contract. During Reconstruction, the federal Freedmen's Bureau ordered the arrangements and wrote and enforced the contracts.|$|E

30|$|Land reform did {{not change}} women’s {{subordinate}} status, {{which was based on}} deep-rooted traditional values and beliefs. Despite women’s role, their position in decision making is documented to be minimal. Men tend to control the income from crops and livestock commodities where women dominate or share the workload such as field crops, vegetables and tree planting. Only in female-headed households do women control the decisions regarding use of agricultural technologies; yet this still tends to be in consultation with their male relatives (Anteneh 2008). Such lack of decision making power over land prohibited women to determine the types of crops to be planted, the type of decisions should be passed on the improvement of land, to either <b>sharecrop</b> or rent the farm land, whether to use fertilizers and other farm technologies, and whether and when to hire labour. The information collected from the informants and FGD reveals that only less valued assets such as hens, egg, animal products; like milk and butter were allowed for women. Men usually avoided consulting their wives especially on matters which requires serious decision making like leasing/selling land.|$|R
