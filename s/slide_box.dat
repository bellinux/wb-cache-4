40|$|Perfect {{preservation}} of cytoplasmic and nuclear detail {{is essential in}} cytology: even transient drying of a smear either before or after fixation is deleterious. This creates a problem for a postal cytodiagnostic service as bottles containing inflammable fixative may not be posted. Various rehydration techniques (Bonime, 1961; Koss and Durfee, 1961) have been tried and found unsatis-factory. Dipping the fixed slide in glycerine (Ayre and Dakin, 1946) is satisfactory but makes handling some-what unpleasant. The fixative detailed below appears {{to solve the problem}} by leaving, after evaporation, a waxy protective film over the smear. Absolute alcohol ' [...] 100 ml. Carbowax (1500) [...] 3 0 g. Glacial acetic acid [...] 0 - 2 ml. (to pH 5 8 - 6 0) If the fixative cannot be collected from the laboratory, the carbowax and acetic acid may be dissolved in 5 - 0 ml. of warm distilled water. This small quantity of base material can be sent through the post and the alcohol added by the receiving clinic. The fixative is applied from a plastic dropping bottle on to the smear immediately it has been made and while it is still wet. The slide is then left on a flat surface, not near heat, for about five or 10 minutes during which time the alcohol will evaporate and a waxy film will be left over the smear. The slide is put in a 4 in. x 1 in. trans-parent plastic bag: several of these then go into a wooden postal <b>slide</b> <b>box</b> of conventional pattern. Slides with a ground area at one end are used in this service: the patient's name can be written in pencil on this area for identification purposes.

The method is simple and cheap and there is no danger of contamination between slides.

40|$|Background. Since {{many years}} the in vitro {{electronic}} length determination has been obtained embedding extracted teeth in an alginate mass. It {{is possible that}} the dehydration of the material can influence the measurements; this event can happen especially if the measurements are multiple and different electronic apex locators (EAL) are tested. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficacy of an alginate model in conditions of constant humidity and after drying out. Methodology. Fifty teeth have been selected and the crowns sectioned at the level of the CEJ; the roots have been embedded with the lip electrode of two EALs in an alginate mass into a closable <b>slide</b> <b>box.</b> At the beginning the working length (WL) was taken using the visual-tactile method (VT); as the alginate had hardened the teeth were measured with the units Apit and RootZX at t 0, at t 1 (after 1 h) at relative humidity 100 %, and at t 2 (after 24 h) leaving the alginate exposed to the air in order to dehydrate it. NaOCl had been injected into the canals. At the end the collected data were analyzed using the Student's t-test for paired samples. Results. The mean WL calculated values are here : (1) Apit t 0 = 23, 70 (2, 24); (2) Root t 0 = 23, 88 (2, 17); (3) Apit t 1 = 23, 61 (2, 25); (4) Root t 1 = 23, 78 (2, 17); (5) Apit t 2 = 23, 87 (2, 28); (6) Root t 2 = 23, 88 (2, 32); (7) VT= 23, 99 (2, 25). The following differences has been noted: 1 vs 2, 1 vs 5, 1 vs 5 (p< 0, 05); 4 vs 7 (p< 0, 01); 3 vs 4 (p< 0, 005); 1 vs 7, 2 vs 3, 3 vs 5, 3 vs 6, 3 vs 7 (p< 0, 001). Conclusions. At constant relative humidity the simplified alginate method results reliable to apprehend discrepancies between different devices; the Apit gives slightly shorter WL values than Root ZX. In desiccate conditions the measured values have been higher and are comparable to the VT method; it is also noteworthy that the differences between the two EAL disappear...|$|E

Harvest {{tissue and}} rinse in PBS or saline. - Immerse tissue in 4 % paraformaldehyde/ 0. 1 M sodium {{phosphate}} buffer pH 7. 4 (recipe follows) at 4 °C for 1 - 3 hrs. Try to avoid overnight fixation if possible as this causes problems with tissue adherence on slides during the hybridization procedure. - Immerse tissue in sterile 15 % sucrose/ 1 xPBS (recipe follows) 3 hrs. to overnight at 4 °C. - Embed tissue in O. C. T. (Baxter No. M 7148 - 4), M 1 (Lipshaw) {{or any other}} convenient embedding matrix for frozen sectioning in plastic embedding molds (. Tissue should be oriented in the block appropriately for sectioning (cross-section, longitudinal etc.). Note the tissue number on the block directly for reference. - Freeze tissue block in liquid nitrogen. Place the bottom third (aproximately) of the block into the liquid nitrogen, allow to freeze until all but {{the center of the}} O. C. T. is frozen, and allow freezing to conclude on dry ice. - Store tissue blocks at - 70 °C in a sealed container or wrapped in foil and ship on dry ice. It is also possible to use fresh frozen tissue for in situ hybridization if the paraformaldehyde/sucrose method is not feasible. Tissues should be rinsed in saline or PBS and frozen in O. C. T. blocks in liquid nitrogen as outlined above. Although not optimal, it is also possible to use snap frozen material tissue without an embedding matrix. The fixation, sucrose, and O. C. T. steps are used primarily to improve the tissue morphology. It is expected that the fixation times outlined above will not result in complete fixation of large pieces of tissue. However, the additional fixation step {{at the beginning of the}} in situ hybridization procedure should ensure adequate fixation of such tissues prior to hybridization. This protocol has been used successfully on large (up to 1 cubic cm) and small (1 cubic mm) tissue samples. 4 **% Paraformaldehyde** - Mix in a two liter flask: - 200 ml 0. 5 M NaPO 4, pH 7. 4 - 800 ml depcH 20 - Heat to 70 °C with stirring on hot plate in fume hood - Add 40 g Paraformaldehyde (EM grade, Polysciences, Cat No. 0380) - Once the solution has cleared (it should take 5 minutes or less), filter with a side-arm flask, Buchner funnel and Whatman No. 2 filter paper. - Immediately pour the solution into a one liter bottle which has been packed in ice. This cools the solution quickly and prevents breakdown of the paraformaldehyde. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks. ** 15 % Sucrose in PBS:** - 500 ml sterile PBS - 75 g "RNase free" sucrose - Mix above and filter sterilize with a disposable Nalgene filtration unit type S(0. 45 micron). Store at 4 °C. **USE OF FISHERBRAND SUPERFROST/PLUS MICROSCOPE SLIDES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** We use Fisherbrand SuperFrost/Plus positively-charged microscope slides (Cat. No. 12 - 550 - 15) for all of our frozen tissue sectioning and have very good tissue retention on slides after an in situ hybridization experiment. SuperFrost/Plus slides require no preparation time prior to cryosectioning and are competitive in terms of labor cost and reagent expenses. **SECTIONING OF FROZEN TISSUES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** 1. Frozen tissues prepared as described can be wrapped and stored for many years prior to sectioning, without loss of the mRNA signal. The biggest problem with stored tissue blocks is that they tend to dessicate if not properly wrapped and the O. C. T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound) can be difficult to cut. - Blocks should be removed from the - 70 °C freezer and allowed to equilabrate with the cryostat chamber temperature. Tissues can be cut at any convenient temperature (- 15 to - 35 °C) as needed. Most tissues cut well at - 15 °C (brain, kidney, liver, vessels, muscle, etc.) however fatty or more difficult tissues (adipose tissue, skin, lung) require temperatures as low as - 35 °C or less to obtain good sections. Care should be taken not to touch the face of the slides but handle by the edges only. Frozen sections 5 - 7 µm (thinner is OK but thicker, over 10 µm, may present problems for visualizing mRNA in situ) should be cut, thaw-mounted onto room-temperature slides, and immediately refrozen by placing slides with sections into a <b>slide</b> <b>box</b> (VWR micro <b>slide</b> <b>box</b> # 48444 - 003) with a single dessicant capsule (Humi-Cap see below). When the box is full, place the top on the box and store at - 70 °C. Sections cut and stored with dessicant are stable for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for most antigens for over 5 years...|$|E

Heidcamp ### Materials 1. ^ 3 H-Thymidine, {{specific}} activity of 2. 0 - curie/millimole - Onion sets, jars and toothpicks - Alcohol-acetic acid fixative - Materials for feulgen reaction (Exercise 2. 4) - Paraffin embedding, sectioning equipment - Kodak Nuclear Track Emulsion (or equivalent) - Darkroom - Water bath at 42 ° C - Kodak D 19 Developer - Kodak Fixer - Xylol, Permount and coverslips - Microscope ### Procedure 1. Carefully read and follow all precautions for the safe handling of radioactive materials ([Appendix H]([URL] - Place toothpicks into {{the sides of}} an onion and set the onion {{into the top of}} a small jar or beaker. Fill the jar with water and allow the onion to begin root development (3 - 7 days). Mild aeration of the water will assist in the growth of the roots. - Set up another beaker, containing a 10 µ /ml solution of ^ 3 H-thymidine such that there are approximately 10 µc/ml, transfer the onion and its growing roots to the jar containing the radioactive thymidine. - Allow the roots to stay in the radioactive solution for 1 hour at room temperature. - Remove the onion and hold the bulb over a beaker containing water. Rinse the onion roots by dipping several times in the beaker. Transfer the bulb to yet another beaker of aerated water and allow to remain in this beaker for four hours. - Cut off the roots tips and fix in alcohol-acetic acid (3 : 1) overnight. Change the fixative after the first four hours. - Wash the roots in water for several minutes and place in 1 N HCl at 60 ° C for 12 minutes. - Stain the root tips with the Feulgen Reaction as given in Steps 3. b- 3. e of [Exercise 2. 5]([URL] - Dehydrate the root tips, embed in paraffin and section at 10 - 15 microns. Mount on microscope slides. - Deparaffinize in xylol and rehydrate sections by passing first through a series of alcohols and finally in two changes of water. - In a dark room melt some liquid autoradiographic emulsion at a water bath at 42 ° C. - Place two slides back-to-back and dip slowly into the melted emulsion. Remove, allow to drain and place in an appropriate light-proof container and allow them to dry in a vertical position. - When dry, place the slides into an opaque <b>slide</b> <b>box</b> containing drierite. Wrap in aluminum foil and place in a refrigerator. - The slides must stay in the refrigerator until a proper exposure has been made. This can vary from 5 days to over two weeks. After one week, a trial slide should be developed using Steps 15 and 16 below. Examine the slide at 10 X with a bright field microscope and look for the presence of black silver grains located over the cells. A correct exposure is determined by the appearance of silver grains over the cells, but few or no silver grains located in areas without cells. If the appearance of the trial slide is correct, then the remainder should be processed immediately. Repeat an additional trial slide in 2 - 3 days, and repeat every three days thereafter until an adequate exposure is obtained. - Develop the autoradiogram emulsion in the darkroom as follows: - Develop in Kodak D- 19 Developer at 20 ° C for 3 minutes. - Wash for 10 seconds in distilled water. - Fix with Kodak Fixer for 3 minutes. - Wash in running water for 15 minutes. - Dehydrate by placing in 95 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Place in 100 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Clear in two changes of xylol for 3 minutes each. - Mount coverslip with Permount. - Draw and label the autoradiograms in the space provided on the following page. Calculate the percent of cells actively undergoing DNA synthesis during the time of exposure to radioactive thymidine. Note that the tissue and the silver grains are in different planes of focus and you will need to constantly switch focus from one plane to the other. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Drawing of thymidine incorporation ### Notes This procedure involves the incorporation of a radioactive substance into a cell, and subsequent detection of that material {{through the use of a}} photographic emulsion. The primary source used for cell biology is an organic molecule containing tritium, the radioactive form of hydrogen. Radioactive carbon, phosphorous and iodine are occasionally utilized, but tritium has inherently more resolution than any of the others. Tritiated thymidine (^ 3 H-thymidine) is often used, for example, to study the synthesis and location of DNA. Thymidine is a soluble base which is specific to DNA. It is incorporated into the macromolecular structure of DNA during synthesis and replication of the chromosomes. Upon fixing the cells for standard histological examination, the DNA molecules (with their incorporated, radioactive, thymidine) are precipitated or cross-linked as permanent parts of the cell. Un-incorporated thymidine is removed from the cell, as it remains soluble and is disposed of in the tissue washing procedures. When the tissues are sectioned and applied to a glass slide, they will contain radioactive nuclei, but only those nuclei that were in the S phase of division during the exposure of the cells to ^ 3 H-thymidine. Radioactive sources can not be detected directly, but if a photographic emulsion is applied directly over the section, it will become exposed by the radioactive source. When the photographic emulsion is subsequently processed (i. e. developed), the exposed portions of the emulsion will contain reduced silver grains in direct proportion to the amount of radiation being given off beneath it (in the nuclei of our example). If the exposed, developed slides are now examined with a microscope, there will be two layers of interest. Focusing the microscope on the tissue itself will give a view of the tissue and cell architecture. If the focus of the microscope is moved upward, however, the cells will go out of focus, exactly as the photographic emulsion comes into focus. Within the emulsion will be areas of reduced silver grains and clear areas containing no silver grains. By alternately focusing on the tissue and the emulsion, those nuclei that are radioactive can be readily identified. If desired, the number of silver grains could be counted to give a quantitative measure of ^ 3 H- thymidine incorporation (and thus DNA synthesis), although this is a rather complex procedure to control, with any significant accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory General notes: The same {{procedures}} {{are used to}} fix and stain cells for SEM and for TEM. Cells can be fixed using conventional [glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation]([URL] described for transmission electron microscopy. To preserve ciliary orientation, use the "instant fixation" protocol described here. With this method, the cortex and ciliary beat form is well preserved but the cytoplasm is poorly preserved and membrane breakage and blebbing on the cell surface is evident. To suspend cells, use a wide bore pipette and gentle flow to avoid damaging cells. Polypropylene disposable Pasteur pipettes work very well for all procedures. Carry out all fixation procedures in a properly vented fume hood. Supplies and most EM chemicals {{can be obtained from}} Electron Microscope Sciences, Ernest F. Fullum, Ladd Research Industries, Polysciences, Ted Pella, and Bio-Rad. ### Instant fixation **Materials:** - Polypropylene conical centrifuge tube (Falcon 35 - 2097 or equivalent) - Ice in ice bucket **Solutions:** - 200 mM stock solution of sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7. 2 - 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate (allow a few hours to dissolve) - Deionized water Glutaraldehyde - 10 % or 25 % stocks in sealed ampoules - Osmium tetroxide - 4 % solution in deionized water. To prepare, score and break an ampoule containing crystalline OsO 4 and drop the open ampoule into a small amber jar. Add appropriate amount of deionized water and let dissolve at room temperature for several days. Store in a second jar at 4 degrees C. OsO 4 tends to evaporate and blacken surfaces, so the second jar is highly recommended. It is best to use a separate refrigerator for fixatives. OsO 4 solutions also can be frozen in small aliquots and stored at - 20 degrees C. Fix: 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde, 2 % OsO 4, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7. 2 Mix glutaraldehyde and cacodylate. Add OsO 4 and mix immediately before adding to cells. ### Procedure: 1. Harvest cells in a clinical or appropriate low speed centrifuge. Centrifuge to obtain a loose pellet of cells (setting # 3, 5 min with a clinical centrifuge). - (Optional, but produces cleaner cell surface) Gently pellet cells from the culture medium and suspend in room temperature HNMK (50 mM HEPES, pH 6. 9, 36 mM NaCl, 0. 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM KCl) at a concentration of 106 - 108 cells/ml. Put in a shallow container and gently agitate for 10 - 30 min at room temperature to aerate cells. - Decant most of the medium/HNMK and suspend cells in a slurry (< 1 ml of remaining medium or HNMK). Transfer to a 16 ml polypropylene conical centrifuge tube. - Rapidly add the freshly prepared glutaraldehyde-OsO 4, mixture, mix well, and immediately put the tube in ice. Fix for 30 - 60 min. If the solution turns black, pellet the cells, remove the fix, and add a fresh aliquot of a freshly prepared mixture of glutaraldehyde-OsO 4. - Wash cells at least 3 times with deionized water at room temperature. If necessary, gently pellet cells during each wash. - Suspend cells in 0. 5 - 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate and leave at room temperature for at least 1 hr. Cells can be stored for weeks in uranyl acetate. - Proceed to ethanol dehydration and critical point drying (SEM) or acetone dehydration and embedding (TEM), below. ### Critical point drying We use one of two methods. **Method 1 :** This is preferred but requires microporous specimen capsules (# 4620; Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), which cost ~$ 2. 00 each. 1. Dehydrate uranyl acetate-treated cells in a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). If possible, use ethanol dried over molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corp. #M 2260). Dehydrate in polypropylene conical centrifuge tubes and let cells settle between washes. - Place specimen capsule in a shallow dish (ex: glass petri dish) containing 100 % dry ethanol and transfer dehydrated cells into the capsule. Do not fill the capsule more than about one third full with cells or they will cake during the drying procedure. Firmly fit the lid to the capsule and transfer to the critical point dryer. - If more than one sample capsule will be dried at the same time, label the outside of each capsule with pencil and/or insert a tiny piece of paper (marked with pencil) into the capsule before capping. - Critical point dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. - Dust the dried cells on a SEM specimen stub covered with a piece of double stick tape. Spreading is easier if cells are brushed on the tape with a fine camel hair brush while observing spreading with a dissecting microscope. - Coat specimens on the stubs with gold/palladium using a sputter coater. - Store specimens in a dry container. **Method 2 :** This method is simple but requires that cells or organelles stick to a coated glass coverslip. Many cells are lost during the dehydration procedure but, usually, more than enough cells will stick for SEM observation. 1. Place a 12 mm circular coverslip on a piece of Parafilm or in a small plastic or glass petri dish. - Apply a drop of an 0. 5 % aqueous solution of polyethylenimine (Sigma P- 3143) to the coverslip. Let sit for 10 - 20 min. - Remove the drop of polyethylenimine and rinse with one or two drops of deionized water. - Put a drop of fixed cells in water or uranyl acetate on the coverslip and let settle for 5 - 10 min. - Dehydrate samples with a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). For the last, washes, use ethanol dried by molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corporation, Cat #M 2260). Many cells will detach from the coverslips during the dehydration procedure. This can be minimized if solutions are removed with a pipette held vertically over the specimens. - Dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. Use a cover-slip holder designed for the dryer or prop the coverslips on a plastic separator removed from a typical microscope <b>slide</b> <b>box.</b> - Remove the coverslips from the dryer and attach them to SEM specimen stubs using double stick tape or adhesive tabs (# 76760 from Electron Microscopy Sciences). - Coat specimens with gold/palladium (60 - 40) using a [sputter coater]([URL] - Store specimens in a dry container...|$|E

On the other hand, addition of cyt-B is the most critical part of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) technique that cannot be omitted. Thus, modification of the traditional CBMn assay seems to be necessary. In this paper, we attempt to troubleshoot this problem and show that the CBMn assay {{can be used in}} embryonic stem cells research, particularly as a reliable tool in monitoring the cytogenetic integrity of cells. The potential reasons of the observed induction of apoptosis in mESCs are also discussed. The full text pdf version of this protocol can be accessed [here]([URL] ### Introduction Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) are pluripotent cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round to oval nuclei, basophilic cytoplasm and round shaped cells that are traditionally co-cultured with “feeder” cells. The use of stem cells in research emphasizes the need to confirm their genetic integrity after different manipulations. For this purpose, many techniques with different capabilities have been used thus far, but most are expensive, time consuming, need special instruments and training. Adopting simple methods for stem cell research is a necessary step for stem cells in large-scale research projects, particularly in pharmaceutical bio-monitoring. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay is a reliable and precise method for assessing chromosome damage. 1 Basically, MNi originate from acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes not included in the main nuclei following DNA replication and nuclear division 2. Although it has been a century since Howell and Jolly described Feulgen-positive nuclear bodies in human reticulocytes, also known as Howell-Jolly bodies 3, the term micronucleus (MN) was suggested for the first time by Boller, Schmidt and Heddle in the early 1970 s 4. In our study cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) was performed as previously described by Fenech 5 with adaptation. It has been shown that CBMn assay provides a simple method to detect the genotoxic potential of mutagens after in vivo and in vitro exposure to biologic systems 6. ### Reagents 1. 2 -Mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) - Concentration of stock solution is 14. 3 M (pure liquid), for Preparation working solution of 2 -mercaptoethanol, dissolve 70 µl of 2 -mercaptoethanol stock solution (14. 3 M) in 10 ml of PBS; sterilize by filtration and store in a dark, cool place. 2 -mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent that can break down many toxic metabolites produced by cells in cultures, thus improving the environment surrounding the cells. Mouse cells are indeed very sensitive to oxidative metabolites; therefore 2 -mercaptoethanol is principally used in culturing these cells. - Bisbenzimide H 33258, (Calbiochem, 382061, 100 mg) - Dulbecco´s phosphate-buffered saline without Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + (D-PBS-) (Sigma; D 5652).

Once thawed, FBS will remain stable at 4 ºC for 3 – 4 weeks. - Caution: Avoid repeated refreezing FBS which has been thawed. - Gelatin (Sigma; G 2500) - Gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of water-soluble proteins with high average molecular weight that are present in collagen. The change on a gelatin molecule and its isoelectric point are primarily due to the carboxyl amino and guanidine groups on the side chains of it. - L-glutamine solution (Gibco; 25030 - 024) - 200 mM sterile solution, cell culture tested. - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGROTM; 13275) - This cytokine is often used to assist with maintaining the pluripotency of mESCs. - Mitomycin C powder (Sigma; M 0503) - Prepare fresh before use. Notice that the amount of Mit-C in a culture medium (at 38 ºC) that contains antibiotics and serum, decreases over time. - Non-essential amino acid (Gibco; 11140 - 035). Store aliquots in fridge - Thymidine powder (Sigma; T 1895) - Trypsin-EDTA (1 x) in HBSS without Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + (Gibco; 25300 - 054) - The optimal activity of trypsin is in a partially alkaline (pH 7. 8 - 8. 7) environment with no Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions. **REAGENT SETUP** - BD Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences; cat. # 354277) - Since Matrigel™ matrix forms a gel above 10 °C; it should be kept at a low temperature. Therefore, all equipment and reagents (tips, Matrigel™ matrix solution, etc.) should be chilled on ice prior to use. For the preparation of Matrigel™, add 350 µl from the stock solution to 6 ml of cool medium. Thaw Matrigel™ at 4 ºC. - Cytochalasin-B (Sigma; C 6762) - Dissolve 5 mg solid Cytochalasin-B in 1 ml DMSO to give a Cyt-B concentration of 5000 µg/ml as follows (1000 x solution) : - i. Remove the cyt-B vial from - 20 ºC and place at room temperature. Do not remove the seal. - ii. Sterilize the top of the rubber seal with 70 % ethanol and allow the ethanol to evaporate. - iii. Vent the vial’s seal aseptically. With a 2. 5 ml sterile syringe, inject 1 ml DMSO through the seal. - iv. Mix contents gently. Cytochalasin-B dissolves readily in DMSO. - v. Mix and dispense 50 µl of 1000 x stock solution aliquots into sterile, 0. 5 ml polystyrene tubes. Date and label tubes with “cyt-B”. - vi. Store at - 20 ºC for up to 12 months. The vials of powder are guaranteed by Sigma for 2 years if stored at - 20 ºC. - vii. For preparation of 100 x and 10 x cyt-B, add 450 µL and 4950 µL DMEM, respectively. - Caution: Cytochalasin-B is toxic and it can be a possible teratogen agent. It must always be purchased in sealed vials. The preparation of this reagent must be carried out in a cytoguard cabinet. - DMEM: The culture medium needed for feeder layer growth. - 1. DMEM (Gibco; 12800 - 116) 13. 5 g/l - 2. NaHCO 3 (Sigma; S- 5761) 3. 7 g/l - 3. Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco; 15070 - 063) 10 ml/L - 4. HCl (1 N) 3 ml/L - 5. 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) 7 µL - Add these components to 837 ml of cell culture grade de-ionized water filter and store in dark, cool conditions. Adjust the pH to 0. 2 - 0. 3 units below the desired working pH (7. 0 - 7. 4) by adding 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl with stirring. The pH of bicarbonate buffered solutions usually raises 0. 1 – 0. 2 units during filtration. - ES-cell medium - 1. Knock-out™ DMEM (Gibco; 10829 - 018) 500 ml - 2. Penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; 15070 - 063) 5 ml - 3. Non-essential amino acid (Gibco; 11140 - 035) 5 ml - 4. 2 -mercaptoethanol (Sigma; M- 7522) 0. 5 ml - 5. ES-FCS (Gibco; 16141 - 079) 75 ml - Aliquot and store at 4 ºC in a dark place. For 50 ml KO-DMEM, 500 µl of L-glutamine and 50 µl LIF 1 are needed. - Caution: Periodic discontinuation of antibiotic use is recommended for several reasons. First, questionable cell culture techniques can be masked; antibiotic-resistant organisms may arise, and finally, cryptic microbial contamination may be present and masked by antibiotic use. - Gelatin treatment of flasks - i. Add 3 - 4 ml of 0. 1 % sterile gelatin to cover the bottom of the T- 25 flask. - ii. Let the gelatin sit for 1 hour at 37 ºC. Sitting longer is also acceptable. - iii. Remove excess fluid from the coated surface and allow to air dry under a laminar flow hood for approximately 1 / 2 hour (alternatively can allow to air dry overnight). - iv. Rinse with sterile tissue culture grade water or a balanced salt solution before adding the media and/or cells (optimal condition for attachment must be determined for each cell line and application). - Hoechst 33258 stock solution Preparation: - Stock solutions of most of the dyes are prepared in PBS at concentrations of 1. 0 mg/ml. However, DAPI and the Hoechst dyes should be prepared in distilled water since at relatively high concentrations these dyes tend to precipitate in PBS. Stock solutions are refrigerated in dark-colored containers or wrapped in foil 7. - Caution: This material is harmful if inhaled, by contact with skin and if swallowed. - The Bisbenzimide Hoechst dyes are designated by numbers 33258, 33342 and 34580. As with H 33258, Hoechst stain H 33342 is used for staining DNA. It binds to AT-rich sequences (in the minor groove) without intercalation 8. H 33342 exhibits 10 -fold greater cell permeability than H 33258. DAPI and H 33258 only stain vital cells, while H 33342 stains vital and dead cell types 9, with blue emission when examine with fluorescent microscopy. H 33258 gives a more stable reaction compared with Hoechst 33342 10. The dye is excited at 365 nm and the filter (emission) is 418 nm 8. - Mitomycin-C treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) - i. Aspirate media from day 14 mEF that are confluent in a T- 75 flask. - ii. Add 200 µl Mit-C to 10 ml of culture medium and incubate for 90 minutes at 37 ºC. - iii. Aspirate off the media and wash three times with 5 ml of PBS- to remove any trace of Mit-C. - iv. Trypsinize and resuspend the cells in growth medium and add 2. 5 × 106 cells to each pre-gelatinized T- 25 flask that contains growth medium adjusted to the appropriate pH. Rotate and distribute the cell suspension evenly {{on the surface of the}} flask. Cell attachment of fibroblasts cells usually takes place within 1 - 2 hours. - Caution: Cells that are being passaged are unable to adjust to the pH of the medium for an amount of time prior to attachment and re-initiation of metabolic activity. The passage time is a particularly critical period that can be achieved by prewarming the flask that contains growth medium in a CO 2 incubator or aseptically gassing each flask with 5 % CO 2. - Mitomycin-C should be stored in the dark since it is readily decomposed by light. - Caution: i. Appropriate protection must be done while working with mitomycin-c. Wearing suitable protection is recommended. - Mounting media - Slides are mounted in PBS/glycerol (1 : 1). - Caution: First, check components for auto fluorescence. Residual auto fluorescent mounting medium can be removed by the offset of imaging software. Once aqueous mounting media is made, it should be stored in small (10 - 30 ml) screw-capped bottles or vials made of transparent glass or plastic. - Preparation of thymidine - ii. Dissolve 0. 1816 g of thymidine powder in 10 ml PBS to give a 75 mM thymidine solution (stock solution). - iii. Add 100 µl of stock solution to 3 ml of culture medium (final thymidine concentration is 2. 5 mM). ### Procedure mESC culture medium preparation: General culture conditions are well established 11 and usually require ES (embryonic stem) cells to be grown on a Mit-C (M 0503; Sigma, Germany) treated mitotically-inactive mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) as feeder cell layer in a gelatin (G 2500; Sigma) -coated tissue culture flask (90025; TPP) [Fig. 1]. mESC line RB 1 12 maintained in ES cell medium consisted of Knockout-DMEM (10829 - 018; Gibco, UK) supplemented with 15 % ES-qualified FCS (10439 - 024; Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (15039 - 027; Gibco), 0. 1 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol (M 7522; Sigma), 1 % nonessential amino acid stock (11140 - 035; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (15070 - 063; Gibco). Tip: Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) are used in co-cultures to provide secreted factors (paracrine element), extracellular matrix (juxtacrine signaling) and cellular contacts for the maintenance of stem cells in an undifferentiated state without losing their pluripotency. Thus, they are also called feeder cells. Subculture of the cells - i. Prewarm all reagents. - ii. Aspirate all medium from the culture vessel. - iii. Rinse the culture twice with 2 ml PBS-, gently rock the vessel for 30 sec and remove the buffer to dispose of all traces of medium containing FBS. - iv. Add the appropriate amount of trypsin to each flask to cover the entire surface of the flask. Incubate the culture at room temperature for approximately 1 minute. Rock the flask for 4 - 5 times quickly back and forth such that the trypsin coats the cells. After 1 minute incubation, wash the culture vigorously by pipetting the trypsin solution up and down over the cells such that the small amount of fluid in the flask shears the loosely attached cells off and dissociates the clumps. - v. Inactive the trypsin by adding fresh, complete medium. Be sure to triturate thoroughly to achieve a single cell suspension before inactivating. Replate as desired. Synchronization protocol for mESCs - i. Add 2 mM thymidine for 16 hours at 25 - 30 % confluency of the stem cell culture. - ii. Remove thymidine by washing with 1 x PBS. Add fresh KO-DMEM complete medium for 4 hours to release cells. Cells progress synchronously through the G 2 - and mitotic phases. Hypotonization Based on criteria by Fenech 13 for the selection of bi-nucleate cells suitable for scoring MNi, a bi-nucleate cell can be scored only if the nuclear boundaries of each nucleus are distinguishable. In addition, the cytoplasmic membrane of bi-nucleated cells must be intact and clearly distinct from adjacent cells. Thus, it is important that mESCs harvested properly without any damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. Micronucleus assay in isolated lymphocyte or cell lines culture does not require hypotonic treatment during harvesting. Hypotonic treatment may destroy necrotic and apoptotic cells, making them unavailable for assay 13. On the other hand, mESCs have a large nucleus surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm. According to the all above items mentioned it seems the hypotonic treatment of mESCs is necessary and cannot be omitted. Harvest & slide making - i. Treat ES cells grown on mEF with 4 µg/ml cyt-B (c- 6762; Sigma) for 14 hours. - ii. Trypsinize the cells and spin them down at 800 g for 6 minutes. - iii. Resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping the tube. Add about 4 ml of hypotonic solution. - iv. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, spin down the cells again and fix the pellet with cool Carnoy`s fixative (methanol: acetic acid; 3 : 1) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Disperse cells before {{the addition of}} fixative. - v. Change the fixative twice. - vi. Drop the suspension on wet slides previously cleaned with ethanol. - vii. Air-dry the slides. Stain with Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem; 382061) and rhodamin B (Sigma; R 6626). - viii. Examine slides under a microscope equipped with fluorescent optic (Olympus Bx 51). Cells are scored blindly for MN presence. In our study, the frequency was expressed as number of MNi per one bi-nucleated cell (mean± SD). Critical: Do not air-dry slides for longer than 10 minutes, otherwise cell and molecular morphology become altered, it makes difficult to score the slides. Store the slides in a microscope <b>slide</b> <b>box</b> in a cool, dry and dust-free cupboard. Scoring: We examined one thousand bi-nucleated cells to measure MN formation in each slide prepared per sample (treated and control). For more details, we followed the Fenech 13. Pause point: Fluorescent stained slides can be stored at 4 ºC for 1 month. Criteria of micronuclei screening MNi are morphologically identical to, but smaller than nuclei and have the following characteristics: - (a) The diameter of MNi in human lymphocytes usually varies between 1 / 16 and 1 / 3 of the mean diameter of the main nuclei, which is corresponded to 1 / 256 and 1 / 9 of the main nuclei area in a BN cell, respectively. - (b) MNi are non-refractile and therefore, can be readily distinguished from artifacts such as staining particles. - (c) MNi are not linked or connected to the main nuclei. - (d) MNi may touch but not overlap the main nuclei. The micronuclear boundary should be distinguishable from the nuclear boundary. - (e) MNi usually have the same staining intensity as the main nuclei [Fig. 2], but occasionally their staining may be more intense 13 (For review see Fenech, 2007). Statistical analysis: We used the t-test to evaluate MN formation induced by genotoxic agents. ### Timing - Monday (8 am- 8 pm); during this period mESCs seeded on mEF and make small colonies. - Monday-Tuesday (8 pm- 12 am); inoculate thymidine to each flask and incubate for 16 h to achieve synchronized mESCs. - Tuesday (12 am- 4 pm); Wash to release from the thymidine block and incubate for 4 hours with fresh medium. - Tuesday-Wednesday (4 pm- 8 am) in which cells are cultured for 14 h in media containing Cyt-B. - Note: Cells that suffer any type of cytotoxic and genotoxic shock may go into cell cycle arrest, thus bi-nucleate cells become less than expected. It must be borne in mind that after any treatment, the cell cycle becomes longer than before. ### Troubleshooting - Screening criteria - To keep mESCs growing with maintenance of differentiation potency, they definitely need to grow on a feeder layer (mitotically inactivated mEF). Therefore, at the time of screening the slides, how should one distinguish between mESCs and feeder cells? - There is a tremendous difference between the nuclei of these two cell types that cannot be overlooked. The nuclei of mESCs are smaller than fibroblastic cells and are round, too. Feeder cells have oval nuclei which are sometimes fragmented. The ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm in mESCs is larger than feeder cells. - At the time of feeder layer preparation from fibroblastic cells, they must become mitotically inactivated by mitomycin-c treatment or gamma irradiation; therefore these cells do not undergo further proliferation. During screening, there will not be any telophasic mEF cells in prepared slides, thus all the bi-nucleated cells are stem cells. - Slides crowded with cells that clumped - Excessive amount of cell suspension was used. - Dilute the cell suspension with additional fixative. - Cell pellet was not dispersed before the addition of fixative. - Loosen final cell pellet vigorously either before or just after addition of fixative. - Too few/no bi-nucleated cells; - Thymidine was inadequately removed. - Continue washing cells with fresh medium. - Cell Lysis was occurred during fixation steps. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellet in fixative. - The Cells progressed through telophase. - Increase cytochalasin-B concentration or incubation time. - Cells membrane lysis occurred. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellets during fixation steps. Re-suspend the cells gently by tapping the tube. - Add cool fixative drop wise during first fixation step. - Micronucleus boundary is overlapped with the nuclear boundary; - Cells were insufficiently swollen. - Check the KCl hypotonic solution. Increase the time/temperature of incubation in hypotonic solution. - Existence of three or more nucleated cells; - The time of incubation with cyt-B was too long. - Adjust the culture time until bi-nucleated cells appear. ### Anticipated Results The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) is a reliable and relatively easy method used for many years by scientists for biological assessments. Relative accuracy, simplicity, multi-potentiality, large tissue applicability of CBMn assay technology and its potency to become automated have made it a fascinating technology during last decades and will play a key role in mutagenicity assessment in the future. This technique is mostly used for lymphocytes and it has been not provided for embryonic stem cells study. In our study, routine CBMn led to unacceptable, substandard, unexplainable results. Although the entire process was based on the standard methods, however most of the mESCs population underwent DNA fragmentation [Fig. 3]! To avoid occurrence of this problem, factors that might contribute to DNA fragmentation of mESCs in some circumstances such as attachment factors 14 - 16, LIF concentration 17, cyt-B concentration 18, 19 were considered, however no significant effect were found. It has been showed that incubation of mESCs with cytochalasin-B (an anti-actin drug) caused marked alterations in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization 19. We observed same results in our study, that after treatment of mESCs colonies with Cyt-B, the cell attachment to each other and feeder layer (mEF) were essentially reduced, cells rounded up, and consequently cells were disaggregated. It has been postulated that single cell suspensions of mESCs lead to leakage oxidative phosphorilation components from mitochondria, these cells finally become committed to apoptosis, whereas this process was suppressed when they proliferated in aggregates 20. According to above descriptions, modification of the timing of the standard protocol of CBMn assay for mESCs is the best way to solve this problem because reducing the incubation time, decrease the chance of detachment of cells from substrate. Tauchi et al. showed that the best time for apoptosis analysis is 16 hours after treatment with toxic agents when there is a raise in the apoptosis rate and approximately most of the apoptotic cells are in the late stage of apoptosis 21. We have observed the same outcome in mESCs (Results not showed). ...|$|E
