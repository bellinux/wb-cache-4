Curs acadèmic 2013 - 2014 Learning {{a second}} {{language}} is a really tough work for most people. Apart from the social constraints that the learner may encounter, {{in the form of}} lack of time or resources, there are some others which range from physiological to psychological. At Castelló Escola Oficial d’Idiomes, the students that begin A levels of English are mostly people who have never had any contact with any kind of language-learning, which is a difficulty for them, but also most of them are over 25 years old, which makes it even more difficult for them to achieve success. In our school we follow the guidelines of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and work the five skills for language reception (listening and reading) <b>and</b> language production (writing, <b>spoken</b> production <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction).</b> We have noticed that the most difficult skills for our students at this level are those related with speaking: <b>spoken</b> production <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> One fact that we teachers have identified is classroom language anxiety, which our students suffer in different degrees, from adding some difficulty to speak to completely impeding it. Teachers deploy a number of strategies to try to avoid or at least to reduce the impact of language anxiety on our students, but it always depends on how successful the teacher is with a given group of students. We have identified that there are some causes for classroom language anxiety and we have tried to reduce as much as possible the influence of one of the causes of language anxiety on our students. For that we have designed a study that consists in eliminating a negative stimulus in order to also eliminate its response: our students experience fear to make mistakes when speaking English in the classroom and that fear makes them be over concentrated on what they say {{in such a way that}} they forget about pronunciation and intonation, with the result of a very poor performance in these two aspects. The strategy studied consists in convincing our students that what they say is correct so that they only have to pay attention to how they say their messages...|$|R
40|$|Assessing ELF in European universities: the {{challenges}} ahead The {{past decade has}} seen a number of calls to attempt to test English as a Lingua France, {{but there has been}} a dearth of research in response, in higher education as elsewhere. This chapter looks at an attempt to redress the balance, in ongoing research at the University of Ca’ Foscari Venice. It reports on the development of an on-line receptive skills test with an ELF element, created in response to a needs analysis carried out among students from a range of academic disciplines, and suggests that such a test is unproblematic conceptually, and realistic in terms of students’ perceptions of needs. More problematic is the assessment of the productive skills. In {{the second part of the}} chapter tentative proposals are made about the form a productive skills test in ELF in an academic context might take – in particular, a test of speaking skills which would be appropriate for English Taught Programmes (ETPs). The CEFR conveniently distinguishes between <b>spoken</b> production <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction,</b> both of which have a role to play in academic contexts (and therefore assessment). For the former, proposals are made about the use of student presentations, which have become a standard feature of continuous assessment in ETPs at MA level. The tentative proposals then put forward to incorporate <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction</b> into a putative test of ELF speaking skills are informed by a classification of speaking strategies, such as accommodation and code-switching, drawn up as part of a year-long study at the Venice International University, an English language humanities faculty in Venice. These clearly show that in the co-construction of meaning which is at the heart of the communicative event the role of the interlocutor is vital; but in a test of ELF interaction so too is the role of the examiner, who is called to be part of this co-construction. In an ELF exam, the examiner thus needs to be part of the ELF context, and not simply a detached observer ticking a checklist of formal features...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis addresses {{the question of whether}} or not online interactional practices are systematically different from interaction in other contexts, particularly <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> I will establish how the organization of online interaction demonstrates participants orientations to the technological affordances of the online medium. The dataset for the study comprises one-to-one interaction between friends, conducted using the chat application of the social networking site, Facebook. Chat logs and screen capture data were used to analyze how participants engaged in, and managed, their unfolding interaction. The data were analyzed using conversation analysis (CA). CA was developed originally for the analysis of spoken talk, but in this dissertation it provides an empirical basis for comparing Facebook chat <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> The thesis demonstrates how CA can be used for analyzing online interaction. The first analytic chapter provides an overview of how participants organize the generic orders of interaction. The findings suggest that participants draw on their knowledge of both <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> written <b>interaction</b> when managing the particular interactional constraints and affordances of Facebook chat. The second analytic chapter focuses on chat openings, comparing them to openings in <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> The findings reveal some similarities, but also systematic differences which orient to the design of the chat software. The third analytic chapter examines topic management, including topic-initiation, topic change and the management of simultaneous topics. The findings suggest that the CA categorization of topic-initiating turns could potentially be extended by also analyzing action-orientation and also the epistemic stance displayed. The analysis also reveals remarkable similarities between topic change in <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>and</b> in Facebook chat. Finally in this chapter I show how organizational components of <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction,</b> such as adjacency pairs and tying techniques, are used to manage simultaneous topics. The final analytic chapter focuses on self-repair in Facebook chat. The analysis reveals that self-repairs completed during message construction orient to the same interactional contingencies as self-repairs in <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> However, the affordances of Facebook chat enable these repairs to be hidden from the recipient. Visible repairs tend to be corrections, with the affordances impacting the sequential placement of such repairs. Finally, I show how participants self-repair in response to the actions of their co-participant. Overall, the findings reveal a number of similarities between the organization of Facebook chat <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction.</b> The analysis also reveals that participants attend to the technological affordances of Facebook in a variety of ways. Finally, this thesis demonstrates that, while there are differences between the interactional practices of <b>spoken</b> <b>and</b> online written <b>interaction,</b> CA can be used to analyze, and subsequently explain, such differences. ...|$|R

Students of Petra I Senior High School which {{is the subject of}} the present study also experience anxiety problem. 	The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> presentational English <b>speaking</b> ability. Heaton (1990 : 100) classified speaking ability into three subskills which covers <b>speaking</b> accuracy, fluency, <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> comprehensibility. Based on this classification the writer also investigates correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> each of <b>speaking</b> ability subskills. 	One part of statistical method of research that is correlation analysis is used to analyze the data to find out the degree of correlation between variables. Pearson product moment correlation is a measurement of relationship between variables. 	The result of the study revealed that there is a negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> presentational English <b>speaking</b> performance score. <b>And</b> there is also a negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> each <b>speaking</b> ability subskills. The correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> presentational English <b>speaking</b> performance is r= - 0. 914, p<. 01. Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> accuracy is r = - 0. 790, p<. 01, Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> fluency is r = - 0. 782, and Pearson correlation coefficient between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> comprehensibility is r = - 0. 843. The more anxious the subject, the worse their presentational English <b>speaking</b> performance score <b>and</b> all <b>speaking</b> ability subskills’ score. 	Finally, it can be concluded that there is a strong negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> presentational English <b>speaking</b> ability. The more anxious the subject the worse the subject speaking ability score. There is also a strong negative correlation between <b>speaking</b> anxiety <b>and</b> each of <b>speaking</b> ability subskills.

Contributors present a wide range of lively data from private as well as institutional contexts, produced by speakers across all life stages and from a number of different ethnic, social, national and linguistic backgrounds. Questions examined in the volume include: • How does gender interact with sexuality, social class, ethnicity, life-stage in private and institutional talk? • What is the relationship between local interactional practices or identity positions, and larger-scale structures like ideologies or national employment statistics? • Which methodological and analytical frameworks can be employed for the exploration of gender <b>and</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction?</b> • How can the analysis of <b>spoken</b> <b>interaction</b> contribute to traditional feminist debates about gender inequality? These questions will be explored on the basis of spoken interactional data from British school children; adolescents from working and middle-class backgrounds; London private school girls; British Asian university students; UK and New Zealand company directors <b>and</b> employees; male-identified Hindi-English <b>speaking</b> women in New Delhi; and Austrian Jewish refugees...|$|R
