This request {{had come from the}} Ops Room and had been worded {{carefully}} so as not to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> order; only the commander on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use. As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected {{just in front of the}} vehicle by an electricity cable.|$|E

[...] He described the words of 2003's Bananas as [...] "politics mostly." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian was broadly {{positive}} about the film: [...] "It's still playing to full houses, {{and you can see}} why. Slick it may be. But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie {{are not the only ones}} who will come out grinning.", though he found the movie [...] "stubbornly un-macho" [...] for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted [...] "Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year." ...|$|E

The soundtrack was recorded by {{performance of a}} 44-piece orchestra, recorded twice and merged to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> 88-piece orchestra. It was composed by Inon Zur and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia. According to Zur, he intentionally made most of the soundtrack feel [...] "dark", combining low brass and bass string instruments with ancient drums to express a feeling that is both heroic and demonic. One of the tracks, [...] "Leliana's Song", was composed in under 24 hours. The soundtrack was presented at a panel in the Hollywood Music in Media Interactive Conference in 2009, and was performed {{as part of the}} September 26 [...] "A Night in Fantasia 2009" [...] concert in Sydney, Australia, by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra.|$|E

His gospel album He Touched Me, {{released}} that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award, for Best Inspirational Performance. A 14-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. The evening concert on July 10 was recorded and issued in LP form a week later. [...] became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single [...] "Burning Love" [...] was released—Presley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. [...] "The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up'", wrote rock critic Robert Christgau. [...] "Who else could make 'It's coming closer, the flames are now licking my body' <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> assignation with James Brown's backup band?" ...|$|E
500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it {{four out of five}} stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a [...] "softer and more prolific edge". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called [...] "Diamonds" [...] a catchy song and felt that it had the potential to be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does not <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a [...] "personal shift" [...] for Rihanna. According to James Montgomery of MTV News, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is more positive than previous singles such as [...] "We Found Love" [...] and [...] "Where Have You Been", despite its moderate tempo. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. Contactmusic's reviewer described it as a [...] "laid-back track", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown. In a track-by-track review of Unapologetic, Andrew Hampp of Billboard found the song inspiring and commented that it [...] "finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date". Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic, and gave it three and a half stars.|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, he spoke of the song giving Kesha a [...] "hussy image" [...] but {{described}} the lyrics in a positive manner. Levine said the use of auto-tune was [...] "fun" [...] and described Dr. Luke's backing track as [...] "bouncy" [...] and [...] "bubblegummy". The review highlighted the song's chorus with Levine calling it [...] "stonking great" [...] and [...] "completely trashy in the best possible way." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic called the track [...] "fun", listing it as one of the album's best tracks. David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound felt that the song was effective in what it was trying to do, writing: [...] "Trashy and rambunctious, it’s a brash summer anthem about getting drunk and partying hard. World rocking it might not be, but as a piece of disposable pop it captures a moment and boasts a huge hook which, really, is all you need to rule the radio, TV and ringtone airwaves." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly listed the song as the recommended download off of Animal, writing that [...] "her Valley Girl sneer with electro-glam arrangements that make brushing one's teeth 'with a bottle of Jack' <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> awesome way to kill the morning-after blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell's next American films, American Outlaws (2001) and Hart's War (2002), {{were not}} commercially successful. His 2002–2003 films, {{including}} Phone Booth, The Recruit and S.W.A.T. (all thrillers, {{with the former}} two his first starring roles), were well received by critics and successful at the box office. Of Phone Booth, Ebert wrote that it is [...] "Farrell's to win or lose, since he's onscreen most of the time, and he shows energy and intensity". Philip French of The Observer praised Farrell's performance. In S.W.A.T., the actor starred in an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Olivier Martinez and Jeremy Renner; Renner became a friend. Alan Morrison of Empire wrote, [...] "Farrell can usually be relied upon to bring a spark to the bonfire. That's also true of [...]" [...] Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times criticised Farrell's accent, writing that he [...] "employ a wobbly American accent that makes him <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> international criminal {{a step ahead of}} the authorities". Ebert and the New York Timess A.O. Scott disagreed on the actor's effectiveness in The Recruit; Ebert noted the actor's likability, but Scott felt that Farrell [...] "spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy, trying to maintain his leading-man sang-froid while registering panic, stress and confusion". Phone Booth earned $46.6million, S.W.A.T. $116.9million and The Recruit $52.8million at the box office.|$|E

500|$|The fictional company Isodyne Energy, who is {{involved}} with nuclear testing in the desert, {{was influenced by the}} real life 1940s companies such as Radiodyne, General Atomic or the beginnings of the Jet Propulsion Lab, [...] "all of which were in L.A. in the '40s, and were developing the space program and were developing nukes." [...] Additionally, the season avoids depicting real life Hollywood stars from the 1940s because [...] "the focus would shift from story to: does that person look or <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actor?" [...] Instead, the character Whitney Frost is depicted as an actress [...] "who will have a part to play in our larger storyline." [...] The season introduces the Council of Nine, based on the Secret Empire, who [...] "meet at the Arena Club, which is like this social club of white guys. They're just the guys who sort of run the world. They have orchestrated assassinations. We insinuate that they orchestrated the 1929 Stock Market crash." [...] Members of the Council include powerful businessmen Calvin Chadwick and Hugh Jones, and their influence extends to [...] "high levels of the government" [...] as seen with War Department veteran Vernon Masters. Despite close similarities between the 'A' symbol of the Arena Club and a Hydra symbol introduced in the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fazekas stated that she [...] "would not say" [...] there was a connection between the Council and Hydra.|$|E

It’s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... I can now say with certainty that it’s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.|$|E

[...] Daniel Rivera of PopMatters cited the album as Robyn's [...] "most honest and infectious outing to date" [...] and noted that [...] "the most impressive thing about Robyn is just how timeless it is proving to be." [...] Stylus Magazine's Jessica Popper wrote that the album [...] "manages to combine several of the currently popular music genres whilst still making a perfect pop album [...] It's {{one of the few}} Europop albums that not only deserves worldwide domination, but also has a really good chance of achieving it." [...] In a review for the Manchester Evening News, Paul Taylor described the album as [...] "undeniably sexy" [...] and dubbed Robyn [...] "a mini-Madonna in the making". Billboards Jill Menze commended the album for its [...] "sassy and sweet dance pop gems". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau commented that he was [...] " [...] disoriented by the hype for 'With Every Heartbeat' [...] But without that add-on, which does grow on you the way pop breakthroughs will sometimes, this 2005 EU release might never have materialized here to prepare the way for Robyn 2010". James Hunter of The Village Voice complimented its [...] "fast electro arrangements tending toward the geometric" [...] and found that [...] " [...] appeal is questionable when she tries to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American rapper, but on tracks where she just sings [...] she gives Europop a swift Swedish energy and presence".
