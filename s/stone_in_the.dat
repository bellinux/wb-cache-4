The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US), was {{published}} by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998. Rowling started to write the Prisoner of Azkaban the day after she finished The Chamber of Secrets.|$|E
5|$|Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined Norman medieval castle on {{the western}} side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the {{original}} moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th century and {{played an important role in}} the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{found it}} {{difficult}} to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US). After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E
5|$|Structure 68 {{is in the}} West Group. A part of {{the western}} side of the {{structure}} has been cut by a modern road.

5|$|The main {{building}} material is Kentish rag-stone, although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide {{details in the}} Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17thand 18thcenturies. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18thcentury, only two original– albeit restored– examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level.|$|E

5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England {{in the newly}} {{completed}} Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, {{the first of the}} many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in <b>stone,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of Christchurch's unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of Canterbury. Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|By 1786, {{the rest}} of the manor except for the {{gatehouse}} had been destroyed; Grose recorded a local tradition stating that Thomas Cecil and Sir Christopher Wandesford had used the <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction of Snape Castle and Kirklington Hall respectively in the late 16th century. In 1976, the tower passed into the guardianship of the state and was then restored and opened to the public. In the 21st century it is operated by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the small}} town of Clare in Suffolk, England. Built shortly after the Norman conquest of England by Richard Fitz Gilbert, the motte and bailey castle was later {{improved}} in <b>stone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 14th century the castle was the home of Elizabeth de Clare, one of the richest women in England, who maintained a substantial household there. The castle passed into the hands of the Crown, and by the 16th century was in ruins. Damaged by the construction of the Great Eastern Railway through the castle in 1867, the remains of the castle are now part of a local park and a scheduled monument and a grade 2* listed building.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, 150 local Jews {{were killed}} in a pogrom in the castle keep, most of them {{committed}} suicide in order not to fall to the hands of the mob. Henry III rebuilt the castle in <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse. During the Scottish wars between 1298 and 1338, York Castle was frequently used as the centre of royal administration across England, as well as an important military base of operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's <b>Stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States), {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of British author J.

After eight auditions, producer David Heyman told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint {{that they had been}} cast for the roles of the school friends Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. Rowling supported Watson from her first screen test.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} career, Teller made {{contributions}} to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects), and surface physics. His extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in {{the form of}} the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions) provided an important stepping <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Launceston Castle {{is located}} in the town of Launceston, Cornwall, England. It was {{probably}} built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068, and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte in one corner. Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall, with a large community packed within the walls of its bailey. It was rebuilt in <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227, including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands. When Richard's son, Edmund, inherited the castle, he moved the earldom's administration to Lostwithiel, triggering the castle's decline. By 1337, the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes.|$|E
5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and <b>stone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E
5|$|The book {{tells the}} story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious <b>stone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. Not knowing the stone's origin or worth, he {{attempts}} to use it as payment to a butcher. A dragon he later names Saphira hatches from the stone, which was really an egg. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out the general location of the egg he sends the Ra'zac to acquire it. By that time Saphira had been growing for a while and takes Eragon to the Spine after Ra'zac appear in their village Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown, with a storyteller called Brom, and decide to search for the Varden, a group of rebels who want the downfall of Galbatorix.|$|E
