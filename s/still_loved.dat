5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana <b>still</b> <b>loved</b> Clark and Clark <b>still</b> <b>loved</b> her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and <b>still</b> <b>loved</b> her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
