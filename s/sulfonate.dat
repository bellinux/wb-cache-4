Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol <b>sulfonate</b> all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of <b>sulfonated</b> polysulfone (SPSU) membrane as potential candidates for proton exchange membrane through sulfonation process. <b>Sulfonated</b> polysulfone membranes have been prepared by conducting sulfonation reaction at room temperature with a mild <b>sulfonating</b> agent, trimethylsilyl chlorosulfonate (TMSCS). The membranes were <b>sulfonated</b> with different molar ratio of <b>sulfonating</b> agent to the polymer repeat unit. The degree of sulfonation was determined by elemental analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) was performed to verify the sulfonation reaction on the polysulfone polymer. The <b>sulfonated</b> polysulfone membranes have been characterized by ion exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake and proton conductivity {{as a function of}} molar ratio and degree of sulfonation. It was shown that increases in the molar ratio of the <b>sulfonating</b> agent to polysulfone repeat unit lead to an increasing degree of sulfonation. The water uptake of the <b>sulfonated</b> polysulfone membrane was increased with an increase in degree of sulfonation from 4. 1 wt. % up to 26 wt. % with the value of IEC about 0. 62 mmol/g and 1. 78 mmol/g respectively.

25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer.

Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
