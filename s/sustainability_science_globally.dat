40|$|Work towards {{creation}} of a knowledge sharing system for <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> {{through the application of}} semantic data modeling is described. An ontology grounded in description logics was developed based on the ISO 15926 data model to describe three types of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> conceptualizations: situational knowledge, analytic methods, and scenario frameworks. Semantic statements were then created using this ontology to describe expert knowledge expressed in research proposals and papers related to <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> and in scenarios for achieving sustainable societies. Semantic matching based on logic and rule-based inference was used to quantify the conceptual overlap of semantic statements, which shows the semantic similarity of topics studied by different researchers in <b>sustainability</b> <b>science,</b> similarities that might be unknown to the researchers themselves...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sustainability</b> <b>science</b> {{is being}} {{developed}} in constructive tension between a descriptive-analytical and a transformational mode. The first is concerned with analyzing problems in coupled human-environment systems, whereas the second conducts research on practical solutions to those problems. Transformational sustainability research is confronted with the challenges of generating actionable knowledge, incorporating knowledge from outside academia, and dealing with different values and political interests. This study approaches the theory and promise of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> through a comparative appraisal of five empirical <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> projects. We exemplarily appraise in how far <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> succeeds and fails in yielding solution options for sustainability problems based on an evaluative framework (that accounts for the particularities of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science).</b> The selected <b>sustainability</b> projects cover a range of topics (water, bioenergy, land use, solar energy, urban development), regions (from coastal to mountainous, from rural to urban areas, in several countries in Africa, Europe, and South and North America), spatial levels (from village to country levels), and research approaches. The comparative results indicate accomplishments regarding problem focus and basic transformational research methodology, but also highlight deficits regarding stakeholder participation, actionable results, and larger impacts. We conclude with {{suggestions on how to}} fully realize the potential of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> as a solution-oriented endeavor, including advanced collaborative research settings, advances in transformational research methodologies, cross-case generalization, as well as reducing institutional barriers...|$|R

50|$|The attempt, by <b>sustainability</b> <b>science,</b> to {{understand}} the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government.

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> aims to {{understand}} the complex and dynamic interactions between natural and human systems in order to transform and develop these in a sustainable manner. As sustainability problems cut across diverse academic disciplines, ranging from the natural sciences to {{the social sciences and}} humanities, interdisciplinarity has become a central idea to the realm of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science.</b> Yet, for addressing complicated, real-world sustainability problems, interdisciplinarity per se does not suffice. Active collaboration with various stakeholders throughout society-transdisciplinarity-must form another critical component of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science.</b> In addition to implementing interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in practice, higher education institutions also need to deal with the challenges of institutionalization. In this article, drawing on the experiences of selected higher education academic programs on sustainability, we discuss academic, institutional, and societal challenges in <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> and explore the potential of uniting education, research and societal contributions to form a systematic and integrated response to the sustainability crisis...|$|R
40|$|This paper gathers {{evidence}} from the current crisis in sustainability, which indeed has led to unsustainable global, social and human systems, to reaffirm the increasing importance of the business sector, {{not only in terms}} of its central role in the achievement of the current unsustainable path, but above all the role still to be played by business in the transition towards sustainability. Principally, this review focuses on the concept of business sustainability and calls for the necessity of collaboration between industry and academia within the context of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science.</b> To provide a reasoned and robust argument, the main co-operation modalities and best practice currently applied out of the <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> paradigm are reviewed. Furthermore, collaborations between industry and academia experienced within the framework of International Conferences on <b>Sustainability</b> <b>Science</b> (ICSS) are analyzed, by describing the founding principles of the innovative scientific paradigm, its evolution and its application to the field. In addition, the manuscript stresses the current relevance of the <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> discipline while attempting to institutionalize a collaborative and participative process, and confronts the expected outcomes with the obstacles faced. Finally, the paper proposes a series of recommendations for conducting successful business–academic collaborations within the framework of <b>sustainability</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sustainability</b> <b>Science</b> is an emerging, transdisciplinary {{academic}} {{field that}} aims {{to help build a}} sustainable global society by drawing on and integrating research from the humanities and the social, natural, medical and engineering sciences. Academic knowledge is combined with that from relevant actors from outside academia, such as policy-makers, businesses, social organizations and citizens. The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and land and water degradation. Since its inception in around the year 2000, and as expressed by a range of proponents in the field, <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> has become an established international platform for interdisciplinary research on complex social problems [1]. This has been done by exploring ways to promote ‘greater integration and cooperation in fulfilling the <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> mandate’ [2]. <b>Sustainability</b> <b>science</b> has thereby become an extremely diverse academic field, yet one with an explicit normative mission. After nearly two decades of sustainability research, it is important to reflect on a major question: what critical knowledge can we gain from <b>sustainability</b> <b>science</b> research on persistent socio-ecological problems and new sustainability challenges...|$|R
