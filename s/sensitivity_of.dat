40|$|The {{robustness}} {{of state}} feedback {{solutions to the}} problem of partial pole placement obtained by a new projection procedure is examined. The projection procedure gives a reduced-order pole assignment problem. It is shown that the <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> the assigned poles in the complete closed-loop system are bounded in terms <b>of</b> the <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> the assigned reduced-order poles, and the <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> the unaltered poles are bounded in terms <b>of</b> the <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding open-loop poles. If the assigned poles are well-separated from the unaltered poles, these bounds are expected to be tight. The projection procedure is described in [3], and techniques for finding robust (or insensitive) solutions to the reduced-order problem are given in [1], [2]...|$|R

5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> 94%.|$|E
