Radar is a day/night all-weather <b>sensor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>imaging</b> radars carried by aircraft or satellites are routinely {{able to achieve}} high-resolution images of target scenes, and to detect and classify stationary and moving targets at operational ranges. Short-range radar techniques {{may be used to}} identify small targets, even buried in the ground or hidden behind building walls. Different frequency bands may be used, for example high frequencies (X-band) may be used to support high bandwidths to give high range resolution, while low frequencies (HF or VHF) are used for foliage penetration to detect targets hidden in forests, or for ground penetration to detect buried targets. The purpose of this contribution is to review the fundamental principles of radar <b>imaging,</b> <b>and</b> to consider the contributions that radar imaging can make in four specific aspects of counterterrorism: through-wall radar imaging, radar detection of buried targets, tomography and detection of concealed weapons, and passive bistatic radar.

40|$|AbstractPiezoelectric microcantilevers (MCs) are {{types of}} MCs {{which can be}} used in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) as a micro-robot, <b>sensor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>imaging</b> actuator. In this paper, the {{vibrating}} motion of piezoelectric MCs in AFM application is analyzed. With respect to the geometrical discontinuities, due to the piezoelectric layer, as well as tip, a non-uniform beam model is chosen for analysis. At first, to determine the accuracy of the non-uniform beam model in simulating the vibrating motion of piezoelectric MC, the simulation results are compared with the experimental ones {{in the absence of the}} tip-sample force. Good agreement of these results indicates the ability of this model in modeling this type of MC. A numerical solution and a Multiple Time Scale (MTS) method are used to study the nonlinear response of the MC near the sample surface. Comparison of results, at the non-contact mode, shows good agreement between the two solving methods at normal equilibrium distances (d≥ 2 nm). The effects of the angle of MC, the probe length, and the geometric dimensions of the piezoelectric layer on the nonlinearity of the system are studied and it then becomes clear that they can affect the frequency response curvature of the curve and the nonlinearity of the system...|$|R

30|$|It is {{challenging}} to constrain the up-dip limit of great earthquake ruptures {{such as the}} 11 March 2011 Tohoku (Mw 9.0) event. The geophysical signals available {{to address this problem}} include seismic and geodetic ground motion recordings, tsunami recordings, aftershock distributions, and in some cases, bathymetric pressure <b>sensors</b> <b>and</b> <b>imaging</b> of coseismic changes in the seafloor. All of these methods have limitations when they are used to image up-dip fault motion in the presence of large deeper fault motions along the megathrust. However, the problem is important; establishing whether or not the up-dip region has failed in a great earthquake is central to assessing the potential for future earthquakes that can be particularly tsunami-genic. The 1907 Sumatra (Kanamori et al., 2010) and 2010 Mentawai (Mw 7.8) (Lay et al., 2011 a) tsunami earthquakes ruptured narrow margins up-dip of deeper great un-derthrusting ruptures, and produced larger tsunami run-ups than did the larger, but deeper events adjacent to them. The occurrence of tsunami earthquakes, which characteristically have long source process times and weak short-period radiation (e.g., Kanamori, 1972; Kanamori and Kikuchi, 1993; Polet and Kanamori, 2000; Bilek and Lay, 2002; Ammon et al., 2006) must involve rather large ocean bottom deformations indicative of large slips on the megathrust or on splay faults (Fukao, 1979; Pelayo and Wiens, 1992). The up-dip limit of co-seismic slip in large earthquakes is also important for consideration of how stresses are communicated to the trench-slope and outer rise intraplate environments, and the potential for tsunamigenic normal faulting ruptures (Kanamori, 1971; Ammon et al., 2008; Lay et al., 2011 c). Given the common presence of a sedimentary wedge and the relatively hydrated conditions likely to exist in a shallow megathrust, it is usually uncertain whether the frictional regime will favor stable sliding or large strain accumulation.|$|E
40|$|Cloud-based {{computing}} infrastructure {{with enormous}} storage capability, coupled with new tools for remotely accessing, analysing and visualising data, is developing at an exponential rate {{in terms of}} the variety and scale of available information. The ‘sensor web’ is an area of particular interest, with many major industries increasingly looking at ways to apply sensor network technologies to develop new products and services. Sensor networks require a scalable model, in which the basic building block, the sensor (or sensing platform) is very low cost to buy, requires no maintenance, and has a very long lifetime (Years). Understandably, attention has therefore focused on sensors that meet these requirements, like thermistors, photodiodes, movement and vibration <b>sensors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>imaging</b> systems. Despite the obvious tremendous value of integrating molecular sensing capabilities into this concept via networked chemical sensors and biosensors, there are no examples of large-scale deployments of such devices. There are a number of reasons why this is so including capital cost, maintenance costs, reliability issues, and the hostile environments to which these devices are typically exposed. These issues are obviously inter-related, and are linked to the degradation of sensitive sensor surfaces that occurs upon deployment. This changes the device response characteristics, which in turn requires integration of calibration procedures into devices. Conventional approaches to liquid handling within chemical sensor platforms drives up the price and complexity, and requires larger form factors for reagent and waste storage. The integration of new concepts for liquid control using fully integrated photo-actuated polymer valves offers a way forward, if issues related to reliability and response characteristics can be solved. In this paper, I will present recent results based on photo-switchable gels that suggest we are moving closer to the realisation of efficient, low-cost microfluidic platforms that could provide the building block for future autonomous chemo/bio-sensing technologies. ...|$|E

The shaping of the fiber tips was based on very different etching rates {{as a result of the}} doping characteristics of specific optical fibers. Technological studies on the influence of the etching gas atmosphere on the temporal tip shaping and the final geometry were performed using undoped and doped silica fibers. The influence of the doping characteristics was investigated in phosphorus-, germanium-, fluorine- and boron-doped glass fibers. Narrow exposed as well as protected internal fiber tips in various shapes and tip radiuses down to less than 15 nm were achieved and characterized geometrically and topologically. For investigations into surface plasmon resonance effects, the fiber tips were coated with nanometer-sized silver layers by means of vapour deposition and finally subjected to an annealing treatment.|$|R
