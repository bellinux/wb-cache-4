40|$|Abstract: Improving {{the steel}} {{properties}} and production processes with reduced energy demand for high strength steels requires improved process control in close {{relation to the}} steel composition. Hot rolling of steel is an energy-intensive process, especially in respect of preheating the steel slabs. The present work was carried out {{with the aim of}} reducing the initial slab temperature {{while at the same time}} improving properties by optimization of the steel composition and process parameters. Optimization of <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> and hot rolling parameters in connection with plate and strip rolling was carried out on low C-Mn high-strength steels microalloyed with Mo-Ti-Nb-B, both in laboratory and full scales processing. The effects of a low <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> temperature, high finish rolling temperature (FRT) during thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) and accelerated cooling rates following hot rolling to RT or to the coiling temperature have been investigated. Improvement of yield strength of the plate has been obtained by lowering the <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> temperature, especially with high cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to room temperature. The results obtained for strip steels also show that a reduced reheating temperature combined with high finish rolling temperatures and cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to a coiling temperature of 450 °C produces very positive microstructures and mechanical properties in the present steels. Lowering the slab reheat temperature reduces energy consumption and accordingly releases less CO 2 into the atmosphere during the thermo-mechanical processing of the present steels...|$|E

Optimal heating for <b>slabs</b> in a <b>reheating</b> furnace is investi-gated numerically to aid in managing energy consumption of the reheating furnace in a hot strip mill, where an arctangent function is applied as the heating curve. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the relationship among the temperature uniformity, discharging target temperature and retention time of the slabs. The results indicate that the temperature difference between the slab surface and the core increases rapidly in the initial period and the maximum value of the temperature difference is close to the inflection point of the heating curve. After that, the internal temperature tends to be uniform. For a given retention time of slabs, it is difficult to simultaneously reach the requirements of discharging target temperature and desired temperature uniformity. A method to evaluate the optimal heating time is thus developed, using the Newton scheme. Some correlations linking the desired temperature uniformity and optimal heating time are established.

40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired.

A total of 14 cases employing different numerical models were simulated with a uniform fuel distribution. Out of the 14 cases, only 11 obtained a converged solution.

The three best cases in terms of both accuracy and computational effort were cases that employed the k-epsilon turbulence model, the Delta Thesis, and a constant absorption coefficient.

During the <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> process, there occurs a partial dissolution of TiN precipitates that subsequently reprecipitates during the hot rolling process. However, this reprecipitation preferentially takes place at crystalline defects which act as nucleation sites. These sites increase with the amount of applied plastic deformation, resulting in smaller precipitates, due to the partial dissolution of larger particles or due to reprecipitation in the nucleation sites. Results indicate a reduction of about 28 % in the average size of the precipitates for samples extracted from hot bands (with deformation) and, therefore, a significant reduction in austenitic grain size, when compared with samples extracted from slabs (with no deformation) ...|$|E

This approach comprises <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> to well defined temperatures, {{a large amount of}} hot deformation below the non-recrystallisation temperature T-nr and accelerated cooling.

In order to decrease the enormous amount of the reheating energy, which is the only heat required in the hot forming process, this works selects a high strength low alloy steel containing vanadium and analyses the dissolution kinetics by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XAS scans for other elements, i. e., titanium and nitrogen have been carried out and discussed for the possibility of the technique to investigate precipitates in microalloyed steels. Vanadium shows rapid dissolution kinetics that as soon as a lower reheating temperature of 1200 °C is reached, most of it is dissolved into the solid solution. This is opposite to titanium whose most fraction is still in TiN after long reheating time at higher temperature in accordance with the application of TiN for the grain boundary pinning during reheating. X-rays absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis of nitrogen shows different form of spectra before and after the reheating process. This indicates that the change in the coordination around the central nitrogen atoms takes place during the reheating interval...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{cooperative}} effort was to evaluate the potential of Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys, such as IC 221 M and IC 396 M, for use as transfer rolls in heating treating furnaces and <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> furnaces used during the normal hot processing of steel ingots into rolled products. Rolls consist of three parts: the center tube section which forms the roll surface {{in direct contact with}} the steel, and the sections welded {{at each end of the}} tube, called trunnions, which bear the load. The work in this CRADA focused on weldments and base materials. The transfer rolls in the furnaces used in the hot processing of steel have been made, almost exclusively, from iron-chromium-nickel heat resistant alloys for over 35 years. The iron-based heat resistant alloys experience a variety of problems when exposed to temperatures above 760 C including: cracking, dimensional instability, and excessive oxidation. Many defects in rolled steel products can be traced directly to rolls used in the processing. Also the demand for higher quality products, spurred in part by competition from foreign producers, requires that various avenues for improving overall quality of rolled steel products be pursued. Initial work done by the Contractor and Metallamics indicated that Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys may perform better than existing iron-chromium-nickel alloys do as transfer rolls in heat treating furnaces. The use of Ni{sub 3 }Al may lead to rolls with longer operational life, improved high temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties, higher quality rolled steel products, and improved energy and operational efficiencies in the hot processing of steel. The goal of the work was to test Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys for the transfer roll application in order to improve process efficiency, minimize waste by virtue of producing rolled steel of higher quality and to enhance the competitiveness of US-based steel producers...|$|E
40|$|Global {{warming and}} air {{pollution}} are the major problems facing the world today. Therefore strict environmental legislation on the emission of harmful gases from motor vehicles has forced the automobile industry to search for alternative materials or new materials for exhaust systems. In order to produce cleaner exhaust gases, the exhaust temperature needs to be increased to approximately 900 oC. Therefore, exhaust manifolds are exposed repeatedly to hot gases as they are nearest to the engine requiring good oxidation resistance, thermal fatigue properties, cold workability and weldability. One such material to meet the above characteristics is AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel, a dual stabilised Ti and Nb ferritic stainless steel. Ti and Nb are added to stainless steel to stabilise C and N due to their high tendency to form carbonitrides (Ti,Nb) (C,N) and laves phase (Fe 2 Nb) and Fe 3 Nb 3 C. With 18 % Cr content, this steel has a good corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. Included in many applications of this steel are those requiring deep drawing and related forming operations. However, the drawability and stretchability of ferritic stainless steels is inferior {{to that of the}} more expensive austenitic stainless steels. For instance, Columbus Stainless has experienced ridging/roping problems at times during the manufacturing process of type AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel. It is believed that this problem is related to crystallographic texture of materials which have effect on formability. The R-value in FSS can be improved through optimisation of chemical composition, which includes reducing the carbon content, and processing conditions such as reducing the <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> temperature, increasing annealing temperature and refining the hot band grain size. Therefore the aim of this research project was firstly to investigate effect of amount of cold reduction and annealing temperature on texture evolution and its influence on formability. The as received 4. 5 mm hot band steel was cold rolled by 62, 78 and 82 % reductions respectively followed by isothermal annealing of each at 900 oC, 950 oC and 1025 oC for 3 minutes. Orientation distribution function (ODF) through X-ray diffractometer (XRD) measurement was used to characterise the crystallographic texture formed in the steel using PANanalytical X’Pert PRO diffractrometer with X’celerator detector and variable divergence. Microstructures were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that steels that received 78 % cold reduction and annealed at 1025 oC recorded the highest Rm-value and lowest ΔR-value which enhances its deep drawing capability. In addition, this steel showed the highest intensity of shifted γ-fibre, notably { 554 } and { 334 }. It can therefore be concluded that the γ-fibre which favours deep drawing, is optimal after 78 % cold reduction and annealing at 1025 oC. The second objective was to investigate the effect of (Nb+Ti) content on the crystallographic texture and the subsequent formability and ridging severity. AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel with different amount of (Nb+Ti) content was used i. e. Steel A (0. 26 Nb+ 0. 2 Ti), Steel B (0. 44 Nb+ 0. 15 Ti) and steel C (0. 7 Nb+ 0. 32 Ti). After a strain of 10 %, steels A exhibited the least resistance against surface ridging with average roughness Ra of 1. 5 μm followed by steels B with an average roughness Ra of 1. 1 μm. Steel C showed the highest resistance to ridging with an average roughness Ra of 0. 64 μm. This was attributed to the increase in carbonitrites (NbTi) (C,N) due to increased (Nb+Ti) content which acted as nucleation sites for γ-fibre.
