30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method for the effective use of both pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap. Thus, we manufactured a wood-porcelain <b>stone</b> <b>composite</b> board, which has excellent waterproof property and incombustibility properties. In addition, we examined the conditions needed to manufacture the wood-porcelain <b>stone</b> <b>composite</b> board as a construction material and evaluated the physical and mechanical properties of this board based on the Japanese Industrial Standard. The main results obtained were as follows: the wood-porcelain <b>stone</b> <b>composite</b> board made from pruned wood and porcelain stone scrap had excellent thickness swelling performance and the board had incombustibility properties that were better than commercial oriented strand board. In both single-layer and three-layer composite boards with weight ratios of porcelain stone particles of 40 %, the internal bond strength exceeded the standard value of type 18 particleboard of JIS A 5908. However, the bending properties of the composite board were inferior to the type 18 particleboard standard. Therefore, it will be necessary to improve the bending properties of the board by changing the particle sizes of both the porcelain stone scrap and the pruned wood component.|$|E
30|$|Many natural mines of {{decorative}} stones {{have been seen}} in the mountainous areas of the province Lorestan (Iran). Due to the traditional harvesting methods, these processes cause irreparable environmental damages. The formulation {{of decorative}} stone consists of travertine stone (TS) and marmarit stone (MS) with stone seeds 8 – 200 and 10 – 200. Cement, water, unsaturated polyester resin and fillers are used in the production of artificial stone composites from lesions of stone factory. The mechanical properties of TS with grain of size 10 – 200 are better than other grains and stones. The compressive strength of the samples was increased by reducing water content to 25  % and increase of unsaturated polyester resin percentage to 12  %. To improve the properties of the samples and minimization of their pores, we used fillers such as calcium carbonate, silica, silane, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Calcium carbonate causes softening and loss of the composite samples. The results showed that use of the fillers including micro-silica, silane and titanium dioxide increases mechanical properties and eliminated close to all pores significantly. Unlike the concrete, artificial <b>stone</b> <b>composite</b> obtained in the absence of water pool showed better properties that increase with time.|$|E

40|$|Regardless {{of whether}} the case of {{processing}} through methods of cutting metal, wood, plastics, <b>stone,</b> <b>composite</b> materials etc., the rake angle (γ) is of major importance for energy efficiency and dynamic behaviour of cutting process, dimensional accuracy, work surface quality and pieces made cost. The paper examines the possibility of establishing the best value for the rake angle supposing two idealizations: one regarding {{the conditions in which}} cutting process takes place, and the second related to the simplifications aiming to facilitate a first stage of theoretical development of mathematical description for the chip forming process. Both idealizations are intended to individualize the influence that has the value of rake angle of the cutting tools on the process of chip forming in order to perceive the meaning of the link between the geometry of the cutting tool with other parameters of chips and by default with the work parameters set to machine-tool. While both validity and applicability of the mathematical relations obtained are negatively marked by the simplifying assumption which was appealed in achieving the approach, the highlighted findings may be good starting points for further research on the kinematics cutting depth and {{in the structure of the}} material being processed...|$|E
40|$|In {{a search}} for an {{effective}} use of both scrap wood and porcelain stone scrap, we manufactured three-layer wood-porcelain <b>stone</b> <b>composite</b> board made from both materials. The objective {{of this study was}} to improve bending strength properties of the board. Pruned branch with leaf (BL), pruned branch without leaf (B), and root-stump (RS) were prepared as raw material of core layer of the board. In board manufacturing, three types of wood particles were prepared as follows: wood particles processed by using an industrial grinder (IG), by using crushing machine (CM), and wood particles mixed both of IG and CM with weight ratio of 1 : 1 (IC). The properties of the board were evaluated based on Japanese Industrial Standard. The main results obtained are as follows: the modulus of rupture values of the board manufactured with B and RS were larger than those of BL regardless of processing methods of raw materials. The modulus of elasticity values of the board manufactured with raw materials processed by using CM were smaller than those of processed by using IG and IC regardless of the types of raw materials. The internal bond strength values of composite board manufactured with B and RS were larger than that of standard value of type 18 Particleboard regardless of processing methods of raw materials. The thickness swelling values of all composite boards in this study were smaller than that of type 18 particleboard standard value...|$|E

40|$|The {{consolidation}} theories considering instant load cannot fully {{reveal the}} consolidation mechanism of a <b>stone</b> column <b>composite</b> foundation {{used in the}} expressway embankments due to the time effect of loading; that is, the expressway embankments are often constructed in several stages for a long time. Meanwhile, owing to the special property that the pile-soil stress ratio is larger than 1, the consolidation theory for sand drain well foundation cannot be used directly in the consolidation analysis of <b>stone</b> column <b>composite</b> foundation. Based {{on the principle that}} the vertical load applied on the composite foundation is shared by the stone column and the surrounding soil, the governing solutions for the <b>stone</b> column <b>composite</b> foundation under a multistage load are established. By virtue of the separation of variables, the corresponding solutions of degree of consolidation for loading stage and maintaining load stage are derived separately. According to the Carrillo theorem, the solution for the average total degree of consolidation of entire composite foundation is also obtained. Finally, the reasonableness of the present solution has been verified by comparing the consolidation curve calculated by the present solution with that measured by site test...|$|R

40|$|A {{shaking table}} model test {{was carried out}} to develop an {{understanding}} of the performance improvement of saturated silty soil ground using <b>stone</b> column <b>composite</b> foundation as reinforcement. It is found that at less than 0. 161 [*]g loading acceleration, soil between piles has not yet been liquefied, the response acceleration scarcely enlarges, and the shear displacement almost does not appear in silty soil. At 0. 252 [*]g loading acceleration, as a result of liquefaction of soil between piles, the response acceleration increases rapidly and reaches its peak, and the shear displacement of silty soil increases significantly. At 0. 325 [*]g loading acceleration, the integral rigidity of foundation decreases greatly, which reduces its capability of vibration transmission and result in the response acceleration amplification coefficient is less than that at the former loading acceleration, but the shear displacement of silty soil further increases. The <b>stone</b> column <b>composite</b> foundation can greatly reduce both the shear displacement and the settlement of ground compared with untreated foundation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis of}} the fire behavior of <b>stone</b> wool <b>composites</b> with stainless steel and gypsum plasterboard linings was performed. The focus was to characterize the micro-scale behavior of stone wool, and identify the main processes occurring in <b>stone</b> wool <b>composites</b> when exposed to heat. Thermogravimetric analysis was applied to two different wools with varying densities and binder content in air and nitrogen atmospheres at 5, 10, and 20 K/min. Results show a low percentage of mass loss that could {{be linked to the}} low fraction of organic binder contained in the wool. Intermediate-scale composite assemblies were tested using the Heat-Transfer Inducing Rate System (H-TRIS). Specimens were composed of stainless steel-stone wool, and gypsum plasterboard-stone wool. Tests were performed at (1) constant low incident heat flux (7 kW/m 2), (2) constant high incident heat flux (60 kW/m 2), and (3) simulated parametric incident heat exposure. The results of these tests help to identify the relevant phenomena that should be taken into account when modelling building assemblies with stone wool cores (i. e. pyrolysis and combustion of the binder, water transport through the cross-section, and burning of paper) ...|$|R

Then the whole construction process of highway <b>stone</b> column reinforced <b>composite</b> foundation is simulated, after 3 years of traffic load, a seismic load was imposed on {{bottom of the}} model. Calculation result show that: in construction and run time period, drainage effect of stone column is significant, when pile length reached to 12 m, maximum pore pressure in middle of stone column reduced to about 4 kPa, when pile length reached to 10 m, effect of pile length on settlement is small; composite foundation has smaller maximum horizontal displacement in stone column; surface and toe of embankment slope is apt to liquefy under seismic load, stone column can eliminate liquefaction potential to a certain extent, especially in composite foundation range...|$|R
40|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>stone</b> is made {{of crushed}} {{materials}} bound by a polymer resin. A design of experimental techniques {{was used to evaluate}} the influence of factors (resin type, use of adhesion promoter, compaction pressure, vibration duration, use of a vacuum, and cure program) on the manufacturing of <b>composite</b> <b>stone.</b> The response variable was flexural strength. A 2 IV 6 - 2 fractional factorial design with five replications was initially used, which showed that resin type, use of adhesion promoter, and a cure program were factors of significant influence, as well as the interaction between them and the interaction between the resin type and the use of adhesion promoter. The data was re-arranged into a full 23 factorial design with ten replications to calculate the influence of these factors. The lack of influence of the other factors suggests that lower pressures should be used to improve the process by employing the surface response methodology...|$|R

40|$|Although {{previous}} {{studies have suggested that}} bacteria may contribute to pigment gallstone formation, the current experiments provide evidence that bacteria have a central role in this process. The studies included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of gallstones, measurements of bacterial adherence to gallstones in vitro, and determination of glycocalyx elaboration by biliary bacteria. Gallstones from 85 patients were studied under SEM. Twenty-five (78 %) of 32 pigment stones had evidence of bacterial microcolonies throughout the interior of the stones. Bacteria were absent from the interior of all 35 cholesterol <b>stones</b> studied. <b>Composite</b> <b>stones</b> (stones with separate pigment and cholesterol portions) showed evidence of bacteria within the pigment portions in 14 (78 %) of 18 cases. Biliary bacteria adhered to the surface of pigment gallstones in vitro in 35 (90 %) of 39 cases, compared with three (8 %) of 39 cholesterol stones. Glycocalyx was elaborated by bacteria isolated from nine (82 %) of 11 patients with either pigment or composite gallstones. One (33 %) of three bacterial species from patients with cholesterol gallstone disease produced glycocalyx. These studies indicate that most pigment gallstones obtained from patients in Western cultures form as a composite of bacteria, bacterial glycocalyx, and pigment solids. Bacteria were found in the majority of black as well as brown pigment stones. These findings serve as the basis of a new theory of pigment stone formation in which bacteria and glycocalyx are postulated to be responsible for the precipitation and subsequent agglomeration of bilirubin pigment. These results also suggest that sepsis is more common in pigment gallstone disease because the stones can serve as a sanctuary for bacteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} and optical properties of technologically interesting pyrolytic carbons formed from cured novolac resin and cured novolac/biomass composites were studied by X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Pyrolysis of the cured materials {{took place at}} temperatures in the range 400 - 1000 degreesC. The most important weight loss, shrinkage and structural changes of pyrolyzed composites are observed at temperatures up to 600 degreesC due to the olive stone component. In the same temperature range, the changes in pyrolyzed novolac are smaller. The spectroscopic analysis shows that novolac pyrolyzed up to 900 degreesC has less defects and disorder than the composites. However, above 900 degreesC, pyrolyzed novolac becomes more disordered compared to the pyrolyzed composites. It is concluded that partial replacement of novolac by olive <b>stone</b> in the <b>composite</b> materials leads {{to the formation of}} a low cost, good quality product...|$|R
