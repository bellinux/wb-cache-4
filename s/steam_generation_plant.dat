The produced steam can directly be used for process heat applications.

In the present paper, a two-phase pressure drop analysis of typical <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants</b> with different layouts is presented. A static model has been developed for this purpose. Parametric studies have shown that, due to the elevated pressure drops, the length of a collector loop within a DSG plant is limited. Consequently, in bigger plants collector loops need to be installed in parallel. In each collector loop so-called Ledinegg instabilities occur. When collector loops are installed in parallel, there are additional flow instabilities. Those parallel flow instabilities occure due to shading of one or several collector loops. Changing pressure drops lead to an unfavourable reallocation of mass flows. In the worst case, steam is superheated and the collectors get damaged due to high temperatures. Ledinegg and parallel flow instabilities can both be reduced by installing an additional flow resistor at the collector loop’s inlet...|$|R

40|$|One {{possible}} way to further reduce levelized costs of electricity of {{concentrated solar thermal}} energy is to directly use water/steam as the primary heat transfer fluid within a concentrated collector field. This socalled direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> offers the opportunity of higher operating temperatures and better exergy efficiency. A technical challenge of the direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> technology compared to oil-driven power cycles is a competitive storage technology for heat transfer fluids with a phase change. Latent heat thermal energy storages are suitable for storing heat at a constant temperature {{and can be used}} for direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> power <b>plants.</b> The calculation of the economic impact of an economically optimized thermal energy storage system, based on a latent heat thermal energy storage system with phase change material, is the main focus of the presented work. To reach that goal, a thermal energy storage system for a direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> power <b>plant</b> with parabolic troughs in the solar field was thermally designed to determine the boundary conditions. This paper discusses the economic impact of the designed thermal energy storage system based on the levelized costs of electricity results, provided via a wide parametric study. A state-of-the-art power cycle with a primary and a secondary heat transfer fluid and a two-tank thermal energy storage is used as a benchmark technology for electricity generation with solar thermal energy.

40|$|Direct steam {{generation}} enables {{the implementation of}} a higher steam temperature for parabolic trough concentrated solar power plants. This leads to much better cycle efficiencies and lower electricity generating costs. For a flexible and more economic operation of such a power plant, it is necessary to develop thermal energy storage systems for the extension of the production time of the power plant. In the case of steam as the heat transfer fluid, it is important to use a storage material that uses latent heat for the storage process. This leads to a minimum of exergy losses during the storage process. In the case of a concentrating solar power plant, superheated steam is needed during the discharging process. This steam cannot be superheated by the latent heat storage system. Therefore, a sensible molten salt storage system is used for this task. In contrast to the state-of-the-art thermal energy storages within the concentrating solar power area of application, a storage system for a direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plant</b> consists of a latent and a sensible storage part. Thus far, no partial load behaviors of sensible and latent heat storage systems have been analyzed in detail. In this work, an optimized fin structure was developed in order to minimize the costs of the latent heat storage.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid en 2015. Director de la Tesis: Manuel Romero Álvarez. Co-director: Javier Muñoz Antón. Tutor: Raúl Sanz MartínElectrolysis {{systems have}} a great {{potential}} for CO 2 -free hydrogen production because its relative simplicity facilitates the interconnection with renewable electrical energy systems like wind and solar. Additionally, this hybridization {{makes it possible to}} interconnect power and fuel networks (natural gas and transport fuel). Thus, hydrogen could be used as energy carrier or a temporary energy storage contributing to strengthen the national energy system by allowing higher penetration of renewables, decreasing external energy dependence and improving energy security. Based on the promising attributes of solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) to reduce electrical consumption by 20 - 25 % versus current alkaline and proton exchange membrane electrolysers, and the capacity of concentrating solar thermal power plants to produce electricity and heat under stable conditions, their hybridization stands for a promising system of large-scale carbon-free hydrogen production process. This study evaluates the integration of a SOEC plant into a direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> solar tower <b>plant</b> in terms of energy and cost. In a first step, both subsystems have been implemented and optimised independently. The evaluation of the implemented quasi steady-state model of a SOEC process reveals that temperature variation along the cells is lower when the electrolyser is operated under thermoneutral conditions along the whole power range. Additionally, this temperature gradient is reduced further when the area specific resistance of the cells varies notoriously with temperature. As consequence of this effect, the SOEC system is capable to operate from 5 - 13 % to 100 % of its maximum capacity. Furthermore, under constant steam conversion operation, the global efficiency of the implemented SOEC electrolysis plant follows a very uniform curve in the range of 92 - 95 % vs. the high heating value of hydrogen. Concerning the solar power plant, a comparison between saturated and superheated direct <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>plants</b> has been done. The simulations show that the advantages of higher performance of solar collectors in saturated steam plants are counterbalance with the increase of the Rankine cycle efficiency with temperature. Nevertheless, in the megawatt range, direct superheated steam dual-receiver solar tower plants are competitive with respect to saturated steam solar plants only at working temperatures higher than 550 ºC. Having optimised both subsystems, several possible configurations of the hybrid plant have been analysed aiming at minimizing the penalties over the solar thermal plant, and maximizing the electrolysis performance. By operating the SOEC system at high pressure, compression work can be reduced drastically and oxygen can be obtained as co-product of the process. Nevertheless, the hybrid plant efficiency is maximized operating the SOEC system at ambient pressure because penalties over the solar plant are minimised. The most efficient integration scheme takes process steam from the low pressure turbine and uses electrolyser's outlet hot streams to preheat the Rankine cycle feed water. Finally, annual yield simulation and economic analysis have been done based on the levelised cost of electricity and hydrogen. The results reveal that the stand-alone solar plant achieves a levelised cost of electricity of 207. 3 €/MWhe. Based on this electricity cost, the resulting levelised cost of hydrogen for the optimal hybrid plant configuration is 11. 7 €/kg. Further analyses of the SOEC system consuming electricity from the grid and heat from a waste hot stream from an industry, reveals a cost reduction above 45 %, 6. 2 €/kg. Thus, a final hybrid plant where process steam is taken from the solar plant while electricity is consumed from the grid has been implemented and evaluated, obtaining a levelised costs of hydrogen of 6. 4 €/kg...|$|R
