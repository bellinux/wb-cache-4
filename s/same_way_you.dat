The transcription of it was very difficult because the huapangueros (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way.

His conversion produced a remarkable effect upon the whole village. Heathen would say to each other on the streets: [...] "The Christian's God has come.

2500|$|In the 1980s, Mark Frost {{worked for}} three years as {{a writer for the}} {{television}} police drama Hill Street Blues, which featured a large cast and extended story lines. Following his success with The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet in 1986, David Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film about the life of Marilyn Monroe, based on the best-selling book Goddess. Lynch recalls being [...] "sort of interested. I loved the idea of this woman in trouble, but I didn't know if I liked it being a real story." [...] Lynch and Frost first worked together on the Goddess screenplay and although the project was dropped by Warner Bros., they became good friends. They went on to work as writer and director for One Saliva Bubble, a film with Steve Martin attached to star, but it was never made either. Lynch's agent, Tony Krantz, encouraged him to do a television show. He took Lynch to Nibblers restaurant in Los Angeles and said, [...] "You should do a show about real life in America—your vision of America the <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> demonstrated it in Blue Velvet." [...] Lynch got an [...] "idea of a small-town thing," [...] and though he and Frost were not keen on it, they decided to humor Krantz. Frost wanted to tell [...] "a sort of Dickensian story about multiple lives in a contained area that could sort of go perpetually." [...] Originally, the show was to be titled North Dakota and set in the Plains region of North Dakota.|$|E
