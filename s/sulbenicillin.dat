In mice infected with sulbenicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible strains, cefsulodin was about 12 to 60 times more active than <b>sulbenicillin</b> {{and had an}} activity similar to gentamicin. In mice, the activity of cefsulodin was independent whether the strains were resistant to gentamicin or not, but it was considerably affected by resistance of the strains to <b>sulbenicillin...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Sulbenicillin,</b> a wide broad {{spectrum}} penicillin, is active against {{a lot of}} gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The AA. studied the activity of this molecule against urinary infections causing germs, by evaluating two parameters: his antiadhesive capability and the Killing curves, in comparison with mezlocillin and piperacillin. An inhibition in adhesive capability of test-germs, due to <b>sulbenicillin</b> was obtained. Furthermore, resulting Killing curves showed more rapidity in action for <b>sulbenicillin</b> than for the two others molecules, versus resistant germs, like P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis...|$|E
40|$|Strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium {{carrying}} R plasmids, {{which were}} obtained from ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. and specified either the type IIIa (TEM-type) or type Va (oxacillin-hydrolyzing) β-lactamase, are resistant not only to ampicillin but also to carbenicillin and <b>sulbenicillin.</b> The latter two derivatives, however, are poorly hydrolyzed in vitro by the β-lactamases. Although values of Km of the enzymes are lower for <b>sulbenicillin</b> and carbenicillin than for ampicillin, the ratios of Vmax to Km for <b>sulbenicillin</b> and carbenicillin are not high enough to explain the high resistance in E. coli bearing the R plasmid. Two mutants of the plasmids conferring a temperature-sensitive ampicillin resistance were induced by nitrosoguanidine treatment. It was confirmed that E. coli CSH 2, harboring the mutant plasmid, produces a temperature-sensitive β-lactamase and is resistant only at low temperatures (below 33 °C), but not at 42 °C, to ampicillin, <b>sulbenicillin,</b> and carbenicillin simultaneously. It is thus concluded that β-lactamase itself {{is responsible for the}} mechanism of resistance not only to ampicillin but also to <b>sulbenicillin</b> and carbenicillin, even though the enzyme as determined in cell-free extracts hydrolyzes the latter two drugs poorly. An unknown barrier for <b>sulbenicillin</b> and carbenicillin directed by β-lactamase in E. coli strains carrying R (bla) plasmids is postulated...|$|E
40|$|Against sulbenicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SCE- 129 was about 10 times more active than <b>sulbenicillin</b> {{and had a}} similar {{activity}} to gentamicin and dibekacin. Sulbenicillin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were moderately resistant to SCE- 129, whether these strains were gentamicin-resistant or not. Gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to dibekacin but not to SCE- 129. Against P. maltophilia, the minimum inhibitory concentration of SCE- 129 resembled those of <b>sulbenicillin,</b> gentamicin, and dibekacin.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ursodeoxycholate {{administration}} on the biliary excretion of the antibiotics cefotiam and <b>sulbenicillin</b> were studied in five patients with stable hepatic function receiving percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice. Cefotiam (I g) and <b>sulbenicillin</b> (2 g) were administered intravenously {{before and after}} ursodeoxycholate administration, and the maximum concentrations of the antibiotics in the bile and total amounts excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration were determined. After ursodeoxycholate administration, both the maximum concentration of cefotiam in the bile and the amount excreted increased significantly. Ursodeoxycholate also increased the peak concentration and total excretion of <b>sulbenicillin.</b> For both cefotiam and <b>sulbenicillin,</b> the amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration showed a significant correlation {{with the amount of}} bile acids excreted in the bile. This strongly suggests a common mechanism for the biliary excretion of these antibiotics and bile acids. Ursodeoxycholate administration is a benign way to increase both the concentration and the total amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of serious biliary tract infections, especially in patients receiving biliary drainage...|$|E

Peak plasma levels were 53. 34 micrograms/ml (group I); 55. 80 and 57. 82 micrograms/ml (group II) after 1 h. The half-life (t 1 / 2 beta) was 1. 47 h (group I); 1. 49 and 1. 62 h (group II). Renal clearance was 6. 68 l/h; 6. 25 and 5. 44 l/h; whereas {{the volume of}} distribution was 18. 02 l; 17. 84 and 17. 21 l for groups I and II respectively. The mean percentage of the recovered active drug in urine over 12 h was 77. 72 % of dose. The mean peak reaching the bronchial secretion was 3. 60 micrograms/ml at the 4 th hour. The results of the multiple dose study {{indicated that there was}} no apparent change in the distribution or elimination kinetics of <b>sulbenicillin</b> after 2 g i. m. administration. Thus, the kinetics from the multiple dose study were in close agreement with those from the single dose study and no accumulation of <b>sulbenicillin</b> was observed.

A remarkable feature of the spectrum of SM- 1652 is its high activity against Pseudomonadaceae. Against 200 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SM- 1652 was significantly more active than cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and <b>sulbenicillin</b> and as active as cefsulodin. The activities of SM- 1652 against Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia were superior to those of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, <b>sulbenicillin,</b> and gentamicin.

40|$|To {{find the}} exact {{substrate}} specificities of three species of tripartite efflux systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexXY-OprM, we constructed {{a series of}} isogenic mutants, each of which constitutively overproduced {{one of the three}} efflux systems and lacked the other two, and their isogenic mutants, which lacked all these systems. Comparison of the susceptibilities of the constructed mutants to 52 antimicrobial agents belonging to various groups suggested the following substrate specificities. All of the efflux systems extrude a wide variety of antimicrobial agent groups, i. e., quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, most penicillins (all but carbenicillin and <b>sulbenicillin),</b> most cephems (all but cefsulodin and ceftazidime), meropenem, and S- 4661, but none of them extrude polymyxin B or imipenem.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the basic data {{regarding}} the prevention and treatment of infection of the defunctionalized bladder, an investigation was made {{to see if the}} antibacterial agent administered generally is transfered into the intravesical space. Male rats, weighing 300 to 350 grams, were nephrectomized bilaterally and their penis was ligated. The bladder was instilled with 0. 7 ml of normal saline. This was designated as the intravesical fluid. Various antibacterial agents were administered to these rats which were sacrificed 24, 43, and 72 hours after that {{in order to determine the}} serum and intravesical fluid concentration of the agents. In amino glycoside group such as kanamycin, DKB and gentamicin, the serum concentration showed a relatively high level even at 72 hours following the gradual decline. The intravesical fluid concentration showed the peak level at 48 hours and the almost same level with the serum at 72 hours. In rifampicin and nalidixic acid, the serum concentration decreased in the course of time. Antibacterial activity was proved in the 72 hours serum in rifampicin and 48 hours serum in nalidixic acid. Intravesical fluid also showed small activities. In aminobenzyl-penicillin, <b>sulbenicillin</b> and cefamezin, tiny activity was proved in the serum and intravesical fluid. Aminobenzyl-penicillin or <b>sulbenicillin</b> disappeared from the serum and cefamezin from the intravesical fluid in the early period of the experiment. In vitro stability of aminobenzyl-penicillin, cefamezin, kanamycin and oleandomycin in the intravesical fluid was examined.

These strains were isolated from the urine samples of inpatients with urinary tract infections in the urology ward and in other wards. The strains of O 12 / 14 (gentamicin susceptible) were replaced with those of O 2 / 3 (gentamicin resistant) between June and September 1981, whereas the other serotypes were isolated continuously. They were resistant to <b>sulbenicillin,</b> cefmetazole, gentamicin, and amikacin, and susceptible to micronomicin and of loxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic.

40|$|Background: Digestive tract {{infection}} with clinical manifestation of diarrhea is an infectious disease that has the highest {{morbidity and mortality}} rate, especially in developing countries. Diarrhea causes mortality mostly in infants under one year old. Improvement in management is done continuously, but advances in diagnosis and therapy cannot be reached by developing countries. One of the etiological agents causing infection of digestive tract is bacteria.  Therefore, knowledge of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal infection and their resistance patterns may support the management of this disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine microbes that were isolated from the digestive tract and their resistance patterns against antibiotics. Methods: Samples (stool, rectal/anal swab) were collected from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, FKUI during  2005 - 2008. Isolation, identifi cation and sensitivity test were conducted according to standard laboratory procedures.  Interpretation of sensitivity test was done according to NCCLS/CLSI guidance. Data was analyzed using WHOnet version 5. 3. Results: We found 28 isolates of pathogenic Escherichia coli, 1 isolate of S. paratyphi A and 4 isolates of yeasts.  Pathogenic Escherichia coli were still sensitive against some antibiotics, but the sensitivity was reduced against amoxicillin, <b>sulbenicillin,</b> ticarcillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Conclusion: The most predominant gastrointestinal tract infection causing microbes was pathogenic Escherichia coli. These bacteria showed decrease sensitivity against some antibiotics commonly used to treat patients with gastrointestinal tract infection.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} clinical effect of fosfomycin Na(FOM) in urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas and Proteus, a comparative study was carried out on patients with chronic complicated urinary tract infections, using <b>sulbenicillin</b> Na(SB-PC) as an active control drug. Both FOM and SB-PC were administered through intravenous infusions in the same dosage of 2 g twice daily {{for a period of}} 5 days, and comparisons were made in terms of clinical and bacteriological effects and adverse reactions with a single blind technique. The results obtained were as follows: 1. There {{was no significant difference in}} global clinical effects between FOM and SB-PC. 2. With respect to clinical effects as classified by the types of disease, FOM was found to be superior with significant difference in the group of low urinary tract infection. 3. Determinations of MICs of FOM and SB-PC for the isolated organisms revealed higher sensitivity of FOM with significant difference, although no statistically significant difference was seen in terms of disappearance of bacteriuria between the two drugs. 4. There was no significant difference in frequencies of adverse reactions between FOM and SB-PC. All the observed reactions were mild in nature and occurred only in a small number of cases. Therefore, it was concluded that both drugs are of sufficient value to be applied clinically...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of cefmenoxime (SCE- 1365), 7 beta-[2 -(2 -aminothiazol- 4 -yl) -(Z) - 2 -methoxyiminoacetamido]- 3 -[(1 -methyl- 1 H-tetrazol- 5 -yl) thiomethyl]ceph- 3 -em- 4 -carboxylic acid, was {{compared with that}} of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro {{activity of}} cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1, 000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of <b>sulbenicillin</b> and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP- 3), followed by PBP- 1 (1 A and 1 B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally {{with a wide variety of}} gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis...|$|E
40|$|Stereoselective {{disposition}} of <b>sulbenicillin</b> (SBPC) epimers in healthy human volunteers was studied {{in order to}} clarify the differences in pharmacokinetic behavior between the epimers. Stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography {{was used for the}} determination of SBPC epimers. Plasma protein binding was measured in vitro with an ultrafiltration method. The binding was stereoselective, with the unbound fraction (fu) of the R-epimer being approximately 1. 3 -fold greater than that of the S-epimer. SBPC was administered intravenously to human volunteers, and concentrations of SBPC in plasma and urinary excretion rates were measured. Renal clearance (CLR) for the unbound drug (approximately 400 ml/min) was greater than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (approximately 109 ml/min) for both epimers, suggesting that both epimers are secreted at the renal tubules. Renal tubular secretion appeared to be greater for the S-epimer. When probenecid was coadministered, the CLR values of both epimers were significantly reduced and were approximately equal to the GFR values. CLR was greater for the S-epimer (37. 5 and 49. 8 ml/min for R-SBPC and S-SBPC, respectively), which was simply due to the greater fu of the S-epimer in plasma. In contrast, total body clearance was greater for the R-epimer (67. 8 and 56. 3 ml/min for R-SBPC and S-SBPC, respectively) because of the stereoselective degradation of the R-epimer in plasma. It was revealed that stereoselective degradation in the body had significant influence on the {{disposition of}} SBPC epimers...|$|E

It was highly active against {{a broad range of}} gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. Moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. When a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 106 or 108 organisms or both per ml, the 70 % minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0. 2, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, 25, and 0. 8 μg/ml, respectively. Its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. In these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059 -S was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration. 6059 -S was markedly bactericidal to both β-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of Escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial β-lactamase degradation. Administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059 -S attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either <b>sulbenicillin</b> or piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Various Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 NfxB mutants were {{isolated}} on agar plates containing cefpirome and ofloxacin.

Type A mutants were four to eight times more resistant to ofloxacin, erythromycin, and new zwitterionic cephems, i. e., cefpirome, cefclidin, cefozopran, and cefoselis, than was the parent strain, PAO 1. In contrast, type B mutants were more resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as ofloxacin, erythromycin, and the new zwitterionic cephems, than was PAO 1, and they were four to eight times more susceptible to carbenicillin, <b>sulbenicillin,</b> imipenem, panipenem, biapenem, moxalactam, aztreonam, gentamicin, and kanamycin that was PAO 1. The changes in susceptibilities of type B mutants were greater than those of type A mutants. The susceptibilities of both type A and type B mutants were restored {{to the level of}} PAO 1 by transformation with plasmid pNF 111, which contained the wild-type nfxB gene, demonstrating that they are NfxB mutants. Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to OprJ revealed that type B mutants produced larger amounts of outer membrane protein OprJ than did type A mutants and that PAO 1 produced an undetectable amount of it. Moreover, transconjugants obtained with the different types of NfxB mutants as the donor strains showed almost the same phenotypes as the corresponding donor strains. These results suggest that {{there are at least two}} nfxB mutations that show different phenotypes and that production of OprJ is associated with changes in susceptibilities of NfxB mutants...|$|E

The infections were prevented well in 9 out of the 15 cases given 10 g/day of SB-PG The 7 cases which {{failed to respond to}} the preventative therapy were all those carrying the catheter for 7 days or longer. Good prophylactic effect was recognized in all the 7 cases treated with concomitant administration of 4 g/day of SB-PC and 100 mg/day of DKB. As side effect was noted a rise of transaminase value in 3 of the 15 cases given 10 g/day of SB-PC, which returned to normal value after discontinuation of medication. Excretion pattern of SB-PC and DKB was also investigated. SB-PC was found to be rapidly excreted in the urine after administration, and duration of the effective SB-PC concentrations in the urine was also satisfactory when judged from the values measured for 6 hours. Urinary excretion of DKB was also good and clinically sufficient DKB concentrations were obtained. Thus, it was found that urinary tract infections were successfully prevented by concomitant administration of SB-PC and DKB in postoperative patients carrying indwelling catheter, though the number of cases employed is as small as 7. It is, however, hard to think of prevention of urinary tract infections in patients carrying indwelling catheter ignoring care of the urinary tract and, therefore, it would be necessary to employ the sterile closed catheterization...|$|E

The patients consisted of 3 cases of suprapubic cystotomy (suprapubic lithotomy), 2 cases of ureteroneocystostomy, 5 cases of partial cystectomy, 5 cases of bladder neck plasty and 20 cases of subcapsular prostatectomy. Of these 17 patients were given CET alone and 18 given SB-PC plus CET. Ten (58. 8 %) patients receiving CET alone responded to therapy. Of them, 6 patients showed an excellent response. 17 (94. 5 %) patients receiving SB-PC plus CET, responded to therapy and 12 of them showed an excellent response. Bacterial cultures were obtained from 21 of the 35 cases, which consisted of 12 cases (57. 1 %) of Pseudomonas spp., 6 cases (28. 6 %) of E. coli, 4 cases (19 %) of Streptococcus faecalis, 3 cases (14. 3 %) of Klebsiella, 3 cases (14. 3 %) of Candida spp., 1 case (4. 8 %) of Enterobacter and 1 case (4. 8 %) of Citrobacter.

A second medline search was performed with the key words "placental transfer of [...] . " followed by the class names of the antibiotic such as penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides. The bibliographic search on the placental transfer of antibiotics covered the period up to July 2005. Results: 3 types of placental transfers were identified. A few antibiotics cross the placenta rapidly and equilibrate in the maternal and cord plasma; this type of transfer is termed "complete" and include the antibiotics ampicillin, methicillin, cefmenoxime and cefotiam. Antibiotics which show incomplete transfer to the placenta where concentrations are lower in the cord than material plasma are said to have "incomplete" transfer and these include azlocillin, dicloxacillin, piperacillin, <b>sulbenicillin,</b> cefoxitin, amikacin, gentamicin, kanatnycin, streptomycin, fosfornycin, thiamphenicol, griseofulvin, vancomycin and colistimethate. Ceftizoxime is the only antibiotic so far known whose concentrations are higher in the cord than material plasma. This type of transfer is called "exceeding" transfer. Conclusion: All examined antibiotics cross the human placenta including those with a molecular weight greater than 1000 kDa such as vancomycin and colistimethate but there are 3 distinct types of placental transfer: complete, incomplete and exceeding and most antibiotics exhibit incomplete transfer...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{effects of}} <b>sulbenicillin</b> (SBPC) and {{mecillinam}} (MPC) were investigated in the mice which were experimentally infected with E. coli, P. rettgeri, K. pneumoniae NH 31 or K. pneumoniae TN 1697. The bacilli and drugs were injected i. p. The protecting effects against the infections were expressed as ED 0, ED 2 S, ED 50 and ED 75. Combined {{doses of the}} drugs used were {{less than that of}} the ED 50 or ED 75 of each drug, and the ED 0, ED 2 S, ED 50 and ED,s in the combined doses were compared with those in the single doses. 1) In the case of the infected mice with E. coli, ED 50 's of SBPC and MPC were 470 mg/kg and 520 mg/kg, respectively. The ED 50 in the combined doses was calculated as that in 100 mg/kg of SBPC and 40 mg/kg of MPC (2. 5 : 1). 2) In the case of the infected mice with P. rettgeri, ED 50 's of SBPC and MPC were 27 mg/kg and more than 2, 000 mg/kg, respectively. The ED 50 in the combined doses was calculated as that in 12. 5 mg/kg of SBPC and 100 mg/kg of MPC (1 : 8. 0). 3) In the case of the infected mice with K. pneumoniae NK 31, ED' 50 s of SBPC and MPC were 90 mg/kg and 420 mg/kg, respectively. The ED 50 in the combined doses was calculated as that in 12. 5 mg/kg of SBPC and 100 mg/kg of MPC (1 : 8. 0). 4) In the case of the infected mice with K. pneumoniae TN 1697, ED 50 's of SBPC and MPC were 130 mg/kg and 33 mg/kg, respectively. The ED 50 's in the combined doses were calculated as the doses of SBPC and MPC in combinations with 17. 5 mg/kg and 3. 1 mg/kg, 9. 6 mg/kg and 6. 25 mg/kg, and 6. 25 mg/kg and 8. 8 mg/kg (5. 81 : 1, 1. 54 : 1 and 1 : 1. 41), respectively. Therefore, as ED 50 's in the combined doses of SBPC and MPC were less than 50 % of those in single doses of each drug, it is concluded that the combined effects of these drugs are synergetic or additive...|$|E
