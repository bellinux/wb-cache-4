25|$|Among the {{complaints}} that some Cambodians have about her works {{is that she}} was only five years old when the Khmer Rouge began its reign, and that she could not possibly have so vivid and detailed a memory of the events as they have been documented in her book. Her detractors also claim that, as a child of a Chinese mother and a Khmer father highly placed in the Phnom Penh government, <b>she</b> <b>paints</b> a very unfavorable picture of Khmer villagers.|$|E

500|$|The men of {{the village}} join in a rousing {{drinking}} song ("To beer!"), while Jeník and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity.

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Montgomery {{wrote that the}} song [...] "is unapologetically epic and uncompromisingly raw, a song that manages to seem both all-encompassing and intimate, often at the same time." [...] In his review of Evanescence, Rick Florino of Artistdirect concluded [...] "The record's centerpiece is the elegantly dark ballad, 'Lost in Paradise'. It's in 'Paradise' that Lee's genius floats to the forefront most prominently. <b>She</b> <b>paints</b> a poignant picture of yearning for redemption from heartache crooning, 'We've been falling for all this time and now I'm lost in paradise.'" [...] In another review, he called the song [...] "the record's standout ballad." [...] Kerrang!s Steve Beebee called the song [...] "majestic" [...] Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters said that the song {{was one of the}} two along with [...] "Erase This" [...] which [...] "really caught" [...] his attention. Edna Gundersen of USA Today put the song on her list of songs to consider downloading.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Our Song" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. [...] While listening to [...] "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. [...] "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It just shows what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News. The video was conceptualized to be very fantasy-like and surreal. The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as <b>she</b> <b>paints</b> them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront her bedroom mirror, which she writes the word [...] "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in [...] a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs [...] "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying {{on a bed of}} flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes with Swift giggling while sitting on the front porch.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927 Shore was {{introduced}} to photographer Edward Weston. Weston was struck by his first encounter with Shore's work, saying [...] "Shore now realizes a fusion of her own ego with a deep universality...When <b>she</b> <b>paints</b> a flower she IS that flower." [...] They quickly became close friends. Her paintings of sea shells attracted and influenced him and he borrowed some of her shells for his photographs. Shore was his senior, 47 to his 40 {{and at that time}} a much more established artist. On Weston's urging, Shore travelled to Mexico with her friend Helena Dunlop. It was in Mexico that she {{was introduced}} to lithography, a medium which continued to work in upon her return to California. Her stay in Mexico most certainly influenced Shore's work, {{as can be seen in}} paintings like Women of Oaxaca in which a line of women in traditional Tehuantepec clothing carry black water jars on their heads.|$|E
2500|$|Today {{there are}} a number of others {{involved}} in the craft. Aguilino Garcia sells fairly expensive skunks, crocodiles, armadillos, and palm trees. He has a reputation for working slowing but makes pieces that were selling for between 100 and 400 pesos in 1998. Better known is the husband and wife team of Reynaldo Santiago and Elodia Reyes, who have been carving since their marriage in the mid-1970s. Reynaldo is a nephew of Martin Santiago. [...] Like in many other carving families, he carves while <b>she</b> <b>paints.</b> Their children are not involved in their business. While the couple make some large and medium-sized pieces, they specialize in miniatures (around seven cm), such as dogs, cats, giraffes, rabbits and goats which will for around 30 pesos each. Because La Union gets few tourists, the couple is mostly reliant on the store owners and wholesalers who buy from them. Today their major buyers are a wholesaler in California and a store owner in Texas.|$|E
50|$|Finlay {{moved to}} London in 1922, {{she lived in}} London Borough of Hampstead.

2500|$|Julia Fish (born 1950) is an American {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} have a deceptive simplicity. <b>She</b> <b>paints</b> in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjectsleaves {{of a tree}} seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture she makes, as one critic says, [...] "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities." [...] She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, {{is not so much}} temporal as durational. [...] Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, [...] "a parallel system to a lived experience." [...] The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can [...] "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term." [...] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said [...] "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1900 Cotton showed five portraits at Knoedler's. The {{exhibition}} {{attracted the}} attention of critics who praised her versatility and evident sympathy with her sitters as well as the [...] "dash and spirit" [...] of her style. Her relationship with Knoedler's continued with exhibitions every few years from 1901 through 1921. Critics liked the 1901 show, one praising improvement in her work. [...] When twenty-one portraits appeared at Knoedler's in 1904, reviewers praised her character research, directness and simplicity, and clever brushwork. One of them also noted her [...] "ability to secure a good likeness, much power of characterization, and as a rule good drawing and effective color." [...] A reviewer also noted an unevenness in the show, some portraits giving evidence of having been rushed or given only perfunctory attention. In 1906 Cotton was seen to have [...] "a brilliant career before her," [...] already earning enough from commissioned portraits to support support herself and her family. By this time her sitters were increasingly from European countries, many of them titled. Two of these were women who had befriended Cotton, Lady Cunard and Lady Savile. Lady Bache Cunard was the former Maude Alice Burke, an American from a wealthy New York family. She had married an English baronet named Bache Edward Cunard who was a grandson of the founder of the Cunard Line. Prominent in London social circles, she was a noted promoter of literary and artistic careers. Gertrude Lady Savile, who was raised in a well-connected English family, developed strong ties in the United States after she married a man who had a diplomatic appointment at the British embassy in Washington, D.C. During her stay in the country she became [...] "the toast of the town not only in the national capital, but also in New York." [...] After her first husband's untimely death, she married another diplomat, John Savile, who, on the death of a childless uncle, also named John Savile, [...] inherited a title, 2nd Baron Savile, and much wealth. Like Lady Cunard, Lady Savile was a highly respected London society matron. Acting somewhat in competition with each other, the two women worked to advance Cotton's career in London. With their help she was able to obtain commissions from a growing list of titled English sitters including Lord Howard de Walden; the daughter of a duke, Lady Marjorie Manners; and a Lady in Waiting to the Queen, the Honorable Violet Vivian. While in Marienbad during the summer of 1907, Cotton began work on a portrait of an English socialite named Mrs. Hall Walker. A close friend of Edward VII, Walker provided Cotton with an introduction that resulted in a request from the king that she paint his portrait as well. Mrs. Hall Walker, later Baroness Wavertree, was a popular hostess seen as liking to surround herself with beautiful women such as Cotton. [...] Begun in Marienbad, the portrait was completed the following winter at Cotton's London studio. [...] When the portrait was shown in an exhibition at Knoedler's later that year, a critic praised an innovative informality of clothing and pose which revealed the king's amiability without compromising his dignity. The portrait pleased him so much that he commissioned another, more formal, portrait of himself and one of the queen. Early in 1914, Cotton brought some of her London portraits to New York for exhibition at Knoedler's eliciting this concise evaluation from a critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle: [...] "There is little doubt of the talent of Mrs. Leslie Cotton, who shows portraits in oil, in the upper gallery at Knoedler's, for <b>she</b> <b>paints</b> with conviction, with much feeling and with convincing result." ...|$|E
