The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E

5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with <b>specific</b> <b>uses.</b> One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E

25|$|Partly due also to {{the variety}} of climates in Japan and the {{millennium}} encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can nonetheless be found. First {{of all is the}} choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures.

Red lights are used by {{the first and last}} vehicle of a convoy of designated vehicles and also are strictly regulated. Amber lights are seeing increasing popularity in recent years, however, <b>specific</b> <b>uses</b> are designated according to the Polish ‘Kodeks Drogowy’. There are no specific rules governing the use of other colors such as purple, green, or clear lights.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} useful {{to compare the}} Americanist {{tradition}} with another widespread tradition, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation {{does not require a}} strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that, to represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other <b>specific</b> <b>uses,</b> gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from typefaces of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.|$|E

25|$|There were {{conditions}} to who the CIA wanted to enlist, {{and they had}} <b>specific</b> <b>uses</b> that they wanted out of the Cubans that they brought aboard to the Cuban Opposition Front. They were supposed to restore the Cuban constitution that was made in 1940, they must be pro-Western and anti-Communist, they must be relatively politically neutral, {{and be able to}} gather other Cuban's support. Their purpose was summarized to three points, a beacon to attract other anti-Castro groups, a scapegoat in case covert operations were discovered, and to act as a potential replacement to Castro after his fall. As early as June 1960, there were 500 Cuban exiles being trained as paramilitary members in order to execute the Bay of Pigs, with some of those exiles being trained in Panama. This was due, partially, to the Soviet Union and its increasing amount of weaponry, along with a much larger influence of the Communist Party in Cuba.|$|E
500|$|Lutetium {{is not a}} {{particularly}} abundant element, although it is significantly more common than silver in the earth's crust. It has few <b>specific</b> <b>uses.</b> [...] Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years {{used to determine the}} age of meteorites. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. 177Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy (see Nuclear medicine) on neuroendocrine tumours. Lutetium has the highest Brinell hardness of any lanthanide, at 890–1300 MPa.|$|E
