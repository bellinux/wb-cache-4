High-speed planar laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) and 3 -D large eddy simulations (LES) {{are used}} to study turbulent flame kernel growth, wrinkling and the for-mation of <b>separated</b> <b>flame</b> pockets in methane/air mixtures. Turbulence was effected {{by a set of}} rotary fans situated in a cylindrical enclosure. Flame wrinkling was followed on sequential 2 -D OH images captured at kHz repetition rates. Under stoichiometric conditions and low turbulence levels the flame kernel remains singly connected and close to spherical in shape. By increasing turbulence or reducing the stoichiom-etry of the mixture the formation of separated pockets could be observed and studied. The mechanisms behind these phe-nomena are investigated qualitatively by LES of a level-set G-equation describing the flame surface propagation in turbu-lent flows...|$|E

These thermodiffusive and hydrodynamic mechanisms are prominent forces in the near limit because buoyancy is quashed in the microgravity environment. A fundamental knowledge of the underlying mechanisms controlling the extinction limit of a diffusion flame can be applied to any real world device involving a spreading diffusion flame as well as fire safety applications on earth and in space. Our work, which combines microgravity experiments, theoretical models, and numerical computation, is a joint effort between NASA and Michigan State University. Experiments in the 2. 2 second drop tower at NASA Lewis Research Center in the Microgravity Combustion Branch have been a preliminary step in locating a region where these instabilities are prevalent.

40|$|An {{apparent}} {{relation between}} the lift-off length under diesel conditions and the ignition quality of a fuel has previously been reported. To cast light on the underlying mechanism, the current study aims to <b>separate</b> <b>flame</b> lift-off effects of the chemical ignition delay from those of other fuel properties under diesel conditions. Flame lift-off was measured in an optical diesel engine by high-speed video imaging of OH-chemiluminescence. Fuel and ambient-gas properties were varied during the experiment. Only a weak correlation was found between ignition delay and lift-off length. The data indicate that this correlation {{is due to a}} common, stronger correlation with the ambient oxygen concentration. The chemical ignition delay and the fuel type had similar, weak effects on the lift-off length. A recently proposed mechanism for lift-off stabilization was used to interpret the results. It assumes that reactants approaching the lift-off position of the jet are mixed with high-temperature products found along the edges of the flame, which trigger autoignition. In this picture, the fuel effect is most likely due to differences in the amount of mixing with high-temperature products that is required for autoignition. In the current experiment, all lift-off effects seem to arise from variations in the reactant and product temperatures, induced by fuel and ambient properties. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute.

5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, magneto-equipped aircraft engines have typically been dual-plugged, whereby each cylinder has two spark plugs, with each plug having a separate magneto system. Dual plugs provide both redundancy should a magneto fail, and better engine performance (through enhanced combustion). Twin sparks provide two flame fronts within the cylinder, these two flame fronts decreasing the time needed for the fuel charge to burn, thereby burning more of the fuel at a lower temperature and pressure [...] As the pressure within a cylinder increases, the temperature rises; {{and if there is}} only a single plug, the unburnt fuel away from the original flame front can self-ignite, producing a <b>separate</b> unsynchronized <b>flame</b> front. This leads to a rapid rise in cylinder pressure, producing engine [...] "knock". Higher octane fuel delays the time required for auto-ignition at a given temperature and pressure, reducing knock; so by burning the fuel charge faster, two flame fronts can decrease an engine's octane requirement. As the size of the combustion chamber determines the time to burn the fuel charge, dual ignition was especially important for the large-bore aircraft engines around World War II.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{submitted}} to the United States Department of Energy in partial fulfillment of the contractual requirements for Phase I of the project titled, ''Real Time Flame Monitoring of Gasifier Burner and Injectors'', under co-operative agreement number DE-FS 26 - 02 NT 41585. The project is composed of three one-year budget periods. The work in each year is divided into separate Tasks to facilitate project management, orderly completion of all project objectives, budget control, and critical path application of personnel and equipment. This Topical Report presents results of the Task 1 and 2 work. The 2 D optical sensor was developed to monitor selected UV and visible wavelengths to collect accurate flame characterization information regarding mixing, flame shape, and flame rich/lean characteristic. Flame richness, for example, was determined using OH and CH intensity peaks in the 300 to 500 nanometer range of the UV and visible spectrum. The laboratory burner was operated {{over a wide range}} of air to fuel ratio conditions from fuel rich to fuel lean. The sooty oxygen enriched air flames were established to test the sensor ability to characterize flame structures with substantial presence of hot solid particles emitting strong ''black body radiation''. The knowledge gained in these experiments will be very important when the sensor is used for gasifier flame analyses. It is expected that the sensor when installed on the Global Energy gasifier will be exposed to complex radiation patterns. The measured energy will be a combination of spectra emitted by the combusting gases, hot solid particulates, and hot walls of the gasifier chamber. The ability to <b>separate</b> <b>flame</b> emissions from the ''black body emissions'' will allow the sensor to accurately determine flame location relative to the gasifier walls and the injectors, as well as to analyze the flame's structure and condition. Ultimately, this information should enable the gasification processes to be monitored and controlled and as a result increase durability and efficiency of the gasifier. To accomplish goals set for Task 2 GTI will utilize the CANMET Coal Gasification Research facility. The Entrained Coal Gasifier Burner Test Stand has been designed and is currently under construction in the CANMET Energy Technology Center (CETC), the research and technology arm of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). This Gasifier Burner Stand (GBS) is a scaled-down mock-up of a working gasifier combustion system that can provide the flexible platform needed in the second year of the project to test the flame sensor. The GBS will be capable of simulating combustion and gasification processes occurring in commercial gasifiers, such as Texaco, Shell, and Wabash River...|$|R

In this study, {{the sample is}} ignited locally at {{the middle of the}} 4 cm wide sample and subsequent flame spread reaches both open edges of the sample. The following flame behaviors are observed in the experiments and predicted by the numerical calculation; in order of increased imposed flow velocity: (1) ignition but subsequent flame spread is not attained, (2) flame spreads upstream (opposed mode) without any downstream flame, and (3) the upstream <b>flame</b> and two <b>separate</b> downstream <b>flames</b> traveling along the two open edges (concurrent mode). Generally, the upstream and downstream edge flame spread rates are faster than the central flame spread rate for an imposed flow velocity of up to 5 cm/s. This is due to greater oxygen supply from the outer free stream to the edge flames than the central flames, For the upstream edge flame, the greater oxygen supply results in a flame spread rate that is nearly independent of, or decreases gradually, with the imposed flow velocity.

The objective is to determine the conditions of extinction which are characterized by the flame structure and its properties. We are interested in the following properties: the curvature of the flame, its maximum temperature, its speed of propagation and the distance <b>separating</b> the <b>flame</b> from the wall. We analyze the influence of heat losses at the wall through the thermal conductivity of the wall {{and the nature of the}} fuel characterized by the Lewis number of the mixture. This investigation allows us to identify three propagation regimes according to heat losses at the wall and to the channel radius. The results show that there is an intermediate value of the radius for which the flame can bend and propagate provided that its curvature does not exceed a certain limit value. Indeed, small values of the radius will choke the flame and extinguish it. The extinction occurs if the flame curvature becomes too small. Furthermore, this study allows us to predict the limiting values of the heat loss coefficient at extinction as well as the critical value of the channel radius above which the premixed flame may propagate without extinction. A dead zone of length 2 - 4 times the flame thickness appears between the flame and the wall for a Lewis number (Le) between 0. 8 and 2. For small values of Le, local extinctions are observed...|$|R
