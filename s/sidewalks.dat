5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities <b>sidewalks</b> remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto <b>sidewalks</b> during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 {{study by}} the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41–50 percent {{believed}} the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada triggered additional accessibility of buildings, <b>sidewalks</b> and public spaces. 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to <b>sidewalks.</b>|$|E
30|$|Here, {{we discuss}} the method of {{estimating}} <b>sidewalk</b> conditions using the <b>sidewalk</b> users’ subjectivity and results of the verification experiment as the basic experimental study of the information collection system for <b>sidewalk</b> road conditions. We assume that {{it is intended to}} improve the convenience for <b>sidewalk</b> passers by analyzing the information that can be collected easily through the passage on the <b>sidewalk</b> without conducting special research activities on each <b>sidewalk</b> and providing information on hindrances. As a specific example, we show the results of evaluating the estimation by machine learning for the gradient and unevenness of the <b>sidewalk</b> from the sensor data during the passage of a stroller.|$|R

5|$|Horse rings, {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary mode of transportation, can be found throughout Portland, Oregon. They were removed from curbs and <b>sidewalks</b> for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident complained about the rings disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the rings by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair.|$|E
5|$|In Spring 2011, WSDOT began a $4.63million {{construction}} project to build wider lanes and shoulders on SR22 between I-82 {{and the city}} of Toppenish, because of a number of collisions along the roadway. Other improvements included installing new <b>sidewalks</b> with ADA-compliant curbs and access ramps, as well as adding turn lanes to side roads. The project was completed in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and {{it was used to}} fill in potholes and build <b>sidewalks.</b> In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sidewalk</b> {{elevator}} is {{a special}} type of freight elevator. <b>Sidewalk</b> elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the <b>sidewalk</b> just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. <b>Sidewalk</b> elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1999, MDOT spent {{substantial}} sums {{of money}} over a five-year program to upgrade M-65 and US23 by refurbishing and replacing bridges and adding more passing lanes. During the same timeframe, the community of Hale embarked on a project to beautify the length of M-65 in town. The project cost $877,929 and installed park benches, new lighting, <b>sidewalks</b> and plantings along the highway. Funding for the venture came {{from the federal government}} and MDOT.|$|E
5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from <b>sidewalks,</b> parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} eight {{different}} neighborhood associations, each of which provides different levels of infrastructure on each street. For example, on 4th Street the street lights are designed as old lamp posts and there are ornamented trash cans with a fleur-de-lis symbol at frequent intervals, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts on the <b>sidewalks,</b> Ouerbacker Court has cast iron decorative gates, and several other streets have basic infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|It {{shares the}} same nesting biology as S.speciosus. All cicada killers are ground-nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to {{hundreds}} of nests, each with a single provisioning female. Their tunnel is mainly made in well-drained, bare sandy soil, frequently under <b>sidewalks,</b> but is generally in full sunlight. Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva. It rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation {{in order for them}} to get more sun. Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive U-shaped digging entrance.|$|E

5000|$|A parklet is a <b>sidewalk</b> {{extension}} {{that provides}} more space and amenities for people using the street.

50|$|A <b>sidewalk</b> (American English) or {{pavement}} (British English), {{also known}} as a footpath or footway, is a path along the side of a road. A <b>sidewalk</b> may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb. There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the <b>sidewalk</b> and the roadway or between the <b>sidewalk</b> and the boundary.|$|R
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of the {{contributing}} properties of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, which was listed as on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1978. It was also designated as a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. In 2009 the <b>sidewalks</b> and railings on the bridge were replaced, and the bridge was repainted; the design of the new ornamental railings was based on the original 1920 design for the bridge's railings, replacing more utilitarian ones that had been substituted at a later date.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{situated}} in a historically significant area. The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in the <b>sidewalks</b> {{on the south side of}} the bridge delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse.|$|E

40|$|People {{with disabilities}} face many {{obstacles}} in everyday outdoor travels. One {{of the most}} notable obstacles is steep slope on <b>sidewalk</b> segments. Current navigation systems/services do not all support map databases with slope attributes and cannot calculate <b>sidewalk</b> slope in real time. In this paper, we present a technique for calculating slopes of <b>sidewalk</b> segments by image data and predict the most suitable route for each individual user through integration with GPS trajectory. In our technique we make use of GPS trajectory data, to identify the <b>sidewalk</b> segment on which the traveler will most probably pass, and images of the identified <b>sidewalk</b> segment. Through edge detection techniques we detect edges of objects, such as buildings, billboards, and walls, in the background. Slope of the segment is then calculated by comparing its line representation in the map with the detected edges. Our experiment result indicates effective calculation of <b>sidewalk</b> slopes...|$|R
