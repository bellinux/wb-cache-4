50|$|To prevent {{overpopulation}} of crown-of-thorns causing widespread destruction to {{coral reef}} habitats, humans have implemented {{a variety of}} control measures. Manual removals have been successful, but are relatively labour-intensive. Injecting <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphate</b> into the starfish is the most efficient measure in practice. <b>Sodium</b> <b>bisulphate</b> is deadly to crown-of-thorns, {{but it does not}} harm the surrounding reef and oceanic ecosystems. To control areas of high infestations, teams of divers have had kill rates of up to 120 per hour per diver. The practice of dismembering them was shown to have a kill rate of 12 per hour per diver and the diver performing this test was spiked three times. Therefore, {{it is for this reason}} and not rumours that they might be able to regenerate that dismembering is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>bisulphate</b> {{is used as}} a food {{additive}} to leaven {{cake mixes}} (make them rise) as well as being used in meat and poultry processing and most recently in browning prevention of fresh-cut produce. The food-grade product meets the requirements set out in the Food Chemicals Codex. It is denoted by E number E514ii in the EU and is approved for use in Australia and New Zealand where it is listed as additive 514. Food-grade sodium bisulfate is used in a variety of food products, including beverages, dressings, sauces, and fillings.|$|E
5000|$|Less common {{forms of}} uroliths {{includes}} ammonium urate, uric acid, calcium phosphate, and cystine uroliths.Urine acidification has been induced in felines by using ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, DL- methonine, ascorbic acid, ammonium chloride, calcium chloride phosphoric acid, and <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphate.</b> [...] Increasing dietary phosphorus {{has been shown}} to reduce the excretion of magnesium in urine, but if a higher phosphorus diet has been administered with a high magnesium diet, formation of struvite crystals may occur if the pH of the urine is not low enough. Further supplementation may come from administrating glucosamine to the feline, though this {{may not be enough to}} reduce cystitis of the bladder.|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} noxious and air {{pollutant}} substances from exhaust gases {{has become a}} routine procedure in the glass industry. Nevertheless, process control is still based on empirical data and {{on the experience of}} the plant operators. In the past, the occasional and unexpected occurrence of aggressive fluxes in the electrostatic precipitator (e-filters) has troubled several operators. This is unsatisfactory since the occurrence could not be attributed in a clear way to any unfavourable boundary conditions. This thesis presents investigations on the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions in Na 2 O-H 2 O-SO 2 -CO 2 -N 2 -containing flue gases below 500 °C. Investigations are particularly focused on the formation of liquid and solid sodium pyrosulphates and <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphates.</b> Special attention is paid to mechanisms of their occurrence and avoidance inside flue gas filters. It is shown that the formation is strongly dependent on the oxygen- and water vapour partial pressure of the system. The measurements will show that many different liquid mixed phases are formed within this system at low water vapour pressures. These phases can be avoided by raising the saturated vapour pressures above 199 mbar...|$|R
40|$|IT {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that malignant tumours depend on a labile coagulative factor for their invasive growth (O'Meara and Jackson, 1958; O'Meara, 1958). This factor, which is elaborated by the malignant cells, diffuses out into the tissue spaces {{in advance of the}} tumour and converts the fibrinogen of the interstitial fluid to fibrin. Fibrinolysis does not take place and the unresolved fibrin undergoes organisation. In this way a vascular stroma is prepared for the tumour which enables it to establish, and maintain, its autonomous growth. Protamine sulphate was found to inhibit the coagulative factor in vitro (Thornes and O'Meara, 1961) and it was considered that protamine might be of value in the treatment of malignant disease. However, protamine sulphate has a high acid residue and is not suitable for injection in high concentrations. Other forms of protamine are available. Prolothan A (Evans) is protamine in combination with <b>sodium</b> formaldehyde <b>bisulphate.</b> It can be given by deep subcutaneous, intramuscular or slow intravenous drip injection. After injection, the protamine is released slowly and its action is optimal several hours later. Prolotha...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{formulate}} and evaluate pharmaceutically equivalent injectable aqueous suspension for parenteral depot of methyl prednisolone acetate. Various aqueous suspensions were prepared by rapid stirring and colloid milling method. The prepared aqueous suspensions were subjected to particle size determination, sedimentation study, in vitro release studies (pH dependent dissolution study), and stability studies. The optimized formulation consisted of 4 % w/w of methyl prednisolone acetate, 2. 91 % w/w of PEG- 3350, 0. 19 % w/v of injection grade Tween- 80, 0. 68 % w/w of monobasic sodium phosphate, 0. 15 % w/w of di-basic sodium phosphate, 0. 91 % w/v of benzyl alcohol, 0. 32 % w/w <b>sodium</b> meta <b>bisulphate.</b> The f 2 value was calculated for innovator (DepoMedrol®, Batch No. MPH- 0254) and optimized formulation at pH 6. 8 and pH 7. 4 phosphate buffers. The f 2 values of 62. 94 and 54. 37 were obtained at pH 6. 8 and pH 7. 4 phosphate buffers respectively. The particle size ranged 23 - 27 μm at D value of 0. 9 for both test and innovator product...|$|R

30|$|Cellulose microfibres were {{isolated}} from P. pinnata seed hull by chlorination and alkaline extraction process (Maheswari et al. 2012). Cleaned seed hull fibres were dewaxed using toluene–ethanol mixture (2 : 1) for 6  h. Excess of solvent from the fibres was removed by suction and later kept for drying in hot air oven. Fibres were bleached with 7 % NaClO 2 taken in fibre to liquor ratio of 1 : 50 (pH vicinity 4 – 4.2 was maintained using acetic acid and sodium acetate buffer) for 2  h at 100  °C and was washed successively using 2 % <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphate,</b> distilled water and ethanol. Further {{the extraction of}} holocellulose from fibres {{was carried out by}} treating with 17.5 % NaOH solution at 20  °C for 45  min and subsequently washed with 10 % acetic acid. Later the fibres were treated with 0.8 % acetic acid and 0.7 % nitric acid in the ratio 15 : 1 at 120  °C for 15  min. The mixture was cooled, filtered and washed sequentially with 95 % ethanol and distilled water. The resulting cellulose fibres were oven dried at 105  °C until consistent weight was achieved.|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{producers}} in the United States have attempted to maintain barn aerial ammonia (NH 3) levels below 25 ppm to improve air quality, and more recently to decrease aerial emissions to the atmosphere. Our objective {{was to investigate the}} influence of litter management strategies on NH 3 emissions from commercial broiler barns employing new bedding, acid-treated built-up litter (<b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphate),</b> or untreated built-up litter (normal practice). Nearly 400 barn-days of NH 3 emissions data were collected from 12 broiler barns on four farms monitored in 48 -hour episodes over one year. On each study farm, the barns were paired for repetition of conditions. Emission was calculated as the product of gas concentration of the exhaust air and barn ventilation rate. Use of new bedding for every flock led to consistently lower NH 3 emission (averaging 0. 35 g NH 3 /(bird d)) at day 21 of the 42 -day flock grow-outs, followed by flocks raised on the annual cleanout with new bedding (0. 52 g NH 3 /(bird d)). Built-up litter without any treatment had the highest emission (0. 73 g NH 3 /(bird d)), followed by the built-up litter with acid treatment (0. 63 g NH 3 /(bird d)). One study site was managed with two barns using litter treatment and two identical barns with untreated, built-up litter for a side-by-side comparison of results under field conditions. Ammonia emissions from treated built-up litter barns were similar to those from untreated built-up litter barns, however, the temporal pattern of emissions provided evidence that ammonia held in the acid-treated litter {{at the beginning of the}} flock was released during the latter period of the flock cycle...|$|E
40|$|Introduction To assess {{exposure}} to second-hand smoke (SHS) in bus stops and markets, settings {{excluded from the}} Spanish Law 42 / 2010 regulating smoking in closed and open public places. Material and Methods Cross-sectional study in Barcelona assessing SHS exposure in 20 bus stops, 8 open markets, and 9 closed for comparison. We measured PM 2. 5 and vapour-phase nicotine as markers of SHS during 30 min (both in μg/m 3), using a SidePak AM 510 monitor and a cassette containing a filter treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphate,</b> respectively. We computed medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and compared them according to traffic density, evidence of smoking (tobacco smell/butts), presence of smokers, wind speed, and type of bus stop (with/without shelter) or type of market (open/closed). Results Median (IQR) PM 2. 5 concentration was 13. 52 µg/m 3 (9. 62 – 17. 68 µg/m 3) in bus stops, being higher in those with evidence of smoking (14. 04 vs. 8. 84 µg/m 3; p< 0. 05). Median nicotine concentration was 0. 17 µg/m 3 (0. 07 – 0. 40 µg/m 3), with significant differences according to wind speed (0. 36 µg/m 3 when wind speed was ≤ 10 km/h vs. 0. 09 µg/m 3 when it was higher). In markets, median PM 2. 5 concentration was 31. 98 µg/m 3 (8. 32 – 50. 96 µg/m 3) in open markets and 31. 20 µg/m 3 (20. 80 – 32. 76 µg/m 3) in closed markets. Nicotine concentrations were 0. 67 µg/m 3 (0. 11 – 1. 52 µg/m 3) and 0. 13 µg/m 3 (0. 09 – 0. 19 µg/m 3), respectively, observing significant differences according to evidence of smoking (0. 19 vs. 0. 08 µg/m 3 without evidence). Conclusions Exposure to SHS is low, but still measurable in these settings. There is still room for improvement in smoking regulation in public open and semi-open spaces.
