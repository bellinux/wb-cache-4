5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity,</b> and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the equipartition theorem is {{intertwined}} with that of <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{both of which were}} studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element. Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights. However, subsequent studies by James Dewar and Heinrich Friedrich Weber showed that this Dulong–Petit law holds only at high temperatures; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as diamond, the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> was lower. Read at l'Académie des Sciences on 11 January 1841.|$|E

25|$|A lake moderates the {{surrounding}} region's temperature and climate because water {{has a very}} high <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> (4,186 J·kg−1·K−1). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze; in the night it can warm it with a land breeze.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of land and water, continents heat up faster than seas. Consequently, the air above coastal lands heats up faster than the air above seas. This creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze.|$|E
25|$|Specific heat, {{also called}} <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{is defined as}} the amount of energy that has to be {{transferred}} to or from one unit of mass (kilogram) or amount of substance (mole) to change the system temperature by one degree.

25|$|By taking N {{to be the}} Avogadro {{constant}} NA, {{and using}} the relation R= NAkB between the gas constant R and the Boltzmann constant kB, this provides {{an explanation for the}} Dulong–Petit law of specific heat capacities of solids, which stated that the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its atomic weight. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is 3R≈ 6cal/(mol·K).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} the equipartition theorem is to the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of a crystalline solid. Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid {{can be viewed as}} a system of 3N independent simple harmonic oscillators, where N denotes the number of atoms in the lattice. Since each harmonic oscillator has average energy kBT, the average total energy of the solid is 3NkBT, and its heat capacity is 3NkB.|$|E
25|$|The high <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> {{of water}} and the {{insulating}} effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature. In some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about 10°C (50°F), groundwater {{can be used for}} controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface. For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used {{in the same way as}} a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air.|$|E

25|$|Compared to liquid water, {{microwave}} heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{measurements}} on the 50kW Manzanares pilot {{solar updraft tower}} found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although SBP believe {{that this could be}} increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100MW unit. This amounts to about 10% of the theoretical limit for the Carnot cycle. It is important to note {{a significant difference between the}} up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity.</b> While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.|$|E

500|$|Monsoons {{are caused}} by the larger {{amplitude}} of the seasonal cycle of land temperature {{compared to that of}} nearby oceans. This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a [...] "mixed layer" [...] that may be fifty meters deep, through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so. [...] Additionally, the <b>specific</b> <b>heat</b> <b>capacity</b> of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land. [...] Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean. The hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation.|$|E
