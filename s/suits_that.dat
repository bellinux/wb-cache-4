5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane <b>suits</b> <b>that</b> allow them to remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|The film {{rights to}} the novel were {{licensed}} in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled Bug Hunt at Outpost 9, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to Starship Troopers. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who found the book too boring to read, and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to gender. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, in order to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized <b>suits</b> <b>that</b> featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.|$|E

25|$|The <b>suits</b> <b>that</b> {{were worn}} by Filipinos {{were known as}} “zoot suits”, {{prominent}} {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles and Stockton. Zoot suits were originally worn by Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, but eventually Filipino-Americans wore them. Because Filipinos lived in the same neighborhoods as Mexican-Americans, the likelihood that Filipinos adopted this specific style of dress from Mexican-Americans was high. Zoot suits had a distinct appearance; they had loud and vivid colors, lengthy jackets, and sat slightly above the waist while tapering off down the leg of the respective pant. What became known as the “McIntosh Suit” was a regional term in southern California for a suit that was one’s personal best. The most popular MacIntosh suits featured gray colors with blue pinstripes constructed of gabardine material and wool material for winter suits.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian clothing industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring of <b>suits</b> <b>that</b> give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of trying to shoot the moon, players attempt to discard high cards, especially high hearts or spades, and try to avoid winning points. This can either be accomplished by creating a void, or playing a high card last in a trick that has no points. Generally speaking, it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick. Players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in <b>suits</b> <b>that</b> {{they do not have}} padding low cards in. For example, if a player had A,5,4,3,2 the A would not be much of an issue; they can play the four lower cards and hopefully exhaust other player's spades before being forced to play the A. In contrast, if they only had A, then they would be forced to play the A the first time spades were led, with the risk that another player will respond with the queen.|$|E
25|$|The term is used {{in various}} {{different}} ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled Snakes in <b>Suits</b> <b>that</b> sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, {{but in some cases}} the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in {{sense of right and wrong}} from the average person.|$|E
