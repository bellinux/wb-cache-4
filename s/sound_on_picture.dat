5000|$|The New York Times {{music critic}} Howard Taubman {{described}} the Mercury <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> <b>Pictures</b> at an Exhibition as [...] "being {{in the living}} presence of the orchestra" [...] and Mercury eventually began releasing their classical recordings under the 'Living Presence' series' name. The recordings were produced by Mercury vice president Wilma Cozart, who later married Bob Fine. Cozart took over recording director duties in 1953 and also produced the CD reissues of {{more than half of}} the Mercury Living Presence catalog in the 1990s. By the late 1950s, the Mercury Living Presence crew included session musical supervisors Harold Lawrence and Clair van Ausdall and associate engineer Robert Eberenz. When Cozart retired in 1964, Lawrence took over the Mercury classical division and continued producing Mercury Living Presence records into 1967.|$|R

50|$|On 8 September 1909 Vitascope-Theater GmbH {{changed its}} name to Deutsche Vitascope GmbH, with Greenbaum the owner and {{managing}} director, and headquarters at 20 Friedrichstraße. The firm's chief objective was the production of <b>sound</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> continuous film so that all the reels could be shown without interruptions. The 1910 Vitascope catalogue advertised a flicker-free camera, Vitaphone soundfilms, arc lamps, used original Vitascope films and 100,000 meters of used vaudeville/variety act movies, for 20-40 pfennigs/meter.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked from}} 1918 {{to develop a}} system of {{recording}} and reproducing synchronized <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> motion <b>picture</b> film. He became the University of Illinois's first research professor of engineering in 1921. On June 9, 1922, Tykociner publicly demonstrated {{for the first time}} a motion picture with a soundtrack optically recorded directly onto the film. When Tykociner demonstrated the first sound-on-film motion picture recordings the projector had a photoelectric cell made by his Illinois colleague Jakob Kunz at its heart. In the first sounds ever publicly heard from a composite image-and-audio film, Helena Tykociner, the inventor's wife, spoke the words, [...] "I will ring," [...] and then rang a bell. Next, Ellery Paine, head of the university's Department of Electrical Engineering, recited the Gettysburg Address. The demonstration was written up in the New York World on July 30, 1922. A dispute between Tykociner and university president David Kinley over patent rights to the process thwarted its commercial application.|$|R
5000|$|Tigerstedt's {{greatest}} {{interest was}} {{in the field of}} sound recording. He had developed a prototype for recording <b>sound</b> <b>on</b> a metal wire as early as 1912 and was convinced that he {{could find a way to}} record <b>sound</b> directly <b>on</b> motion <b>picture</b> film. He started his first experiments in Helsinki using very primitive equipment. The sentence he attempted to record was in German: [...] "Grau ist alle Theorie. Grün ist nur des Lebens Baum". Finally, he succeeded and he called his invention the [...] "photomagnetophone". Unfortunately, his achievements did not gain any recognition, nor did he reap any financial gains from his invention, so he had to maintain a day job in order to earn a modest living and could only continue his experiments in the evenings and into the nights, sometimes working all through the night without any sleep.After meeting his former schoolmate Alfred Nybom in Berlin, he succeeded in using Nybom's connections to gain access to a research laboratory and employment as an inventor. Film with audio was recognised as a commercially promising field of endeavour, but Tigerstedt's invention needed further development before it could be commercialised. There was as yet no technology available to electronically amplify the audio signal sufficiently to fill a large movie theatre. Tigerstedt also enlarged his vision of video transmission in the future. He wrote: [...] "There will come a time when people can sit at home and follow events in the world through a device I now call the 'electronic eye'. When people get used to film with sound, they will soon adopt the electric eye, or electrophtalmoscope". When his father learned of his thinking, he tried to persuade him to not let his imagination carry him away, [...] " ... otherwise you will surely end your days in the asylum in Lapinlahti." ...|$|R
