5|$|As the show's revenue {{continued}} to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004. The work stoppage occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked {{for an increase in}} their pay to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to <b>something</b> <b>between</b> $250,000 and $360,000 per episode.|$|E
5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds {{from the back of}} an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described as <b>something</b> <b>between</b> a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
5|$|The {{registers}} of Crosthwaite Church {{stated that}} there were 238 interments in 1623, {{believed to have been}} <b>something</b> <b>between</b> a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at that time. In the 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre was <b>something</b> <b>between</b> a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E

Looking up at or down on another person can be taken literally in many cases, with the higher person asserting greater status.|$|E

25|$|Buckley {{was well}} known for his command of language. He came late to formal {{instruction}} in English, not learning it until he {{was seven years old}} and having earlier learned Spanish and French. Michelle Tsai in Slate says that he spoke English with an idiosyncratic accent: <b>something</b> <b>between</b> an old-fashioned, upper class Mid-Atlantic accent, and British Received Pronunciation, with a Southern drawl.|$|E
25|$|The Leonine City at {{that time}} was also renowned in Rome for its stufe. These buildings, whose {{tradition}} came from Germany (the name comes from the German word stube), were <b>something</b> <b>between</b> a Roman bath and a modern sauna, and were often attended by artists, who could freely sketch nudes there (Raffaello himself was owner of a stufa in Borgo, near his palace).|$|E
25|$|Note {{that using}} a {{hierarchical}} system like this (assuming {{it is done}} carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence {{on the number of}} objects to <b>something</b> <b>between</b> linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and we would have a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.|$|E

But their father leaves them {{for long periods of}} time, because he must live in two worlds. One with his Indian bride, and the other with Lise in St. Louis. McKeag hates the situation, but bears with it and cares for the boys like an uncle. But Jacques grows contemptuous of McKeag's presence, sensing <b>something</b> <b>between</b> McKeag and his mother.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} Sparta's own {{contribution}} was just 300 Spartiates (accompanied by their attendants and probably perioikoi auxiliaries), the total force assembled {{for the defense}} of the pass of Thermopylae came to <b>something</b> <b>between</b> four and seven thousand Greeks. They faced a Persian army who had invaded from the north of Greece under Xerxes I. Herodotus stated that this army consisted of over two million men; modern scholars consider this to be an exaggeration and give estimates ranging from 70,000 to 300,000.|$|E
25|$|New {{kinds of}} technology, {{including}} social media have {{also played a}} role. Increasingly information is conveyed in brief 'sound bites' so that it becomes <b>something</b> <b>between</b> information and entertainment. This makes 'the news' more susceptible to simplistic and populist explanations {{at the expense of}} more in-depth analysis and the seemingly indigestible opinions of academics and experts. Pratt argues that as a result, the influence of academics, senior civil servants, penal reform groups and judges who collectively make up the 'criminal justice establishment' has steadily declined.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} from the types mentioned above. Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type which is <b>something</b> <b>between</b> a superposition type of the multi-lens compound {{eye and the}} single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes. Then there is the mysid shrimp Dioptromysis paucispinosa. The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye {{there is a single}} large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone. This projects an upright image on a specialised retina. The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.|$|E
25|$|At present, no canonical, presecribed use of colours can be detected, {{except that}} at least from Augustan times the {{background}} was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well. The colour of human skin was usually in <b>something</b> <b>between</b> dark red and hot pink. In Dionysiac scenes, skin could also be painted a reddy-brown. In Augustan times light yellow was not unusual for skin. At Hannover, violet-brown, reddy brown, purple, red, yellow, yellow-brown, turquoise-green, dark bown, pink, blue, black, and white can all be identified. Today the paint is lost in almost all cases and only residual traces can be recognised.|$|E
25|$|Not {{knowing how}} to play or compose music did not stop António from making music by himself. He would, using a tape recorder, {{mimicking}} sounds and rhythms while he sang, using his own voice or even tapping his hands on different objects. These recordings were then used by his supporting studio musicians {{as the basis for}} the song arrangements. Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from synthesizers, to Portuguese and classical guitars, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: <b>something</b> <b>between</b> Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.|$|E

25|$|Some Spaniards {{objected to}} the encomienda system, notably Bartolomé de las Casas, who insisted that the Indians were humans with souls and rights. Due to many revolts and {{military}} encounters, Emperor Charles V helped relieve the strain on both the Indian laborers and the Spanish vanguards probing the Caribana for military and diplomatic purposes. Later on New Laws were promulgated in Spain in 1542 to protect isolated natives, but the abuses in the Americas were never entirely or permanently abolished. The Spanish also employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the mita, and treated their subjects as <b>something</b> <b>between</b> slaves and serfs. Serfs stayed to work the land; slaves were exported to the mines, where large numbers of them died. In other areas the Spaniards replaced the ruling Aztecs and Incas and divided the conquered lands among themselves ruling as the new feudal lords with often, but unsuccessful lobbying to the viceroys of the Spanish crown to pay Tlaxcalan war demnities. The infamous Bandeirantes from São Paulo, adventurers mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward {{in their search for}} Indian slaves. Serfdom existed as such in parts of Latin America well into the 19th century, past independence.|$|E

500|$|The Poisoned Kiss (1927–29, premiered in 1936) {{is a light}} comedy.
