25|$|The Mid-Norfolk Railway is {{frequently}} used by mainline companies for crew {{training and the}} storage and testing of recommissioned and new on-track plant, including ballast tampers, ballast regulators, stoneblowers and Multi-Purpose Vehicles from companies including Network Rail and Balfour Beatty Rail Ltd. Since 2001 the line has been used annually for low adhesion training, or <b>skidpan</b> training, for crews from Anglia Railways, latterly for National Express East Anglia, where a specially fitted Class 153 treats the track with a slimy solution before the crew practices stopping in a virtual station. The line has also been used for training exercises by East of England Ambulance Service, Norfolk Police and the Fire Brigade, including major incident training involving air ambulances.|$|E
50|$|A skidpad or <b>skidpan</b> is a {{circular}} area of flat pavement used for various tests of a car's handling. The most common skidpad use is testing lateral acceleration, measured in g. This usage {{is similar to}} that of a kick plate.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{also had}} a motocross track, a <b>skidpan,</b> a dirt track and four wheel drive course and a 1000-foot drag strip. Due {{to the nature of}} the land on which the circuit was built, most of the circuit was visible from the main {{grandstand}} or the grassed banks surrounding the track.|$|E
50|$|Norwegian Automobile Federation (Norges Automobil-Forbund, NAF) is a Norwegian {{association}} of car owners, established in 1924, {{and member of}} Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The federation has 73 local chapters and more than 500,000 members. NAF is running a number of test stations, <b>skidpans</b> and camping sites. Among its publications is the monthly magazine Motor and the triannual NAF Veibok.|$|R
50|$|Ebisu Circuit (エビスサーキット) is an {{established}} race complex at 1 Sawamatsukura, Nihonmatsu-shi, Fukushima Prefecture, 964-0088, Japan. The complex features 7 individual tracks plus 2 skid pan type circuits. The circuits are, Nishi (West), Kita (North), Higashi (East), Minami (South) {{as well as}} Drift Land, the School Course, The Touge (mountain pass) and 'KuruKuru Land' which are the <b>skidpans.</b> The most famous circuit is the Minami or South course which is for D1 and other drifting events. The Higashi or East circuit features a 420 metre long main straight with 20 ground floor pit garages and is used mainly for grip events.|$|R
50|$|Stunt Driving Relay Race: The {{players were}} {{presented}} with a relay race involving driving tricks. Ann-Maree and Crystal-Rose would have to slalom through traffic cones - forward and then backward. Alaina and Marc would then {{have to do a}} handbrake turn and reverse into a small box marked off by cones. Bob and David would last have to do two figure 8s around cones on a <b>skidpan.</b> The race against the clock was two laps, with each player needing to do their trick once in turn, on a fifteen-minute time limit. After completing their leg, the players had to hand the car off to the next person inside a box marked by blue flags. They were given some training and a dry run, but during the real run, there would be on top of each cone an egg, which, if dislodged, would cost a $500 penalty from the potential $10,000 value of the assignment. The first lap went strongly, with Ann-Maree slaloming perfectly, Marc doing a strong handbrake turn and reversing into the box (but losing time as he didnt back up completely the first time), and David quickly completing his figure 8 laps on the <b>skidpan.</b> The second lap was less fluid - Crystal-Rose slalomed perfectly just as Ann-Maree had (and was cruising instead of racing, losing time), but Alaina knocked over two cones on her handbrake turn and Bob lost several seconds on the <b>skidpan</b> in addition to forgetting to put his seat belt on as he took off. They completed the race in 13 minutes 35 seconds. David, however, had not had his seatbelt on when he backed the car into the box of blue flags on the changeover to Crystal-Rose, after he had first overshot it. This meant he had to do his part again, in the 1 minute 25 seconds that remained on the clock. He made it with 2 seconds to spare, so $9,000 was won.|$|E

5000|$|A skid {{called a}} drag, dragshoe, shoe or <b>skidpan</b> retards {{the motion of}} the wheels. A London patent of 1841 {{describes}} one such apparatus: An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle. The original feature of this modification was that, instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum, the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of [...] "pendant-levers" [...] and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position and be ready for further use.|$|E
