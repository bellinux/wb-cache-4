40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{dissolution of}} titanium and vanadium in liquid steel has been studied. Two periods were distinguished: the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> {{period and the}} free dissolution period. In the case of titanium, it is shown that the customary frozen <b>shell</b> of <b>steel</b> encases the cylinder following its initial immersion. Premature internal dissolution then begins {{as a result of}} liquid eutectic of Fe(, 0. 3) Ti(, 0. 7) composition forming at the inner <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> boundary. This phenomenon triggers an exothermic dissolution and erosion of the inner <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> The net result is considerable shortened shell melting times. During the free dissolution period, the temperature of the titanium dissolving at the interface increases and the dissolution process becomes self-accelerating. During the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> period with pure vanadium and ferrovanadium alloys, no reaction was observed between the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and vanadium. For low grade ferrovanadium alloys, the dissolution proceeds via a heat transfer mechanism. On the other hand, for high grades, ferrovanadium mass transfer mechanisms dominate. A simplified mathematical model of the process has been developed to describe the coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena involved in the various systems studied...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{carrying}} capacity and energy absorption characteristic of foamed aluminum (or aluminum foam), fabricated by melt foaming technique, are limited {{due to the}} lower strength of aluminum. The typical anti-vibration energy absorbing structures are designed as foamed aluminum-filled or sandwich structures. The deformation and absorption characteristics of foamed aluminum-filled structures subjected to impact loadings are analyzed using experimental and numerical methods in this work. The analysis shows that the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> of the combinative structure subjected to dynamic loadings dominates during energy absorption. The energy absorption capacity and initial instability loading increase as impact velocity increase and as increasing shell thickness duo to the interaction between <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and aluminum foam. The impact mass {{within the range of}} 100 kg influences weakly on peak instability loading. Since the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> is the dominating part of load capacity and energy absorption, the reasonable design, taking into account of foam density and shell thickness and taking full advantage of interaction between <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and aluminum foam, should be adopted to increase the energy absorption characteristic of foam-filled structures...|$|R

The considered structures subjected to uniformly distributed pressure, rigidly connected with a steel plate, are considered. True material stressâ€“strain curves for shell and foam filling are assumed in calculations. The problem is solved by FEM using ANSYS software. The time relations of strain energy and effective stresses for different simulations of blast pressure are determined and compared for <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> and shells filled with aluminum foam...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Steel-concrete {{composite}} shell roofs (Comshell roofs) {{are formed}} by pouring concrete on a thin stiffened <b>steel</b> base <b>shell</b> {{which serves as}} both the permanent formwork and the tensile steel reinforcement. The thin <b>steel</b> base <b>shell,</b> constructed by bolting together open-topped modular units consisting of a base plate with surrounding edge plates, is a <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> with thin stiffeners in both directions. The new system retains all the benefits of thin concrete shells, but {{eliminates the need for}} temporary formwork and minimises the required falsework. A key issue in the design of such shell roofs is to ensure that the <b>steel</b> base <b>shell</b> can carry the wet concrete loading safely. This paper presents the results of a series of buckling experiments on model <b>steel</b> base <b>shells</b> under simulated wet concrete loading. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{formation}} of oscillation marks in continuous casting of steel will be derived and evalu-ated numerically. Liquid steel is injected through a submerged nozzle into an intensively cooled mould. At the wall the steel solidifies and the solidified shell is withdrawn vertically. Flux powder is added at the top of liquid steel. It melts (slag) and thus it serves as a lubricant for the passage of the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> through the mould. In order to prevent sticking of the steel onto the mould it oscillates vertically leaving oscillation marks {{on the surface of the}} solidified <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> In the present study the interaction of the steel melt, the solidified <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> and the slag will be inves-tigated. On the basis of thin layer approximations for the slag flow and heat transfer through the <b>steel</b> <b>shell,</b> slag and mould, respectively, and dominating surface tension at the interface liquid steel/liquid slag a mathematical model will be derived, solved numerically and compared with data reported in the literature. The flow problem for the slag flow is closely related to the well known coating problem...|$|R

Studied parameters include the magnitude of internal pressure, steel strength, and ratio of cylinder radius to shell thickness.

The buckling strength predicated by proposed equations agrees well with that from the numerical simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissolution}} of Ti additions in liquid steel during secondary steelmaking {{occurs in a}} two step process. In the first step, a <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> solidifies around the initial cold addition, whereas in the second step, after this shell has remelted, the Ti dissolves directly in the steel bath. The initial presence of this <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> modifies the position of dissolution and influences the local concentration and thus the inclusion formation. Further complications arise {{from the fact that}} part of the Ti will dissolve while enclosed by the <b>steel</b> <b>shell,</b> altering the alloy composition first released in the ladle and effectively shortening the subsequent free dissolution period. The duration of the <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> period and the fraction of predissolved Ti have been investigated using a conservative one-dimensional sharp interface model solving the coupled heat and mass transfer in a cylindrical shell/addition composite. The influence of the convection conditions and the original Ti radius was evaluated in a parametric study. A pronounced effect of the convective heat transfer on the shell melting time was found. It is thus concluded that the dissolution behaviour is strongly dependent on the local flow conditions, which is determined by factors such as stirring conditions and addition characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cylinders, cones, spheres and tori {{are some}} of the common basic <b>shell</b> elements. <b>Steel</b> <b>shell</b> {{structures}} such as silos, tanks, pressure vessels, offshore platforms, chimneys and tubular towers generally consist of two or more of these basic shell elements. Axisymmetric intersections featuring meridional slope mismatches between the connected elements are common features in <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> structures. High bending and circumferential membrane stresses are developed in these intersections, and their buckling and collapse strengths are a key design consideration. This paper presents a summary of recent research on the stress, stability and strength of axisymmetric <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> intersections. Particular attention is paid to intersections formed from cylindrical and conical segments as these are more common and have been more extensively researched. A simple approximate method for extrapolating the knowledge gained on these intersections to those containing curved shell segments is also suggested.

There was a reproducible trend in net residual shell distortion as a function of temperature with residual tensile stresses in the shell for temperatures â‰¤ 210 Â°C and â‰¥ 390 Â°C, and net compressive stresses at intermediate temperatures. In-situ linear displacement sensor experiments have been used to investigate the dynamic distortion of sprayed <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> on <b>steel</b> substrates, over the same range of surface temperatures. Residual and in-situ distortion measurements confirmed two manufacturing temperatures at which stresses in the <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> were either minimized or eliminated.

It is proposed that tensile quench stresses are balanced by the time- and temperature-dependent expansive austenite-to-bainite phase transformation...|$|R
40|$|The Sprayform Tool Process {{is a novel}} {{alternative}} to CNC machining for the rapid manufacture of hard tooling. The process {{is based on the}} robot controlled sprayforming of molten steel droplets onto a ceramic master pattern to form a thick, dimensionally accurate <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> This paper describes the Sprayform Tool Process, and investigates the evolution of microstructure in thick <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> in terms of the oxide fraction as a function of process parameters: (i) spray height; (ii) atomising gas pressure; (iii) wire feed rate; and (iv) manipulating robot velocity. Spray height had the strongest influence on oxide content; by reducing spray height from 160 to 120 mm the oxide fraction in the microstructure was halved. The role of droplet splashing on the subsequent oxidation of splash droplets has been revealed as an important phenomenon controlling sprayed microstructure and oxide fraction. On the basis of the presented experimental results, the implications for the manufacture of large <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> by the Sprayform Tool Process are discussed. 0 2004 Elsevier B. V.
