5|$|There {{are several}} {{methods used to}} produce {{synthetic}} diamond. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5GPa at 1500°C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and <b>sonication</b> of graphite solutions.|$|E
25|$|For autoclaving, {{cleaning}} is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can {{be achieved}} through physical scrubbing, <b>sonication,</b> ultrasound or pulsed air.|$|E
25|$|Since mRNAs {{are longer}} than the read-lengths of typical {{high-throughput}} sequencing methods, transcripts are usually fragmented prior to sequencing. The fragmentation method is a key aspect of sequencing library construction. It may incorporate chemical hydrolysis, nebulisation, or <b>sonication</b> of RNA, or utilise simultaneous fragmentation and tagging of cDNA by transposase enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Double {{stranded}} DNA is sheared {{using one}} of the methods: <b>Sonication,</b> enzymatic digestion or nebulization. Fragments are size selected using Ampure XP beads. Gel-based size selection is not recommended for this method since it can cause melting of DNA double strands and DNA damage as the results of UV exposure. The size selected fragments of DNA are subjected to 3’-end-dA-tailing.|$|E
25|$|If {{the protein}} of {{interest}} is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, {{the first step of}} each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) <b>sonication,</b> iii) homogenization by high pressure (French press), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme). Finally, the cell debris can be removed by centrifugation so that the proteins and other soluble compounds remain in the supernatant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sonication</b> is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during sol-gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to create}} {{longitudinally}} oriented channels {{is to create a}} conduit from one polymer with embedded longitudinally oriented fibers from another polymer; then selectively dissolve the fibers to form longitudinally oriented channels. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in a (Hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (HEMA) scaffold. PCL was chosen over poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), because it is insoluble in HEMA but soluble in acetone. This is important because HEMA was used for the main conduit material and acetone was used to selectively dissolve the polymer fibers. Extruded PCL fibers were inserted into a glass tube and the HEMA solution was injected. The number of channels created was consistent from batch to batch and the variations in fiber diameter could be reduced by creating a more controlled PCL fiber extrusion system. The channels formed were confirmed to be continuous and homogeneous by examination of porosity variations. This process is safe, reproducible and has controllable dimensions. In a similar study conducted by Yu and Shoichet (2005), HEMA was copolymerized with AEMA to create a P(HEMA-co-AMEA) gel. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in the gel, and then selectively dissolved by acetone with <b>sonication</b> to create channels. It was found that HEMA in mixture with 1% AEMA created the strongest gels. When compared to scaffolds without channels, the addition of 82–132 channels can provide an approximately 6–9 fold increase in surface area, which may be advantageous for regeneration studies that depend on contact-mediated cues.|$|E
2500|$|Samples can {{be taken}} from whole tissue or from cell culture. Solid tissues are first broken down {{mechanically}} using a blender (for larger sample volumes), using a homogenizer (smaller volumes), or by <b>sonication.</b> [...] Cells may also be broken open {{by one of the}} above mechanical methods. However, virus or environmental samples can be the source of protein and thus western blotting is not restricted to cellular studies only.|$|E
2500|$|Ultrasonicated honey {{has been}} {{processed}} by ultrasonication, a nonthermal processing alternative for honey. When honey {{is exposed to}} ultrasonication, most of the yeast cells are destroyed. Those cells that survive <b>sonication</b> generally lose their ability to grow, which reduces the rate of honey fermentation substantially. Ultrasonication also eliminates existing crystals and inhibits further crystallization in honey. Ultrasonically aided liquefaction can work at substantially lower temperatures around [...] and can reduce liquefaction time to less than 30 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to initiate sluggish Grignard reactions. [...] These methods weaken the passivating layer of MgO, thereby exposing highly reactive magnesium to the organic halide.

[...] Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-Dibromoethane are common activating agents. [...] The use of 1,2-dibromoethane is particularly advantageous as its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. [...] Furthermore, the side-products are innocuous: ...|$|E
2500|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be used to make aerogels/foams, either {{homogeneously}} or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace polystyrene-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce starch foams by using a freeze-drying technique. The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of wood-based pulp fibers is that the nanofibrills can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various freeze-drying and super critical [...] drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates. Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibrill suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibrill interaction in the foams. Cellulose nanowhiskers could also be made to gel in water under low power <b>sonication</b> giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (>600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels. In another study by Aulin et al., the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by freeze-drying was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before freeze-drying. Chemical vapour deposition of a fluorinated silane was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the freeze-drying technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrills dispersed inside. Olsson et al. demonstrated that these networks can be further impregnated with metalhydroxide/oxide precursors, which can readily be transformed into grafted magnetic nanoparticles along the cellulose nanofibers. The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1gram of water within a 60mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (>98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.|$|E
