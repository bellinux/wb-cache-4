During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq.

After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.|$|E

5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda.

Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> as motives.

This conflict as well as Saddam Hussein's policy of Arabization in Iraq, the Gulf War and subsequent <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> intensified the Assyrian diaspora from the region. Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolution and Shi'a emphasis in Iran created a tense situation for Assyrians in the Middle East.

25|$|Powell {{came under}} fire {{for his role in}} {{building}} the case for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said that <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein. As {{was the case in the}} days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar Richard Clarke in front of the 9/11 Commission. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a unilateral approach. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.|$|E

Brazil's relations with Iraq were downgraded during the Gulf War, when Brazil supported the U.N.

25|$|Jordan {{participated in}} the {{imposition}} of economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq</b> even though the sanctions would severely affect its economy. The effects of the Gulf War, the sanctions on Iraq, and the flow of refugees to Jordan were estimated by a UN report to be $1.5billion out of a gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.2billion in 1990, and $3.6billion out of a GDP of $4.7billion in 1991. The end of the Gulf War coincided {{with the end of}} the Cold War. This allowed the United States to play a more active role in solving the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Bush administration were still angry at Hussein for the Gulf War events but realized they needed Jordan's participation in any peace process. Hussein agreed to an American request to join an international peace conference so that Jordan could start repairing its relationship with the United States, and end its political isolation. Hussein's moves towards democratization 1989 and his stance during the 1990 Gulf War had won him considerable popularity across Jordan's political spectrum. But when Hussein replaced his conservative prime minister, Mudar Badran, with liberal Palestinian Taher Al-Masri, who was in favor of peace negotiations with Israel, the Muslim BrotherhoodJordan's main opposition group, who at that time occupied 22 out of 80 seats in the House of Representatives, and whose members and support came mostly from Palestinians in the countryvehemently rejected the new prime minister by voting against him during the vote of confidence. The Brotherhood also refused to participate in the National Congress where the King hoped to gather support for a peace settlement.|$|E

40|$|International {{sanctions}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive political debate, its effectiveness is highly questioned and its wide implementation even more so. Yet economic sanctions still remain the primary punitive response in the international community, states violation of sovereignty, authoritarianism and/or deviations from the human rights charter are regularly met with international condemnation and sanctions. But do they have the desired effect? Many scholars claim that there is an inherent ineptitude in international sanctions, especially in regard to authoritarian states and dictatorships. Economic sanctions intended to cripple a nation’s economy in order to force a state to negotiations, more often than not, have an adverse efficacy on closed states where economic disparity maim the population rather than the ruling elite. The purpose of this paper will therefore be to achieve a greater understanding of international economic sanctions and their impact on an authoritarian state.

5000|$|The bad news, therefore, is {{that the}} UN proved unequal {{to the task of}} {{preventing}} a rogue regime from stealing some of its own money.

Most observers would conclude that the UN, however inadequate its financial oversight, certainly got its priorities right. The UN <b>sanctions</b> regime <b>against</b> <b>Iraq,</b> including the Oil for Food program, is worth close scrutiny not because it was a scandal, although scandal there was, but because taken as a whole, it is the most successful use of international sanctions on record.
