Sugar House is an area which {{has been the focus of}} redevelopment efforts such as the UTA <b>S-Line</b> Streetcar.

On the main lines, approximately 28 miles of lines run through underground sections with 32 miles on elevated tracks. Track segments are internally referred to by letter: the A-line from Fremont to Lake Merritt; the C-line from Pittsburg/Bay Point to Rockridge; the L-line Dublin/Pleasanton to Bay Fair; the M-, W-, and Y-lines from West Oakland to Millbrae; the R-line from Richmond to MacArthur; and the <b>S-line</b> from Fremont to Warm Springs.|$|E

Here we determine all partial three-spaces S for which the S-planes are planes of PG(n, q), for which the <b>S-lines</b> are all the lines contained in the S-planes, for which the S-points are all the points in the S-planes, and for which the incidence relation is that of PG(n, q). More generally, we determine all partial three-spaces S for which the <b>S-lines</b> are lines of PG(n,q), for which the S-points are all the points on these lines, and for which the incidence relation is that of PG(n, q) ...|$|R
5000|$|BCR (Beijing City Rail) {{also known}} as Beijing Suburban Railway is a {{commuter}} rail service that connects urban Beijing with outlying districts and counties {{beyond the reach of}} the city's Beijing Subway network. The [...] "S"-numbered suburban rail lines are managed by the Beijing Railway Bureau, an agency of the Ministry of Railways that is not affiliated with the Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp., Ltd, the municipal company that operates the subway. Hence, the <b>S-Lines</b> run on separate tracks and stations and have a different fare schedule from the subway. There is only one suburban railway line currently in operation, the S2. A total of six <b>S-lines</b> are planned to be built by 2020.|$|R

50|$|The {{system was}} {{established}} in May 1990 as a unified fare system with a coordinated local train network. Local train lines were prefixed with the letter S (S-Bahn). <b>S-Lines</b> 1 through 43 (with some lines missing) and now form part of the S-Bahn Network. A proof-of-payment fare system is in force on all S-Bahn trains. Fare gates are not used, but those caught without a valid ticket during a random inspection face a minimum fine of CHF 100.|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of this station has increased with {{the extension of the}} Milan suburban railway service to Pavia and Lodi, and the new residential district called Santa Giulia. The station is fully operational. The station includes a stop for the Regionale trains from Parma to the Milano Centrale station, and it became possible in August 2009 to change to the <b>S-lines</b> for connections through the Passante into Central Milan and on to Malpensa Airport at Bovisa.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lines are}} {{numbered}} {{according to the}} following system: The main lines are numbered with one-digit numbers, starting east and following in the counter-clockwise direction. Then, the connecting lines (S12, S29, S41) are numbered with two-digit numbers, composing of the numbers of the main lines to which they connect. The lines named [...] "R3" [...] etc. are fast trains which run along the same tracks as the <b>S-lines</b> but still stop at multiple stations integrated into the PID system.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet A be the {{coordinate}} ring of <b>s-lines</b> {{through the}} origin in An + 1 (k). We discuss {{what it means}} for these lines to be in “sufficiently general position” and then, with this restriction on the lines, we attempt to verify our belief that the Cohen-Macaulay type of A depends only on s and n. We characterize those s and n for which A is a Gorenstein ring (i. e. of C-M type 1) and explicitly calculate the Cohen-Macaulay type in several other cases. We then extend some of our results to the case of an arbitrary reduced curve whose tangent cone consists of lines in sufficiently general position. Finally, we calculate the Hubert-Samuel polynomials of the curves we have been considering...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} during {{selection process}} (starting material, material after 3 and 5 cycles of mass-selection and breeding lines produced by selfing and 4 cycles of pedigree selection) obtained from two local Greek cabbage Open-Pollinated (OP) populations was investigated, using RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) markers, on 12 individual plants selected from each population. A {{total number of}} 24 random primers were employed and in the entire material studied 277 bands were detected {{with an average of}} 11. 54 bands/primer. Some of the bands (80 or 72 out of all the bands) revealed polymorphism in selection products of the cabbage populations at an average of 3. 47 and 3. 00 polymorphic bands/primer for each population. Nei`s standard genetic distances between the selected products were grouped by the Unweighted Pair Group Method and Arithmetic Average (UPGMA) clustering method. Average genetic diversity within and between the selection cycles and <b>S-lines</b> was evaluated. It was concluded that RAPD markers could be used to monitor changes occurring during the breeding process in the two cabbage populations...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>S-Line</b> (formerly {{known as}} Sugar House Streetcar) is a {{streetcar}} transit line that connects Sugar House (a neighborhood of Salt Lake City) with the neighboring city of South Salt Lake, {{as well as}} the UTA TRAX system. It is a joint project between UTA, Salt Lake City, and South Salt Lake. The <b>S-Line</b> runs along the old Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW) line (which lies between 2100 South and the I-80 freeway) from the Central Pointe TRAX Station in South Salt Lake east to McClelland Street (1040 East) in Salt Lake City. The <b>S-Line</b> line differs slightly from the TRAX lines in that it travels a slower speed, stops more often, and has [...] "stops" [...] instead of [...] "stations". It is also intended for shorter trips than TRAX, as the initial length of the entire line is only about 2 miles km.|$|E
