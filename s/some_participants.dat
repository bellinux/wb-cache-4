5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, <b>some</b> <b>participants</b> {{felt that this}} was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>participants</b> {{tried to}} track Russian down {{to have their}} {{questions}} answered. One contestant, Louise Miles, discovered that Russian's production company, NRP, did not actually exist and that {{the woman who had}} been answering their phone calls was really Russian's mother, Margaret. Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. <b>Some</b> <b>participants</b> said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} the widespread existence of antisocial punishment, that is, the sanctioning {{of people who}} behave prosocially. Our evidence comes from public goods experiments that we conducted in 16 comparable participant pools around the world. However, {{there is a huge}} cross-societal variation. <b>Some</b> <b>participant</b> pools punished the high contributors as much as they punished the low contributors, whereas in others people only punished low contributors. In <b>some</b> <b>participant</b> pools, antisocial punishment was strong enough to remove the cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment. We also show that weak norms of civic cooperation and the weakness {{of the rule of law}} in a country are significant predictors of antisocial punishment. Our results show that punishment opportunities are socially beneficial only if complemented by strong social norms of cooperation...|$|R

5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although <b>some</b> <b>participants</b> of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} planned {{to begin at}} 2:30 AM local time by the organizers, but due to large crowds and <b>some</b> <b>participants</b> {{arriving}} late, the race officially started at 2:43. The riders formed three groups on the road, of which the first one contained twenty riders when it passed through the checkpoint in Brescia. The group further thinned to sixteen {{by the time it}} reached Verona, and to eleven when it arrived at the checkpoint in Vicenza. From the group, the sprint to the finish line was mainly contested by Giovanni Micheletto and Giuseppe Santhià, of which the former managed to win the leg. With Atala-Dunlop's Micheletto winning the stage and his teammate Carlo Galetti finishing third, Atala-Dunlop acquired seven points and the lead in the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the Scandinavian Episcopal Conference followed only two months after that of the Apostolic Delegation. Convoked by the Apostolic Delegate, the entire hierarchy of the five countries met in Bergen (South Norway) on May 1, 1960, with the prime purpose of founding a proper bishops' conference. <b>Some</b> <b>participants</b> were still {{the same as in}} 1951 (Bishops Cobben, Mangers, Suhr, and Wember).

25|$|The study Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance (2009) {{identified}} the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; <b>some</b> <b>participants,</b> from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, <b>some</b> <b>participants</b> deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants had to hold the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{problems}} with sexual functioning mentioned by participants in this study, the most common problems listed for males were experiencing anxiety about performing sexually (81.4%) and premature ejaculation (74.4%).

Common problems for girls included difficulties with sexual climax (orgasm) (86.7%), not feeling sexually interested during a sexual situation (81.2%), unsatisfactory vaginal lubrication (75.8%) anxiety about performing sexually (75.8%) and painful intercourse (25.8%). Most problems listed by the girls were not persistent problems. However, inability to experience orgasm {{seemed to be an}} issue that was persistent for <b>some</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E
