25|$|Marighella {{speaks of}} the urban {{environment}} as being as or more concealing than the jungle. Walls, roofs, and other structural features interrupt line-of-sight (LOS) and make overhead imagery of less value in urban areas than in others. Such barriers preclude penetration by many sensors. There may be a limited capability provided by advanced thermal sensors, and, if available, penetrating radar, typically from airborne or <b>spaceborne</b> senseors that are not readily available.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{freeze-up}} {{depends on}} the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the Arctic {{can be obtained from}} airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman et al. 1975) and <b>spaceborne</b> optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.|$|E
500|$|... is a four-episode Japanese {{science fiction}} {{original}} net animation (ONA) released by Gonzo in 2001. The story {{is set in}} the near future, when Earth is threatened by a <b>spaceborne</b> virus that turns humans into violent creatures and enhanced soldiers are fighting a war against the creatures in order to ensure the survival of the human race. The series was directed by Seiji Mizushima and written by Natsuko Takahashi. Music for the series was composed by Kenji Kawai. Zaion was licensed for an English language release in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperspectral, {{as opposed}} to multispectral, {{processing}} gives the potential of improved spectral signature measurement from airborne and <b>spaceborne</b> sensor platforms. Sensors on these platforms, however, must compensate for atmospheric effects. Such compensation is easiest with high contrast targets sensed through well-behaved atmosphere with even, reliable illumination, the real world will not always be so cooperative. [...] For more complicated situations, one can not simply compensate for the atmospheric and illumination conditions by taking them out. The Invariant Algorithm for target detection was designed to find many possible combinations of these conditions for the image.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with most}} {{government}} agencies, building equipment often is contracted. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), {{responsible for the}} development and operation of airborne and <b>spaceborne</b> sensors, long was a joint operation of the CIA and the United States Department of Defense. NRO had been significantly involved {{in the design of}} such sensors, but the NRO, then under DCI authority, contracted more of the design that had been their tradition, and to a contractor without extensive reconnaissance experience, Boeing. The next-generation satellite Future Imagery Architecture project [...] "how does heaven look", which missed objectives after $4 billion in cost overruns, was the result of this contract.|$|E
2500|$|CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) is a high-priority NASA decadal survey mission, {{originally}} {{selected as}} such by the National Research Council in 2007. [...] The CLARREO mission {{is intended to}} provide a metrology laboratory in orbit to accurately quantify and attribute Earth's climate change (see List of climate research satellites). The mission is also designed to transfer its high accuracy to other <b>spaceborne</b> sensors. It {{would serve as a}} reference calibration standard in orbit, making climate trends apparent in their data sets within a 30-year time frame. [...] These measurements may go on to enable testing, validation, and improvement of climate model prediction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, a Pathfinder {{mission to}} the full CLARREO mission {{received}} funding. [...] "The allocated funds support the flight of a Reflected Solar (RS) spectrometer, hosted on the International Space Station (ISS) in the 2020 time frame. ... The CPF is a Class D mission with 1 year of operations on orbit and 1 year for analysis of acquired data." [...] The mission is designed to demonstrate essential measurement technologies in orbit {{that can be used}} to reduce the risk of a full CLARREO mission. CLARREO Pathfinder has two primary objectives: to demonstrate high accuracy on orbit traceable to International Systems of Units (SI) and to transfer that accuracy to other <b>spaceborne</b> sensors. Pathfinders baseline objective compared to the full CLARREO mission is relaxed by a factor of two from 0.15% to 0.3% (k=1).|$|E
2500|$|Dialog in [...] "Datalore" [...] {{establishes}} some of Data's backstory. It is {{stated that}} he was deactivated in 2336 on Omicron Theta before an attack by the Crystalline Entity, a <b>spaceborne</b> creature which converts life forms to energy for sustenance. He was found and reactivated by Starfleet personnel two years later. Data went to Starfleet Academy from 2341–45 (he describes himself as [...] "Class of '78" [...] to Riker in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but that may refer to the stardate and not the year that he graduated) and then served in Starfleet aboard the USS Trieste. He {{was assigned to the}} Enterprise under Captain Jean-Luc Picard in 2364. In [...] "Datalore", Data discovers his amoral brother, Lore, and learns that he was created after Lore. Lore fails in an attempt to betray the Enterprise to the Crystalline Entity, and Wesley Crusher beams Data's brother into space at the episode's conclusion.|$|E
