5|$|At {{the tour}} finals Federer and Djokovic both reached the final, but Federer withdrew citing injury {{following}} a brutal semifinal against Wawrinka. Federer recovered {{to win the}} Davis Cup {{as part of the}} Switzerland team for his, and the country's, first triumph in the competition, leading many people to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> tennis career was now complete. Collectively, the Big Four won 19 titles in 2014, but two Slam titles and two Masters titles went to other players. In the end-of-year rankings, Djokovic, Federer and Nadal held the top three spots, with Murray in sixth.|$|E
5|$|Reformers {{attached}} {{great importance}} to the elevation and translation of saints, moving their bodies from their initial resting place to a higher and more prominent location {{to make them more}} accessible for veneration. An important precursor was the seventh-century translation of the remains of St Benedict himself from Monte Cassino to Fleury Abbey. By the tenth century, translation usually involved a grand procession, an elaborate new shrine and often reconstruction of the church. Almost nothing is known of the life of Swithun, who was an obscure ninth-century Bishop of Winchester until Æthelwold launched a major cult of him as a saint, and translated his grave from outside the Old Minster to a new shrine inside. After Æthelwold's own death in 984 his progress to becoming the subject of a cult followed the conventional path: his grave {{is said to have been}} neglected until he appeared in a vision to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> body should be moved, and his successor Ælfheah then built a new choir to hold his body, where it became the focus of miracles.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{goes along}} to a cookery class that Vanessa is {{teaching}} and flirts with Tiffany Giles (Shaye Hopkins) to make Vanessa jealous. She invites him {{to dinner and}} he suffers an allergic reaction to the food. Vanessa and Rhys almost kiss, but are interrupted by Lucas. The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month study tour in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his hand on a piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that he has only a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns that there has been no improvement to his hand. After altering the report to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> nerves are healing, Rhys is invited to assist Jessica in surgery.|$|E

According to the Yi Zhou Shu and Mencius the battle was very bloody. The classic, Ming-era novel Fengshen Yanyi retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict where rival factions of gods supported different sides in the war.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 1864, the War Department {{appointed}} Colonel Sweet {{as commander}} of the camp. He {{had been at the}} camp for seven months and wanted the post. (Some historians now doubt his claim to have been wounded at the battle of Perryville, because he claimed that two wounds, including a chest wound, were treated by ordinary soldiers, not doctors. On the other hand, other sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> right arm was rendered useless by the wounds.) In any event, Sweet transferred to the Invalid Corps.|$|E
25|$|Walter Whitehead {{was born}} on 12October 1840 at Haslam Hey, between Lowercroft and Walshaw in Bury, Lancashire. He was a son of John Whitehead and Eliza Ellen (née Allanson). According to some sources, his family had been textile {{bleacher}}s in the Lowercroft area for well over 200 years prior to his birth, while others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father came from Penwortham Priory, near Preston. His father was a bleacher and perhaps also a dyer and printer of textiles. Among his relations were the inventors John Kay (flying shuttle), Robert Kay (drop box for weaving looms) and Robert Whitehead (torpedo).|$|E

His body was discovered by a Marine helicopter on September 8, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Some {{close to}} Marriott, {{such as his}} wife and even Marriott himself, would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{personality}} changed for the worse when he toured America. Eventually, possibly {{as a result of}} excessive alcohol and drug use, Marriott started showing signs of mild schizophrenia. He had regularly taken amphetamines (speed) and smoked cannabis in his days in the Moments and Small Faces, and {{in the latter half of}} the 1960s he also tried LSD. But by the time Humble Pie began to tour America regularly in the early 1970s, Marriott allegedly developed a destructive cocaine and alcohol addiction, which is thought to have been the cause of his marriage break-ups and to have contributed to his premature death in a house fire.|$|E
25|$|One of Abu Tir's most {{noticeable}} physical attributes and trademarks is his bright orange beard. The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called henna, a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours. Residents in his native village of Umm Tuba <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> signature beard does help him stand out when he is out campaigning at public events and functions.|$|E

25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
