Results showed that expectations of emotional support from male and female friends were related to greater willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from friends of the same gender. Previous help-seeking experience was related to greater willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from female friends, but less willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from male friends for males.

5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system.

Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the relationship between emotional competence and willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> for emotional problems and suicidal ideation. A survey of 300 university undergraduates assessed emotional competence (skill at emotion perception, managing self-relevant emotions, and managing others 2 ̆ 7 emotions), hopelessness, willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from health professionals (e. g. counsellor) and nonprofessionals (friends, family), and perceived usefulness of past help-seeking experience. Those who reported feeling less skilled at managing emotions were less willing to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> {{from family and friends}} for both emotional problems and suicidal ideation and less willing to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from health professionals for suicidal ideation. These relationships held even after controlling for hopelessness, sex, and past help-seeking experience. Mediational analysis suggested that people low in managing others 2 ̆ 7 emotions were less willing to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from professionals because they had had poorer experiences with mental health professionals in the past. There was no significant relationship between emotion perception skill and willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help.</b> People most likely to be in need of help (those poor at managing emotions) were the least willing to seek it, and if they did seek it, were the least likely to benefit from it...|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{release of}} the game as Dragon Warrior II was created by Enix {{themselves}} and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal battery backup instead to record the player's progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> from its king. The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Eighty-six {{university}} {{students with learning}} disabil-ities (LDs) completed measures of self-esteem and of perceptions of their LDs. In addition, they rated their willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from academic services in response to two experimental manipu-lations: (a) they read vignettes about a student requesting help from professors or peers and receiving positive or negative reac-tions; and (b) they listened to audiotaped radio advertisements for academic services on a college campus, emphasizing either learning or performance goals. Participants reported the most willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> after reading about a positive reaction from a professor and the least willingness to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> after read-ing about a negative reaction from a professor.

40|$|In recent years, many {{researchers}} {{tried to explain}} the social selection in use of mental health care services. A modest role is attributed to the orientation toward help-seeking. This article studies this orientation. Our research-population consisted of 10, 171 Dutch persons, aged 18 and older. Analysis showed {{that most people are}} prone to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> for one or more emotional problems. People who are more prone to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> are younger, have had more education and have a higher family income. They have more often acquaintances working in mental health care. People who are more prone to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> do not see chance as the locus of control of health. These people are less dependent on their GP for common disorders and are more open about mental health matters. The results of discriminant analysis are not satisfactory, but when we try to distinguish the groups of people who are and who are not willing to <b>seek</b> <b>help,</b> we see that the best discriminating factor is their help-seeking attitude for common disorders. People who have high expectations from the GP for common disorders, clearly do have a preference to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> for the emotional problems. The groups of people who are more willing to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from the GP compared to mental health professionals cannot be distinguished by these expectations. Here the level of education discriminates fairly well: people who are more prone to <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from a GP have a lower educational level. Future research should be focussed on the testing of a theoretical model that explains the orientation toward help-seeking for emotional problems and selection in help-seeking with longitudinal data.

40|$|Funding: Medical School, University of St AndrewsDespite {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} psychological distress, many students in higher education do not <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> for difficulties. This study explored undergraduate student understanding of the concepts of mental health and mental well-being and where undergraduate students would <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> for mental well-being difficulties. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 undergraduate students from 5 different subject areas. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed.
