50|$|Aluminium alloys {{are widely}} used in {{automotive}} engines, particularly in cylinder blocks and crankcases due to the weight savings that are possible. Since aluminium alloys are susceptible to warping at elevated temperatures, the cooling system of such engines is critical. Manufacturing techniques and metallurgical advancements have also been instrumental for the successful application in automotive engines. In the 1960s, the aluminium cylinder heads of the Corvair earned a reputation for failure and <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> which is not seen in current aluminium cylinder heads.|$|E
40|$|Future warheads face {{not only}} performance-, {{environmental}}- and environmental resistance requirements {{but are also}} facing requirements to reduce collateral damage on impact. This report is a concept study {{on the development of}} shatter free shell bodies for warheads carried out at Saab Dynamics AB. Focus of the concept study was identifying alternative materials for use in the warhead casing, identifying manufacturing processes useable in the production of casings of selected materials, identifying possible suppliers both in Sweden and abroad, as well as calculating an indication of manufacturing cost for both prototype and series manufacturing. A pre-study was carried out before initiating the concept study, studying earlier research performed within the field and retrieving basic knowledge of warhead component configuration and functionality, followed by establishing a requirement specification to be used for evaluation purposes during the concept study. Concept study material evaluation concluded the use of a fibre strengthened polymer matrix composites to achieve desired final properties of the component. Important factors for alternative materials ability to achieve required mechanical properties were found to be the need for high fibre volume content, long fibre reinforcements as well as the need for possibility of orienting fibre direction in order to accommodate applied stresses. An evaluation was executed of applicable manufacturing methods ability to attain good values of selected material factors, derived from the material evaluation; as well as an assessment of set methods repeatability, potential for automation and relative laminate quality. Combined with estimation of prime and sales cost resulted in the recommended use of filament winding using a thermoset polymer matrix. Combining process factors of the selected manufacturing method with remaining material alternatives resulted in further delimitation of materials and a final material recommendation. Subsequently threading integrity was evaluated for selected concept solution due to that only unfavourable fibre orientation in the section being possible. This resulted in the need of minor dimension changes to avoid <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> during firing sequence. Estimated required dimensional change was assessed as acceptable but would however need be evaluated in future development. Final recommendation for future development is to commence testing of shell body composed of filament winded carbon epoxy composite. Estimated required dimensional changes is an increase slipping groove radius from 0, 3 mm to 1, 5 mm and an increase of thread length by 6 mm...|$|E
40|$|Self-advancing tool bits {{that are}} hybrids of drills and stepped taps make it {{possible}} to form threaded holes wider than about 1 / 2 in. (about 13 mm) without applying any more axial force than is necessary for forming narrower pilot holes. These self-advancing stepped-tap drills were invented for use by space-suited astronauts performing repairs on reinforced carbon/carbon space-shuttle leading edges during space walks, in which the ability to apply axial drilling forces is severely limited. Self-advancing stepped-tap drills could also be used on Earth for making wide holes without applying large axial forces. A self-advancing stepped-tap drill (see figure) includes several sections having progressively larger diameters, typically in increments between 0. 030 and 0. 060 in. (between about 0. 8 and about 1. 5 mm). The tip section, which is the narrowest, is a pilot drill bit that typically has a diameter between 1 / 8 and 3 / 16 in. (between about 3. 2 and about 4. 8 mm). The length of the pilot-drill section is chosen, according to the thickness of the object to be drilled and tapped, so that the pilot hole is completed before engagement of the first tap section. Provided that the cutting-edge geometry of the drill bit is optimized for the material to be drilled, only a relatively small axial force [typically of the order of a few pounds (of the order of 10 newtons) ] must be applied during drilling of the pilot hole. Once the first tap section engages the pilot hole, it is no longer necessary for the drill operator to apply axial force: the thread engagement between the tap and the workpiece provides the axial force to advance the tool bit. Like the pilot-drill section, each tap section must be long enough to complete its hole before engagement of the next, slightly wider tap section. The precise values of the increments in diameter, the thread pitch, the rake angle of the tap cutting edge, and other geometric parameters of the tap sections must be chosen, in consideration of the workpiece material and thickness, to prevent <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> during the drilling/tapping operation. A stop-lip or shoulder at the shank end of the widest tap section prevents further passage of the tool bit through the hole...|$|E

However, industry specification for subsea production systems, e. g. such as API Specifications 6 A, 16 A, 16 C, and 17 D, allows {{the use of}} low strength heavy hex nuts, e. g.

In the refining and chemical industries the common practice is to use ASTM A 193 B 7 studs with 2 H nuts. Calculations and testing of nuts have been performed and capacity formulas have been established for nut structural capacities.

6000|$|Her way lay along Faber Street, {{the main}} artery of Hampton, a wide <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> asphalt <b>threaded</b> with car tracks, lined {{on both sides}} with incongruous edifices {{indicative}} of a rapid, undiscriminating, and artless prosperity.

Here, during those months when the sun made the asphalt soft, on a scaffolding spanning the window of the store, might be seen a perspiring young man in his shirt sleeves chalking up baseball scores for the benefit of a crowd below. Then came the funereal, liver-coloured, long-windowed Hinckley Block (1872), and on the corner a modern, glorified drugstore thrusting forth plate glass bays--two on Faber Street and three on Stanley--filled with cameras and candy, hot water bags, throat sprays, catarrh and kidney cures, calendars, fountain pens, stationery, and handy alcohol lamps.

40|$|Abstract—To {{determine}} the length <b>of</b> engagement <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a bolt {{installed in a}} tapped part {{in order to avoid}} the threads stripping remains a very current problem in the design <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> assemblies. It does not exist a calculation method formalized for the cases where the bolt is screwed directly in a ductile material. In this article, we study the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>threads</b> <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> a loaded assembly by using a modelling by finite elements and a rupture criterion by damage. This modelling enables us to study the different parameters likely to influence the behavior of this bolted connection. We study in particular, the influence of couple of materials constituting the connection, of the bolt’s diameter and the geometrical characteristics of the tapped part, like the external diameter and the length <b>of</b> engagement <b>threads.</b> We established an experiments design to know the most significant parameters. That enables us to propose a simple expression making possible to calculate the resistance <b>of</b> the <b>threads</b> whatever the metallic materials of the bolt and the tapped part. We carried out stripping tests in order to validate our model. The estimated results are very close to those obtained by the tests. Keywords—Bolt, damage, plasticity, stripping, thread assemblies.

Classification comprises also combined tools based on design <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy.
