40|$|Remotely-operated vehicle <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> inshore {{rockfish}} (Sebastes spp.) are low-cost and non-lethal, but frequently {{result in}} density estimates with high variance. Adaptive cluster sampling {{may result in}} more precise abundance estimates when the distribution of organisms is rare and clustered. Using computer simulations, I investigate the ability of adaptive cluster sampling to reduce sampling variance for remotely-operated vehicle <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> rockfish. In general, adaptive cluster sampling was less precise than simple random sampling in <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> equivalent sampling effort. Adaptive cluster sampling was only more precise (for equivalent sample size) for highly clustered rockfish populations, large initial sample sizes, and small numbers of adaptively sampled units, conditions which are not likely met for ROV <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> rockfish, based on my analyses. Adaptive cluster sampling is not recommended for remotely operated vehicle <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> rockfish and other strategies should be investigated to increase the precision of abundance estimates...|$|R

5|$|As {{a nucleus}} of the 19th- and early 20th-century Bengal Renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many people from Kolkata—among them several Nobel laureates—have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. Kolkata culture {{features}} idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle intellectual exchanges (adda). West Bengal's share of the Bengali film industry is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. Among professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> India, the Botanical <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> India and the Indian Public Health Association. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president.
