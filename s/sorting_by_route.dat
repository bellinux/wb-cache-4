40|$|The {{understanding}} of genome rearrangements {{is an important}} endeavor in comparative genomics. A major computational problem in this field is finding a shortest sequence of genome rearrangements that transforms, or sorts, one genome into another. In this paper we focus on sorting a multi-chromosomal genome by translocations. We reveal new relationships between this problem and the well studied problem of <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reversals. Based on these relationships, we develop two new algorithms for <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reciprocal translocations, which mimic known algorithms for <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reversals: a score-based method building on Bergeron’s algorithm, and a recursive procedure similar to the Berman-Hannenhalli method. Though their proofs are more involved, our procedures for reciprocal translocations match {{the complexities of the}} original ones for reversals. Key words: genome rearrangement, <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> translocations, <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> reversals. 1...|$|R

40|$|Researchers and {{educators}} often {{argue that a}} student's peers strongly influence his or her educational outcomes. If so, an unequal distribution of advantaged and disadvantaged students across schools in a community will leave many students doubly disadvantaged and amplify existing inequalities. We explore {{the relationship between the}} degree of <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> socioeconomic characteristics, ethnicity and language across schools within a community and inequality as measured by the variance of standardized high school exam scores within the community. Simple cross- sectional estimates suggest a direct relationship between <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> ethnicity and the variance of test scores, but no direct relationship between <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> income or primary parent's education and the variance of test scores. We then implement a fixed effects estimator to control for endogeneity in the extent of sorting: the results indicate that <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> ethnicity does not affect the variance of test scores, but that <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> home language and primary parent's education does. social interactions, peer effects, sorting, classroom effects...|$|R

40|$|Generalization is a {{fundamental}} cognitive process; however mechanisms of generalization early in development remain contested. According to one theoretical position, from very early in development conceptual information takes precedence over perceptual information. According to the alternative position, effects of conceptual knowledge have a protracted developmental course. The goal of the present research was to examine directly whether 3 - to 5 -year-old children privilege conceptual information over perceptual information. Participants were presented with triads of objects in which category membership conflicted with appearance similarity. Half {{of the children were}} first asked to <b>sort</b> pictures <b>by</b> category membership and then switch to <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> similarity; the order of tasks was reversed for {{the other half of the}} children. A strong asymmetry in perseveration errors was observed across all three age groups: there was a marked decrease in accuracy when children were asked to switch form <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> similarity to <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> category membership, whereas the decrease was less pronounced when children were asked to switch from <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> category membership to <b>sorting</b> <b>by</b> similarity (particularly for 4 - and 5 -year-old children who exhibited virtually no decrease in accuracy in the latter condition) ...|$|R
