He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach,</b> giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E

5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|This new-found unity between East and West did not, however, {{solve the}} ongoing {{disputes}} in the east. Justinian's policies switched between attempts to force Monophysites {{to accept the}} Chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks – thereby embittering their sympathizers in Egypt and other provinces – and attempts at a compromise that would win over the Monophysites without surrendering the Chalcedonian faith. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> {{was supported by the}} Empress Theodora, who favoured the Monophysites unreservedly. In the condemnation of the Three Chapters, three theologians that had opposed Monophysitism before and after the Council of Chalcedon, Justinian tried to win over the opposition. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council, most of the Eastern church yielded to the Emperor's demands, and Pope Vigilius, who was forcibly brought to Constantinople and besieged at a champel, finally also gave his assent. However, the condemnation was received unfavourably in the west, where it led to new (albeit temporal) schism, and failed to reach its goal in the east, as the Monophysites, remained unsatisfied; all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.|$|E
