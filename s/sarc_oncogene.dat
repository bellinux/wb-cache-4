[...] "The <b>SARC</b> <b>oncogene,</b> a malignant gene first discovered in chickens, causes cancer in humans as well. When Ohno translated the gene to music, it sounded very much like Chopin`s Funeral March". [...] "An enzyme (phosphoglyceratekinase), which breaks down sugar (glucose) in the body revealed itself to Ohno as a lullaby. ``A violinist recorded the tune, and when kindergarten teachers in Tokyo play it, their youngsters yawn and willingly take their naps,``" [...] said Ohno. The biologist, with no formal training in music, [...] "decided to assign notes according to the molecular weights" [...] and [...] "put the heavier molecules in lower positions, and the lighter molecules higher". With DNA being composed of four subunits, he mapped each to two positions on the musics staff, forming an octave. He found that the more evolved an organism is, the more complicated is the music. His ultimate hope was [...] "to find is some basic pattern that governs all life[...] [...]everything." ...|$|E

Concepts delineated by Knudson regarding hereditary cancers in man and experimental animals will probably be found operative in certain demographic units (oncozoons) among feral fishes bearing neoplasms. Hereditary factors include: antioncogenes (regulatory genes), which act as suppressors of neoplastic expression in homozygous, heterozygous, or hemizygous states, as well as constitutional (structural) genes that influence carcinogen activation or deactivation through enzyme gene products, genes that influence immunologic responses, and gene abnormalities that favor spontaneous or induced mutations. The two major classes of genes (oncogenes and antioncogenes) that influence the manifestation of cancers appear to operate through different mechanisms, but conceivable interactions have not been widely investigated, especially in tumor enzootics among feral fishes. Some explorations have been undertaken in the laboratory by Anders and collaborators in studies of suppressor genes (antioncogenes) and the cellular <b>sarc</b> gene (an <b>oncogene)</b> in melanophoromas in platyfish-swordtail hybrids and backcrosses. Some feral fish oncozoons that exhibit features of hereditary oncodemes as seen in man have been tentatively identified here as candidate systems to be studied more intensively in laboratories, particularly using cytogeneti...|$|R
