40|$|Abstract – Four {{members of}} Engineers without Borders – UCLA (EWB-UCLA), constituting the Thinklab! team, {{collected}} eleven laptops from various personal and corporate donors {{to establish the}} Thinklab! computer laboratory. The project aspired to provide an education resource to encourage learning and creativity for a small children’s center called El Buen Samaraitano, in Jocotenango, Guatemala. The team members tested each computer individually for functionality and installed Linux and OpenOffice, free alternatives to Microsoft Windows and Office. After setting up the units, approximately 25 students attended several weeks of typing, computing, and lab maintenance courses. Meanwhile, to address cultural impacts and logistical concerns, the Thinklab! team developed a close partnership with El Buen Samaritano directors. Design {{and implementation of the}} project covered eight main areas of focus: location, hardware and <b>software,</b> <b>transportation,</b> customs, Internet, classroom, benchmarking, and recycling.

40|$|Geographic {{information}} systems (GIS) are being increasingly deployed by transportation agencies {{to help them}} display, review, and utilize data. The primary items of interest are transportation facilities and services, which may {{take the form of}} highways, airports, bus routes, and seaports, among others. Using GIS <b>software,</b> <b>transportation</b> facilities are represented as geometric shapes; i. e., points, lines, and areas. However, it is increasingly apparent to GIS users in the field of transportation that a geometry-based approach is not sufficient. The offered solution is to develop a feature-based GIS approach for transportation. The central requirement of such an approach is to have an unambiguously identified set of transportation features and a means of locating related features and attributes on or adjacent to the transportation features. For linear transportation features, the common location referencing system (LRS) is also linear. Usually based on milepoint offsets from a beginning point, linear LRSs are widely used by transportation agencies to locate data stored in numerous legacy databases. Some agencies may have multiple linear LRSs for various applications or topical areas. Data users unfamiliar with linear LRSs have difficulty using highway data provided by transportation agencies, and the correlation of linear and non-linear LRSs is generally quite difficult. The result is that sharing of digital road map databases within and among organizations is difficult since there are no consistent ways of representing transportation features, and different decision rules exist as to what features to include and how they are identified. Numerous efforts are underway to develop a national standard for linear LRS design and implementation, including a set of field procedures to ensure that needed accuracy is achieved. This paper will describe a means to unambiguously define transportation features using a simple set of naming rules. These rules will support linear and other forms of LRS for all types of transportation features, including airports, seaports, railroads, highways, transit services, bridges, intersections, signs, and related facilities and services. Such features may be displayed at multiple scales as point, line, and area graphical objects...|$|E
40|$|This {{final report}} for {{research}} that {{was supported by}} grant number NAG- 1 - 995 documents our progress in addressing two difficulties in parallel programming. The first difficulty is developing software that will execute quickly on a parallel computer. The second difficulty is transporting software between dissimilar parallel computers. In general, we expect that more hardware-specific information {{will be included in}} software designs for parallel computers than in designs for sequential computers. This inclusion is an instance of portability being sacrificed for high performance. New parallel computers are being introduced frequently. Trying to keep one's software on the current high performance hardware, a software developer almost continually faces yet another expensive <b>software</b> <b>transportation.</b> The problem of the proposed research is to create a design methodology that helps designers to more precisely control both portability and hardware-specific programming details. The proposed research emphasizes programming for scientific applications. We completed our study of the parallelizability of a subsystem of the NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data processing system. This work is summarized in section two. A more detailed description is provided in Appendix A ('Programming Practices to Support Eventual Parallelism'). Mr. Chrisman, a graduate student, wrote and successfully defended a Ph. D. dissertation proposal which describes our research associated with the issues of software portability and high performance. The list of research tasks are specified in the proposal. The proposal 'A Design Methodology for Portable Software on Parallel Computers' is summarized in section three and is provided in its entirety in Appendix B. We are currently studying a proposed subsystem of the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data processing system. This software is the proof-of-concept for the Ph.

40|$|It {{is common}} in {{practice}} that many companies build complex and highly delicate business processes around their legacy (existing software) systems making it extremely difficult and costly to switch software systems or to change their business processes. Software re-engineering is an approach that takes legacy software that has become expensive to maintain or whose implementation is obsolete, and reconstructs it with current software technologies. The software re-engineering approach is important for recovering and reusing existing software assets, putting high software maintenance costs under control, and establishing a base for future software development. Top Hat, Inc. started developing its demand-response <b>transportation</b> <b>software</b> in 1994. Today, it is {{a vital part of}} their business.
