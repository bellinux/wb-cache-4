40|$|This paper explores The Devil's Playground (Schepisi, 1976), with {{reference}} points {{from the opening}} sequence serving as a springboard {{for a discussion of}} the representations of male <b>sexualities</b> <b>and</b> gender identities. In the analysis that follows <b>sexualities</b> <b>and</b> masculinities are taken to be diverse and intersecting, and bodies are understood as powerful sites for their interaction. This analytic focus on <b>sexualities</b> <b>and</b> masculinities reveals that the film speaks to a much wider historical canvas concerning the production of the modern gender order than a 'national cinema' analysis would show...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{editorial}} introduction to Gender, <b>Sexualities</b> <b>and</b> Law. Bringing together an international range of academics, Gender, <b>Sexualities</b> <b>and</b> Law provides a comprehensive interrogation {{of the range}} of contemporary issues – both topical and controversial – raised by the gendered character of law, legal discourse and institutions. The gendering of law, persons and the legal profession, along with the gender bias of legal outcomes, has been a fractious, but fertile, focus of reflection. It has, moreover, been an important site of political struggle. This collection of essays offers an unrivalled examination of its various contemporary dimensions, focusing on: issues of theory and representation; violence, both national and international; reproduction and parenting; <b>and</b> partnership, <b>sexuality,</b> marriage <b>and</b> the family. Gender, <b>Sexualities</b> <b>and</b> Law will be invaluable for all those engaged in research and study of the law (and related fields) as a form of gendered power...|$|R

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of the {{initiative}} to challenge the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act.

Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, <b>sexuality,</b> <b>and</b> healthcare.|$|E
