5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the {{feelings}} that he had, and those that he <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came for {{developmental}} and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56mm candidate weapons were included with the 6mm candidates: the M16 HBAR, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 <b>SAW</b> <b>were</b> selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for {{the conversion of the}} Rodman XM235 to 5.56mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5.56mm conversion of its HK 21A1 (instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.|$|E

The South Vietnamese fleet also received warnings that U.S. Navy radar had detected additional Chinese guided missile frigates and aircraft on their way from Hainan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Saws</b> <b>were</b> {{at first}} {{serrated}} {{materials such as}} flint, obsidian, sea shells and shark teeth.In ancient Egypt, open (unframed) saws made of copper are documented {{as early as the}} Early Dynastic Period, circa 3,100-2,686 BC. Many copper <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> found in tomb No. 3471 dating to the reign of Djer in the 31st century BC. <b>Saws</b> have <b>been</b> used for cutting a variety of materials, including people (see Death by sawing). Models of <b>saws</b> have <b>been</b> found in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types. Egyptian <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> at first serrated, hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes. As the <b>saw</b> developed, teeth <b>were</b> raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. <b>Saws</b> <b>were</b> also made of bronze and later iron. In the Iron Age, frame <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> developed holding the thin blades in tension. The earliest known sawmill is the Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the third century AD and <b>was</b> for <b>sawing</b> stone.|$|R

500|$|Despite a storyline {{running over}} {{a course of}} seven days, Adrienne wears the same {{wardrobe}} throughout the entire game: an orange shirt and black pants.

The only solutions she <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> to allow less decision-making by the player, or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes. Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game. An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen.

500|$|Arnold also {{realized}} such a flanking maneuver was likely, and petitioned Gates {{for permission to}} move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements, where the American skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage. Gates, whose preferred strategy was to sit {{and wait for the}} expected frontal assault, grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan's men and Henry Dearborn's light infantry. [...] When Morgan's men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman, they spotted British advance troops in the field. [...] Fraser's column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field, while Hamilton's column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain. Riedesel's force, while it was on the road, was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans. The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction.

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{criticized the}} Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar issued in 1904–1905: [...] "the lack of spark in these coins, as {{in so many}} designs by Barber or [...] Morgan, {{stems from the fact}} that the faces, hair, and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." [...] He did not believe that the problems he <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> due to the small size of the dollar, stating that the gold dollar of the Panama-Pacific issue, by Charles Keck, is far more beautiful. Vermeule noted that contemporary accounts saw the 1903 issue as an innovation; a 1904 article in the American Journal of Numismatics stated that they [...] "indicate a popular desire for a new departure from the somewhat monotonous types of Liberty which have characterized our money... If this tendency could make itself felt on the regular coinage, it would give a new zeal to collectors." [...] Beginning in 1909 with the Lincoln cent, the Mint would depict an actual person on the circulating coinage; this would become more common with the 1932 Washington quarter.|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
