40|$|The {{interactions}} between two opposing teams {{lead to the}} emergence of unique game patterns. In volleyball, attack efficacy emerges as the strongest predictor of the final result and thus it becomes of foremost importance to understand which game patterns afford the attaining of higher attack efficacies. These rely {{on the quality of the}} setting action. In turn, the serve and the serve reception constrain the setter's actions and the attacker's efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine predictors of the <b>setting</b> <b>zone</b> in elite-level men's volleyball. Thirty-one matches of the 2007 World Cup were analyzed, in total 5117 rallies. The dependent variable was the <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> and the independent variables were the server player, serve type, serve direction, serve depth, reception zone, receiver player and reception type. Multinomial logistic regression was applied, in order to obtain the estimated likelihood of occurrence of the dependent variable, based on the values of the independent variables (p < 0. 05). Only the serve direction showed not to be predictive of the <b>setting</b> <b>zone.</b> Concerning the remaining variables, the tennis jump serve, serves from the middle-player, deep serves, reception near the endline or sidelines, reception by the zone 4 attackers when in defensive zone, and low reception all proved to impair the quality of reception, demanding the setter to play more often in the not acceptable <b>setting</b> <b>zone.</b> Results suggest that, at this level, practice of serve-reception should preferably cover the deep tennis jump serve, and attempt to afford the libero more opportunities to receive. By focusing on the variables with the most predictive power, performers may better allocate their attention towards the most pertinent cues at each moment. Knowledge of these interactive models provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the action sequences, affording coaches important information and guidanc...|$|E

Accordingly, (3) means that during islanding formation, phase A voltage at time dt increases above the voltage <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> and three phase voltages at time dt+T increase above the <b>setting</b> <b>zone</b> after phase-A’s CB is opened.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} how different variables of the setting action affect to the block participation in high level male volleyball. The study sample was comprised of a total of 2742 game actions, divided into 1371 setting actions and 1371 block actions, corresponding to the observation of the 24 matches of the third stage of the World Male Volleyball Championship, absolute category. The dependent variable was block participation (zero or one blocker, two blockers, three blockers). The independent variables were: <b>setting</b> <b>zone</b> (excellent, acceptable, unacceptable), type of set (standing set, jump set), setting technique (overhand set, forearm set), set´s area (zone one, zone two, zone three, zone four, zone six) and tempo of set (first tempo, second tempo, third tempo). The result of this study showed that the variables <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> type of set, set’s area and tempo of set, were predictors of the block participation. Thus, the decision-making of the setter in the setting action as well as the type, area and tempo of set, has high relevance in game, affecting to the block participation of the opposing team.

40|$|This study aims at {{analysing}} probabilistic relationships {{predicting the}} outcomes relating to attack players in elite-level men’s volleyball. Nineteen matches from the 2006 Men’s World Championships were notated and the tactical indicators regarded the space-, task-, player- and efficacy-related dimensions of se-lected game actions (reception, set and attack) played in side-out. A multinomial logistic regression was applied, {{with the level}} of significance determined at. 05. Results showed that the most relevant cues for predicting the selected attack player were related with aspects of setting (<b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> setter position, set-ter type), positioning of the middle player and reception player. Overall, the selection of the attack player is highly predictable and can be anticipated through analysing a number of visual cues previous to the attack. Knowing such patterns will enhance the rate of success of the defending teams, while the attacking teams should try to create strategies of using each set of game constraints in different manners, thus diminishing the possibilities of the opponents to anticipate their actions.

40|$|Change is pervasive, but {{emerging}} {{patterns are}} occasionally detectable through analysis of systemic behaviors. Match analysis uses these patterns {{in order to}} reduce the degree of improvisation and to optimize the training process. However, it is possible that certain game phases elude systematic patterning. In this vein, our aim was to analyze the case of attack coverage in men’s volleyball, as we suspected it would elude systematic patterning and has received negligible attention in scientific research. We analyzed the occurrence of attack coverage in 4544 plays of the 2011 Volleyball World League. A Chi-square test with residual adjusted values was applied to explore significant associations between variables. A Monte Carlo correction was applied, as some cells had n< 5. Effect sizes were determined using Cramer’s V. Overall, attack coverage occurred in 3. 89 % of ball possessions, and 23 distinct structures emerged. These structures lacked significant associations with the game complex, <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> and effect of attack coverage. Conversely, attack coverage structures showed significant associations with the attack zone and tempo, with very strong effect sizes (V= 0. 472 and V= 0. 521, respectively). As certain attack zones are deeply associated with attack tempo, it is apparent that quicker attack plays affect attack coverage structuring, promoting the formation of less complex structures. Ultimately, attack coverage structures seem to depend on momentary constraints, thereby rendering rigid systematization impracticable. Still, we contended that a principle-based approach might be suitable. This invites researchers to rethink how to interpret game regularities...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the effect of}} modifying the analysis zones used to analyse aggregate data for geographic zones. It uses two approaches to do this. Firstly assuming that a population model is available, the effect of misspecification of the zones used to analyse the data is investigated. Secondly, the effects of zoning on the parameter estimates are investigated empirically, by creating a zoning distribution for the parameter estimates obtained using an ecological model for statistics such as population means and regression coefficients. The zoning distribution defines the probability distribution or density function of the statistic over all possible <b>sets</b> of M <b>zones</b> that could be formed, given the constraints used in constructing the zones. Using a combination of statistical theory and empirical investigation, the parameter estimates obtained from the ecological analysis of small area health data are investigated when different <b>sets</b> of geographical <b>zones</b> are used to aggregate the data. By aggregating the data to 8 different scales using multiple <b>sets</b> of <b>zones</b> an empirical zoning distribution is obtained for each parameter estimate at each scale of analysis. This allows the implications of using a particular <b>set</b> of <b>zones</b> to be assessed for both a continuous and a binary response variable. The procedure for creating and analysing the distributions has some innovative aspects. To obtain detailed population information, unit record files from the Australian 2007 - 2008 National Health Survey (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009) were combined with area level constraints from the 2006 Australian Census (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006 a) to simulate realistic individual level data using combinatorial optimisation techniques. The data were aggregated to 1000 <b>sets</b> of <b>zones</b> at eight scales of aggregation using the AZTool program. Empirical zoning distributions were created from the parameter estimates obtained from analysing the data summaries for each <b>set</b> of <b>zones.</b> The {{results show that the}} zoning distribution exists, is approximately normal and its variance increases as the scale increases. Even with over 1000 zones the variance of the zoning distribution cannot be ignored when interpreting the results of a zone based analysis...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the variables that predicted setting efficacy in complex I (KI) in volleyball, in formative categories and depending on gender. The study sample was comprised of 5842 game actions carried out by the 16 male category and the 18 female category teams that participated in the Under- 16 Spanish Championship. The dependent variable was setting efficacy. The independent variables were grouped into: serve variables (a serve zone, the type of serve, striking technique, an in-game role of the server and serve direction), reception variables (a reception zone, a receiver player and reception efficacy) and setting variables (a setter‘s position, a <b>setting</b> <b>zone,</b> the type of a set, setting technique, a set’s area and tempo of a set). Multinomial logistic regression showed that the best predictive variables of setting efficacy, both in female and male categories, were reception efficacy, setting technique and tempo of a set. In the male category, the jump serve was the greatest predictor of setting efficacy, while in the female category, it was the set’s area. Therefore, in the male category, it was not only the preceding action that affected setting efficacy, but also the serve. On the contrary, in the female category, only variables of the action itself and of the previous action, reception, affected setting efficacy. The results obtained in the present study should be taken into account in the training process of both male and female volleyball players in formative stages...|$|E
