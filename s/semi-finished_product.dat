5000|$|Yang et al. {{stated that}} in order to cope with high level of uncertainty, {{purchasing}} postponement (purchasing materials as close to production as possible) product development postponement may be applied => no physical inventory. In contrast, to deal with low uncertainty we use logistics postponement (reduction of obsolete inventories, just-in-time delivery) and production postponement => <b>semi-finished</b> <b>product.</b> With high modularity (when components can be incorporated into products with almost no change) product development and production postponements are used, whereas with low modularity (when customization is required) - logistics and purchasing postponements.This is what exactly was lacking in the 20th century because you did not know whether physical inventory, semi-finished, or finished products would work best as it was uncertain due to fluctuating consumer demands. Therefore, Yang et al. (2004) provides us with a guideline on how to manage this uncertainty.|$|E

40|$|For {{efficiency}} reasons {{many buildings}} are realized {{by using the}} lightweight design principles. The combination of fabric and lightweight structure plays a significant role. Although most lightweight materials, such as aluminum, are {{more expensive than the}} conventional materials concrete and structural steel, savings result due to the comprehensive cost analysis over the lifetime of a building. For example cost advantages can be achieved during the transport to the building site and in the dimensioning of the basement. Semi-finished aluminum foams, especially sandwiches are excellent for lightweight constructions. The applicability has already been proven in several serial applications for machine tools. In the building industry aluminum foam is still an almost unknown material. Due to ist cellular structure aluminum foam is very light. The material has also a high vibration damping capacity. <b>Semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> made from or made with aluminum foam are usually offered in shape of pure foam plates, sandwiches and foam-filled hollow structures. Large structures can excellently be produced by using prefabricated semi-finished aluminum foam. In this lecture the fabrication of the foams, their properties, available composite materials and opportunities for the machinability of the foams and their <b>semi-finished</b> <b>products</b> are shown and principles of lightweight design that can be realized with the new materials will be presented.
