5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was a case of a female <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena.</b> Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and <b>striped</b> <b>hyena.</b> However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{animals that}} are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the muntjac, the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the sloth bear, the dhole, the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> and the golden jackal.

5|$|Unlike the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena,</b> {{for which}} a number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> are {{frequently}} referenced in Middle Eastern literature and folklore, typically {{as symbols of}} treachery and stupidity. In the Near and Middle East, <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> are generally regarded as physical incarnations of jinns. Zakariya al-Qazwini (1204–1283) wrote in Arabic of a tribe of people called [...] "Hyena People". In his book Marvels of Creatures and the Strange Things Existing (...) , he wrote that should one of this tribe be {{in a group of}} 1000 people, a hyena could pick him out and eat him. A Persian medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure cannibalistic people known as kaftar who are said to be [...] "half-man, half-hyena". Al-Doumairy in his writings in Hawayan Al-Koubra (1406) wrote that <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> were vampiric creatures that attacked people at night and sucked the blood from their necks. He also wrote that hyenas only attacked brave people. Arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones. Until the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the bodies of werewolves, if not destroyed, would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas which drank the blood of dying soldiers. The image of <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> in Afghanistan, India and Palestine is more varied. Though feared, <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> were also symbolic for love and fertility, leading to numerous varieties of love medicine derived from hyena body parts. Among the Baloch people and in North India, witches or magicians are said to ride <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> at night.|$|R

25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> is {{primarily}} a scavenger which feeds mainly on ungulate carcasses in different stages of decomposition, fresh bones, cartilages, ligaments and bone marrow. It crushes long bones into fine particles and swallows them, though sometimes entire bones are eaten whole. The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> is not a fussy eater, though it has an aversion to vulture flesh. It will occasionally attack and kill any animal it can overcome. It hunts prey by running it down, grabbing its flanks or groin and inflicting mortal wounds by tearing out the viscera. In Turkmenistan, the species is recorded to feed on wild boar, kulan, porcupines and tortoises. A seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits is an important food source in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, while in the Caucasus, it is grasshoppers. In Israel, the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> feeds on garbage, carrion and fruits. In eastern Jordan, its main sources of food are feral horse and water buffalo carcasses and village refuse. It {{has been suggested that}} only the large hyenas of the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia and the Indian subcontinent attack large prey, with no evidence of their smaller Arabian and east African cousins doing so. Because of its scavenging diet, the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> requires more water to survive than most other carnivores. When eating, the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> gorges itself until satisfied, though hyenas with cubs will transport food to their dens. Because of the high content of calcium in its diet, the faeces of the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> becomes white very rapidly, and can be visible from long distances.|$|E
25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena hyaena) {{may have}} evolved from H. namaquensis of Pliocene Africa. <b>Striped</b> <b>hyena</b> fossils {{are common in}} Africa, with records going {{back as far as}} the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the Mediterranean region, {{it is likely that the}} species is a {{relatively}} late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of spotted hyenas in Asia at the end of the Ice Age. The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> occurred for some time in Europe during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in France and Germany. It also occurred in Montmaurin, Hollabrunn in Austria, the Furninha Cave in Portugal and the Genista Caves in Gibraltar. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the brown hyena (Hyaena brunnea).|$|E
25|$|The {{carnivores}} group mainly {{comprises the}} Asiatic lion, sloth bear, Indian leopard, Indian cobra, jungle cat, <b>striped</b> <b>hyena,</b> Golden jackal, Indian and Ruddy mongeese, and honey badger. Desert cats and rusty-spotted cats occur but are rarely seen.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, the History Channel aired a {{documentary}} called The Real Wolfman which {{argued that the}} beast was an exotic animal {{in the form of}} a <b>striped</b> <b>hyena,</b> a long-haired species of hyena now extinct in Europe.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{smallest}} of the true hyenas and retains many primitive viverrid characteristics lost in larger species, having a smaller and less specialised skull. Though primarily a scavenger, large specimens have been known to kill their own prey, and attacks on humans have occurred on rare instances. The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs. A nocturnal animal, the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> typically only emerges in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise. Although it has a habit of feigning death when attacked, it has been known to stand its ground against larger predators in disputes over food.|$|E
25|$|The {{species may}} have evolved from H. namaquensis of Pliocene Africa. <b>Striped</b> <b>hyena</b> fossils {{are common in}} Africa, with records going {{back as far as}} the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian.

25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> {{features}} {{prominently in}} Middle Eastern and Asian folklore. In some areas, its body parts are considered magical, {{and are used}} as charms or talismans. It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it {{is referred to as}} tzebua or zevoa, though the species is absent in some Bible translations into English.|$|E
25|$|The Zagros {{are home}} to many {{threatened}} or endangered organisms, including the Zagros Mountains mouse-like hamster (Calomyscus bailwardi), the Basra reed-warbler (Acrocephalus griseldis) and the <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> (Hyena hyena). The Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), an ancient domesticate once thought extinct, was rediscovered in the late 20th century in Khuzestan province in the southern Zagros.|$|E
25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> is monogamous, {{with the}} male helping the female to {{establish}} a den, raise young and feed her when cubs are born. The mating season varies according to location; in Transcaucasia, hyenas breed in January–February, while those in southeast Turkmenia breed in October–November. In captivity, breeding is non-seasonal. Mating can occur {{at any time of}} the day, during which the male grips the skin of the female's neck.|$|E
50|$|Barbary leopards (Panthera pardus panthera), <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), {{which were}} found {{once in the}} area, are extinct. The Barbary stag (Cervus elaphus barbarus) was extinct as well, but has been reintroduced recently.|$|R
50|$|The {{species on}} display include a common hippopotamus, lions, <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas,</b> California sea lions, zebras, scimitar horned oryx, a {{selection}} of bears, monkeys, Dromedary camels, Barbary sheep, black leopard, spotted hyena, golden jackal, Bactrian camel, and llama.|$|R
50|$|In {{the park}} there are houbara bustards, North African ostriches, barbary sheep, dorcas gazelles, oryxes and <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas.</b> There {{is also a}} large number of {{reptiles}} such as lizard, wyches, monitor lizards, chameleons, geckos and different varieties of snakes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> {{competes with}} the gray wolf in the Middle East and central Asia. In the latter area, a great {{portion of the}} hyena's diet stems from wolf-killed carcasses. The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> is {{dominant}} over the wolf on a one-to-one basis, though wolves in packs can displace single hyenas from carcasses. Both species {{have been known to}} share dens on occasion. On rare occasions, Striped Hyenas are also known to travel with and live amongst wolf packs, with each doing the other no harm. Both predators may benefit from this unusual alliance, as the hyenas have better senses of smell and greater strength, and the wolves may be better at tracking large prey. Red foxes may compete with striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh which is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} animals {{are found in}} the state are tigers, black panthers, leopards, gaur, sloth bears, sambar, four-horned antelope, blue bull, chital, barking deer, mouse deer, civet cats, jackals, jungle cats, <b>striped</b> <b>hyena,</b> and hare. Other animals in the state include {{reptiles}} such as lizards, cobras and kraits. The national parks of Maharashtra possess a variety of plant species that include jamun, palas, shisam, neem, teak, dhawada, kalam, ain, bija, shirish, mango, acacia, awala, kadamba, moha, terminalia, hedu and ficus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena hyaena) is {{a species}} of hyena native to North and East Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, as the global {{population}} {{is estimated to be}} under 10,000 mature individuals which continues to experience deliberate and incidental persecution along with a decrease in its prey base such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations.|$|E
50|$|The North African boar (Sus scrofa algira) is {{a smaller}} {{subspecies}} of wild boar native to North Africa including Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It is a prey animal for predators such as <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas,</b> Barbary leopards and Barbary lions.|$|R
50|$|Other predators such as African leopards, East African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas also {{threaten}} the cheetahs. Spotted and <b>striped</b> <b>hyenas</b> frequently scavenges from the cheetah kills, and the cheetahs would surrender their meals to the incoming hyenas without a fight.|$|R
