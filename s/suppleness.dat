5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural <b>suppleness</b> and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is {{dedicated}} to Yoga, as a discussion between Ribhu and his student Nidagha. There are three types of Yoga, states the text, and these are Laya (soft), Mantra (mystic), and Hatha (middle), recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three. It discusses various aspects of Yoga, ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities, in small portions, several times a day, to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry. The goal of Yoga, states Varaha, is manifold, including the gain of body strength and <b>suppleness,</b> acquisition of knowledge of one's own body and its auras, meditation, and Self (soul) knowledge.|$|E

25|$|The flipper was the {{signature}} delivery of Anil Kumble of India and the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne in his earlier years, until injury and later shoulder surgery restricted {{his ability to}} bowl flippers accurately. Like the googly, it may become more difficult to bowl as a bowler ages due to the flexibility and <b>suppleness</b> it demands from the bowler's wrist.|$|E
25|$|Descending any {{significant}} gradient {{is more difficult}} as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases <b>suppleness</b> or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.|$|E
25|$|While on {{tour in the}} United States in 1987, Plisetskaya gave master {{classes at}} the David Howard Dance Center. A review in New York {{magazine}} noted that although she was 61 when giving the classes, “she displayed the <b>suppleness</b> and power of a performer in her physical prime.” In October that year she performed with Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov for the opening night {{of the season with}} the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.|$|E
25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural <b>suppleness</b> and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the <b>suppleness</b> and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E
25|$|This {{apparatus}} {{may be made}} of hemp or {{a synthetic}} material which retains the qualities of lightness and <b>suppleness.</b> Its length is {{in proportion to the}} size of the gymnast. The rope should, when held down by the feet, reach both of the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an anti-slip material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of 10cm (3.94in). The rope must be coloured, either all or partially and may either be of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. In 2011, the FIG decided to nullify the use of rope in rhythmic gymnastic competitions.|$|E

500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of the}} 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still {{breaking}} new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw {{it for the first}} time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as [...] "an awkwardly updated production", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the [...] "melodic <b>suppleness</b> and warmth" [...] of Bizet's score.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Blue Lotus showed {{evidence}} of Hergé's [...] "left-wing counter-tendency" [...] that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview. He {{believed that this}} was {{partly due to the}} influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Hergé's [...] "European absolutism", and overall thought of it as [...] "the most visually rich of all the Tintin books". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi– who was poisoned with Raijaijah– inverted [...] "the model of justice ruling the world of the Good". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have [...] "feline <b>suppleness,</b> a devotion to good causes, and the patience of an animal stalking its prey". He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his Oedipus complex and was a substitute for castration.|$|E
500|$|The first shoe {{polish to}} {{resemble}} the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, Kiwi and Wren's. An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was Kiwi. Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making [...] "boot polish" [...] in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored color. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added <b>suppleness</b> and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. Black {{and a range of}} colors became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "street-smart R" [...] track [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] was {{described}} by Patoski as being [...] "state-of-the-art pop". Lyrically, [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] speaks of mourning an absent lover and reminiscing of rhapsodic events that she once shared with him. Jerry Johnston of the Deseret News said that Selena displayed a [...] " [...] baby-voice" [...] in [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] and that she [...] "displays a wonderful <b>suppleness</b> in her voice". The Virginian-Pilot said that the song was built on hooks that recall Diana Ross's [...] "Missing You", which {{is a tribute to}} Marvin Gaye, and the Beach Boys' [...] "Good to My Baby". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said that [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] and other tracks were added to Entre a Mi Mundo [...] "for good measure". Guerra found the music in [...] "Amame" [...] to contain [...] "fiery club rhythms", while its lyrics call on the singer's crush, asking him to love her. In the polka [...] "Vuelve a Mi", the singer recalls the day that her lover abandoned her on a rainy day, and pleads that he returns to her.|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological <b>suppleness</b> which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..."

2500|$|The {{other work}} for which Bouré is most noted shows a strikingly {{different}} {{side of the}} artist. The white marble Le lézard or L'enfant au lezard, not quite 4 feet long and about 2 feet high (overall 61.5 by 118.5 by 39cm), depicts a nude boy lying on his stomach, ankles crossed, resting on his left elbow {{with his right hand}} cocked inquisitively as he directs his absorbed gaze down at a small lizard. Bouré created this délicieux morceau during the period 1872–1874. It was praised for its fine modeling and lifelike expression, its charm and grace of attitude, and the [...] "rare <b>suppleness</b> of its lines." [...] Le lézard was not uniformly admired. One critic noted its [...] "poverty of imagination" [...] and thinness of execution, while admitting other qualities.|$|E
2500|$|Confessing to be a [...] "complete Anglomaniac", Davidman {{returned}} to England with her sons in November 1953. Cynthia Haven speculates that {{the activities of}} HUAC {{might have been a}} factor in her decision to emigrate and not return, given her political affiliations in the past. Davidman found a flat in London and enrolled David and Douglas at Dane Court Preparatory School, but she soon ran into financial difficulties when Gresham quit sending money for support. Lewis paid the school fees and found Davidman and her sons a house in Oxford close to The Kilns. Lewis originally regarded her only as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend. Warren Lewis wrote: [...] "For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual.

[...] In addition to textures and structures being created for the costumes, digital screen-printing was utilized for some pieces. [...] The costumes for the Russian swing act were inspired by volcanic eruptions.

2500|$|Wilson, Keppel and Betty {{formed a}} popular British music hall and {{vaudeville}} {{act in the}} middle decades of the 20th century. They capitalised on the fashion for Ancient Egyptian imagery following {{the discovery of the}} tomb of Tutankhamun. The [...] "sand dance" [...] that formed the highlight of their act was a parody of postures from Egyptian tomb paintings, combined with references to Arabic costume. The lithe and extremely lanky Wilson and Keppel, who wore long moustaches and make-up to emphasise the sharp angularity of their features and make them appear almost identical, demonstrated their impressive <b>suppleness</b> in adopting wild gestures and dancing in identical [...] "stereo" [...] movements, while Betty watched their antics. The dance itself was a soft-shoe routine performed on a layer of sand spread on the stage to create a rhythmic scratching with their shuffling feet.

2500|$|The Court {{determined}} that a fair and reasonable wage was to be determined according {{to the needs of}} a male worker not according to the worker's value to the employer. [...] What then was a fair and reasonable wage for a female worker? Higgins J considered this in 1912 in the Fruit pickers case, rejecting an application for equal pay for women, deciding that this would represent equal pay for unequal work. His Honour held that women should only be awarded the full male rate where there was the risk of cheap female labour displacing men, setting a common rate for fruit pickers of 1 shilling per hour. The work of packing at the factory was [...] "essentially adapted for women with their superior deftness and the <b>suppleness</b> of fingers" [...] and this apparently justified a lower minimum wage of 9 pence per hour, which would provide for the woman’s food, shelter and clothing but not that of her family. Until World War II, the female basic wage was, generally speaking, approximately 54 per cent of the male basic wage. The assumptions of a male bread winner and female domestic carer have been criticised as a deliberate policy of discouraging women in the paid workforce, reflecting a flawed understanding of work and care where the normative worker of the labour market is without responsibilities to care for others. It thus ensured the continuance of the women's inferior place in the paid work force, only entitled to equal wages if their work threatened the position of men.|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell has {{received}} consistent positive praise throughout her career. About her New York City recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1987 noted music critic Will Crutchfield wrote, [...] "The voice is first rate: a small, clean high soprano that goes from high {{to low and}} loud to soft with rare unity and poise. It is beautiful in quality and she has the special ability to take {{it down to the}} very tiniest pianissimo with complete control. Her linguistic grasp was secure, and her intonation likewise... Miss Blackwell's personality on the stage is warm and likable, and in one of Roland Hayes's spiritual arrangements she showed an unexpected comic gift." [...] In 1994, the New York Times said, [...] "Her performances at the Met since her 1987 debut as Pousette in [...] "Manon" [...] have won consistent praise, both for the purity and <b>suppleness</b> of her voice and for her poised, persuasive acting." [...] A 2000 article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in review of her performance of the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor said, [...] "Vocally and dramatically, this is a role that is perfectly suited to Blackwell; the voice is the right size, the right timbre and has the right flexibility for this coloratura challenge. Agile and clear, her soprano soars and floats like an eagle on an updraft. The two big E-flats in the Mad Scene were right on target." [...] In 2001 Opera News said, [...] "Harolyn Blackwell sang beautifully, with crisp, unfussy diction... She sang with a satisfying lyricism, and her [...] "Summertime" [...] was mesmerizing."

2500|$|The {{return of}} the troupe to Paris at the {{beginning}} of September, coincided with the publication in the NRF of Copeau's Un essai de rénovation Dramatique: le théâtre du Vieux-Colombier ("Essay on Dramatic Renewal: The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier"), in which he set forth the principles of this project: first, the choice of place far from the despised Right Bank boulevard in a district closer to schools and the center of artistic life where the new theatre might attract an audience of students, intellectuals and artists with a subscription system that would assure reasonable prices; [...] second, a variety of productionsas many as three different productions a week, which would not only appeal to a wider public, but also would offer the actors the opportunity to play several different sorts of roles in quick succession, maintaining the <b>suppleness</b> of their interpretive skills; third, a repertoire both classic and modern would mark the offerings of the company: the classic plays of Jean Racine and Molièrenever put in modern dress [...] to keep them à la modeand the best plays of the previous thirty years. Too, Copeau wanted to entice into the theatre new playwrights, perhaps those who had despaired that the theatre would ever present works of quality. Fourth, he particularly held in disdain ham acting or cabotinage, so common in the commercial theatre. He proposed eventually a school for young actors {{in order to create a}} new cohort of actors whose taste and instincts would remain above compromise. Lastly, he proposed a simple stage freed from the overworked scenic machinery that had become commonplace: [...] "Pour l'œuvre nouvelle, qu'on nous laisse un plateau nu" [...] ("For our new undertaking, just give us a bare platform"), he wrote (Registres I, p.32).|$|E
