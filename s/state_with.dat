40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the U. S. federally implemented Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) on states’ solar energy installation and utilization. In particular, I compare relative trends in solar installation and utilization between <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially higher levels of solar and <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially lower levels of solar, before and after the implementation of the Solar ITC. My findings demonstrate that <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially higher levels of solar prior to 2006 — the year the Solar ITC took effect — experienced rapid, significant growth in solar installation and utilization relative to <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially lower levels of solar, on average. These results suggest that the Solar ITC had a larger effect on solar installation and utilization in <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially higher levels of solar compared to <b>states</b> <b>with</b> initially lower levels of solar, on average...|$|R
50|$|Immigrant {{population}} density and states’ immigrant Medicaid eligibility rules interactively shape the native-foreign born Medicaid coverage gap. <b>States</b> <b>with</b> lower immigrant populations have negative and significant marginal {{effects on the}} native-foreign inequality in Medicaid coverage. Additionally, immigrant eligibility is conditional on the annual changes of states’ immigrant {{population density}}; where <b>states</b> <b>with</b> decreases in foreign-born population densities have negative effects on eligibility. Immigration brings <b>states</b> <b>with</b> exclusive Medicaid policies and a small immigrant population increases in the participation gap between native and foreign populations. In <b>states</b> <b>with</b> inclusive Medicaid policies and small immigrant population, immigration {{does not affect the}} participation gap. In <b>states</b> <b>with</b> a large immigrant population, immigration decreases social inequality regardless of the Medicaid policy.|$|R
