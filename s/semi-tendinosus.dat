40|$|AbstractHarvesting of the {{gracilis}} and <b>semi-tendinosus</b> (ST) hamstring tendons {{is usually}} performed by anteromedial approach. Harvesting by a horizontal posterior approach is possible. Based {{on a series}} of 90 patients, this technical note describes the perioperative difficulties and the characteristics of the harvested tendon(s) as well as any complications. Only one unsuccessful harvest was reported. Posterior harvesting of the gracilis and ST hamstring tendons is a reliable, reproducible surgical technique with a low rate of complications...|$|E
40|$|Chronic patellar tendon {{ruptures}} are rare. Diagnosis {{is usually}} made on clinical background. The ideal {{method of treatment}} {{is a matter of}} debate. The management of neglected, chronic patellar tendon must address four difficulties: The proximally retracted patella, reconstruction of the patellar tendon, temporary protection of repair, patello-femoral tracking, and active full range of knee movement. By presenting a case of chronic patellar tendon rupture, the advantages of reconstruction with a free <b>semi-tendinosus</b> and gracilis autograft from an early rehabilitation are described...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} and compared the lipid oxidation of charque, taken from, the <b>semi-tendinosus</b> muscle of animals from the Nelore breed (Bos taurus indicus), supplemented with &# 945;-tocopherol. Charque was produced submitting the samples to salt moisture, salt drying and exposition {{to the sun}} for dehydration until water activity values (Aw) reached 0. 75. The statistical analysis of {{the results showed that}} {{there were no significant differences}} in the values of cholesterol, total lipids, fatty acids and substances relative to tiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and tocopherol as the samples were controlled and supplemented, respectively. Despite this, the values of TBARS and cholesterol were lower in the samples with the supplement of &# 945;-tocopherol. The supplementation, at the levels used showed no significant result in the addition of &# 945;-tocopherol in the feeding of animals destined for the processing of charque...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundArthroscopic {{treatment}} of tears {{in the middle}} and posterior parts of the medial meniscus can be difficult when the medial tibiofemoral compartment is tight. Passage of the instruments may damage the cartilage. The primary objective of this cadaver study was to perform an arthroscopic evaluation of medial tibiofemoral compartment opening after pie-crusting release (PCR) of the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) at its distal insertion on the tibia. The secondary objective was to describe the anatomic relationships at the site of PCR (saphenous nerve, medial saphenous vein). Material and methodWe studied 10  cadaver knees with no history of invasive procedures. The femur was held in a vise with the knee flexed at 45 °, and the medial aspect of the knee was dissected. PCR of the sMCL was performed under arthroscopic vision, in the anteroposterior direction, at the distal tibial insertion of the sMCL, along the lower edge of the tibial insertion of the <b>semi-tendinosus</b> tendon. Continuous 300 -N valgus stress was applied to the ankle. Opening of the medial tibiofemoral compartment was measured arthroscopically using graduated palpation hooks after sequential PCR of the sMCL. ResultsThe compartment opened by 1 mm after release of the anterior third, 2. 3 mm after release of the anterior two-thirds, and 3. 9 mm after subtotal release. A femoral fracture occurred in 1  case, after completion of all measurements. Both the saphenous nerve and the medial saphenous vein were located at a distance from the PCR site in all 10  knees. DiscussionPCR of the sMCL is chiefly described as a ligament-balancing method during total knee arthroplasty. This procedure is usually performed at the joint line, where it opens the compartment by 4 – 6 mm at the most, with some degree of unpredictability. PCR of the sMCL at its distal tibial insertion provides gradual opening of the compartment, to a maximum value similar to that obtained with PCR at the joint space. The lower edge of the <b>semi-tendinosus</b> tendon is a valuable landmark for PCR of the distal sMCL...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{increased}} popularity {{of using the}} <b>semi-tendinosus</b> and gracilis tendons for ACL reconstruction, donor site morbidity has become of paramount concern after tendon harvest. Morbidity has been largely {{discussed in terms of}} isokinetic knee flexion strength. Although several studies have reported a significant decrease in the isokinetic knee flexion strength, 4, 21 most of the studies have demonstrated no significant decrease postopera-tively. 14, 18, 19, 23, 36 However, it is extremely difficult to isolate the strength of the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles by measuring the total isokinetic strength during knee flexion. 35 Recently, several studies ¶ have reported that semitendi-nosus and gracilis tendon regeneration has been observed after harvest for ACL reconstruction. Using MRI, Cross et al 6 originally reported the regeneration of the semitendi-nosus and gracilis tendons after harvest. Simonian et al 31 reported that 6 of 9 semitendinosus tendons and all 9 gra-cilis tendons were similarly regenerated. Eriksson et al...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The project {{aimed to}} {{implement}} neuromuscular training during a full soccer and handball league season and to experimentally analyze the neuromuscular adaptation mechanisms elicited by this training during a standardized sidecutting maneuver {{known to be}} associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Design: The players were tested before and after 1 season without implementation of the prophylactic training and subsequently before and after a full season with the implementation of prophylactic training. Participants: A total of 12 female elite soccer players and 8 female elite team handball players aged 266 3 years {{at the start of the}} study. Intervention: The subjects participated in a specific neuromuscular training program previously shown to reduce non-contact ACL injury. Methods: Neuromuscular activity at the knee joint, joint angles at the hip and knee, and ground reaction forces were recorded during a sidecutting maneuver. Neuromuscular activity in the prelanding phase was obtained 10 and 50 ms before foot strike on a force plate and at 10 and 50 ms after foot strike on a force plate. Results: Neuromuscular training markedly increased prelanding activity and landing activity electromyography (EMG) of the <b>semi-tendinosus</b> (P, 0. 05), while quadriceps EMG activity remained unchanged. Conclusions: Neuromuscular training increased EMG activity for the medial hamstring muscles, thereby decreasing the risk of dynamic valgus. This observed neuromuscular adaptation during sidecutting could potentially reduce the risk for non-contact ACL injury...|$|E
40|$|Knee flexion contractures occur {{frequently}} in non-ambulatory, aged persons and persons with {{central nervous system}} lesions, rendering positioning and nursing care difficult. There are often risks associated with surgical interventions. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} percutaneous needle tenotomy to lengthen the knee flexor muscles and improve passive function. This was a retrospective study of all patients who underwent percutaneous needle tenotomy between 2012 and 2014. Tenotomy was carried out in the <b>semi-tendinosus,</b> biceps femoris and gracillis muscles under local anesthesia. The procedure took no more than 40 minutes. Range of motion (ROM) was evaluated immediately post-operatively and 3 months later. Thirty-four needle tenotomies were carried out. Mean lack of knee extension was 94. 2 ° (range 35 - 120 °) pre-op, (range 15 - 90 °; p< 0. 05) immediately post-op and 50. 1 ° (range 10 - 90 °; p< 0. 05) three months later, thus a mean increase of 44. 1 ° knee extension (range 0 - 90 °). All care and positioning objectives were achieved. There were no complications and procedure-related pain was rated as 3 - 4 / 10. Needle tenotomy was well tolerated and yielded a significant increase in ROM with no unwanted effects. All objectives were achieved. This technique could be used in an ambulatory care setting or within institutions for severely disabled individuals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of closed kinetic chain {{exercises}} (CK-CEs) and open kinetic chain exercises (OKCEs) with elastic bands on the electromyographic activity of patients with degenerative gonarthritis. [Subjects] The study subjects were 30 degenerative gonarthritis patients who were divided into a CKCE group (CKCEG, n= 10), an OKCE group (OKCEG, n= 10), and a control group (CG, n= 10). [Methods] The CKCEG and the OKCEG performed exercises with elastic bands, and the CG took part in a quad-riceps strengthening exercise. All three groups performed the exercises three times per week for four weeks. The electromyographic activities of the subjects ’ vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), <b>semi-tendinosus</b> (ST), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were measured and compared. [Results] Within-group compari-sons revealed that the electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, VL, ST, and BF muscles increased significantly in the CKCEG. The OKCEG displayed significant increases in the electromyographic activity of the VM, RF, ST, and BF muscles, and the CG showed significant increases in the electromyographic activities of the RF, VL, ST, and BF muscles. In between-group comparisons after the intervention, the electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, and VL muscles of the CKCEG were significantly higher than those of the CG. The electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, and ST muscles of the OKCEG were significantly higher than those of the CG. [Conclusion] We con-sider CKCEs with elastic bands are an effective intervention for increasing the electromyographic activities of th...|$|E
40|$|Troponin I was {{isolated}} from six red {{muscles in the}} hind leg of the rabbit. Soleus, <b>semi-tendinosus,</b> vastus intermedius and adductor longus muscles contained primarily slow-muscle troponin I, vastus lateralis contained fast-muscle troponin I and quadratus femoris contained a mixture of the two. The complete amino acid sequence of the troponin I from slow muscle was determined. Seven CNBr fragments were isolated and sequenced by using the dansyl–Edman technique after digestion with proteolytic enzymes. The CNBr fragments were ordered by isolation of tryptic peptides containing carboxy[14 C]methyl-methionine. Direct evidence for the conjunction of residues 8 and 9 has not been obtained, {{and one of the}} carboxyl groups between residues 71 and 79 may carry an amide group. Slow-muscle troponin I is a single polypeptide chain of 184 residues with a mol. wt. of 21146. It has a net overall positive charge of 18 at pH 7, and an absorption coefficient, A 1 %, 1 cm 280, of 5. 43. The protein {{was isolated}} with both a blocked and an unblocked N-terminus, although the nature of the blocking group was not determined. Proline was found to be the N-terminal amino acid. Two forms of the protein could also be distinguished by the presence of an extra two residues at the C-terminus. Comparison of sequences of troponin I from rabbit slow, fast and cardiac muscle shows that homology is most marked in the C-terminal half of the molecules. Towards the N-terminus the homology becomes much less marked. Detailed evidence on which the sequence is based has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50079 (32 pages) at the British Library (Lending Division), Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS 23 7 BQ, U.

O processamento do charque acelera as reações oxidativas. Com o intuito de diminuir as conseqüências dessas reações indesejáveis, lançase mão do uso de antioxidantes, principalmente os naturais, que são mais bem aceitos pela população consumidora. O presente trabalho avaliou e comparou a oxidação lipídica do charque, obtido a partir de ponta de agulha de bovinos da raça Nelore, suplementados com 1000 mg/dia/cabeça de &# 945;-tocoferol e sem a suplementação. A análise estatística dos resultados mostrou que não houve diferença significativa nos valores de colesterol (168, 4 e 160, 9), lipídios totais (8, 4 e 8, 5), TBARS (1, 4 e 1, 3) e &# 945;-tocoferol para as amostras controle e suplementadas, respectivamente.

40|$|Muscle {{growth and}} {{development}} was studied in 49 Large White pigs from a total of 17 litters. Representative large (mean birthweight of 1544 g), small (1144 g) and runt (776 g) littermates were selected and slaughtered at the same age, ages ranging from birth to 128 days. Fresh frozen, serial transverse sections taken from the <b>semi-tendinosus</b> and trapezius muscles of these animals were stained for the histochemical demonstration of acid and alkaline pre-incubated adenosine triphosphatase, succinate dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase. Profiles of the muscle fibre types were compiled for each animal. In both muscles the number of slow oxidative (SO) fibres, that were arranged together in groups within 'metabolic bundles', increased with growth. The transverse sectional area (TSA) of the semitendinosus muscle increased with the 2 / 3 power of liveweight whereas the area occupied by SO fibres increased at a rate significantly greater than 1. 0 (P less than 0. 01). Regression analysis revealed that the area of this muscle occupied by SO fibres was greater (P less than 0. 001) in runt and small littermates relative to their large littermates when they were compared at an equal liveweight. This greater TSA of the semitendinosus classified as 'SO' in lower birthweight pigs {{was the result of}} a combination of higher percentages (P less than 0. 05) of SO fibres and significantly greater (P less than 0. 001) SO fibre mean TSAs. The mean TSAs of all myofibre types were similar between littermates of the same age but most types were of greater TSA in the lower birthweight littermates when compared (by regression analysis) at the same liveweight suggesting that fibre TSA was age- rather than weight-related. The higher percentage of SO fibres in the low birthweight pigs, when compared at an equivalent liveweight to their large littermates, appeared to be related to their affected secondary/primary fibre number ratio. This phenomenon, plus the data on the number of slow fibres per metabolic bundle, indicated that it was apparently the number of slow fibres per metabolic bundle which was regulated with liveweight gain rather than the resultant percentage of slow fibres within the muscle...|$|E
