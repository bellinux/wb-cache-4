5|$|The band {{supported}} Lions {{with two}} North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), {{and a short}} tour of Europe and Japan in between. <b>Soundboard</b> recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be <b>soundboard</b> recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a <b>soundboard</b> recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg <b>soundboard</b> recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
50|$|Since the mid-1990s, the Australian company Maton {{has used}} bunya for the <b>soundboards</b> of its BG808CL Performer {{acoustic}} guitars. The Cole Clark company (also Australian) uses bunya {{for the majority}} of its acoustic guitar <b>soundboards.</b> The timber is valued by cabinet makers and woodworkers, and has been used for that purpose for over a century.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, the fangxiang was {{expanded}} to include 51 <b>soundboards.</b> The <b>soundboards</b> were arranged based on twelve-tone equal temperament and double scale arrangement. On the top lane, it is the C# scale, and on the bottom lane it is the C major scale ranging from f to C4. The shelf used for holding those <b>soundboards</b> can rise up and fall down {{for the convenience of}} performing. The new design of the fangxiang sounds clear and melodious, and it is really good for accompaniments in the Chinese traditional orchestra music. For example, in the music [...] "The Great Wall Cappricio", it is used to sound like a bell.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992 J W Walker & Sons {{refurbished}} <b>soundboards</b> of Great Organ reeds and mixtures.|$|R
25|$|Lutes {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The <b>soundboard</b> is a {{teardrop-shaped}} thin flat plate of resonant wood (typically spruce). In all lutes the <b>soundboard</b> has a single (sometimes triple) decorated sound hole under the strings called the rose. The sound hole is not open, but rather covered with a grille {{in the form of}} an intertwining vine or a decorative knot, carved directly out of the wood of the <b>soundboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Strings run between {{mechanical}} tuning machines {{at the top}} of the neck to a tailpiece that anchors the other end of the strings. The strings are suspended over the neck and <b>soundboard</b> and pass over a floating bridge. The bridge is kept in contact with the <b>soundboard</b> by the downward pressure from the strings. The neck is either flat or has a slight radius, and is covered with a fingerboard with frets. The action of the strings on the bridge causes the <b>soundboard</b> to vibrate, producing sound.|$|E
25|$|After {{joining the}} top to the sides, a {{half-binding}} is usually installed {{around the edge of}} the <b>soundboard.</b> The half-binding is approximately half the thickness of the <b>soundboard</b> and is usually made of a contrasting color wood. The rebate for the half-binding must be extremely precise to avoid compromising structural integrity.|$|E
50|$|Its light weight, {{strength}} and dark warm sound {{make it a}} popular choice for guitar <b>soundboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Three {{models were}} {{produced}} between 1977 and about 1980. All were true acoustic pianos with <b>soundboards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... for Luthier applications, to bind wood fibres {{down and}} prevent tear {{out on the}} soft spruce <b>soundboards.</b>|$|R
25|$|The urshnaim may {{refer to}} the wooden toggle to which a string was {{fastened}} once it had emerged from its hole in the <b>soundboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the <b>soundboard</b> of the {{hurdy-gurdy}} and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is striken, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the <b>soundboard,</b> producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s English luthier Stefan Sobell {{developed}} a large-bodied, flat-backed mandolin with a carved <b>soundboard,</b> {{based on his}} own cittern design; this is often called a 'Celtic' mandolin.|$|E
5000|$|... 1958 J W Walker & Sons Ltd, London {{cleaned the}} organ and {{provided}} new <b>soundboards</b> to the pedal.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{superior}} sonic properties, {{the wood}} {{is used for}} the <b>soundboards</b> of several Chinese instruments, including the guqin and guzheng.|$|R

25|$|Originally, stage {{lights were}} {{housed in the}} ceiling but proved {{difficult}} to adjust, and today's lighting system was added later. Texas Instruments donated the first digital <b>soundboard</b> {{to be used in}} a theater.|$|E
25|$|For many years, live {{recordings}} {{of these two}} shows only circulated {{in the form of}} bootlegs, and even then only certain audience recordings were available to fans and collectors (for example, Burn Like a Candle). Though several <b>soundboard</b> {{recordings of}} Led Zeppelin concerts were circulated amongst fans after having been stolen from Page's personal archive some time in the mid-1980s, no soundboards of the 1972 Long Beach or LA Forum shows were taken, meaning the release of How the West Was Won was the first chance fans had of hearing the <b>soundboard</b> versions of these concerts.|$|E
25|$|Like the bowlback, the {{flatback}} has a round sound hole. This {{has been}} sometimes modified to an elongated hole, called a D-hole. The body has a rounded almond shape with flat or sometimes canted <b>soundboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, it is {{considered}} more than acceptable for use in stringed instruments. Its fine grain, good strength and tonal quality are highly regarded for <b>soundboards</b> in guitar making.|$|R
50|$|The organ was {{restored}} in 1965-66, when J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London overhauled the <b>soundboards,</b> installed a new console with electropneumatic action, {{and lowered the}} pitch.|$|R
50|$|The site {{features}} individual celebrity <b>soundboards,</b> where {{users can}} click buttons to hear quotes or phrases spoken by that celebrity. By pressing certain buttons {{in an organized}} order, users can simulate the celebrities saying unusual things.|$|R
25|$|A clavicytherium is a {{harpsichord}} {{with the}} <b>soundboard</b> and strings mounted vertically facing the player, the same space-saving principle as an upright piano. In a clavicytherium, the jacks move horizontally without {{the assistance of}} gravity, so that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those of other harpsichords.|$|E
25|$|Since Empress Valley is {{the only}} {{supplier}} of new <b>soundboard</b> material for the moment, its issues are being cloned after initial release by numerous minor labels, sometimes with alternative titles. As noted above, however, Empress Valley has done its own share of repackaging already existent tapes.|$|E
25|$|The back or {{the shell}} is {{assembled}} from thin strips of hardwood (maple, cherry, ebony, rosewood, gran, wood and/or other tonewoods) called ribs, joined (with glue) {{edge to edge}} to form a deep rounded body for the instrument. There are braces inside on the <b>soundboard</b> to give it strength.|$|E
5000|$|Ervin V. Somogyi (born 1944) is a {{maker of}} {{high-end}} steel string guitars. He {{is known for his}} craftsmanship, and places particular emphasis on the voicing of his instruments' <b>soundboards.</b> [...] He is also an influential teacher.|$|R
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck was {{featured}} prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money. Cramer exited the Wreck's passenger door {{to start the}} show and one of Cramer's trademark <b>soundboards</b> {{was attached to the}} front bumper.|$|R
50|$|Two {{instruments}} by Ioes Karest have survived; {{both are}} polygonal virginals. Both have sides of thin maple or sycamore, inset keyboards, and <b>soundboards</b> of spruce or fir. They both also feature applied moldings that outline {{the case at}} top and bottom.|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s, bootleg labels such as Smilin' Ear, Kornyfone, Dragonfly, Trade Mark of Quality, Condor and Toasted {{released}} unofficial {{recordings of}} several Led Zeppelin shows on vinyl. The following table includes {{a sample of}} these recordings. Most of them derived from audience tapes, though a few (such as Destroyer) were sourced from <b>soundboard</b> recordings.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the early}} 1900s, mandolinist Ginislao Paris {{approached}} Luigi Embergher to build custom mandolins. The sticker {{inside one of the}} four surviving instruments indicates the build was called after him, the Sistema Ginislao Paris). Paris' round-back double-top mandolins use a false back below the <b>soundboard</b> to create a second hollow space within the instrument.|$|E
25|$|On the Portuguese guitar {{the strings}} are picked with {{the corner of}} the fingernails, {{avoiding}} contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the <b>soundboard.</b> Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks were traditionally made of tortoiseshell, but today are usually nylon or plastic.|$|E
5000|$|... "Max Rebo Band Jams". Heard {{twice in}} the film, once after Jabba sends the Wookiee Chewbacca to jail, and again on Jabba's Sail Barge (hence its title). A {{recording}} of the first {{can be found on}} the official Star Wars <b>Soundboards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cristofori used cypress, {{the wood}} {{traditionally}} favored for <b>soundboards</b> in the Italian school of harpsichord making. Piano making after Cristofori's time ultimately settled consistently on spruce {{as the best}} material for soundboards; however, Denzil Wraight has noted some compensating advantages for cypress.|$|R
5000|$|As a rough {{generalization}} {{it can be}} {{said that}} stiff-but-light softwoods are favored for the <b>soundboards</b> or soundboard-like surface that transmits the vibrations of the strings to the ambient air. Hardwoods are favored for the body or framing element of an instrument.|$|R
