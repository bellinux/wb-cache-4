40|$|The use of {{conventional}} <b>service</b> <b>handbooks</b> is still common among service technicians during on-site support. If problems occur during the service process, service technicians have {{to analyze the}} situation and react accordingly. Problem analysis is subject to uncertainty in time, because the optimal course of action strongly depends on the current situation. Therefore, intelligent situation adapted support is needed to replace static guidance. The present article describes a concept for the generation of interactive and situation adapted service instructions that are dynamically derived from a service process model. The concept includes an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based approach for human-machine interaction to support on-site service activities...|$|E

When The Link and the Anglo-German Review were included among a number of peace organisations across the political spectrum in the Peace Service Handbook(a publication put out by the Peace Pledge Union) the Daily Telegraph and The News Chronicle published articles accusing the PPU of supporting Nazism. In response, PPU member Stuart Morris wrote to the papers stating there was no connection between the PPU and The Link, and that the former organisation did not support the German demand for colonies or peace at the expense of smaller nations. The PPU also sent a letter to its group leaders dissociating The Link from the PPU, and ceased publishing the Peace <b>Service</b> <b>Handbook.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{products}} are growing more complex, so is their documentation.

This also holds for large-scale medical devices like Magnetic Resonance (MR) Tomographs. Siemens Medical Solutions has thus decided against one common on-line <b>service</b> <b>handbook</b> for all its MR Tomographs. Instead, they fragment the on-line documentation into small packages, out of which a suitable subset is selected for each individual product instance. Selection of (so-called) help packages is controlled by XML terms encoding Boolean choice conditions. To assure that the set of available help packages is sufficient for all valid product instances, we developed a tool called HelpChecker that provides a transformation of XML terms to propositional logic formulae, and then employs BDD-based methods to ascertain completeness of the on-line documentation and to support authors in locating any gaps. Experiments with SAT-Solvers were also made. Keywords: real-world applications, problem encoding, BDD-techniques, SAT 1...|$|R

Each competency has its own competency criteria, scale and aim. As is the case worldwide this change management competency is bedevilled continuously by a complex set of connected internal and external change forces. It is the view of the author that a keen grasp and deep understanding of the paradigmatic view of change, conceptual and theoretical perspectives of change, change constructs, factors resisting and supporting change, change interventions as well as the role of change agents and change leadership will enhance the change management competency of South African senior public service managers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large-scale medical systems—like {{magnetic}} resonance tomographs— are manufactured with a steadily {{growing number of}} product options. Different model lines can be equipped {{with large numbers of}} supplementary equipment options like (gradient) coils, amplifiers, magnets or imaging devices. The diversity in service and maintenance procedures, which may be different for each of the many product instances, grows accordingly. Therefore, instead of having one common on-line <b>service</b> <b>handbook</b> for all medical devices, SIEMENS parcels out the on-line documentation into small (help) packages, out of which a suitable subset is selected for each individual product instance. Selection of packages is controlled by XML terms. To check whether the existing set of help packages is sufficient for all possible devices and service cases, we developed the HelpChecker tool. HelpChecker translates the XML input into Boolean logic formulae and employs both SAT- and BDD-based methods to check the consistency and completeness of the on-line documentation. To explain its reasoning and to facilitate error correction, it generates small (counter-) examples for cases where verification conditions are violated. We expect that a wide range of cross-checks between XML documents can be handled in a similar manner using our techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{the social and}} material relations of higher education coordinate and constrain the lives of undergraduates who are college students and parents. Drawing on the methodological strategies of institutional ethnography, I interrogate how the bureaucratic power structure of postsecondary institutions intersects with the experiences and obligations {{of students who are}} also parents. Through in-depth interviews with student-parents, I explore how institutional policies, procedures, and norms shape the strategies student-parents employ in negotiating school and parenting responsibilities. I have also conducted interviews with professional members of postsecondary institutions (e. g. faculty, administrative staff, institutional administrators), as well as document analyses of institutionally sanctioned texts (e. g. housing contracts, health <b>services</b> <b>handbooks,</b> examination procedures), to examine how institutional policies, procedures, and norms are formally communicated and enforced in the everyday lives of student-parents. The principal objectives of the dissertation research include bringing visibility to the strategies student-parents develop in their efforts to negotiate the competing demands of postsecondary schooling and parenting; enhancing social scientific understanding of an often marginalized and largely unrecognized population of college and university students; discovering how the social locations of race, class, and gender shape student-parent experience; and developing program and policy recommendations that address the unique needs of student-parents within institutions of higher education. ...|$|R

Understanding the types of knowledge and the distinguishing terms of the hierarchical building blocks for relationship enables conceptual clarity and concise application. The importance of knowledge sharing as a key process in knowledge activities is emphasised. Enabling and promoting communities in supporting knowledge interactions are vital. Knowledge management as a human-centric activity requires insights into the elements of intellectual capital. A human-centric process also requires the nurturing of the human values as an important enabler.

40|$|Since {{this edition}} of the JNCHC is {{dedicated}} to honors administration, it seems appropriate to offer a few introductory remarks about the usefulness of this study. College and university administrators participating in the accreditation process {{are well aware that}} assessing student learning is not the passing fad that some had suspected it might be. In the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, for example, administrators are familiar with Core Requirement 2. 1 —the institution engages in ongoing, integrated, and institution- wide planning and evaluation processes that incorporate systematic review of programs and <b>services</b> (<b>Handbook</b> for reaffirmation of accreditation, 2004). All accreditation bodies in higher education now require systematic assessment of student learning. Honors programs have been generally slow to adopt ongoing assessment strategies, and calls for intentional evaluation of honors education are not new. In a National Collegiate Honors Council monograph published in 1995, for example, Reilhman, Varhus and Whipple noted that “... the paucity of evaluations of honors programs is surprising” (p. 2). A decade earlier, Randall and Collier (1985) observed, “examples of efforts to evaluate the effect of honors programs on the college career... are extremely rare”(p. 2). A search of relevant literature today suggests that only marginal progress has been made toward providing substantive and scientifically gathered data about how student learning is enhanced as a result of participation in an honors program...|$|R
