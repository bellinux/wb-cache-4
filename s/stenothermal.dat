We tested the predictions that (a) rare warm-water events would produce fewer changes in eurythermal than <b>stenothermal</b> coral assemblages; and (b) after the disturbance, the <b>stenothermal</b> assemblages would more closely resemble the eurythermal ones. The 1998 event produced fewer changes in coral cover and community similarity among the assemblages in the reefs with high variation in temperature than in those with low variation in temperature. Despite the initially lower taxonomic richness in the eurythermal assemblage, there was an additional loss of taxonomic richness in the high and none in the <b>stenothermal</b> reefs. There was some evidence for taxonomic convergence, of the <b>stenothermal</b> towards the eurythermal reefs and a general loss of some of the branching taxa, such as branching Porites, Pavona, and Stylophora, and a relative increase in massive Porites and Favia. There was, however, moderate site specificity that did not produce true convergence.

30|$|The blue-green {{damselfish}} (Chromis viridis) is a <b>stenothermal</b> teleost that is abundant on coral reefs {{throughout much of}} the Indo-Pacific region (Allen [1991]; Lieske and Myers [1994]), including southern Taiwan (Shen et al. [1993]). Previous {{studies have shown that the}} average temperature in Nanwan Bay, Kenting National Park, southern Taiwan is 26 °C to 27 °C and increases to approximately 32 °C to 33 °C during the day (Meng et al. [2008]; Mayfield et al. [2013]). Accordingly, the normal and hyperthermic temperatures of 26 °C and 32 °C, respectively, were used in this study. The goal of this study was to investigate the stress responses, PQC mechanism, and osmoregulatory response in the gills of C. viridis exposed to an increase in ambient temperature (32 °C) for 12  h to ascertain the physiological strategies employed by <b>stenothermal</b> teleosts under short-term thermal stress.|$|E
30|$|Most organisms on Earth are ectotherms {{which have}} {{to survive and}} adapt to {{temperature}} fluctuations (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Guschina and Harwood [2006]; Somero [2010]). Temperature fundamentally affects all aspects of physiology by influencing the reactive rates {{as well as the}} physical properties of biological molecules (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Crockett and Londraville [2006]). For marine ectotherms including fish, environmental temperature has the pervasive effects on physiological and biochemical functions at all levels of biological organization, from molecule to organism (Jobling [1995]; Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Hofmann et al. [2002]; Donaldson et al. [2008]). According to the tolerance range of temperature, the fishes can be classified into two groups, eurythermal and <b>stenothermal</b> species. Eurythermal fish can maintain metabolic activity at temperatures as low as Antarctic fish can survive and withstand temperature as high as the avian and mammalian body temperature. In contrast, changes in environmental temperature may lead to the poor maintenance of physiological homeostasis in <b>stenothermal</b> species, resulting in temperature stress (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Somero [2010]; Long et al.

40|$|Polar marine {{invertebrates}} and fish grow slowly. At present {{there are three}} basic explanations for this slow growth: 1. a direct limitation by temperature, 2. rising costs of maintenance {{at the expense of}} a reduction in growth, 3. seasonal resource limitation. On the cellular level the rate-limiting effect of temperature on growth could be excluded for the cold <b>stenothermal</b> scallop Adamussium colbecki and for the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum. The protein synthesis, measured in vitro, was cold compensated in these species compared to related eurythermal species, the European scallop Aequipecten opercularis and the North Sea eelpout Zoarces viviparus. Within the temperature tolerance of P. brachycephalum the cold adapted protein synthesis apparatus could still be acclimated to various temperatures. Compensated protein synthesis capacities in Antarctic scallops and eelpout have been achieved by low activation energies and high RNA translation capacities and indicate the development of a cost efficient growth apparatus. Unlike Antarctic fish, Antarctic invertebrates exhibit higher RNA contents when compared to related species from warmer waters. These over compensated protein synthesis capacities due to high RNA contents seem specific for Antarctic invertebrates and support high growth efficiencies during the austral summer. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis rates suggests that actual in vivo rates remain far below capacity. Therefore the regulation must occur on a higher level. A sensible regulation factor could be the pHi. Differing energy budgets and trade-offs between lifestyle, exercise and growth performance of cold <b>stenothermal</b> and eurythermal animals are discussed. A basic requirement is that the energetic costs for the protein synthesis are the same as demonstrated for both scallop species. Despite even low maintenance costs, cold <b>stenothermal</b> animals exhibit slow annual growth rates suggesting seasonal resource limitation...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic marine ectotherms {{are often}} {{described}} as only being capable {{of living in a}} restricted temperature range, i. e. they are <b>stenothermal.</b> However, few data exist demonstrating that for a given group this is the case. The Antarctic bivalve molluscs Laternula elliptica and Limopsis marionensis are similar to other Antarctic invertebrates and can only exist within a temperature window of 6 – 12 °C. This is two to six times smaller than the range for temperate and tropical bivalves, thus demonstrating their <b>stenothermal</b> nature. The possibility of elevated metabolic rates of cold-water ectotherms has been a topic of debate over many years. Recently, the suggestion that metabolic rates must be elevated at low temperatures to overcome constraints has been supported by findings that mitochondrial contents of muscles in ectotherms are higher at low temperatures. Data, presented here for standard or routine metabolic rates of 41 species of bivalve mollusc from polar, temperate and tropical sites, indicate that oxygen consumption is not elevated at low temperatures. Indeed, analysis of Q 10 coefficients between 0 and 25 °C suggests that metabolic rates of polar species may be lower than would be expected by comparison with temperate bivalve...|$|E

Mb was isolated from yellowfin tuna (homeothermal warm), mackerel (eurythermal warm), and the Antarctic teleost Notothenia coriiceps (<b>stenothermal</b> cold). Zebrafish (<b>stenothermal</b> tropical) myoglobin was expressed from cloned cDNA. N. coriiceps Mb cDNA has also been cloned, expressed at 20 °C, and isolated from E. coli, but was not used {{in any of the}} functional and kinetic studies. These proteins differed in oxygen affinity, as measured by Oz dissociation rates and PS 0 values, and thermal stability as measured by autooxidation rates. Mackerel Mb had the highest Pso value at 25 OC (3. 7 mm Hg), corresponding to the lowest Oz affinity, followed by zebrafish (I. Omm Hg), yellowfin tuna (1. Omm Hg), and N coriiceps (0. 6 mm Hg). Oxygen dissociation rates and Arrhenius plots were similar between all teleost species in this study, with the exception of mackerel myoglobin, which was two fold faster at all temperatures tested.

40|$|Temperature {{requirements}} for growth, photosynthesis and dark respiration were determined for five Antarctic red algal species. After acclimation, the <b>stenothermal</b> species Gigartina skottsbergii and Ballia callitricha grew at 0 {{or up to}} 5 degrees C, respectively; the eurythermal species Kallymenia antarctica, Gymnogongrus antarcticus and Phyllophora ahnfeltioides grew up to 10 degrees C. The temperature optima of photosynthesis were between 10 and 15 degrees C in the <b>stenothermal</b> species and between 15 and 25 degrees C in the eurythermal species, irrespective of the growth temperature. This shows that the temperature optima for photosynthesis are located well below the optima from species of other biogeographical regions, even from the Arctic. Respiratory rates rose with increasing temperatures. In contrast to photosynthesis, no temperature optimum was evident between 0 and 25 degrees C. Partial acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to growth temperature was found in two species. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus acclimate to 0 degrees C, and 5 and 0 degrees C, respectively. But acclimation did in no case lead to an overall shift in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis. B. callitricha and Gymnogongrus antarcticus showed acclimation of respiration to 5 degrees C, and P. ahnfeltioides to 5 and 10 degrees C, resulting in a temperature independence of respiration when measured at growth temperature. With respect to the acclimation potential of the species, no distinction can be made between the <b>stenothermal</b> versus the eurythermal group. (Net) photosynthetic capacity:respiration (P:R) ratios showed in all species highest values at 0 degrees C and decreased continuously to values lower than 1. 0 at 25 degrees C. In turn, the low P:R ratios at higher temperatures are assumed to determine the upper temperature growth limit of the studied species. Estimated daily carbon balance reached values between 4. 1 and 30. 7 mg C g(- 1) FW day(- 1) at 0 degrees C, 16 : 8 h light/dark cycle, 12 - 40 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1) ...|$|E
30|$|Environmental {{temperature}} significantly influences internal electrolyte and osmotic homeostasis in aquatic ectotherms (Christensen [1975]; Amoudi et al. [1996]; Metz et al. [2003]; Sardella et al. [2004, 2008 a]). It is due {{to active}} ion-transporting mechanisms that are regulated by many proteins, while the cellular proteins of <b>stenothermal</b> species are only marginally stable at a limited range of temperature (Hochachka and Somero [2002]; Metz et al. [2003]; Crockett and Londraville [2006]; Sardella et al. [2008 a]). The fundamental transporter proteins responsible for osmoregulation in gill epithelia {{have been reported in}} previous studies (see Hirose et al. [2003]; Evans et al. [2005]; Hwang and Lee [2007]; Kaneko et al. [2008]; Hwang et al. [2011]). Among them, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is the most important enzyme that actively transports Na+ out of and K+ into animal cells for sustaining intracellular homeostasis as well as for providing the driving force for ion-transporting systems in fish gills (Hwang and Lee [2007]; Hwang et al. [2011]). Therefore, branchial NKA responses (mRNA and protein expression and specific activity) have been used to assess the osmoregulatory status/ability of teleosts (Epstein et al. [1967]; Hwang and Lee [2007]; Kaneko et al. [2008]). In this regard, it is worth examining the branchial NKA responses to investigate the impact of temperature stress on osmoregulatory responses in <b>stenothermal</b> teleosts and clarify whether the protein expression or specific activity of gill NKA is susceptible to temperature challenge.|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{dependent}} adjustments of intracellular pH {{are thought}} {{to play a major}} role in the maintenance of protein function. Comparative studies were carried out in two species from the same fish family (Zoarcidae), the <b>stenothermal</b> Antarctic eelpout (Pachycara brachycephalum) and the eurythermal eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) to find out whether pH regulation is modified by temperature in both closely related species and to what extent the respective pattern differs between eurytherms and stenotherms. Previous invasive studies had compared individual animals sampled at various temperatures thereby suggesting that a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) values occurs at rising temperatures as predicted by the alpha-stat hypothesis of acid-base regulation. The present study used non-invasive in vivo 31 P-NMR spectroscopy in non-anaesthetized, unrestrained fish for long term online recordings in individual specimens. Control spectra obtained at T= 0 °C for P. brachycephalum and at 12 °C for Z. viviparus indicated low stress conditions as well as a high stability of energy and acid-base status over time periods longer than 1 week. Temperature changes had no influence on the concentration of high-energy phosphates like phosphocreatine or ATP. Temperature induced pH changes were monitored continuously in a range between 0 and 6 °C for polar and 12 to 18 °C for temperate eelpout. A pHi change of around - 0. 015 pH units/°C was observed within both species in accordance with the alpha-stat hypothesis, however, extrapolation to the same temperature revealed different set points of pH regulation in the two species. These findings confirm that an alpha-stat pattern of pH regulation can be found in <b>stenothermal</b> Antarctic animals, however, at setpoints deviating from an alphastat pattern in a between species comparison...|$|E

Similarly, transient conditions remain to be studied because surface water/groundwater interactions can be modified during the fall low-flow period. Another field of research should be developed to predict the modification of these hydraulic exchanges in the framework of climate changes. Indeed, the thermal modifications that are induced by global warming could have harsh repercussions on the water demand of human populations. For example, nuclear power plants would require increasing amounts of <b>stenothermal</b> groundwater, and the groundwater demand for agriculture during summer periods would significantly increase.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies hailed thermal {{tolerance}} {{and the capacity}} for organisms to acclimate and adapt as the primary pathways for species survival under climate change. Here we challenge this theory. Over the past decade more than 365 tropical <b>stenothermal</b> fish species have been documented moving pole-ward, away from ocean warming hotspots where temperatures 2 - 3 °C above long-term annual means can compromise critical physiological processes. We examined the capacity of a model species - a thermally-sensitive coral reef fish, Chromis viridis (Pomacentridae) – to use preference behaviour to regulate its body temperature. Movement could potentially circumvent the physiological stress response associated with elevated temperatures and may be a strategy relied upon before genetic adaptation can be effectuated. Individuals were maintained at one of six temperatures (23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 °C) {{for at least six}} weeks. We compared the relative importance of acclimation temperature to changes in upper critical thermal limits, aerobic metabolic scope, and thermal preference. While acclimation temperature positively affected the upper critical thermal limit, neither aerobic metabolic scope nor thermal preference exhibited such plasticity. Importantly, when given the choice to stay in a habitat reflecting their acclimation temperatures or relocate, fish acclimated to end-of-century predicted temperatures (i. e., 31 or 33 °C) preferentially sought out cooler temperatures, those equivalent to long-term summer averages in their natural habitats (~ 29 °C). This was also the temperature providing the greatest aerobic metabolic scope and body condition across all treatments. Consequently, acclimation can confer plasticity in some performance traits, but may be an unreliable indicator of the ultimate survival and distribution of mobile <b>stenothermal</b> species under global warming. Conversely, thermal preference can arise long before, and remain long after, the harmful effects of elevated ocean temperatures take hold and may be the primary driver of the escalating pole-ward migration of species...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{acclimation}} {{effects on}} leg muscle plasma membrane composition and biophysical state, neuromuscular function and whole organism thermal tolerance, and {{their dependence on}} the background seasonal acclimatization were investigated in the eurythermal Carcinus maenas and the <b>stenothermal</b> Cancer pagurus. Correlations between the changes observed at each of these levels are discussed. The average winter (5 ºC), annual (8 ºC), and summer (15 ºC) sea-water temperatures and a warmer summer temperature (22 ºC) were chosen as acclimation temperatures for their ecological significance. Warm-acclimation (22 ºC) increased the thermal tolerance (CTMax) of both species and induced partial compensation of the neuromuscular function (assessed from leg nerve axonal conduction velocity and the amplitudes of excitatory junction potentials in dactylopodite closer muscle fibres). The time-course of acclimation showed it was complete after two weeks, but a longer exposure to 22 ºC reduced neuromuscular performance, an effect {{that may not be}} acclimation related. At plasma membrane level, the response to warm-acclimation depended on acclimation temperature. Acclimation to 15 ºC induced {{a significant increase in the}} S/U fatty acids ratio of PC and PE, but no increase in plasma membrane order. Acclimation to 22 ºC induced a significant increase in the Ch/PL molar ratio and in plasma membrane order, but no major changes in overall fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, compared to cold-acclimated crabs. A seasonal background, determined by complex factors, underlined these responses to temperature-acclimation. At all acclimation temperatures, crabs acclimated in autumn and winter had lower S/U fatty acid ratios and Ch/PL molar ratios than in spring, and the temperature dependence of plasma membrane fluidity was reduced in summer, compared to spring and autumn. The response to 15 ºC- acclimation was greater in winter than in other seasons. The CTMax and the magnitude or efficacy of the acclimation responses showed that the <b>stenothermal</b> species was more thermally sensitive than the eurythermal species...|$|E

It plays {{a significant}} role in bentho-pelagic coupling and hence has been proposed as a sentinel species for climate change monitoring. Previous studies have shown that this mollusc displays a high level of plasticity with regard to shell deposition and damage repair against a background of genetic homogeneity. The Southern Ocean has amongst the lowest present-day CaCO 3 saturation rate of any ocean region, and is predicted to be among the first to become undersaturated under current ocean acidification scenarios. Hence, this species presents as an ideal candidate for studies into the processes of calcium regulation and shell deposition in our changing ocean environments. Results: 454 sequencing of L. elliptica mantle tissue generated 18, 290 contigs with an average size of 535 bp (ranging between 142 bp- 5. 591 kb). BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Temperature-adaptive {{physiological}} variation plays {{important roles}} in latitudinal biogeographic patterning and in setting vertical distributions along subtidal-to-intertidal gradients in coastal marine ecosystems. Comparisons of congeneric marine invertebrates reveal that the most warm-adapted species may live closer to their thermal tolerance limits and have lower abilities to increase heat tolerance through acclimation than more cold-adapted species. In crabs and snails, heart function may be of critical importance in establishing thermal tolerance limits. Temperature-mediated shifts in gene expression may be critical in thermal acclimation. Transcriptional changes, monitored using cDNA microarrays, {{have been shown to}} differ between steady-state thermal acclimation and diurnal temperature cycling in a eurythermal teleost fish (Austrofundulus limnaeus). In <b>stenothermal</b> Antarctic notothenioid fish, losses in capacity for temperature-mediated gene expression, including the absence of a heat-shock response, may reduce the abilities of these species to acclimate to increased temperatures. Differences among species in thermal tolerance limits and in the capacities to adjust these limits may determine how organisms are affected by climate change. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The thermal {{sensitivity}} of mitochondrial function {{was investigated in}} the <b>stenothermal</b> Antarctic fish Lepidonotothen nudifrons. State 3 respiration in-creases with increasing temperature between 0 °C and 18 °C with a Q 10 of 2. 43 – 2. 63. State 4 respiration {{in the presence of}} oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase, quantifies the leakage of protons through the inner mitochondrial membrane, which causes oxygen consumption without concomitant ATP production. This parameter shows an unusually high Q 10 of 4. 21 0. 42 (0 – 18 °C), which indicates that proton leakage does not depend merely on ion diusion but is an enzyme-catalysed process. The dierential {{thermal sensitivity}} of oxidative phosphorylation (=state 3) and proton leakage (=state 4 in the presence of oligomycin) leads to progressive uncoupling of the mitochondria and decreased eciency of oxidative phosphorylation under in vivo conditions if the body temperature of L. nudi-frons increases.
