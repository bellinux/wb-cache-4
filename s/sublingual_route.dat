30|$|Some studies {{report that}} the {{conscious}} sedation created by midazolam is appropriate and effective for many procedures and does not affect urodynamic measurements (Bozkurt et al. 1996; Ozkurkcugil and Ozkan 2010). Conscious sedation {{can be defined as}} a constant sedation in an awake patient where protective airway reflexes are maintained. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with sedative, anxiolytic and amnestic effects. It is a valuable drug as it enables the patient to stay awake and cooperate for cystometry, has a rapid onset of action and short duration of effect without any serious side effects, causes partial anterograde amnesia, can be administered easily, and has several administration routes. The ability to reverse midazolam’s effect with flumazenil is a distinct advantage regarding safe use. This sedative agent can be administered through the intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal, rectal, oral or <b>sublingual</b> <b>routes.</b> Each administration route has specific advantages and disadvantages. Midazolam is effective when administered via the oral, nasal, rectal or <b>sublingual</b> <b>routes</b> (Akil et al. 2005; Malinovsky et al. 1995; Herd et al. 2006; Kogan et al. 2002). Its nasal or oral use can be difficult in children due to nasal irritation it causes and the unpleasant taste leading to spitting the drug out. Although the full dose of the drug can be made available with rectal administration, there may be fear and shame when this route is used.|$|R

40|$|Gene-based {{vaccination}} strategies, specifically viral vectors encoding vaccine immunogens {{are effective}} at priming strong immune responses. Mucosal routes offer practical advantages for vaccination by ease of needle-free administration, and immunogen delivery at readily accessible oral/nasal sites to efficiently induce immunity at distant gut and genital tissues. However, since mucosal tissues are inherently tolerant for induction of immune responses, incorporation of adjuvants for optimal mucosal vaccination strategies is important. We report here {{the effectiveness of}} alpha-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a synthetic glycolipid agonist of natural killer T (NKT) cells, as an adjuvant for enhancing immunogenicity of vaccine antigens delivered using viral vectors by mucosal routes in murine and nonhuman primate models. Significant improvement in adaptive immune responses in systemic and mucosal tissues was observed by including α-GalCer adjuvant for intranasal immunization of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus vector encoding the model antigen ovalbumin and adenoviral vectors expressing HIV env and Gag antigens. Activation of NKT cells in systemic and mucosal tissues along with significant increases in adaptive immune responses were observed in rhesus macaques immunized by intranasal and <b>sublingual</b> <b>routes</b> with protein or adenovirus vectored antigens when combined with α-GalCer adjuvant.

In Group 1 (n= 60), 800 μg misoprostol with 2 - 3 drops of normal saline were placed in the posterior vaginal fornix. In Group 2 (n= 60), 800 μg misoprostol was sublingually given. If the complete abortion did not occur, the repeated medication in the same route would be done every 6 hours for maximum of three doses in total. Results: There was no difference in the complete abortion rate between two groups (60. 0 % vaginal; 68. 3 % sublingual, p= 0. 44). The mean induction-abortion time was shorter in the sublingual group compared to the vaginal group (21. 1 ± 10. 2 hrs vaginal; 12. 6 ± 3. 9 hrs sublingual p= 0. 03). Heavy bleeding was common in the sublingual group. Side effects of both groups were similar which included nausea, fever, headache, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

40|$|Background and aims: Per year, overdoses kill 69. 000 {{users of}} illicit and {{prescription}} opioids in epidemic pattern worldwide. Among them, 250 people in Norway. Naloxone {{is an effective}} antidote for opioid overdose reversal, but approved pharmaceuticals have been limited to invasive administrations. Lay people access to naloxone is initiated to facilitate bystander rescue, but limitations associated with invasive administration constitute a desire for non-injectable formulations. The thesis deals with two separate issues: A) Contribution to recruitment, screening and conduction of a pivotal clinical trial aiming to support marketing authorization for an intranasal naloxone spray. B) Contribution to a systematic review paper on non-peer reviewed patent registrations of non-injectable naloxone formulations. Method: A) Central elements of good clinical practice were dealt with through developing documents needed for recruitment and inclusion to the clinical trial. B) Patents on noninjectable naloxone formulations were identified through the WIPO PatentScope database. Information on pharmacokinetics and formulations (including stability data) were extracted and analysed. Peer-reviewed literature was reviewed based on a PubMed search using the Boolean search query “(nasal OR intranasal OR nose OR buccal OR sublingual) AND naloxone AND pharmacokinetics”. Results: A) An Information letter with an integrated informed consent form, blood sample storage records, an information flyer and a case report form were developed and used during recruitment and at screening in October and November 2015. 17 subjects were screened, whereof 11 were eligible. 6 subjects were re-screened and 9 new subjects were screened at March 2016, whereof 12 subjects were included. B) 522 WIPO patents and 56 PubMed records were identified, whereof 3 patents and 5 papers were eligible. Pharmacokinetic data for intranasal and <b>sublingual</b> <b>routes</b> were identified and collated. Sublingual bioavailability was F= 1 %.

40|$|Influenza is a one of {{the most}} {{important}} respiratory viruses, and it infects millions of people every year. Due to mutational changes in the virus genome (antigenic drift), influenza cause occasional pandemics. Pandemic influenza strains arise when gene segments from two or more influenza viruses re-assort (antigenic shift), leading to a novel virus. Vaccination is still the most effective way of preventing influenza, and the recent H 1 N 1 pandemic emphasised the need for effective pandemic vaccines that can induce rapid protection in an immunologically naïve population. Mucosally administered vaccines are an attractive approach for delivery of influenza vaccines since they are needle-free and have the ability to induce mucosal immune responses. Intranasal (IN) vaccination against influenza has been used for decades, however, an inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine was recently associated with Bell's Palsy (facial nerve paralysis). Sublingual (SL) vaccination (application under the tongue) can be a novel alternative for mucosal administration of influenza vaccines. Avian influenza subtypes have previously shown to be poorly immunogenic in man, thus an effective adjuvant is needed to boost the vaccine effect. In this study we have vaccinated BALB/c mice IM, IM or SL with two doses, three weeks apart, of a virosomal H 5 N 1 influenza vaccine (2 μg of HA) alone or in combination with 7. 5 μg of the novel mucosal adjuvant c-di-GMP. Serum, saliva and nasal wash samples were analysed for influenza specific antibodies using the ELISA and HI antibodies were detected in serum and saliva using the HI assay. Splenocytes were used in the memory B cell ELISPOT, and stimulated in vitro before the cytokine profiles were measured by multiplex bead assay. In addition, influenza stimulated splenocytes were fixed and stained intracellularly for cytokines, and the frequency of cytokine producing cells was determined using multiparametric flow cytometry. The intramuscular, the intranasal and the <b>sublingual</b> <b>routes</b> all induced strong immune responses both in the humoral and the cellular immune assays when the virosomes were combined with c-di-GMP adjuvant. The non-adjuvanted vaccine induced lower immune responses as compared to the adjuvanted vaccine, irrespective of administration route. After the first vaccine dose, IM administration of the adjuvanted vaccine showed the highest IgG antibody response. In contrast, after the second vaccine dose, the IN adjuvanted group showed the highest responses in all assays. A strong local humoral immune response together with systemic IgG and IgA antibodies was elicited in both the sublingual and the intranasal adjuvanted groups. Interestingly, the IN adjuvanted group showed a dominant Th 1 profile, whereas the SL adjuvanted group showed a more balanced Th 2 /Th 1 profile. In addition, high levels of IL- 17 (a Th 17 cytokine) were produced in both the mucosal administered vaccines groups. The frequency of multifunctional CD 4 + T cells was highest in the IN adjuvanted group, but also SL vaccination of virosomes combined with c-di-GMP induced high frequencies of multifunctional T cells. This is the first study to report that SL vaccination with H 5 N 1 virosomes induces both humoral and cellular immune responses. These results demonstrate that the SL route is a promising way of administering influenza vaccines; we therefore suggest further investigation of influenza vaccines administered sublingually...|$|R
