Twomey’s Merlot is typically aged for 18 months in French oak barrels, and during the aging process the wine is racked from barrel to barrel, something known as <b>soutirage</b> traditionnel. <b>Soutirage</b> is the method of moving the wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump, which can be disruptive to a wine. This process softens tannins and clarifies and enhances the aromatic qualities of this wine.|$|E

Baron's Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is typically aged for about 24-25 months exclusively in American oak barrels, following in the tradition of Justin Meyer. He ages Twomey's Merlot typically for 18 months in French oak barrels, and six times during the aging process the wine is racked from barrel to barrel, something known as <b>soutirage</b> traditionnel. <b>Soutirage</b> is the method of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump, which can be disruptive to a wine.

The process is also known as Abstich in German and travaso in Italian.|$|E
5000|$|Racking or <b>soutirage</b> is a {{traditional}} method in wine production of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump. The process is repeated when the casks are moved to the second-year cellar. <b>Soutirage</b> {{was developed in the}} Bordeaux region of France in the 19th century {{at a time when there}} was no electricity to power pumps. Many estates such in Bordeaux and some estates in Pomerol and St. Emillion still employ this labor-intensive method. During aging, the wine is decanted several times from barrel to barrel. This process softens tannins, clarifies the wine and enhances aromatic qualities. According to Oz Clarke, [...] "traditionally the wine is 'racked' or drawn from barrel or tank to another empty one on a number of occasions (called <b>soutirage).</b> This helps clarify and freshen the wine by removing the fine lees or sediment which forms and provides a tiny amount of oxygen to help the aging process. The wine may also be 'fined' (collage) using egg white or other materials to settle out particles in suspension which are then removed through further racking." [...] Egg white is often applied to each barrel during the process. Twomey Cellars's Napa Valley Merlot is made using the <b>soutirage</b> process.|$|E
