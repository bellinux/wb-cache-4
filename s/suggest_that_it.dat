5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
50|$|The {{size of its}} osteocytic lacunae <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had {{a fairly}} large genome (C-value of about 36.7 pg, with a 95% {{confidence}} interval ranging from 30.2 to 44.2 pg), though not as large as that of obligatorily neotenic extant urodeles. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been facultatively neotenic.|$|R
5000|$|Cytosolic beta-glucosidase is a {{predominantly}} liver enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes beta-D-glucoside and beta-D-galactoside, but not any known physiologic beta-glycoside, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved}} in detoxification of plant glycosides. GBA3 also has significant neutral glycosylceramidase activity (...) , <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved in}} a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway of glucosylceramide metabolism.|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E
5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking {{is that there are}} one or two earlier examples.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
50|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{comes from}} Turkey <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is adapted to}} harsh climates.|$|R
500|$|Other {{proposals}} were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving {{and supporting the}} head. Othenio Abel proposed it {{was used as a}} weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used as a}} foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osmólska <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed salt glands, and John Ostrom <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities. One unusual suggestion, made by creationist Duane Gish, is that the crest housed chemical glands <b>that</b> allowed <b>it</b> to throw jets of chemical [...] "fire" [...] at enemies, similar to the modern-day bombardier beetle.|$|R

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may have been}} cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also {{seems to have been}} greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Demeter, Philitas' {{most famous}} work, {{consisted}} of elegiac couplets, or couplets in the elegiac meter. Its few surviving fragments <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> narrated the grain goddess Demeter's hunt {{for her daughter}} Persephone. The fragments describe Demeter's arrival on Cos and warm welcome by its royal family of Meropids, or humans twice normal size, thus presenting the founding myth of a local cult of Demeter on Cos.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further work {{being carried out}} on the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although peace was declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly what shape the fort took; archaeological investigations <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; {{there would have been}} battery positions {{on either side of the}} main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had been spent on building and developing the fortification.|$|E

5|$|I. lakotaensis was {{described}} by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of Iguanodon, I. lakotaensis {{was described}} from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was more basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested {{that it was a}} synonym of I. bernissartensis. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Some Neolithic flint tools {{recovered}} {{from the top of}} the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since prehistory. The nearby remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an Iron Age settlement in about 300–200BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens. There is no evidence of permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was visited on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in daily use {{as part of the}} farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparition}} of 12BC {{was recorded}} in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16AU of Earth. Halley's appearance in 12BC, {{only a few years}} distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{back cover}} on early prints of the CD {{featured}} a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints {{for fear of}} litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover.

5|$|The commentaries of Ramayana <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} right for Sugriva to marry the widowed Tara. Amritakataka of Kataka Madhava Yogindra says that this was right as they were animals. The Tilaka by Nahesh Bhatt(Ramavarma) justifies Sugriva's {{marriage}} to Tara since Sugriva was her dead husband's brother. It further states that Tara should remarry as she {{did not belong to}} the first three castes and was young. Tara's action of taking Sugriva as her husband after Vali's death is seen as her attempt to secure the futures of Angada and the kingdom.|$|E
