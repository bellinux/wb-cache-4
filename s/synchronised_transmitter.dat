5000|$|Technical issues {{addressed}} included that of synchronization between transmitters (GPS {{was used}} to supply a 1 Hz and a 10 MHz reference frequency, as well as timing information) and precise control of transmitted frequencies (to within 1 Hz). Identification for each individual transmitter needed to be embedded in the signal for troubleshooting purposes, yet the main data stream on every <b>synchronised</b> <b>transmitter</b> must be identical; this is done by adding a second, low bit rate spread spectrum signal 27-30 dB weaker than the main signal. As this [...] "watermark" [...] identifier is buried under the stronger main signal, multiple repetitions of this same identifier could be received and summed {{in order to provide}} a readable version of the watermark to broadcast technicians. A standard receiver, meanwhile, would see the same signal from all transmitters by design.|$|E

Transmitters that are part of an SFN need to be very accurately <b>synchronised</b> with other <b>transmitters</b> in the network, which requires the transmitters to use very accurate clocks.|$|R

50|$|In North American digital {{terrestrial}} television broadcasting, a distributed transmission system (DTS or DTx) {{is a form of}} single-frequency network in which a single broadcast signal is fed via microwave, landline, or communications satellite to multiple <b>synchronised</b> terrestrial radio <b>transmitter</b> sites. The signal is then simultaneously broadcast on the same frequency in different overlapping portions of the same coverage area, effectively combining many small transmitters to generate a broadcast area rivalling that of one large transmitter or to fill gaps in coverage due to terrain or localised obstacles.|$|R
50|$|Tests by Pennsylvania State University public {{educational}} WPSX-TV (now WPSU-TV) {{were initially}} made in 2003 WPSU was in analog a VHF 3 station which serves State College, Pennsylvania {{from a distant}} transmitter which must also cover Johnstown and Altoona. As a digital station, WSPU had used a large UHF 15 transmitter {{at the location of}} the original low-VHF broadcast tower, leading to localised problems with terrain shielding which interfered with UHF reception in State College itself. Relocation of the main transmitter would have interfered with the station's ability to serve the other two communities. Addition of a small (50 kW) <b>synchronised</b> digital TV <b>transmitter</b> in State College, on the same frequency as the main UHF 15 signal, proved a means to improve reception; further improvements would be possible by adding small co-channel 50 kW transmitters in each community to be served.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} {{high data rate}} serial {{transmission}} protocols, the clock {{is embedded in the}} signal. At the physical level, PCI Express 2.0 utilizes the 8b/10b encoding scheme to ensure that strings of consecutive identical digits (zeros or ones) are limited in length. This coding was used to prevent the receiver from losing track of where the bit edges are. In this coding scheme every eight (uncoded) payload bits of data are replaced with 10 (encoded) bits of transmit data, causing a 20% overhead in the electrical bandwidth. To improve the available bandwidth, PCI Express version 3.0 instead uses 128b/130b encoding with scrambling. 128b/130b encoding relies on the scrambling to limit the run length of identical-digit strings in data streams and ensure the receiver stays <b>synchronised</b> to the <b>transmitter.</b> It also reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) by preventing repeating data patterns in the transmitted data stream.|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} chaotic {{cryptographic}} {{system based on}} a modified inclusion method in combination with indirect coupled synchronisation to create a chaotic private key. A Rossler type chaotic oscillator is used to embed an encrypted message in its dynamics {{as well as to}} drive the piece-wise linear function of a Chua type system, used to create a chaotic key to encrypt the embedded message. In the receiver side a Rossler high gain observer is used to <b>synchronise</b> with the <b>transmitter</b> as well as to drive a second Chua oscillator to decrypt the message. A bidirectional link is applied to remove the nonlinear term in transmitter-receiver error dynamics analysis. Information retrieval is achieved when encrypted message amplification factors and gain matrix values are correctly tuned; leading to a transfer function between error dynamics and encrypted message equal to unity. In this way encrypted message is retrieved with straight forward error dynamics subtraction, avoiding left invertibility problem. Message is finally obtained with key chaotic decryption from a second receiver-driven Chua oscillator. All results presented are based on software simulation in an ideal communication channel...|$|R
40|$|Stemming {{from their}} common {{interest}} in media archeology {{and the idea}} of the air as a medium of encrypted signals, Satz and Parikka explore the themes emerging from her film installation 'Impulsive Synchronisation', shown at the Hayward project space, London, in 2013. Satz has used various technologies as the subject of her work, including the Chladni plate, mechanical music, phonograph grooves and optical sound, looking at how such objects tap into ideas of knowledge and communication in their use of notation systems, languages or codes. Satz is also interested in bringing to the fore key female figures that are largely excluded from mainstream historical discourse in an ongoing engagement with the question of women’s contributions to labour, technology and scientific knowledge. The starting point for ‘Impulsive Synchronisation’ was a 'Secret Communication System' patented during World War II by Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr and American composer George Antheil. This invention of 'frequency hopping' was designed to protect radio-controlled torpedoes from enemy disruption by distributing the signal over many frequencies and <b>synchronising</b> the <b>transmitter</b> and receiver in rapidly changing patterns. The idea, which drew in part on Antheil's unsuccessful attempt to synchronise 16 pianolas in his 1924 avant-garde masterpiece 'Ballet Mecanique', suggested the use of 88 frequencies (the number of keys on a piano), and the use of perforated paper rolls to keep the frequency hops in sync with each other. This concept has since become the basis for today's spread-spectrum technology, widely used in wireless telephone and wi-fi technology. In Satz’s film and sound installation, these technologies were referenced to explore visual, musical and data notation, as well as its encryption, synchronisation and decipherment. The conversation covers the topics of radio frequencies, encryption, the unexpected trajectories and migrations of technological inventions, the textual/visual language of patents, and questions of synchronisation in communication technologies...|$|R
40|$|The main {{investigation}} {{in this thesis}} is the research on a future quantum internet. The focus is laid on the network structure of this quantum network. The network is rst examined by {{the investigation of the}} Kuramoto model for classical oscillators. The main property of the network is the ability to synchronise all nodes such that all oscillate with the same frequency. Several parameters of the oscillators are varied to verify why and when synchronisation takes place. After modelling the calculated equations of motion, an interesting conclusion arises. For a symmetric ring network, a stable conguration is not always found but by introducing asymmetric oscillators in the network, the synchronous state can be found. This conclusion leads to the idea that a quantum network requires certain dierences in its structure in order to guarantee transmission to take place. Furthermore, the existence of synchronisation heavily depends on the parameters used for the oscillators. The analysis is then continued in the quantum domain where optomechanical systems are introduced. At rst, two systems are connected to each other by a gaseous interaction and an electric interaction via a Dung circuit. The main investigation is again into the synchronisation, which implies that the operators belonging to both systems behave the same as a function of time. Then several synchronisation measures are introduced to measure the ability of the systems to synchronise. As predicted, both systems synchronise in terms of the operators for each system. Then a quantum network is introduced, where a complex yet ecient network is created. This quantum network is a small world network, where a transmitter node is able to connect to the receiver node by only a few links. Furthermore, multiple transmissions can take {{place at the same time}} and links which are not connected do not <b>synchronise</b> with the <b>transmitter</b> node. After modelling this network, the results are in compliance with the theory available. Challenges for a practical quantum network include the experimental basis of being able to utilise optomechanical systems outside laboratory circumstances. Also, the network should be tested for practical use and expanded in a much larger size both in theoretical analysis as well as in experiments. Applied Mathematics / Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the FF-LYNX project, {{undertook}} by DII-IET (Pisa) and INFN (Pisa) and relying on a collaboration with CERN (Geneva), and focuses on the development of a high-level SystemC model and simulator of a new communication protocol and interfaces {{to be used in the}} context of High Energy Physics (HEP). The FF-LYNX protocol is meant to provide the diverse and heterogeneous world of HEP experiments with a standard solution to common problems, such as Data Acquisition (DAQ) and Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC). The particle detectors used in HEP experiments generate unwieldy amounts of data following a particle collision (10 TB/s - 1 PB/s). To reduce the amount of data to shift from the detector to the central elaboration system a filter is applied. After a collision the detectors send only a small share of data to the central system. This data is used to ascertain whether the detectors caught interesting events (which are only a few percent of the total). If the results are positive a trigger signal is sent to the detectors to command the acquisition of the interesting events only. This way the data rate becomes manageable. Every HEP laboratory has developed its TTC/DAQ protocol, so no standard solution exists. FF-LYNX aims at defining a standard but flexible approach that could be employed in all the HEP contexts, therefore enabling savings on money, time and efforts. The proposed protocol sits at the data-link layer of the ISO/OSI stack, is serial and synchronous and makes use of Time Division Multiplexing to fit two channels in the same wire. One of these channels carries triggers, frame headers and synchronisation patterns, while the other transports data frames. Triggers undergo a scheduling process to make sure they have fixed and known end-to-end delay (a key requirement in HEP experiments). The high-level simulator has been used to validate the performance of the protocol and to support critical implementation decisions, such as the mechanism for keeping the receiver and <b>transmitter</b> <b>synchronised.</b> A useful set of guidelines have been thus provided for the development of a lower-level VHDL model. The scalable and modular architecture of the simulator will allow it to be reused to control the FPGA emulator that will implement the interfaces at a later project phase...|$|R
40|$|Synchronization is a {{critical}} function in digital communications. Its failure may cause catastrophic effects on the transmission system performance. It {{is very important that}} the receiver is <b>synchronised</b> with the <b>transmitter</b> because {{it is not possible to}} correct frequencies/phases without any control mechanisms. Synchronization is different in Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) for uplink and downlink because of the choice of multiple access scheme. Multiple access scheme for LTE downlink is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) for the uplink. OFDMA is susceptible to Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO). In case of a typical LTE system with a carrier frequency of 2. 1 GHz, a frequency drift of 10 ppm (10 × 10 - 6) of the local oscillator can cause an offset of 21 kHz. LTE system employs a fixed subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz. This offset caused by the local oscillator corresponds to 1. 40 subcarrier spac-ings. The receiver extracts the information from the received signal to synchronise and compensate for any carrier frequency/phase offset. Increasing demand for data driven applications has put stress on communication systems to provide high data rates and increased bandwidth. This demand has ever been increasing and requires new standards to evolve and efficient hardware. It has been difficult to develop hardware at the pace new communication standards are developing. It also increases the cost of deployment of a technology for a brief period of time without covering the huge capital invested in the network. In order to meet the pace of evolving standards and covering the huge net-work costs, industry needs Software-Defined Radio (SDR). SDR is a radio communica-tion technology that is based on software defined wireless communication protocols instead of hardwired implementations. System components that are usually implemented in hardware are implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system. LTE carrier recovery algorithm for LTE downlink with 20 MHz system bandwidth has been implemented in this thesis. The architecture chosen for implementation is Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA) with the goal to achieve real time constraints along with a certain flexibility and power consumption needed for an SDR platform. The target programming language is C with TTA specific extensions instead of hand optimized assembly with the aim to reduce the whole design time and still achieve the required optimizations and throughput. This design cycle time is also one of the im-portant aspects for product development in the industry...|$|R
