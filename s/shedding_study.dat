40|$|Background Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was {{discovered}} in 2001. Later {{studies have shown that}} HMPV is quite similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children. Aims The aims of my thesis were to study the occurrence and clinical manifestations of severe HMPV infections in Norwegian children and the impact of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. I also wanted to compare severe HMPV and RSV infections. I wanted to study the HMPV shedding time during acute RTI and HMPV in asymptomatic hospital controls, to get an impression of HMPV in non-infected children. Finally, I wanted to study HMPV and other respiratory viruses among children in day-care centers. Materials and Methods The thesis is based on data from 3 clinical studies, a cohort study of 3, 650 hospitalized children with RTI and 339 asymptomatic hospital controls, the <b>shedding</b> <b>study</b> including 32 hospitalized HMPV-infected children and a cross-sectional study in two day-care centers, including 161 apparently healthy children. The day-care children were examined median 2 times during four visits in 2012 - 2014. Informed, written consents to participate were collected from caregivers and the majority of children underwent clinical examination. Nasopharyngeal samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens, and cultured for virus. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Results HMPV was detected in 7. 3 % and RSV in 28. 7 % among children in the hospital cohort during the period 2006 - 2015. Among the controls, 2. 1 % had HMPV with low viral load by PCR, but all were culture negative. HMPV occurred in regular winter and spring-summer epidemics, and with a median duration of 3. 5 months. The average annual hospitalization rates in children < 5 years old with lower RTI were 1. 8 / 1, 000 (HMPV) and 9. 9 / 1, 000 (RSV). All HMPV subtypes (A 2 a, A 2 b, B 1 and B 2), except subtype A 1, were detected. In each season, at least two subtypes circulated. The F gene sequencing revealed no clusters or new strains, whereas several known HMPV strains circulated during the entire period. The clinical manifestations were relatively similar in HMPV- and RSV-infected children with lower RTI, and the clinical manifestations in HMPV lower RTI were not related to viral co-detection and HMPV genotypes. Age was an important risk factor for disease severity, in addition to a history of prematurity and chronic disease, for HMPV- and RSV-associated lower RTI. Children < 6 months of age with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12 - 23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. Among children in day-care centers, HMPV was detected 4 times only, but rhinovirus, enterovirus and parechovirus were frequently appearing. The virus rates in day-care children varied in relation to age, clinical signs of RTI, day-care section (sections for younger and older children) and season. The median HMPV shedding time was estimated to be 13 days (range 6 - 28 days). Conclusions HMPV occurred in regular epidemics, and is a common cause of severe RTI in Norwegian children, but the hospitalization rate is five times lower than RSV. Clinically, severe HMPV and RSV infections manifest relatively similar, and independent of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes in children with severe HMPV infections. Children shed HMPV shortly and HMPV appears seldom in asymptomatic children and healthy day-care children, in contrast to picornaviruses that may be detected frequently in Norwegian children attending day care...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{turbulent}} {{wake of a}} square-back body {{exhibits a}} strong bimodal behavior. The wake randomly undergoes symmetry-breaking reversals between two mirror asymmetric steady modes [reflectional symmetry-breaking (RSB) modes]. The characteristic time for reversals is about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude larger than the natural time for vortex <b>shedding.</b> <b>Studying</b> {{the effects of the}} proximity of a ground wall together with the Reynolds number, it is shown that the bimodal behavior is the result of an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. The RSB modes correspond to the two stable bifurcated branches resulting from an instability of the stable symmetric wake. An attempt to stabilize the unstable symmetric wake is investigated using a passive control technique. Although the controlled wake still exhibits strong fluctuations, the bimodal behavior is suppressed and the drag reduced. This promising experiment indicates the possible existence of an unstable solution branch corresponding to a reflectional symmetry preserved (RSP) mode. This work is encouraging to develop a control strategy based on a stabilization of this RSP mode to reduce mean drag and lateral force fluctuations...|$|R

The midribless mutants {{are characterized by}} leaf blades that tend to droop because {{of the absence of}} a keel in the midrib portion of the leaf lamina. Seed set was drastically reduced in J 561 (India) and IP 6534 (Mali) midribless mutants as the gynoecium and androecium were affected. In another midribless mutant, IP 10154 (Mali), the gynoecium was absent or rudimentary, but the androecium was more prominent with prolific pollen <b>shedding.</b> <b>Studies</b> of F 2 segregation in reciprocal crosses between normal and their respective midribless mutants indicated that a single recessive gene controlled the midribless trait {{in each of the three}} mutants. Tests for complementation among the midribless mutants indicated that J 561 and IP 6534 have the same gene for the trait designated mrl 1, and IP 10154 has a different gene designated mrl 2.

40|$|The type 2 transmembrane serine {{protease}} matriptase {{is involved in}} many pathophysiological processes probably via its enzymatic activity, which depends on the dynamic relationship between zymogen activation and protease inhibition. Matriptase shedding can prolong the life of enzymatically active matriptase and increase accessibility to substrates. We show here that matriptase shedding occurs via a de novo proteolytic cleavage at sites located between the SEA domain and the CUB domain. Point or combined mutations at the four positively charged amino acid residues in the region following the SEA domain allowed Arg- 186 {{to be identified as}} the primary cleavage site responsible for matriptase <b>shedding.</b> Kinetic <b>studies</b> further demonstrate that matriptase shedding is temporally coupled with matriptase zymogen activation. The onset of matriptase shedding lags one minute behind matriptase zymogen activation. Studies with active site triad Ser- 805 point mutated matriptase, which no longer undergoes zymogen activation or shedding, further suggests that matriptase shedding depends on matriptase zymogen activation, and that matriptase proteolytic activity may be involved in its own <b>shedding.</b> Our <b>studies</b> uncover an autonomous mechanism coupling matriptase zymogen activation, proteolytic activity, and shedding such that a proportion of newly generated active matriptase escapes HAI- 1 -mediated rapid inhibition by shedding into the extracellular milieu...|$|R
40|$|Vortex induced {{vibrations}} of {{circular section}} structures are a {{well known and}} deeply studied phenomenon because many engineering applications are involved by this kind of prob-lems. Up to now most part of the experimental results belong to a Reynolds Number range between 500 and 6 · 104 and no reliable numerical simulations are available for Reynolds higher than 3000, nevertheless many structures deals with Reynolds {{of the order of}} thousands up to more than one million. Vortex <b>shedding</b> <b>studies</b> on still circular cylinder shows that the phenomenon is strongly influenced by the Reynolds Number, in particular in the critical range. In the past Roshko showed that the well defined vortex shedding reappears at postcritical Reynolds Number. Due to the effects of the body surface characteristics on the flow field also the surface roughness affects vortex shedding and it is expected to influence VIV. Because the Reynolds Number is a fundamental parameter in the vortex shedding on fixed cylinder and among all the studies of VIV are at moderate Re, there is the need to understand if and how the Reynolds Number affects also the vortex induced oscillations; in the paper experimental tests on a large diameter cylinder investigate the vortex induced dynamics at high Reynolds Numbers...|$|R
