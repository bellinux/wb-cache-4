40|$|The {{life-time}} {{performance of}} chemical processes is limited due {{to changes in}} the plant dynamics and disturbance characteristics over time. Such systems often make use of model-based controllers. When a dynamic change arises over time, a difference occurs between the dynamic models contained in the controller and the true system dynamics. The difference in dynamics could deteriorate the performance of a model-based control system. Monitoring the performance on-line is therefore of importance. Detection of a dynamic plant or disturbance change occurs by a classical performance monitoring method, which estimates the variance of the controlled outputs. A change is detected at the moment that a maximum performance bound is violated. An important step is to distinguish between control-relevant plant changes and variations in disturbance characteristics due to different solutions strategies. With an existing performance diagnosis method which makes use of closed-loop prediction error identification the true plant dynamics are identified. Then it is verified whether a performance drop is caused by a change in control-relevant plant dynamics by making use of hypothesis testing. A set is considered that contains all plant dynamics which achieve a satisfactory performance and it is verified whether the identified model is located in or outside the <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>decision.</b> With an alternative second decision rule, a heuristic method is used where models are constructed around the estimated model by making use of a normal distribution. It is verified which percentage of these models are located outside the <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a <b>decision.</b> A third decision rule is used which is a combination of the first and second decision rules and the confidence is compared between all considered decision rules. In a simulation case study of a binary distillation column, the performance monitoring method detects a performance drop satisfactory without creating many false alarms. Furthermore, it is shown that with the heuristic method a significant increase in confidence is achieved compared to the first decision rule and only a minor difference with respect to the third decision rule.

Guided by andragogy, this sequential mixed methods {{study was conducted to}} explore differences in students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of satisfaction, self-confidence, and critical thinking between two groups of students with different amounts of clinical simulation. In an associate degree nursing program, 34 nursing students completed a single survey on student perceptions of satisfaction and self-confidence, 12 students completed a critical thinking test, 37 student reflection papers were reviewed, and 4 faculty members were interviewed. Independent t tests were used in analyzing quantitative data, and content analysis was used in the analysis of qualitative data. Statistical analysis and content analysis showed no difference between the groups of students for satisfaction, self-confidence, and critical thinking. However, results should be interpreted with caution because quantitative analyses were underpowered, increasing the risk of type II error. Overall, students had positive comments about simulations in regard to satisfaction, self-confidence, and critical thinking.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 During {{the course}} of care, {{patients}} frequently develop escalating health problems that lead to medical complications, costly treatments, severe pains, disabilities and even death. Predicting such escalations provides the opportunity to apply preventive measures that result in better patient safety, quality of care and lower medical costs; in short, timely prediction can save lives and avoid further medical complications. Prognostics methods using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) promise to deliver new insights into future patient health status that provide more effective medical treatment during the patient hospital stay. With the advent of smaller, inexpensive sensors and volume of data collected from patients, physicians are challenged with making increasingly analytical decisions from a large set of data that are being collected per patient. This trend is only increasing giving rise to what's known in the industry as the "big data problem": The rate of data accumulation is rising faster than physicians' cognitive capacity to analyze increasingly large data <b>sets</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions.</b> The big data problem offers an opportunity for predictive analytics and prognostics. Investigation and development of a methodical framework for medical data prognostics in general and use of committee of algorithms in particular have not been adequately explored. A framework for prediction of patient health status from clinical data is needed to assist physicians in their clinical decision process. This research investigates and contributes to three essential ideas for improving healthcare prognostics through big data analytics: 1) A control system approach to prognostics for prediction, 2) A generalized committee of models framework as prognostics engine, and 3) Study the viability of such framework on a particular clinical case. This research offers three key contributions: First, it develops a control system treatment of medical prognostics and predictive models. The control system development of prognostics combines feed-forward and feedback control mechanisms to create a framework for medical prognostics. This framework introduces a rules-based prognostics engine that uses ANN algorithms to identify patients who develop a particular disease or medical complication. Second, it provides a generalized committee of models framework to predict the patient's medical condition and predict any medical complication from large data sets. The model also provides the strength (or the impact level) of all contributing clinical data to that prediction. The methodology proposes using a multi-algorithm prognostics framework to enhance the accuracy of prediction using four ANN models. The framework introduces a supervisory program, called an oracle to select the most appropriate ensemble of models that best meet the practitioner's desired prediction accuracy. Third, it demonstrates the viability and feasibility of using ANN methods as predictive models in this framework. As part of the demonstration, the research explores building, training and validating four ANN models to predict medical complications from data acquired during 1, 073 patients' hospital stay to predict Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE). DVT/PE, is a condition caused by blockage of patient lung vessels by blood clots that initially form in patient's legs. DVT/PE leads to severe pain, loss of lung function and even death. The aim of all three ideas {{is to improve the}} physician's ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> predictive <b>decisions</b> from a vast array of data in order to be proactive and apply preventative medical interventions before complications occur...|$|R

While intuitively ap-pealing, we show that this switching policy can have arbitrar-ily poor worst case performance. In response, we describe a modified algorithm, monotone policy switching, whose worst case performance, under certain conditions, is provably no worse than the minimax fixed policy in the set.

40|$|Maintaining {{order and}} {{discipline}} {{is one of}} the most challenging aspects of the school-based administrator’s role. School officials <b>make</b> disciplinary <b>decisions</b> within a context that is established, in part, by case law, legislation and regulations, school board policies and social, organizational and individual values. The exercise of administrative discretion is vital to the decision-making process. It offers school leaders creativity and flexibility. The interpretation and implementation of school discipline policies by in-school administrators can provide insight into their discretionary decision-making. The purpose of this study was to determine how principals in an urban school division in Western Canada negotiated within the legal parameters of discretion as it is delegated to them in legislation and school board policy in order to be faithful to their own values system in matters of student discipline. The study assumed Christopher Hodgkinson’s hierarchy of values as a theoretical framework for examining the administrators’ decision-making, and used H. L. A. Hart’s concept of law as a system of rules as an additional lens through which to view the exercise of administrative discretion. Employing an interpretive qualitative research methodology, the researcher conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten elementary school principals. Findings of the research reflect that the way principals perceived the exercise of discretion enabled them to maintain school safety, to be, in their judgment, fair and just in decision-making in disciplinary situations, to balance competing rights in the school <b>setting</b> and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> in what they understood to be the best interests of their students. The principals’ exercise of discretion, however, appeared to be subject to various values and influences which could lead to injustice and arbitrariness in decision-making. In the end, I concluded discretionary power should be structured, limited and subject to review in order to provide accountability to stakeholders. Implications of the study suggest principals should develop greater awareness of their own values system and be reflective about their judgments and decision-making. Schools should have clearly-defined codes of conduct, and school divisions should outline expectations for discipline policy implementation and adherence by principals...|$|R

40|$|Background/Introduction: Diarrhea is {{a leading}} killer of {{children}} around the world. Responsible for 4 to 6 million deaths per year according to the World Health Organization. The disease is characterised by vomiting, fever and watery diarrhoea, associated with dehydration and sometimes death in children. It is associated with high cases {{of morbidity and mortality}} and it is estimated that up to 600, 000 deaths in young children occur annually in the less developed countries and approximately 150, 000 - 200, 000 deaths occur in Africa alone. Rotavirus is the leading viral agent causing gastroenteritis in children. Rationale: The study aimed at accurately determining the prevalence and associated factors of group A rotavirus disease in a resource-poor <b>setting</b> necessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> informed <b>decisions</b> on provision appropriate interventions for prevention and control. Objectives To determine the prevalence and associated factors of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged 0 - 5 years in Moshi Municipal Health facilities. Methodology: This was cross- sectional descriptive study conducted in a hospital setting, involving children of five years of age and below with diarrhoea, and whose faecal samples were collected and tested for rotavirus by ELISA test at MUHAS Microbiology laboratory. All patients who met case definition were included in the study. Completed questionnaires were coded by numbers and double entered in a computer using Epi info software version 3. 5. 1. Chi- squire test was used to explore bivariate associations for categorical variables. 	 vu Results Of the 249 children with diarrhoea 31 (12. 4 %) showed stool rotavirus positive results among these, 17 (54. 8 %) were females and 14 (45. 2 %) were males. Prevalence varied by sex being 5. 6 % in males and 6. 8 % among females. The over all mean age was 23. 3 months; mean age for females was 23. 5 months where as for males was 23. 0 months. Rotavirus positive specific age group distribution, 30 (96. 8 %) children are in the age group 7 - 24 months and 1 (3. 2 %) child in the age group 25 - 60 months. Conclusion and Recommendations: This study shows insignificant prevalence of rotavirus gastroenteritis that could decrease the importance of vaccination by health education to parents on oral rehydration therapy, general sanitation, improvement of water supplies and proper excreta disposal this could reduce the burden of diarrhea diseases including rotavirus...|$|R

40|$|The {{mentoring}} of new {{researchers and}} caregivers by senior nursing and midwifery professionals {{is vital to}} continue delivering quality health outcomes for patients, according to Chair of Clinical Nursing at Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s Fremantle Campus, Professor Leanne Monterosso. Professor Monterosso says there is an expectation for up-to-date health practice from consumers, health care funders and insurance providers, with nurses and midwives needing to possess a broad skills <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> critical patient-related <b>decisions.</b> Professor Monterosso addressed these points and others while delivering an oration titled Nursing and Midwifery Research: changing lives, changing practice at the third Biennial Nursing and Midwifery Oration Series at St John of God Murdoch Hospital, Western Australia. The event {{was sponsored by the}} Department of Health in partnership with St John of God Health Care and The University of Notre Dame Australia. The oration covered several important topics including research initiatives undertaken in neo-natal health care, the partnerships between tertiary institutions and health care providers in training and mentoring student nurses and midwives, and the complex nature of palliative care and the care options available to patients and their families regardless of the outcome from the initial diagnosis. Professor Monterosso said the impact of work undertaken by nurse and midwife researchers could lead to improved patient care and quality of life outcomes, an evidence base for nursing and midwifery curricula and clinical guidelines, and the training and support of the next generation of clinical nurses, researchers and educators. 2 ̆ 2 Within the private tertiary and health care sectors in WA, St John of God Health Care and The University of Notre Dame Australia, whilst still fledgling research institutions, are demonstrating strong leadership by increasing their commitment to research across nursing, medical, surgical and mental health with the aim of improving patient outcomes, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Monterosso said during her oration. 2 ̆ 2 As researchers, our objective is not only to improve the outcomes for patients and their families, but to ensure they receive the best care possible. 2 ̆ 2 We are constantly reminded, and acutely aware, that patients have a right and expectation to receive the best evidence based care – that is; the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place. 2 ̆ 2 Nursing and midwifery research does make a difference. It changes practice and changes lives. As nurses and midwives, we must embrace our profession, change it, improve it and make our mark upon it. 2 ̆ 2 Students studying the Bachelor of Nursing course at Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s Fremantle Campus are required to undertake more than 400 hours of clinical practice each year in a variety of hospital, community and private health care settings under the guidance of registered professionals.
