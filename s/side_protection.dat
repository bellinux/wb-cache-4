500|$|Vanguards {{underwater}} protection was enhanced {{when she}} was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when Prince of Wales was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the [...] torpedo bulkhead. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to list and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system had a maximum depth of , but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends.

500|$|The {{design of}} the {{underwater}} protection on the Montanas was modeled on that of the North Carolina-class rather {{than that of the}} South Dakota and Iowa-classes. This was due to caisson tests in 1938 and 1939 that concluded that extending the main armor belt that tapers to the keel to act as one of the torpedo bulkheads had detrimental flooding effects due to the armor belt's excessive rigidity. The Montanas design had four torpedo bulkheads that would form a multi-layered <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system. Of the four compartments, the outer two would be liquid loaded in order to allow the bulkheads to elastically deform and absorb the energy of a torpedo detonation. The greater beam of the Montanas would allow a higher system depth of [...] compared to [...] of the North Carolinas.|$|E
500|$|The {{second and}} fifth test charges (8 and 13 June) were both placed near the fore main battery magazines.

Both broached the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system—allowing 1,008 and 726 long tons (1,024 and 738 t) of water, respectively, to enter the ship—showing that the usual three-compartment, all-void system used in most Japanese battleships was an insufficient defense against modern torpedoes. The list incurred during test two was a °16' change, resulting in a port list of °36'; for test five these numbers were °38' and a starboard list of °48'.|$|E

500|$|The {{underwater}} <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> {{had numerous}} faults, however. It was extremely strong amidships, but weakened on {{either end of}} the citadel. The underwater protection could only stop a [...] warhead in these areas. Another significant weakness in the design was the arrangement of the torpedo bulkhead. It was connected to the lower portion of the sloped deck, at an angle of 10°; two riveted angled bars held it in place. The bars were constantly under a great deal of stress, due to normal bending forces in the hull. When combined with the explosive force of a torpedo warhead, the bars could not sustain the increased pressure and could fail. Also, the beam of 30m meant that the protection system had to be weaker around the main battery turrets, as a significant amount of the hull space was taken up by the magazines and barbettes.|$|E
500|$|On 13 November, at 15:40, the sonar {{operator}} {{aboard the}} destroyer [...] detected an unidentified sound, but {{assumed it was}} the propellers of a nearby destroyer. One minute later, Ark Royal was struck amidships by a torpedo, between the fuel bunkers and bomb store, and directly below the bridge island. The explosion caused Ark Royal to shake, hurled loaded torpedo-bombers into the air, and killed Able Seaman Edward Mitchell. A [...] hole was created on the ship's bottom and on the starboard side below the water-line by the torpedo, which was judged to have run deep, striking the bilge keel where it detonated, inboard of the <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system. The hit caused flooding of the starboard boiler room, main switchboard, oil tanks, and over [...] of the ship's starboard bilge.

500|$|The <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> system {{incorporated}} five compartments {{divided by}} torpedo bulkheads {{and a large}} anti-torpedo bulge that {{ran the length of}} the [...] "armored raft". The outer two compartments, the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty, while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid. The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets. In these areas, the fifth compartment was deleted; instead, there was an outer empty compartment and two liquid-filled spaces, backed by another empty compartment. To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system, these sections received additional armor plating, up to [...] in thickness. The complete system was designed to withstand warheads of up to [...] of TNT. Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was [...] deep. The bottom layer was [...] thick and was kept filled with fluid, while the upper [...] thick layer was kept empty. The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated.|$|E
500|$|The {{thickest}} protection {{was reserved}} for the central citadel in all battleships. Some navies extended a thinner armoured belt and armoured deck to cover {{the ends of the}} ship, or extended a thinner armoured belt up the outside of the hull. This [...] "tapered" [...] armour was used by the major European navies—the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This arrangement gave some armour to a larger part of the ship; for the very first dreadnoughts, when high-explosive shellfire was still considered a significant threat, this was useful. It tended to result in the main belt being very short, only protecting a thin strip above the waterline; some navies found that when their dreadnoughts were heavily laden, the armoured belt was entirely submerged. The alternative was an [...] "all or nothing" [...] protection scheme, developed by the US Navy. The armour belt was tall and thick, but no <b>side</b> <b>protection</b> at all was provided {{to the ends of the}} ship or the upper decks. The armoured deck was also thickened.

It was supported by [...] thick slopes on either longitudinal side. The slopes connected to the lower edge of the main belt, an arrangement {{referred to as the}} [...] "turtle deck." [...] The slopes significantly increased armour protection in the critical areas of the ship. The ships' vitals were well armoured against any caliber shell fired by battleships at the time at ranges where the shell would have to penetrate both the main belt and the sloping deck. At very long ranges, however, the deck armour could be easily penetrated by heavy-caliber shells. All of these sections were composed of Wotan Hart (Wotan Hard) steel.

2500|$|The hull {{below the}} waterline, {{along the main}} armour belt, formed the <b>Side</b> <b>Protection</b> System (SPS). It was {{subdivided}} {{into a series of}} longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or void space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the pressure pulse over a larger area while the liquid contained any metal splinters that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining pressure pulse from the torpedo explosion. Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75inch (44mm) abreast of the magazines. This bulkhead formed the [...] "holding bulkhead" [...] and it was designed to resist the residual blast effects from the torpedo hit. If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces.|$|E
