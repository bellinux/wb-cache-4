40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} and compare suggested food portion sizes in UK schemes. Design: The study collated and compared suggested portion sizes from selected UK schemes intended both for general advice and weight-loss advice. Setting: Portion size schemes were included {{if they were}} relevant to the UK, provided actual portion size information, were intended for adults and were obtainable from the public domain in November 2010. Included schemes were from the food industry, non-governmental organisations and health-care pro-fessionals. Suggested portion sizes of foods occurring {{in at least one}} scheme for general advice and at least one scheme for weight loss were included. Own brand on-pack portion size labelling from a large UK-wide supermarket was added to represent portion size advice from UK food retailers. Subjects: Not applicable. Results: The suggested portion sizes in the weight-loss advice schemes were often concordant, as were the general advice schemes, except one general advice scheme from a non-governmental organisation which was more closely aligned with the portion sizes for weight loss. Overall there were substantial discrepancies between suggested portion sizes for muesli and crunchy breakfast cereals, rice, pasta and potatoes, meat, fish and pulses, whereas portion <b>sizes</b> for <b>cooked</b> vegetables, dried fruit, some breakfast cereals and cheese were broadly consistent. Conclusions: There is a lack of consistency in the portion sizes communicated to the public.

This study measured POP contents of 19 foods prepared by typical household baking and cooking methods using margarines without (control) and with 7. 5 % added PS (as 12. 5 % PS-esters, PS-margarine). Median POP contents per portion <b>size</b> of <b>cooked</b> foods were 0. 57 mg (range 0. 05 - 1. 11 mg) with control margarine versus 1. 42 mg (range 0. 08 - 20. 5 mg) with PS-margarine. The oxidation rate of PS (ORP) was 0. 50 % (median) with the PS-margarine and 3. 66 % with the control margarine. Using the PS-margarine, microwave-cooked codfish had the lowest POP content, with 0. 08 mg per portion, while shallow-fried potatoes had the highest POP content, 20. 5 mg per portion. Median POP contents in cookies, muffins, banana bread, and sponge cake baked with the control or PS-margarine were 0. 12 mg (range 0. 11 - 0. 21 mg) and 0. 24 mg (range 0. 19 - 0. 60 mg) per portion, with a corresponding ORP of 1. 38 % and 0. 06 %, respectively.

Ceramic is {{the primary source of}} income in the community and also is the primary source of lead (Pb). This study determined the amount of Pb consumed by community members based on portion <b>sizes</b> of <b>cooked</b> beans, a main food staple, for both adults and children. After collecting bean samples, performing a LeadCheck?? Swab on the pot that the beans were cooked and/or stored in, and conducting informal interviews with questions pertaining to the samples collected, the beans were chemically analyzed in the laboratory at San Diego State University. Pb levels in the beans ranged from 4. 15 - 47. 74 parts per million (ppm). The average consumption level for children, based on a mean portion size of 135. 6 g, was 2, 770 mg/Pb. The average consumption level for adults, based on a mean portion size of 283. 8 g, was 5, 470 mg/Pb. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for Pb of 25 mg of Pb per kilogram of body weight (mg/Pb/kg) per week or 3. 5 mg/Pb/kg per day. Based on a community average of bean consumption six times per week, the average child weighing 30 kg is ingesting 515 mg/Pb/kg per week or 74 mg/Pb/kg per day while the average adult weighing 75 kg is ingesting 431 mg/Pb/kg per week or 62 mg/Pb/kg per day. The results of this study emphasize the need for immediate behavior change as well as continued educational interventions in Santa Maria Atzompa...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSteam jet cooking {{has been}} used for years to prepare aqueous starch dispersions for food application. The steam jet cooking generates high shear stress to starch. The {{objective}} of this research is to study the effect of shear stress on structure of corn starch granules by steam jet cooking. A laboratory scale steam jet cooker has been established with flow rate about 1 L/min. Three kinds of corn starch, waxy, regular, and high amylose were used. Starch slurries (5 % w/w) were cooked by steam jet cooker at temperature 100 °C (SJ 100), 120 °C (SJ 120) and 135 °C (SJ 135) compared with hot water boiling at 90 °C 30 min (HB). The insoluble particles of cooked starches were investigated by particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and damage starch assay kit. There was a significant decrease in percent yield of insoluble particles of cooked dispersions for all starches in the order HB > SJ 100 > SJ 120 > SJ 135. The data also showed that SJ 100 has higher destruction than HB, although the temperature of heat treatment was similar. The particle <b>size</b> of <b>cooked</b> starches was much larger than uncooked starches, and the particle size of HB was larger than SJ 100 for all starches. This {{may be due to the}} time of cooking, 30 min for HB vs. a few sec for SJ 100. Percentage damaged starch of cooked dispersions for all starches became higher with increasing of cooking temperature. Although, the time of heat treatment was much shorter for SJ 100 than HB, the damaged starch was higher as well. Those date all revealed the effect of shear stress from steam cooking. On SEM observation, the damaged granules showed sponge like structure for the starch dispersions cooked by HB. The starches heated by steam jet cooking were fractured into small fragments...|$|R

Both {{physical and chemical}} assessment were done to assess the quality of meat. Organoleptically all the samples were in acceptable condition upto 120 days of storage time. The initial (30 days) DM, CP, EE and ash content, of the samples (g/ 100 g DM) were ranged from 81. 32 - 90. 00, 69. 00 - 80. 16, 2. 90 - 5. 23 and 15. 00 - 18. 01, respectively. The DM, CP and EE decreased and ash content increased with increasing storage time. At the end of 120 days of storage the DM, CP, EE and ash content of the samples (g/ 100 g DM) ranged from 79. 00 - 87. 36, 67. 24 - 77. 92, 1. 90 – 4. 00 and 19. 00 - 24. 70, respectively. DM and CP content in cooked meat was higher than non-cooked meat. However, cooked meat contains less EE and ash value than non-cooked meat.

40|$|The {{link between}} poultry animal {{production}} factors and poultry meat processing {{has not been}} studied in detail.   The effect of factors such as genotype, sex, age, diet and muscle type on meat processing capabilities such as post-mortem pH, soaked, cooked yield, texture and binding of whole and comminuted meat are reported here.   To determine the processing  capabilities of the meat, various methods were employed, including muscle fibre typing, microscopy and electrophoresis. The breast muscle was more suited to processing that the thigh, particularly with regards to texture.   Genotype was the most significant production factor for processing capabilities: broiler-type birds produced meat which gave higher soaked and cooked yields, was less tough and improved meat bind.   Generally, older animals produced meat less suitable for processing.   Diet {{had little effect on}} the processing capability of the meat. The addition of salt and phosphates to poultry meat had a more significant effect on processing behaviour than any animal production factor.   Phosphate increased the soaked and cooked yield, reduced toughness and increased meat bind.   Salt improved the processing performance more than phosphate.   Salt and phosphates added together improved processing performance more than either alone.   This synergistic result was independent of animal production factors. These findings indicate that muscle location, genotype and bird age are the most significant animal production factors.   Additionally, salt and phosphate affect the processing capability of meat more than any of the animal production factors.   Muscle fibre type has no affect on meat processing capability.   Microscopic observations suggest that protein dispersion, decrease in porosity and void <b>size</b> increased <b>cooked</b> yield and meat binding.   The electrophoresis results showed that actin and myosin are the two proteins most dispersed by the action of salt and phosphate.

The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups.

40|$|Occupational {{hearing loss}} {{resulting}} from noise exposures {{encountered in the}} workplace affects millions of workers and costs {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually in Workers’ Compensation costs in the United States alone. Some industries have been well studied, and the presence of hazardous noise in the work environment established and documented. The restaurant industry is one in which little current data exists, but in which there may be cause for concern. This work sought to quantify noise exposures for cooks, servers, and dishwashers and to determine whether or not any of these workers are at risk for Noise Induced Hearing Loss. Further, the researchers wanted to know what environmental factors present in the restaurants had the greatest impact on noise exposures for each exposure group. Statistical analysis was conducted on selected factors, and while nearly all were found to have significant effects on noise exposure for servers, only the number of minutes worked explained variance in exposures for cooks and dishwashers when all factors were included in analysis. These two groups are the ones most likely to be overexposed and they typically worked more than 480 minutes on the day the sample was collected. Efforts to control exposure must take these extended shifts into careful account. The study was limited by relatively small sample <b>size,</b> with 124 <b>cooks,</b> 119 servers, and 91 dishwashers employed at nine different restaurants participating. Future efforts to explain and characterize the sources of variation in noise exposure for these three groups should include greater numbers of participants and structure the data in a way that allows the effects of selected factors to be more clearly seen...|$|R
40|$|The body <b>size</b> {{of adult}} <b>Cook</b> Islanders on Rarotonga {{for the years}} 1952, 1966 and 1996 has been increasing. The rate of {{increase}} in stature of women aged 20 - 39 years was 0. 5 cm per decade across the period 1952 - 1966, and 0. 8 cm per decade for the period 1966 - 1996. The rate of increase of weight in the 20 - 29 years age group was 0. 6 kg per decade in period 1, and 7. 3 kg per decade in period 2. In the age group 30 - 39 years, the rates were 3. 2 kg per decade and 5. 1 kg per decade respectively. Changing food availability for the period 1961 - 2000 is used to compare estimates of dietary energy availability with estimates of physiological energy requirements. There has been reduced availability of traditional staples, a likely reduction in consumption of fish, increased consumption of meat, {{and a decline in}} the availability of dietary fats and oils. Daily per capita energy intakes in 1952 and 1966 greatly exceed an hypothetical physiological maximum value for energy expenditure, suggesting a large positive energy balance in 1952 and an even greater one in 1966, both predisposing to weight gain. Although daily per capita energy availability in 1996 is similar to the hypothetical physiological maximum value for energy expenditure, it exceeds the measured level of energy expenditure at that time. It is speculated that excessive energy intake relative to requirement is more likely to predispose to positive energy balance and weight gain than decline in energy expenditure, although to a lower extent than in 1966 and 1952.

40|$|In the whisky {{industry}} {{there is}} {{a balance between the}} desire to adhere to the traditional production process and the desire to increase profit margins. One solution that follows both stipulations is to increase the alcohol yield of a given batch of whisky. This can be achieved by utilizing high total fermentable corn which has a higher concentration of fermentable starches than other corn. HTF corn has the potential for a greater final ethanol yield. By simply using a higher quality of raw materials, the integrity of the process is maintained while allowing for an increase in output. Ten strains of HTF corn (35 D 28, 35 Y 33, 34 M 94, 32 K 33, 34 P 88, 33 A 84, 34 H 31, 31 G 66, 33 N 56, and 34 A 15) and four strains of control corn (33 N 09, 32 W 86, 33 M 54, and 34 D 71) were tested for mash pH, sugar content by mass (balling), conversion of starch to sugar, conversion of sugar to ethanol, and alcohol content by volume (ABV). Ten trials were performed using HTF corn, yielding 60 fermentations; 18 trials were performed using control corn, yielding 158 fermentations. Each trial yielded five to nine fermentations depending on the <b>size</b> of the <b>cooks.</b> Due to contamination from an unknown source, only 44 HTF and 41 control fermentations were clean and, therefore, were used to establish the most significant trends. For a 99 % confidence level, a clean HTF fermentation yielded 9. 69 % ± 0. 14 % ABV and a clean control fermentation yielded 9. 34 % ± 0. 08 % ABV. From these values it was determined that the HTF corn provides a 3. 6 % increase in alcohol yield over control corn. This indicates that the HTF corn may provide an advantage over the control corn when moved to an industrial scale. When the strains of corn were compared on an individual basis, HTF strain 32 K 22 appeared to be the strain of choice for whisky production at this preliminary stage. Strain 32 K 22 provided for the highest levels of conversion of both starch and sugar, at 97. 6 % and 98. 3 % respectively, and it produced the highest alcohol content of any strain at 10. 42 % ABV. The 32 K 22 strain achieved an overall conversion of starch to ethanol of 95. 9 % which is significantly higher than the average overall conversion for the control corn, 88. 5 %...|$|R
