These cell lines overproduce a membrane protein, the P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by a member(s) of a multigene family, termed mdr or pgp. The amino acid sequence of the P-glycoprotein predicts an energy-dependent transport protein with homology to a large superfamily of proteins which transport a wide variety of substances. This report describes the isolation and characterization of two Drosophila homologs of the mammalian mdr gene.

40|$|Abstract. The multi-pass welding generates {{residual}} stress which may change fatigue {{crack growth rate}} and impair the lifetime of nuclear welded structures. In this paper, we performed fatigue test with notched specimens and evaluate the effect of {{residual stress}} on fatigue crack growth rate of welds. In order to identify the magnitude of residual stress, the residual stress was measured by HDM (hole drilling method) and residual stress analysis was performed by using FEM (finite element method). In order to review the effect of residual stress on fatigue crack growth rate, the fatigue crack growth analysis was also performed to determine the fatigue crack growth curves by using FEM and ASME B&PV Code, <b>Sec.</b> XI, <b>App.</b> A.

40|$|We {{classify}} 2 -center extremal {{black hole}} charge configurations through duality-invariant homogeneous polynomials, {{which are the}} generalization of the unique invariant quartic polynomial for single-center black holes based on homogeneous symmetric cubic special Kaehler geometries. A crucial role is played by an horizontal SL(p,R) symmetry group, which classifies invariants for p-center black holes. For p = 2, a (spin 2) quintet of quartic invariants emerge. We provide the minimal set of independent invariants for the rank- 3 N = 2, d = 4 stu model, and for its lower-rank descendants, namely the rank- 2 st^ 2 and rank- 1 t^ 3 models; these models respectively exhibit seven, six and five independent invariants. We also derive the polynomial relations among these and other duality invariants. In particular, the symplectic product of two charge vectors is not independent from the quartic quintet in the t^ 3 model, but rather it satisfies a degree- 16 relation, corresponding to a quartic equation for {{the square of the}} symplectic product itself.

There is a dual description via conformal field theory, which in the special case of W=x^d is an N= 2 minimal model, and which also {{gives rise to a}} monoidal category describing defect lines.

40|$|An {{expansion}} for quantum {{statistical mechanics}} is derived that gives classical statistical mechanics {{as the leading}} term. Each quantum correction comes from successively larger permutation loops, which arise from the factorization of the symmetrization of the wave function with respect to localized particle interchange. Explicit application of the theory yields the full fugacity expansion for the quantum ideal gas, and the second fugacity coefficient for interacting quantum particles, which agree with known results. Compared to the Lee-Yang virial cluster expansion, the present expansion {{is expected to be}} more rapidly converging and the individual terms appear to be simpler to evaluate.

40|$|The Stokes {{multipliers}} in {{the matrix}} models are invariants in the string-theory moduli space {{and related to}} the D-instanton chemical potentials. They not only represent non-perturbative information but also {{play an important role}} in connecting various perturbative string theories in the moduli space. They are a key concept to the non-perturbative completion of string theory and also expected to imply some remnant of strong coupling dynamics in M theory. In this paper, we investigate the non-perturbative completion problem consisting of two constraints on the Stokes multipliers. As the first constraint, Stokes phenomena which realize the multi-cut geometry are studied in the Z_k symmetric critical points of the multi-cut two-matrix models. Sequence of solutions to the constraints are obtained in general k-cut critical points. A discrete set of solutions and a continuum set of solutions are explicitly shown, and they can be classified by several constrained configurations of the Young diagram. As the second constraint, we discuss non-perturbative stability of backgrounds in terms of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. In particular, our procedure in the 2 -cut (1, 2) case (pure-supergravity case) completely fixes the D-instanton chemical potentials and results in the Hastings-McLeod solution to the Painlevé II equation. It is also stressed that the Riemann-Hilbert approach realizes an off-shell background independent formulation of non-critical string theory.

The renormalization calculation is performed in the on-shell scheme improved by using the pinch technique to eliminate the gauge dependence in the renormalized couplings. We first review the pinch technique for scalar boson two-point functions in the Standard Model (SM), the HSM and the THDMs. We then discuss {{the difference in the}} results of the renormalized Higgs boson couplings between the improved on-shell scheme and the ordinal one with a gauge dependence appearing in mixing parameters of scalar bosons.

40|$|The signal {{recognition}} particle (SRP) plays {{a pivotal role}} in transporting proteins to cell membranes. In higher eukaryotes, SRP consists of an RNA molecule and six proteins. The largest of the SRP proteins, SRP 72, was found previously to bind to the SRP RNA. A fragment of human SRP 72 (72 c′) bound effectively to human SRP RNA but only weakly to the similar SRP RNA of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii. Chimeras between the human and M. jannaschii SRP RNAs were constructed and used as substrates for 72 c′. SRP RNA helical section 5 e contained the 72 c′ binding site. Systematic alteration within 5 e revealed that the A 240 G and A 240 C changes dramatically reduced the binding of 72 c′. Human SRP RNA with a single A 240 G change was unable to form a complex with full-length human SRP 72. Two small RNA fragments, one composed of helical <b>section</b> 5 <b>ef,</b> the other of section 5 e, competed equally well for the binding of 72 c′, demonstrating that no other regions of the SRPR RNA were required.
