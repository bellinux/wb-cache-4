5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for {{the exploration of the}} series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States. A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Menendez, Dan Burton, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and Rick Lazio, lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the explosion, even before the Kremlin had been informed of the submarine's sinking, U.S. National Security Adviser <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> and Defense Secretary William Cohen were told that Kursk had sunk. Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence rescue vehicles, but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance. Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev told the American Embassy that the rescue was well under way. The Russian Navy told reporters that a rescue was imminent.|$|E

25|$|In August 1996, American hedge-fund manager Mansoor Ijaz {{traveled}} to the Sudan and met with senior officials including Turabi and Bashir. Ijaz asked Sudanese officials to share intelligence data with US officials on bin Laden and other Islamists who had {{traveled to}} and from the Sudan during the previous five years. Ijaz conveyed his findings to US officials upon his return, including <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and argued for the US to constructively engage the Sudanese and other Islamic countries. In April 1997, Ijaz persuaded Bashir to make an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance {{in the form of a}} signed presidential letter that Ijaz delivered to Congressman Lee H. Hamilton by hand.|$|E
500|$|Ijaz {{first met}} Sudanese {{president}} Omar al-Bashir and other Sudanese leaders in August 1996 and reported his findings back to U.S. government officials, including Lee Hamilton, ranking {{member of the}} House Committee on International Relations at the time, and <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and Susan Rice, then director for African Affairs at the National Security Council. Initially, Khartoum sought U.S. sanctions relief, particularly for its growing oil sector, in return for access to its intelligence data on Al Qaeda's nascent network and bin Laden's activities there. However, the sanctions continued until U.S. officials exempted some in unrelated policy decisions that benefited U.S. oil companies. Ijaz then argued that Washington should adopt a policy of [...] "constructive engagement" [...] with Khartoum vis-a-vis economic development and political reconciliation in return for Sudanese counterterrorism cooperation.|$|E
500|$|Ijaz {{also used}} his {{fundraising}} results to advance his causes in Congress, appearing {{as an expert}} witness in front of committees in the Senate on extremist threats faced by the United States [...] and in the House of Representatives to advocate for Washington to adopt a policy of [...] "constructive engagement" [...] with rogue Muslim countries affected by U.S. sanctions. As Ijaz' prominence in Democratic Party circles increased, allegations of conflicts with his business interests also surfaced, although they were never proven. In {{the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, Ijaz had a public falling out with senior Clinton-era officials, including the former president, <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> and Susan Rice, over what he deemed were failures in their counterterrorism policies during Clinton's two terms in office. In 2007, Nevada Republicans approached Ijaz to run against Sen. Harry Reid, in a bid to unseat the Senate Majority Leader, but Ijaz declined.|$|E
500|$|National Security Advisor <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
500|$|In February 1997, a United States {{immigration}} {{court judge}} granted asylum to a German Scientologist who claimed {{she would be}} subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In April 1997, John Travolta met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia. Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would [...] "really love to help" [...] with the [...] "issue over in Germany with Scientology". According to Travolta, Clinton recalled that [...] "he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it", stating that Scientologists [...] "were given an unfair hand in [...] and that he wanted to fix it". In September 1997, John Travolta, Chick Corea and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, also known as the Helsinki Commission), voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, and had a briefing with United States National Security Advisor <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> whom Clinton had assigned to be [...] "the administration's Scientology point person". The German ambassador responded with a letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had {{come to the conclusion that}} Scientology's [...] "pseudo-scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members", adding that [...] "membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency, to financial ruin, and even to suicide. In addition, there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany's basic political principles." ...|$|E

Talbott reveals in his book Engaging India: Diplomacy, Democracy and the Bomb that India and Pakistan came very close to a nuclear war in 1999. [...] According to Talbott, before Clinton met with Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif in 1999 to discuss the issue, US national security adviser <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> told Clinton that he could be heading into [...] "the single most important meeting with a foreign leader of his entire presidency".|$|E

50|$|Clarke's book Against All Enemies is also {{a crucial}} {{complement}} to the September 11 panel's failure to condemn Mr. Clinton's failure to capture or kill bin Laden {{on any of the}} eight to 10 chances afforded by CIA reporting. Mr. Clarke never mentions that President Bush had no chances to kill bin Laden before September 11 and leaves readers with the false impression that he, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> did their best to end the bin Laden threat. That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick Clarke, Bill Clinton and <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.|$|E

50|$|The {{main source}} of the {{controversy}} stems from portions of the film concerned with the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Critics say that certain dramatized scenes tend to suggest that blame for the events that took place on September 11, 2001 lies with Clinton and his cabinet. One example cited is {{a scene in which}} then National Security Advisor, <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger,</b> does not approve of the order to take out a surrounded Osama bin Laden and tells the squad in Afghanistan that they will have to do the job without official authorization and then hangs up the phone. According to <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> and others - including conservative author and Clinton critic Richard Miniter - this never happened. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh has now admitted that the abrupt hang-up was not in the script and was improvised.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreign policy}} of the Bill Clinton {{administration}} was the {{foreign policy of}} the United States from 1993 to 2001 under the Administration of President Bill Clinton.

5000|$|Critics claim many {{inaccuracies}} in the film, {{including the}} depiction of the Clinton administration. For example in one scene, former National Security Advisor <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> is portrayed as unwilling to approve a plan {{to take out a}} surrounded Osama bin Laden. He leaves it to former CIA Director George Tenet to decide if he will take responsibility. In the original version of the film, Berger hangs up the phone on Tenet, and Tenet calls off the operation. No reliable verification of this event has ever been discovered. In fact, even Richard Miniter [...] - [...] a conservative author and critic of the Clinton administration [...] - [...] was quoted as saying [...] "The idea that someone had bin Laden in his sights in 1998 or any other time and <b>Sandy</b> <b>Berger</b> refused to pull the trigger, thereâ€™s zero factual basis for that." ...|$|E
