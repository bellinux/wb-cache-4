5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail <b>shiner,</b> the rosyface <b>shiner,</b> the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Project 86 {{announced}} that Alex Albert had parted {{with the band}} on friendly terms to pursue other interests. Instead of searching for a full-time replacement, the band recruited Jason Gerken, formerly of <b>Shiner,</b> to play drums on the record. Production of their sixth album, entitled Rival Factions, followed suit with Deftones engineer Ulrich Wild.

50|$|Spottail <b>shiners</b> are {{currently}} listed as of least concern. These <b>shiners</b> are not vulnerable {{in the wild}} yet. The primary causes for death is being preyed upon, pollution of their natural habitat, and parasites. Minnows are used as bait for game fishing. These <b>shiners</b> are caught and used as bait fish throughout the area they occupy. They {{are one of the}} most popular minnow used to lure walleyes. Their shiny scales and small bodies attract specific species of game fish that anglers frequently try to catch. Currently there are conservation agencies at the state-level protecting these <b>shiners</b> from being harvested for fish bait. Pollution of many different toxic chemicals into the areas that these <b>shiners</b> live is one of the main causes of death. It is found that water pollution from wastewater and runoff affect the immune system of spottail <b>shiners.</b> There are certain parasites that also affect the life of these <b>shiners.</b> The parasites are also found to affect the immune system in spottail <b>shiners.</b>|$|R

5|$|Former Giants {{teammates}} Terry and Frankie Frisch {{joined the}} Veterans Committee in 1967 and aided {{the elections of}} several of their former teammates, including Youngs in 1972.

Youngs is {{the only member of}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame from San Antonio and was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. <b>Shiner,</b> the town in which Youngs was born, hosted a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Norton played Mike <b>Shiner,</b> a prickly Broadway {{actor in}} the black comedy film Birdman and was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role. On February 20, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Norton was directing Motherless Brooklyn. In June 2014, Norton's Class 5 Films and RatPac Entertainment acquired the film rights to the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Major Frederick Russell Burnham, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotami into the Louisiana bayous and persuade Americans to eat them. The film highlights the rivalry between Burnham and Duquesne, two famous spies who had been under orders to assassinate each other. Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner were to produce this feature film.|$|E

5000|$|Scarlet <b>shiners</b> live in subtropical, benthopelagic {{freshwater}} environments. Scarlet <b>shiners</b> {{thrive in}} waterways that have clear water, {{and they tend}} to occupy the higher gradient streams with coarser substrates. Typically, the scarlet <b>shiner's</b> habitat is situated around the Ohio River basin, but they range down as far as Eagle Creek in Kentucky. The species can be found specifically in the southwestern part of Ohio down to the Scioto River and westward, reaching the Little River basin in Tennessee then connecting to the Tennessee River to flow down into the northern most parts of Alabama and some areas within West Virginia and Virginia. [...] Scarlet <b>shiners</b> have also been thought to be introduced in certain waterways in Ohio, such as the Ohio River basin to the Muskingum River drainage. Other areas where one may encounter scarlet <b>shiners</b> are in the Cumberland drainages in Kentucky and Tennessee along with the ones in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia.|$|R
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside <b>shiner,</b> sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

40|$|Student paper, BIOL 3811, 2011 Blacknose <b>shiners</b> (Notropis heterolepis) have {{developed}} {{many ways to}} detect predators and ways to react to avoid detection themselves. We wished to determine {{the ways in which}} blacknose <b>shiners</b> react to two such detection strategies: visual and chemical. Prey fish such as <b>shiners</b> can chemically detect predator fish through kairomones. These chemicals allow prey fish to detect a predator at a greater distance than vision alone would allow. We found no significant response in blacknose <b>shiners</b> to a visual stimulus of predator perch or from kairomones from perch. However, a trend in reduction of activity was detectable from the kairomone stimulus. This trend further supports evidence that kairomones are used as a fish’s primary detection technique of predators as opposed to visual cues...|$|R
