50|$|J.V. Wigle (1890 - 1970), a {{combustion}} engineer from Michigan {{and laboratory}} assistant at Eastern Michigan State, met a local woman, Mattie Lawson, {{and settled down}} in Pikeville. He first brought electricity to town when he electrified the house where he lived near the corner of Poplar and Wiegle streets (Wiegle Street, named after J.V. Wigle, is misspelled). In addition to bringing electricity to Pikeville, Wigle bottled Coca-Cola and made wrought iron railings in the community. He was granted two U.S. patents in 1931 (1,798,289 & 1,814,535) for a coin <b>selecting</b> <b>device</b> and a braking mechanism. His two sons attended the engineering school at Vanderbilt University. His son Tom (1933 - 2006) helped build U.S. Route 127 heading north out of town as it rises up the mountain near the county line, during a summer job between semesters at Vanderbilt. Wigle is buried {{with his wife in}} Pikeville City Cemetery in the family plot, along with Tom Wigle.|$|E

40|$|This letter investigates a new <b>select</b> <b>device</b> disturb {{phenomenon}} in TANOS NAND flash memories. Since NAND string <b>select</b> <b>devices</b> contain the same charge trap (CT) stack as the memory cells, they are, in principle, programmable. We observe a select threshold voltage increase during cycling {{of the cell}} array. This disturb is caused by electron injection from the outermost wordline into the CT layer of the <b>select</b> <b>devices</b> under the erase condition. The increasing select threshold voltage leads to a reduced string current and, finally, to read fails of the NAND string. The mechanism is evaluated by means of electrical measurements and field simulations. Several options to overcome this issue are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Memristive device based passive {{crossbar}} arrays hold a {{great promise}} for high-density and non-volatile memories. A significant challenge of ultra-high density integration of these crossbars is unwanted sneak-path currents. The most common way of addressing this issue today is an integrated or external <b>selecting</b> <b>device</b> to block unwanted current paths. In this paper, {{we use a}} memristive device with intrinsic rectifying behavior to suppress sneak-path currents in the crossbar. We systematically evaluate the read operation performance of large-scale crossbar arrays with regard to read margin and power consumption for different crossbar sizes, nanowire interconnect resistances, ON and OFF resistances, rectification ratios under different read-schemes. Outcomes of this study allow improved understanding of the trade-off between read margin, power consumption and read-schemes. Most importantly, this study provides a guideline for circuit designers to improve the performance of oxide-based resistive memory (RRAM) based cross-point arrays. Overall, self-rectifying behavior of the memristive device efficiently improves the read operation performance of large-scale selectorless cross-point arrays...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{dielectric}} {{environment on}} phase resonance in compound grating are investigated theoretically and numerically. Transmission characteristics can be effectively tailored {{by changing the}} dielectric environment. When the dielectric constants between the two slits are slightly different, the transmission spectra show obvious dips for all modes, {{and values of the}} dips are near to zero, and photon forbidden band gaps emerge with larger difference of dielectric environment. The corresponding physical mechanisms are discussed by means of effective refractive index and effective length based on F-P-like and phase resonant mechanisms. In addition, the electric field for the peak at the shorter wavelength of the dip is mainly concentrated on the slit filled with smaller dielectric constant, while the electric field located on the slit filled with larger dielectric constant for the peak at the longer wavelength of the dip. By selecting a proper dielectric environment, the channel <b>selecting</b> <b>device</b> can be constructed by using the dielectric compound grating...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of {{neighbour}} discovery on distributed learning schemes applied on optimal network selection based on the acquisition by the <b>selecting</b> <b>device</b> of context information on the capabilities and status of surrounding networks. The work introduces the problem of neighbour discovery in multiple channel and cognitive networks, and identifies the trade-offs between neighbour discovery performance and overall network performance. Next, an optimal network selection algorithm based on distributed learning is introduced, and key parameters and components relevant to its operation are presented, focusing in particular on the common control channel required to exchange the context information. Finally, the paper discusses the relation between neighbour discovery and the distributed learning process at {{the basis of the}} context information acquisition; a model for mapping the learning process on a neighbour discovery problem is proposed, and the potential impact of neighbour discovery failures on the performance of the optimal network selection scheme is discussed. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E
