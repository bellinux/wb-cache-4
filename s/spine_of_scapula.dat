50|$|The deltoid {{originates}} on {{the lateral}} {{third of the}} clavicle, acromion and the crest <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> It is inserted on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction of the shoulder. The supraspinatus also originates on the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of the shoulder.|$|R

30|$|If we {{remember}} {{the possibility of}} fracture or pseudo-arthrosis <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> and look for it on the roentgenograms, we do not miss the diagnosis. It is a rare fracture type, {{but we should not}} forget that it can be a reason of painful shoulder function for years. In order to prevent delayed or missed diagnosis <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> just a simple roentgenogram and focusing on the scapula is enough.|$|R

30|$|For painful pseudo-arthrosis <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> {{which is}} seen very rarely, {{operative}} treatment is indicated [12]. The few {{reported cases of}} pseudo-arthrosis <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> were treated by resection of the fibrous tissue, bone grafting of the fracture site and rigid fixation [1, 11]. In some cases, compression of the pseudo-arthrosis was established with one cancellous lag screw, without exposure, debriding or grafting. The screw was placed eccentrically to {{the upper part of}} the pseudo-arthrosis site, and this position resulted in a superior tilt of the acromion which made the impingement syndrome disappear [1].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Dislocation of the {{shoulder}} is the commonest of all large joint dislocations. Inferior dislocation constitutes 0. 5 % of all shoulder dislocations. It characteristically presents with overhead abduction of the arm, the humerus being parallel to the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>scapula.</b> We present an unusual case of recurrent luxatio erecta in which the arm transformed later into an adducted position resembling the more common anterior shoulder dislocation. Such a case has not been described before in English literature. Closed reduction by the two-step maneuver was successful with a single attempt. MRI revealed posterior labral tear and a Hill-Sachs variant lesion on the superolateral aspect of humeral head. Immobilisation in a chest-arm bandage followed by physiotherapy yielded excellent results. The case is first of its kind; the unusual mechanism, unique radiological findings and alternate method of treatment are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Herein {{we report}} {{a case of}} primary Hodgkin's lym-phoma (HL) of the scapula {{presented}} with shoulder pain. A 24 -year-old young and healthy man presented with left shoulder pain and swelling. There {{was no evidence of}} weight loss, sweating, fever or any sys-temic symptoms. Laboratory evaluation was normal except for mild leukocytosis. C-reactive protein was negative and erythrocyte sedimentation was normal. Physical examination showed mild shoulder limitation of motion secondary to pain and swelling due to ill-defined mass. No pe-ripheral lymphadenopathy was detected despite of thorough examination of the whole body. Plain X-ray showed an osteolytic lesion in the scapula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse abnormal signal in the scapula and the coracoid process. There were soft tissue masses on both sides of <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> <b>scapula</b> indicating origin from the bone. Head of hu-merus was unremarkable (Figure 1). With the radio-logic differential diagnoses of neoplastic process, the patient underwent open surgery to obtain an excision-al biopsy. Pathologic examination of the biopsy showed diffuse infiltration of polymorphic population of hematopoietic cells composed of eosinophils, plas-ma cells, lymphocytes, PMN leukocytes and foamy histiocytes. There were many isolated mono and binu-cleated large Reed-Sternberg cells which were reactive with CD 15, CD 30 and Pax- 5, but nonreactive wit...|$|E

Symptoms of impingement regressed, and he had a pain-free arc of motion.|$|R
5000|$|In human anatomy, the {{trapezius}} (...) {{is one of}} {{two large}} superficial muscles that extend longitudinally from the occipital bone to the lower thoracic vertebrae and laterally to the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade). Its functions are to move the scapulae and support the arm.|$|R
50|$|A stout {{and short}} muscle lying {{posterior}} to the acromiodeltoid. It lies along the lower border <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> and {{it passes through}} the upper arm, across {{the upper end of}} muscles of the upper arm. It originates at the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> and inserts at the deltoid ridge. Its action is to raise and rotate the humerus outward.|$|R
25|$|The back <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> (also {{called the}} dorsal or {{posterior}} surface) is arched from above downward, and is subdivided into two unequal parts by the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> The portion above the spine {{is called the}} supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa. The two fossae are connected by the spinoglenoid notch, situated lateral to the root <b>of</b> the <b>spine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{supraspinatus}} (plural supraspinati, from Latin supraspinatus) is {{a relatively}} small muscle of the upper back that runs from the supraspinatous fossa superior portion <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> (shoulder blade) to the greater tubercle of the humerus. It {{is one of the}} four rotator cuff muscles and also abducts the arm at the shoulder. The <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> separates the supraspinatus muscle from the infraspinatus muscle, which originates below the spine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suprascapular artery}} {{branches}} {{off from the}} thyrocervical trunk, which in turn arises from {{the first part of}} the subclavian artery. This suprascapular artery crosses over the suprascapular ligament, passes through the supraspinous fossa and turns around the lateral border <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> and supplies the infraspinous fossa as far as the inferior angle.|$|R
30|$|Injuries to the {{thoracic}} cage and soft tissues around the shoulder girdle are common and {{may lead to}} a delayed diagnosis of the scapular fracture. In this case report, we present a late-diagnosed scapular spine fracture, which has been treated conservatively for soft tissue injury and later operated for rotator cuff tear without the diagnosis of pseudo-arthrosis <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
50|$|The middle fibers, or {{transverse}} of the trapezius {{arise from}} the spinous process of the seventh cervical (both {{in the back of}} the neck), and the spinous processes of the first, second, and third thoracic vertebrae.

30|$|Finally, the levator scapulae muscle {{reattached}} to the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> Redivac drain size 14.0 {{was inserted}} under the subcutaneous tissue at the region <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> The wound was then closed in layers. Postoperative treatment consisted of {{application of a}} broad arm sling for 4  weeks, followed by a range of movement exercise to the shoulder girdle for 4  weeks. Cases of bilateral deformity were operated on 6  months after the operation on the other scapula.|$|R
30|$|Four {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to identify or to discuss the mechanism of avulsions [3 – 5, 12]. Heyse-Moore et al. [3] {{were not able to}} describe a specific mechanism for avulsions of the superior border <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> However, their 7 cases did not involve a scapular <b>spine</b> avulsion. Avulsions <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> can be due to sudden forceful contraction of the SS or the omohyoid muscle; the latter was reported in 3 papers [5, 11, 12]. However, none of these papers mention avulsions due to SS force, as in our case.|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the resting position <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> forms part <b>of</b> the examination of upper quadrant posture. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if surface palpation is a valid indicator of actual scapular position. Twelve embalmed shoulders were examined and the actual location of three bony scapular landmarks and three bony thoracic landmarks were compared with surface palpation of these locations. The results, based on the upper value for a distance (with 95 % confidence), suggested that the difference between the surface location of the root <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> the acromial angle and the inferior angle would be less than 0. 67 cm, 0. 98 cm and 0. 46 cm respectively from the centre of the bony locations. The difference between the twelfth thoracic spinous process (SP), the SP corresponding with the root <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> and the SP corresponding with the inferior angle and the surface points would be 1. 46 cm, 1. 09 cm and 1. 01 cm respectively. The results of this study suggest that surface palpation of scapular location is a valid method for determining the actual location <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> The findings also suggest that surface palpation can determine the location of thoracic landmarks, which may serve as reference points for scapular position...|$|R
50|$|The fibers {{converge}} to a tendon, which glides {{over the}} lateral border <b>of</b> the <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> and, passing across the posterior {{part of the}} capsule of the shoulder-joint, is inserted into the middle impression on the greater tubercle of the humerus.The trapezoidal insertion of the infraspinatus onto the humerus is {{much larger than the}} equivalent insertion of the supraspinatus, the reason why the infraspinatus is involved in rotator cuff tears about as frequently as the supraspinatus.|$|R

25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach to the surface <b>of</b> the <b>scapula</b> and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> infraglenoid tubercle <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> and <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b> These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation <b>of</b> the <b>scapula,</b> consists <b>of</b> the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders <b>of</b> the <b>scapula.</b>|$|R
