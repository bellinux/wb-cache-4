40|$|International audienceThe {{fundamental}} property {{which often}} dictates {{the performance of}} a coating is its adhesion to the substrate and thus there are many techniques to measure adhesion. The choice of methods is dependent on many factors such as mechanical properties of the coating and substrate, the interface properties, the microstructure of the coating/substrate system, residual stress, coating thickness and the intended application. Most tests aim to introduce a stable interfacial crack and make it propagate under controlled conditions and model this process to determine adhesion. The corresponding models are either stress analysis based or energy-based. With the advent of miniature systems and very thin functional coatings, {{there is a need for}} characterization of adhesion at small length scales and some specific tests have been developed which are not appropriate for thicker coatings. Among these, indentation and scratch methods have the widest range of applicability but it is necessary to analyze the failure mechanisms before choosing an appropriate model to extract adhesion parameters.

The size and concentration of environmentally relevant inorganic particles in a tissue sample can be determined by a procedure consisting of matrix digestion, particle recovery by centrifugation, size separation by sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF), and detection by light scattering. Background Laboratory nanoparticles that have been labeled by fluorescence, radioactivity, or rare elements have provided important information regarding nanoparticle uptake and translocation, but most nanomaterials that are commercially produced for industrial and consumer applications do not contain a specific label. Methods Both nitric acid digestion and enzyme digestion were tested with liver and lung tissue {{as well as with}} cultured cells.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis targets the analysis and implementation of multi-criteria performance prediction methods for System-on-Chips (SoC). These new SoC architectures offer the opportunity to integrate complete heterogeneous systems into a single chip {{and can be used}} to design battery powered handhelds, security critical systems, consumer electronics devices, etc. However, this variety in terms of application usually comes with a lot of different performance objectives like power consumption, yield, design cost, production cost, silicon area and many others. These performance requirements are often very difficult to meet together so that SoC design usually relies on making the right design choices and finding the best performance compromises. In parallel with this architectural paradigm shift, new Very Deep <b>Submicron</b> (VDSM) <b>silicon</b> processes have more and more impact on the performances and deeply modify the way a VLSI system is designed even at the first stages of a design flow. In such a context where many new technological and system related variables enter the game, early exploration of the impact of design choices becomes crucial to estimate the performance of the system to design and reduce its time-to-market. In this context, this thesis presents: - A study of state-of-the-art tools and methods used to estimate the performances of VLSI systems and an original classification based on several features and concepts that they use. Based on this comparison, we highlight their weaknesses and lacks to identify new opportunities in performance prediction. - The definition of new concepts to enable the automatic exploration of large design spaces based on flexible performance criteria and degrees of freedom representing design choices. - The implementation of a couple of two new tools of our own: - Nessie, a tool enabling hierarchical representation of an application along with its platform and automatically performs the mapping and the estimation of their performance. -Yeti, a C++ library enabling the defintion and value estimation of closed-formed expressions and table-based relations. It provides the user with input and model sensitivity analysis capability, simulation scripting, run-time building and automatic plotting of the results. Additionally, Yeti can work in standalone mode to provide the user with an independent framework for model estimation and analysis. To demonstrate the use and interest of these tools, we provide in this thesis several case studies whose results are discussed and compared with the literature. Using Yeti, we successfully reproduced the results of a model estimating multi-core computation power and extended them thanks to the representation flexibility of our tool. We also built several models from the ground up to help the dimensioning of interconnect links and clock frequency optimization. Thanks to Nessie, we were able to reproduce the NoC power consumption results of an H. 264 /AVC decoding application running on a multicore platform. These results were then extended to the case of a 3 D die stacked architecture and the performance benefits are then discussed. We end up by highlighting the advantages of our technique and discuss future opportunities for performance prediction tools to explore.

40|$|In {{classical}} elasticity, geometric {{dependence of}} the rigidities can be normalized and the normalized rigidities are size independent. Recent experimental observations showed significant elastic size effect in normalized bending rigidity in micron scale epoxy beams. Size effect in elastic behaviors can be described by surface stress theories and strain gradient elasticity theories. Surface effect on elastic properties is significant in nanometer scale, but recognized to be negligible in micron scale. The observed size effect in micron sized epoxy beams was found to agree with strain gradient elastic models. Besides epoxy films, effort is underway to characterize strain gradient behaviors in other material systems. Silicon nitride thin film is a widely used film in MEMS. Comprehensive understanding of the elastic deformation behaviors of silicon nitride thin films is essential for design and analysis of MEMS structures. In this thesis, <b>submicron</b> thick LPCVD <b>silicon</b> nitride thin films were fabricated. XPS and XRD {{analyses were conducted to}} determine elemental and micro-structural consistency of the as-fabricated thin films. XPS analyses showed element compositions were similar in films with different thicknesses. However, XRD analyses revealed that films had different crystalline phase fractions. Cantilever beams were fabricated from the films and elastic bending tests on the beams were conducted using nanoindenter to investigate the elastic bending behaviors of the films as a function of thickness. Analyses showed that beams with different thickness had fluctuating normalized bending rigidities. The fluctuations of normalized bending rigidities maybe related to varying crystalline phase fractions in the thin films. The beams were annealed and bending tests were conducted to investigate possible correlation between normalized bending rigidity fluctuations and crystalline phase fractions. Bending tests results showed similar level of fluctuations in normalized bending rigidities before and after annealing while XRD results of the annealed films showed increase in crystalline phase fractions for all thicknesses. This suggested crystalline phase fraction cannot be correlated with the fluctuations in normalized bending rigidities of the beams. Error analyses of experiment setup, geometries of the beams and data analysis were conducted. The fluctuations in normalized bending rigidity in different thickness were within the error range. While LPCVD silicon nitride may have size dependence in the nanometer scale, size dependence of normalized bending rigidity of LPCVD silicon nitride appears to be insignificant in submicron scale.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for simulating carrier transport in semiconductor devices is proposed and demonstrated.

These larger waveguides feature easier fabrication, higher reliability and better interfacing to optical fibres.

Hence, the main limitation in increasing the level of integration and in reducing the cost of micron-scale waveguide circuits is their mm- to cm-scale minimum bending radius. Fortunately, single-mode rib waveguides with a micron-scale silicon core can be locally transformed into multi-mode strip waveguides that have very high lateral index contrast.

Optical micrograph of the deposit cross-section revealed that the particles incorporation was uniform throughout the thickness of the coating. Phase transformation behavior studied by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) indicates that the particle incorporation had not influenced the crystallization temperature of the composite coatings. Presence of metastable phases like NiP 2 and Ni 5 P 4 were observed for both coatings annealed at crystallization temperature. Increase in grain size of the deposits from 1. 2 nm to 21 nm was also observed due to the annealing at crystallization temperature. Microhardness measurements made on the as-deposited and annealed (400 degrees C) cross-sectional coatings showed that there was about 10 % and 22 % increase in hardness values respectively with the codeposition of silicon nitride particles...|$|E
