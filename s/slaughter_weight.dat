5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to <b>slaughter</b> <b>weight</b> within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E
500|$|Commercial turkeys {{are usually}} reared indoors under {{controlled}} conditions. These are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds' activity and thereby increases {{the rate of}} weight gain). [...] The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve <b>slaughter</b> <b>weight</b> at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed, {{but the majority of}} commercial birds are white, as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the pin feathers being less visible. Turkeys were at one time mainly consumed on special occasions such as Christmas (10 million birds in the United Kingdom) or Thanksgiving (60 million birds in the United States).

Os pescoços praticamente não variaram com o aumento dos pesos de abate. Os pescoços dos cordeiros TS e FS foram menores, comparados aos dos cordeiros SS e BS, na maioria dos pesos de abate estudados. A paleta também não variou com o aumento dos pesos de abate, havendo tendência para diminuição. Aos 45 kg, os cordeiros TS e FS apresentaram PPA maiores em relação aos cordeiros SS e BS. Nos outros pesos de abate, praticamente não houve diferenças para PPA entre os grupos genéticos. A costela/fralda elevou-se com o aumento dos pesos de abate, sendo que, em pesos de abate elevados, os cordeiros TS mostraram maiores proporções.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate roughage levels in whole shelled-corn finishing diets and to compare use of self-feeders to a total mixed ration in a whole corn program. In trial 1, steers were fed whole corn diets alone or with 4 or 8 % roughage or a rolled corn diet with 8 % roughage. Increasing the roughage level increased dry matter in take, feed required per unit of gain, and carcass weight and finish, and reduced the incidence of liver abscesses. Despite better feed efficiency and lower costs of gain, reducing the dietary roughage level reduced profitability because of lighter <b>slaughter</b> <b>weights.</b> In trial 2, feeding 4 % vs no roughage in a whole-corn finishing program increased dry matter intake and tended to increase rate of gain by finishing heifers. No performance benefit resulted from feeding a total mixed ration vs using self-feeders and providing chopped hay in a feed bunk. Feeding very little or no roughage in whole corn diets can improve feed efficiency and reduce cost of gain.

40|$|Abstract: In Romania, {{suckling}} {{lamb meat}} is on demand during the Easter, but growing suckling lambs just {{for this purpose}} is not profitable. The paper performed a comparative study of the fattening aptitudes of the lambs from three local sheep breeds to produce carcasses demanded on the international market. The research was done on three groups (Carabash, Tsigai and Tsurcana breeds) of 16 weaned lambs each, with an initial weight between 21 - 27 kg and continued until the animals reached an weight of 35 - 38 kg. The experiment started {{after a period of}} accommodation to the experimental maintenance and feeding conditions. The animals were kept indoors under similar conditions of feeding and microclimate. The body weight of the animals was measured {{at the beginning and end}} of each fattening period, as well as the average daily gain and the total weight gain for each breed. During the late period of fattening, control weighing was performed until the target weight has been achieved. The Carabash lambs, which had the highest lambing weights of all the investigated breeds, proved to be the most precocious as weight gain. Over 44 fattening days they recorded an average daily gain of 0. 258 ± 0. 016 kg, reaching a <b>slaughtering</b> <b>weight</b> of 38. 46 ± 1. 178 kg with a feed conversion ratio of 4. 66 FU.
