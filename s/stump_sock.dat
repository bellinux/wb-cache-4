Inside the below-the-knee plaster cast, stump socks or commercially available tube socks are added to provide continuous compression on the stump. The components are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Procedure Making the below-the-knee plaster cast: A three-ply <b>stump</b> <b>sock</b> or a tube sock is applied directly to the healed stump, or over a sterile dressing if the wound is not corn pletehy healed. Initial padding is added to the concave area of the medial side of a bulbous stump (Fig. 3) in order to ensure a wider opening of the cast and allow removal and reapplication of the cast. We then place a few tapered layers of cast-padding cotton over the bone prominences of the tibial tubercle, tibial crest, and fibular head (Fig. 3). This differs from the felt used in the Burgess technique in that the tapered cotton works like a temporary spacer and is removed to leave a gap between the cast and the bone prominences (Fig...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Transtibial amputee {{residual}} limbs shrink and swell {{throughout the}} day {{for a variety of}} reasons. If an amputee does not properly regulate their limb fit due to volume changes, then ulcers, irritation and other maladies can result. <b>Stump</b> <b>socks</b> are by far the cheapest way to manage volume. However evidence suggests that improper use of socks {{is one of the top}} reasons for socket discomfort and injury. In order to determine what constitutes proper usage of socks, the current use patterns of amputees need to be understood. This requires tracking the use of the amputee sock habits as well as their physical activity. However there is currently no way to objectively observe or track the sock usage of an amputee. A low power monitoring device capable of measuring sock usage and physical activity was developed and tested on human subjects. Between two subjects, 54 % of donnings and 12 % of doffings of socks were successfully detected. The future of this device should include additional development of the hardware and firmware to improve battery life and antenna effectiveness. Clinical intervention through sock recommendation should be explored after a thorough understanding of how amputees use their socks is established. This device has the potential to improve the comfort and fit of a transtibial prosthetic socket and to reduce the incidence of residual limb soft tissue injury...|$|R
40|$|Evidence based {{practice}} {{is important in}} the provision of the best possible care and the enhancement of quality of life for the lower limb amputee. However, there is a limited amount of evidence available about what constitutes a good socket fit. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and to compare the dynamic interface pressure distribution of a 'hands on' and 'hands off' type of socket design and relate this to patient feedback and activity level. Evidence gained will contribute to socket prescription and design for trans-tibial amputees. METHOD Subjects: Established (at least 1 year) unilateral trans-tibial amputees (n= 50) were divided in two equal subject groups. Group 1 was fitted with a PTB style socket and group 2 was fitted with a pressure cast style socket. Groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, pathology and BMI. Apparatus: A Tekscan pressure measurement system was used to record the stump/socket interface pressure distribution of the patients own prosthesis. A Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) was used as a qualitative measure for evaluating the prosthesis and health-related quality of life. An ActivPAL activity monitor was attached to the prosthesis for one week to provided quantitative information on the use of the prosthetic limb. Data Analysis: 3 way repeated measure ANOVA used to indicate variations in interface pressure within socket and between groups throughout stance phase. Independent sample tests used to determine if differences exist between groups for PEQ and activity monitor results. RESULTS Stump/socket interface pressure distribution is similar between groups. Pressure levels were higher in pressure cast sockets. Similar responses were seen between groups when answering PEQ questions. Subjects responded with high satisfaction in all PEQ categories. Subjects walked an average of 8200 steps per day; there were no significant differences between groups. PEQ responses did not correlate with daily activity. DISCUSSION Interface pressure within the prosthetic socket can be used to evaluate socket fit. Previous studies comparing the two casting concepts have shown that significant differences exist in the distribution and magnitude of interface pressure (Convery and Buis, 1998, Goh et al., 2004). The differences in magnitude and distribution of interface pressure were not observed in this study. Both groups reported a high satisfaction in all areas of quality of life, and the activity of the subject was not influenced by the type of socket worn. The prostheses used in this investigation differed from most previous research studies investigating interface pressure as subjects own prostheses were instrumented. These had been delivered by their prosthetist and worn in daily activities for at least six months prior to this study. Over this time adjustments to walking patterns and physiological changes to the residual limb and additional <b>stump</b> <b>socks</b> worn may all have contributed in reducing initial differences seen in interface pressure between casting concepts. CONCLUSION Two different casting philosophies are used to produce the majority of trans-tibial sockets. Based on these principles and previous experimental evidence, a significant difference in loading pattern and pressure was expected within the prosthetic socket. These differences were not seen in the socket in the long term after delivery of the prosthesis. Adaptation over time may have reduced any initial differences between the two designs...|$|R

The Wicked Witch of the West was not pleased with Dorothy {{for the death of}} her sister. Before the Wicked Witch of the West can claim the magic footwear, the Wicked Witch of the East's stockinged feet curl up into <b>stumps</b> with striped <b>socks,</b> and they disappear under the house and the shoes are transposed to Dorothy's feet. In the original book, the Wicked Witch of the West showed no remorse for the death of her counterpart in the East, nor was she noted to be related to her in any way. She was only interested in the magic footwear ("Silver Shoes" [...] in the book, [...] "Ruby slippers" [...] in the 1939 film). It is believed in the movie that Miss Almira Gulch is turned in the tornado into the Wicked Witch of the East, rather than the West, since she is close to the tornado and because her appearance in the scene is somewhat different than the second witch. But in the movie, Oz was a dream so she could have easily turned into the witch that Dorothy envisions Miss Gulch to be.|$|R
