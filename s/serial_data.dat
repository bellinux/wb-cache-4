Phase noise of -150 dBc at 10kHz from 10MHz is now available, a level that is generally only needed for radio frequency (RF) applications. MEMS oscillators are now available with integrated jitter under 1.0 picosecond, measured from 12kHz to 20MHz, a level that is normally required for high speed <b>serial</b> <b>data</b> links, such as SONET and SyncE, and some instrumentation applications.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a <b>serial</b> <b>data</b> technology that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to make a major change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E

25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a <b>serial</b> <b>data</b> stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{framework}} to simultaneously segment and register lung and tumor in <b>serial</b> CT <b>data.</b> Our method assumes nonrigid transformation on lung deformation and rigid structure on the tumor. We use the B-Spline-based nonrigid transformation to model the lung deformation while imposing rigid transformation on the tumor to preserve the volume and the shape of the tumor. In particular, we set the control points within the tumor to form a control mesh and thus assume the tumor region follows the same rigid transformation as the control mesh. For segmentation, we apply a 2 D graph-cut algorithm on the 3 D lung and tumor datasets. By iteratively performing segmentation and registration, our method achieves highly accurate segmentation and registration on <b>serial</b> CT <b>data.</b> Finally, since our method eliminates the possible volume variations of the tumor during registration, we can further estimate accurately the tumor growth, an important evidence in lung cancer diagnosis. Initial experiments on five sets of patients’ <b>serial</b> CT <b>data</b> show that our method is robust and reliable. 1...|$|R
