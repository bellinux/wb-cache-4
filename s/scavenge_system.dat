50|$|The early {{prototype}} Twin Cam engines {{had considerable}} {{trouble with the}} oiling system. These problems delayed release of the engine as scheduled for the 1997 model year. When the engines were run, oil came out any gasketed joint {{as well as the}} breather. Harley sought the help of Paul Troxler, a young engineer from Southwest Research Institute and eventually the problem was traced to a design which drained the cam case into the crankcase, and used a single scavenge pump. Due to airflow through ports in the crankcase wall, the cam case was not draining properly. After much testing, the solution was to seal the cam case from the crankcase and use a dual <b>scavenge</b> <b>system,</b> which was incorporated into the engine, rather than as an outboard pump as used on older Big Twins since the original Knucklehead. However, oil was still not scavenging properly from the crankcase, and this was traced to an acoustic phenomenon due to the caliber of the scavenge inlet. Restricting the diameter of the inlet, a counter-intuitive solution, solved that problem.|$|E

40|$|With ample radio {{transmitters}} {{scattered throughout}} urban landscape, RF energy scavenging {{emerges as a}} promising approach to extract energy from propagating radio waves in the ambient environment to continuously charge low power electronics. With the ability of generating power from RF energy, the need for batteries could be eliminated. The effective distance of a RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> is highly dependent on its conversion efficiency. This results in significant limitations on the mobility and space requirement of conventional RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>systems</b> as they operate only in presence of physically large antennas and conversion circuits to achieve acceptable efficiency. This thesis presents a number of novel design strategies in the antenna and rectifier designs for miniaturized RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system.</b> In the first stage, different energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>systems</b> including solar energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> thermoelectric energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> wind energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> kinetic energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> radio frequency energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> and hybrid energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> are investigated {{with regard to their}} principle and performance. Compared with the other <b>systems,</b> RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> has its advantages on system size and power density with relatively stable energy source. For a typical RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> antenna and rectifier (AC-DC convertor) are the two essential components to extract RF energy and convert to usable electricity. As the antenna occupies most of the area in the RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system,</b> reduction in antenna size is necessary in order to design a miniaturized system. Several antennas with different characteristics are proposed in the second stage. Firstly, ultra-wideband microstrip antennas printed on a thin substrate with a thickness of 0. 2 mm are designed for both half-wave and full-wave wideband RF energy scavenging. Ambient RF power is distributed over a wide range of frequency bands. A wideband RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> can extract power from different frequencies to maximize the input power, hence, generating sufficient output power for charging devices. Wideband operation with 4 GHz bandwidth is obtained by the proposed microstrip antenna. Secondly, multi-band planar inverted-F antennas with low profile are proposed for frequency bands of GSM 900, DCS 1800 and Wi-Fi 2. 4 GHz, which are the three most promising frequency bands for RF energy scavenging. Compared with previous designs, the triple band antenna has smaller dimensions with higher antenna gain. Thirdly, a novel miniature inverted-F antenna without empty space covering Wi-Fi 2. 4 GHz frequency band is presented dedicated for indoor RF energy scavenging. The antenna has dimensions of only 10 × 5 × 3. 5 mm 3 with appreciable efficiency across the operating frequency range. In the final stage, a passive CMOS charge pump rectifier in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology is proposed for AC to DC conversion. Bootstrapping capacitors are employed to reduce the effective threshold voltage drop of the selected MOS transistors. Transistor sizes are optimized to be 200 / 0. 5 μm. The proposed rectifier achieves improvements in both power conversion efficiency and voltage conversion efficiency compared with conventional designs. The design strategies proposed in this thesis contribute towards the realization of miniaturized RF energy <b>scavenging</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The laser optical delivery system was also tested and optimized to minimize non-uniformities over the field of view. An isoflurane anesthetic delivery and <b>scavenge</b> <b>system</b> were designed and added to the scanner. Animal models were developed using the breast cancer cell lines MB-MDA- 231 and BT- 474. These were xenografted onto athymic nude mice. A synthesized arterial input function was produced utilizing measurements obtained with DCE-CT scans. 4 D image coregistration was performed to allow for measuring identical regions between DCE-CT and DCE-PCT scans. This data was then able to be used for compartmental modeling of dynamic contrast enhanced photoacoustic data. The perfusion and fractional plasma volume values as determined by DCE-PCT were then able to be compared to the values as measured by DCE-CT. A series of fiber optic dosimetry probes were also fabricated and calibrated to aid in measuring laser fluence within the photoacoustic scanner. ^ Results: The photoacoustic scanner was adjusted to have in scan motion less than that of the theoretical spatial resolution. The synthesized arterial input function was determined to have the same general shape, and peak timing as that of individual arterial input functions measured by both DCE-CT and DCE-PCT scans. A fiber optic dosimetry probe with a diameter of 1. 5 mm and a concentration of 5 mg/mL titanium dioxide was determined to yield a coefficient of variation of ∼ 7 %. Compartmental fitting after coregistration was performed to determine blood perfusion and fractional plasma volume. ^ Conclusion: This study explored the feasibility of a prototype photoacoustic scanner to quantify localized blood perfusion and fractional plasma volume in vivo using a dynamic contrast enhanced imaging protocol in a xenograft tumor model. The perfusion and fractional plasma volumes determined by DCE-PCT did not obtain statistically significant correlation to those same measurements as determined by DCE-CT. ...|$|E

This paper describes the model testing and evaluation of a new <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> in a small two-stroke petrol engine with internal working mixture preparation. The scavenging process is per-formed by two different gas media in two successive phases and is more sophisticated and effective than the conventional single-phase (Schnürle) principle. Using the similarity principle and dimensional analysis, a new mathematical model was developed for evaluation of the effectiveness of the <b>scavenging</b> <b>systems.</b> This makes it possible to establish relationships between the most important parameters of the model engine and of the real engine, which are independent of the dimensional parameters. The effectiveness of the <b>scavenging</b> <b>systems</b> was defined by means of qualitative scavenging efficiency. A special testing device for the model engine has been developed and a liquid working media (instead of gaseous) is used. A qualitative as well as a quantitative evaluation of the predicted values and a simulation of the working medium exchange process at different working conditions is possible. A visual observation of the slowed-down scavenging process in a transparent model cylinder was also made.

Thus, this study aimed to compare the trace concentrations of the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane in operating room with and without central <b>scavenging</b> <b>system.</b> Method Waste concentrations of isoflurane and sevoflurane were measured by infrared analyzer at different locations (near the respiratory area of the assistant nurse and anesthesiologist and near the anesthesia station) and at two times (30 and 120 min after the start of surgery) in both operating room types. Results All isoflurane and sevoflurane concentrations in unscavenged operating room were higher than the US recommended limit (2 parts per million), regardless of the location and time evaluated. In scavenged operating room, the average concentrations of isoflurane were within the limit of exposure, except for the measurements near the anesthesia station, regardless of the measurement times.

After subarachnoid hemorrhage, the intrathecal CD 163 -haptoglobin-hemoglobin system was saturated, as shown by the presence of extracellular hemoglobin despite detectable haptoglobin. Hemoglobin efflux from the central nervous system was evident, enabling rescue hemoglobin scavenging by the systemic circulation. Therefore, the central nervous system is not capable of dealing with significant intrathecal hemolysis. Potential therapeutic options to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia ought to concentrate on augmenting the capacity of the intrathecal CD 163 -haptoglobin-hemoglobin <b>scavenging</b> <b>system</b> and strategies to encourage Hb efflux from the brain...|$|R
