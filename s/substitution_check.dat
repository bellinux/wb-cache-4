40|$|Some {{countries}} in Latin America have introduced {{a tax on}} bank withdrawals {{in order to increase}} revenue. The debit tax has usually been levied in periods of economic turbulence. This paper analyzes the effects of such a tax on real cash holdings and on balances of different types of bank accounts in Colombia. The paper analyzes data for the period 1994 to 2007 and then verifies the robustness of the model using only the data from 2000 to 2007, thereby eliminating the economic crisis of the late 1990 s. The results show that even though the tax caused a decrease in checking account balances, the changes produced in total balances of real cash after 2001 cannot be attributed to the debit tax. However, an increase in the rate of growth of savings account balances can be attributed to it, suggesting a <b>substitution</b> from <b>checking</b> toward savings accounts.

The consistency of the Kraitchman <b>substitution</b> structure was <b>checked</b> by calculating the Op [...] -Op bond distance six ways; the values ranged from 1. 458 to 1. 502 A. This variation was attributed to an amplification of residual vibrational effects by large axes rotations upon isotopic substitution. Estimates of errors produced from this effect were made and a procedure was developed for choosing rs parameters in which the effect is minimized. This gave the following ring parameters: d(COe) = 1. 416 A, d(COp) = 1. 412 A, d(OO) = 1. 461 A, eC = 104. 8 [deg], eCOp = 105. 5 [deg], pOp = 99. 3 [deg]...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{industry has been}} among the most innovative while being one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. Government regulation of pharmaceutical product quality started in 19061 and has evolved into a stringent system of premarket controls over new drug development and introduction. Several recent studies have examined the effects of these regulatory controls on the costs and development periods for new drug entities, the quantity of drug innovation, and delays in new drug therapies available to consumers. 2 Government laws and regulations indirectly affect the innovation process through the distribution and marketing of pharmaceuticals. In contrast to other products, drugs can be dispensed to an individual only with a physician's prescription. This is true unless the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the drug for self-medication (i. e., over-the-counter us-age). Historically, state antisubstitution laws for prescription drugs have prohibited pharmacists from dispensing a different brand of a drug than the one prescribed by the physicians. A major structural change taking place in the {{pharmaceutical industry}} to-day is the repeal of state antisubstitution laws. Over forty states have passed product selection or drug substitution laws. 3 While the state-enacted laws have significant differences, essentially all enable pharmacists to substitute generic products (some mandate substitution) unless a physician prevents <b>substitution</b> by <b>checking</b> a preprinted box or writing "dispense as written" (DAW) on the prescription form...|$|R
40|$|The <b>substitution</b> of noncash (<b>check,</b> giro, {{and credit}} and debit card) {{payments}} for cash transactions {{is difficult to}} gauge {{because there are no}} data series on the actual value or volume of cash transactions in any country. However, determining the degree of cash substitution is important because it will negatively affect government seigniorage revenue and, if cash use falls fast enough, may require tax revenues to redeem excess currency holdings. We utilise a novel method for approximating the volume of cash transactions using public information on currency stocks and noncash payments. Applying this method, we estimate how cash has been substituted by other payment instruments in 10 European countries. We also provide a forecast of future cash use by country. We find that the trend in cash substitution across countries is quite similar. However, the countries themselves are at significantly different stages of this substitution process. The spread of debit and credit card payments has been the key factor behind the substitution away from cash as use of e-cash innovation is still in its infancy. Country-specific differences in the substitution process are largely explained by differences in the level of implementation of each country’s card payment technology. cash substitution; learning curves; seigniorage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For the phonon Boltzmann {{equation}} {{with only}} pair collisions we characterize {{the set of}} all collisional invariants under some mild conditions on the dispersion relation. In {{the study of the}} Boltzmann equation, collisional invariants play an important role: for the spatially homogeneous equation they are in one-to-one correspondence with its stationary solutions and for the linearized Boltzmann equation they yield the eigenvectors spanning the zero subspace. In the kinetic theory of gases, under rather general conditions, a collisional invariant is necessarily of the form ψ(v) = a 1 2 v 2 +b·v+c with arbitrary coefficients a, b, c [1]. In case the particles are relativistic, the kinetic energy, 1 2 v 2, will be replaced by its relativistic cousin (1 + p 2) 1 / 2, see [2] for the characterization of the collisional invariants. In this note we discuss collisional invariants for the phonon Boltzmann equation with 4 -phonon processes only. The essential difference to the kinetic theory of gases {{lies in the fact that}} the role of the kinetic energy is taken by the dispersion relation ω(k) which is a fairly arbitrary, non-negative function on Td, the d-dimensional torus of wave numbers. To keep notation simple we discuss a single band model with the hypercubic lattice Zd as crystal lattice. Amongst the allowed 4 -phonon processes we study first only the number-conserving ones. For them, under conditions to be specified, a collisional invariant is necessarily of the form ψ(k) = aω(k) + c, a, c ∈ R. It is then a simple <b>substitution</b> to <b>check</b> whether the set of collisional invariants is further reduced by c = 0 when taking the remaining 4 -phonon collisions into account. We will work in the extended zone scheme. The dispersion relation ω: Rd → R then satisfies ω ≥ 0 and is Zd-periodic, i. e. ω(k+n) = ω(k) for all n ∈ Zd. Physically ω(k) 2 = ∑ γ(n) e i 2 πk·n n∈Z d with γ of exponential decay. Thus ω is real analytic except at points where ω(k) = 0. For multiband models further points of non-analyticity may occur because of bun...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Species of the Fusarium genus are {{important}} fungi which {{is associated with}} health hazards in human and animals. The taxonomy of this genus has been a subject of controversy for many years. Although many researchers have applied molecular phylogenetic analysis to examine the taxonomy of Fusarium species, their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear only few comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the Fusarium genus {{and a lack of}} suitable nucleotides and amino acid substitution rates. A previous stugy with whole genome comparison among Fusairum species revealed the possibility that each gene in Fusarium genomes has a unique evolutionary history, and such gene may bring difficulty to the reconstruction of phylogenetic tree of Fusarium. There is a need not only to <b>check</b> <b>substitution</b> rates of genes but also to perform the exact evaluation of each gene-evolution. Results We performed phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences of the rDNA cluster region (rDNA cluster), and the β-tubulin gene (β-tub), the elongation factor 1 α gene (EF- 1 α), and the aminoadipate reductase gene (lys 2). Although incongruence of the tree topologies between lys 2 and the other genes was detected, all genes supported the classification of Fusarium species into 7 major clades, I to VII. To obtain a reliable phylogeny for Fusarium species, we excluded the lys 2 sequences from our dataset, and re-constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree based on the combined data of the rDNA cluster, β-tub, and EF- 1 α. Our ML tree indicated some interesting relationships in the higher and lower taxa of Fusarium species and related genera. Moreover, we observed a novel evolutionary history of lys 2. We suggest that the unique tree topologies of lys 2 are not due to an analytical artefact, but due to differences in the evolutionary history of genomes caused by positive selection of particular lineages. Conclusion This study showed the reliable species tree of the higher and lower taxonomy in the lineage of the Fusarium genus. Our ML tree clearly indicated 7 major clades within the Fusarium genus. Furthermore, this study reported differences in the evolutionary histories among multiple genes within this genus for the first time. </p...|$|R
