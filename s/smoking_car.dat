500|$|Lody {{returned}} to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from King's Cross to Edinburgh. He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card {{and talked with}} her a while before going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth {{and the other a}} sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were [...] "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: [...] "What country are you? Are you from the other side?" [...] Lody replied, [...] "Yes, I am an American." [...] They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser HMS Pathfinder, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, [...] "We are going to put out mines as the Germans have done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." [...] Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the <b>smoking</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

[...] They were flat cars #1-20, box cars #21-25, caboose #26, lowside coal gondolas #27-30, and box cars #31-36. [...] The Portland Company also built a wedge snowplow, a flanger, and two 19-ton 0-4-4 Forney locomotives #2-3. [...] Jackson and Sharp built four passenger cars 40 feet long.

40|$|Aims: To explore adolescents' {{perceptions}} of <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> {{and awareness of}} the potential harms associated with such exposure. Methods: Data were drawn from a 2011 cross-sectional study with 11 - 16 year olds (n = 1373) in the UK, who were asked how often {{they are exposed to}} <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars,</b> their support for banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> and their {{perceptions of}} the harms associated with exposure, both to themselves and non-smokers in general. Findings: Almost half (46 %) reported being exposed to <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars,</b> with 17 % reporting travelling more than once a week with someone smoking. 85 % supported a ban on <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> carrying children under 16 years. 74 % reported that they disliked being exposed to <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> and 91 % perceived exposure to be harmful. Logistic regression found that dislike of exposure, perceived harm and support for bans varied depending on smoking status, exposure to <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> and their demographic profile. Conclusions: Many UK adolescents report exposure to <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars.</b> Adolescents' opposition to such exposure, the associated health risks and their support for <b>car</b> <b>smoking</b> bans highlights the need for further consideration to be given to legislative options to protect children and others in private cars...|$|R

2500|$|The Wiscasset car shop {{completed}} {{a number of}} rebuilding projects starting with conversion of six of the original flatcars to boxcars {{during the first year}} of railroad stations. [...] The shop then rebuilt one end of <b>smoking</b> <b>car</b> #4 into a baggage compartment. [...] After the <b>smoking</b> <b>car</b> burst into flame in 1904, its trucks were used under the caboose. [...] The caboose was renumbered from 26 to 301 after its cupola was removed. [...] Excursion car #7 was converted to a replacement combination RPO-smoking car in 1906. [...] The 28-foot gondolas were rebuilt as flatcars when the 30-foot gondolas were delivered, and the 30-foot gondolas were rebuilt as simple flatcars within a year. [...] Box cars #65, 72 and 73 were rebuilt with hinged doors, insulated walls, and 2 windows for use as cream cars carrying an attendant to load and record milk cans. [...] As the 28-foot boxcars needed repair, they were rebuilt to the full height of the 30-foot boxcars and renumbered in the 300 series with special purpose modifications. [...] Cars #302-304 had end doors and six windows on each side for use as express cars in passenger train service. [...] Many later cars of the 300 series contained stoves to keep potatoes from freezing during winter shipment. [...] Ten of the 28-foot flatcars were rebuilt in 1910 as heated insulated boxcars #501-510 for potato loading. [...] Boxcars #509 was rebuilt with hinged doors for cream car service after car #73 was destroyed in 1913. [...] Flatcar #10 was rebuilt in 1913 with a derrick for placing riprap. [...] The remaining three 28-foot flatcars were rebuilt in 1916 into express cars #80-82 with end doors and 6-foot-wide side doors. [...] Combination #6 was converted to an express car by removing interior features and placing protective bars across the windows.|$|E

40|$|Background: As {{exposure}} to tobacco smoke pollution (TSP) {{has been identified}} as a cause of premature death and disease in non-smokers, and studies have demonstrated that <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> produces high levels of TSP, this study will investigate smokersâ€™ rules for <b>smoking</b> in their <b>cars,</b> and predictors of <b>car</b> <b>smoking</b> rules, including potentially modifiable correlates. Methods: Data were drawn from nationally representative samples of current smokers from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project surveys in France (2007), Germany (2007), and the Netherlands (2008). Smokers in France and Germany were asked about smoking rules in their cars, and smokers in the Netherlands were asked about <b>smoking</b> rules in <b>cars</b> carrying children. Results: In France and Germany, 59 % and 52 % of smokers respectively, allowed <b>smoking</b> in their <b>cars.</b> In the Netherlands, 36 % of smokers allowed <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> carrying children. Predictors of allowing <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> included: being a daily vs. non-daily smoker, being younger vs. older age, having no (young) children in the home, being a heavier smoker, and allowing smoking in the home. In the Netherlands, smokers who agreed that TSP is dangerous to non-smokers were less likely to allow <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> carrying children. Conclusion: Overall, a sizeable proportion of smokers allowed <b>smoking</b> in their <b>cars</b> across the three countries. Media campaigns with information about the dangers of TSP may increase the adoption of smoke-free cars. These media campaigns could target smokers {{who are most likely to}} allow <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Since 2006, banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> with {{children}} {{has become a}} rapidly growing tobacco control policy. However, to date, {{there have been few}} studies examining support and correlates of support for <b>car</b> <b>smoking</b> bans, and none of the existing studies have been international in nature. We conducted such a study among smokers in four countries. Methods: 6716 adult current smokers from the 2007 Wave of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey, a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort telephone survey of smokers in the USA, Canada, UK and Australia. Controlling for demographics, heaviness of smoking, smoking health knowledge/beliefs and quit intentions, we compared support and correlates of support for banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> {{with children}} across the four countries. Results: The majority of smokers supported banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> with children. Support was highest in Australia (83 %), followed by the UK (75 %) and Canada (74 %); support was lowerâ€”but still highâ€”in the USA (60 %). Support was highest among smokers who: had stronger quit intentions, were lighter smokers, had lower education, had no children in the home, believed that cigarette smoke is dangerous to non-smokers and could cause asthma in children, and were concerned about modelling smoking to children. Conclusions: These findings indicate that a majority of smokers in the four countries support banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> with children, and lend support to banning <b>smoking</b> in <b>cars</b> with children. Additionally, they suggest that support may be increased by educating smokers about the dangers of cigarette smoke exposure...|$|R

60|$|After escorting {{her to a}} seat on the train, he tactfully {{retired to}} the <b>smoking</b> <b>car,</b> not to rejoin her until they were on the trestle {{spanning}} the Charles River by the North Station. All the way to Boston she had sat gazing out of the window at the blinding whiteness of the fields, incapable of rousing herself to the necessity of thought, to a degree of feeling commensurate with the situation. She did not know what she would say to Lise if she should find her; and in spite of Mr. Tiernan's expressed confidence, the chances of success seemed remote. When the train began to thread the crowded suburbs, the city, spreading out over its hills, instead of thrilling her, as yesterday, with a sense of dignity and power, of opportunity and emancipation, seemed a labyrinth with many warrens where vice and crime and sorrow could hide. In front of the station the traffic was already crushing the snow into filth. They passed the spot where, the night before, the carriage had stopped, where Ditmar had bidden her good-bye. Something stirred within her, became a shooting pain.... She asked Mr. Tiernan what he intended to do.|$|E

But Billy, in the <b>smoking</b> <b>car</b> for a cigarette, seated himself beside {{a man who was}} destined to deflect them from their course. He was a keen-faced, dark-eyed man, undoubtedly a Jew; and Billy, remembering Saxon's admonition always to ask questions, watched his opportunity and started a conversation. It took but a little while to learn that Gunston was a commission merchant, and to realize that the content of his talk was too valuable for Saxon to lose. Promptly, when he saw that the other's cigar was finished, Billy invited him into the next car to meet Saxon. Billy would have been incapable of such an act prior to his sojourn in Carmel. That much at least he had acquired of social facility.|$|E

60|$|Boardman {{put himself}} in charge of Mavering, and took him into the <b>smoking</b> <b>car.</b> It was {{impossible}} to indulge a poetic gloom there without becoming unpleasantly conspicuous in the smoking and euchre and profanity. Some {{of the men were}} silent and dull, but no one was apparently very unhappy, and perhaps if Dan had dealt in absolute sincerity with himself, even he would not have found himself wholly so. He did not feel as he had felt when Alice rejected him. Then he was wounded to the quick through his vanity, and now; in spite of all, in spite of the involuntary tender swaying of his heart toward her through the mere force of habit, in spite of some remote compunctions for his want of candour with her, he was supported by a sense of her injustice, her hardness. Related with this was an obscure sense of escape, of liberation, which, however he might silence and disown it, was still there. He could not help being aware that he had long relinquished tastes customs, purposes, ideals, to gain a peace that seemed more and more fleeting and uncertain, and that he had submitted to others which, now that the moment of giving pleasure by his submission was past, he recognised as disagreeable. He felt a sort of guilt in his enlargement; he knew, by all that he had, ever heard or read of people in his position, that he ought to be altogether miserable; and yet this consciousness of relief persisted. He told himself that a very tragical thing had befallen him; that this broken engagement was the ruin of his life and the end of his youth, and that he must live on an old and joyless man, wise with the knowledge that comes to decrepitude and despair; he imagined a certain look for himself, a gait, a name, that would express this; but all the same he was aware of having got out of something. Was it a bondage, a scrape, as Boardman called it? He thought he must be a very light, shallow, and frivolous nature not to be utterly broken up by his disaster.|$|E
