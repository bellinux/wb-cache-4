40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of ASN 3 -encoded asparagine synthetase (AS, EC 6. 3. 5. 4) during vegetative growth, seed development and germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. Phenotypic analysis of knockout (asn 3 - 1) and knockdown (asn 3 - 2) T-DNA insertion mutants for the ASN 3 gene (At 5 g 10240) demonstrated wild-type contents of asparagine synthetase protein, chlorophyll and ammonium in green leaves at 35 days after <b>sowing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization localized ASN 3 mRNA to phloem companion cells of vasculature. Young siliques of the asn 3 - 1 knockout line showed a decrease in asparagine but an increase in glutamate. The seeds of asn 3 - 1 and asn 3 - 2 displayed a wild-type nitrogen status expressed as total nitrogen content, indicating that the repression of ASN 3 expression had only a limited effect on mature seeds. An analysis of amino acid labeling of seeds imbibed with (15 N) ammonium for 24 h revealed that asn 3 - 1 seeds contained 20 % less total asparagine while 15 N-labeled asparagine ((2 - 15 N) asparagine, (4 - 15 N) asparagine and (2, 4 - 15 N) asparagine) increased by 12 % compared to wild-type seeds. The data indicate a fine regulation of asparagine synthesis and hydrolysis in Arabidopsis seeds...|$|E

40|$|This study {{represents}} part of {{a broader}} investigation into novel seed broadcasting methodologies as a means to optimize rehabilitation techniques following sand mining. Specifically, the study investigated the use of polymer seed coatings, time of <b>sowing</b> application, and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> raking of the topsoil to optimize seedling recruitment to site. For polymer seed coatings, an ex situ trial was undertaken to evaluate seed coating effects on seedling emergence. Results demonstrated that seed coatings did not significantly inhibit maximum emergence percentage of 10 Banksia woodland species (out of 11 evaluated), but coated seeds from four species were on average 2 – 6 days slower to emerge than noncoated seeds. Seed coatings were found to have a greater effect <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> with more coated seeds emerging than noncoated seeds.

40|$|Interactions {{between two}} canopy layers in a {{designed}} perennial herbaceous plant community were investigated {{over a period}} of {{four and a half years}} to see whether it was possible to create an urban landscape vegetation that was both flower rich for an extensive time period and resistant to weed colonization at very low levels of maintenance by <b>sowing</b> seed <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> The ecologically novel plant community involved a tall over-canopy layer of 18 species of North American prairie and woodland edge forbs, and a shade tolerant under-canopy of eight European and North American, mainly woodland forbs. After 5 years the community was dominated by four over-canopy and two winter green under-canopy species. Interspecific competition generated by the sown biomass restricted weed colonization to very low levels, despite the experiment being surrounded by a weedy brownfield. The winter green canopies of the two dominant under-storey forbs closed down gaps within a winter deciduous, prairie-like vegetation, improving winter appearance and providing a major flowering display in spring.

Effects of {{inclusion}} of whole-crop pea silages differing in their tannin content {{on the performance}} of dairy cows fed high or low protein concentrates. Livestock Science, 124 (1 - 3), 306 - 313. The effect of including high or low tannin forage peas as an alternative to soyabean meal on performance and N efficiency was investigated using 18 dairy cows in two Latin square design studies. Two varieties of forage pea; Racer (coloured flowers; high tannin) and Croma (white flowers: low tannin), were ensiled 12 weeks post <b>sowing.</b> The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> degradability characteristics of the pea silages were determined using 4 cannulated sheep. The low tannin forage had a higher soluble N (a) fraction and a greater extent of degradation (a + b), resulting in a greater amount of N being predicted to be released in the rumen than the high tannin forage. In experiment 1. cows were fed one of three treatments in each of 3 periods of 28 d duration in a Latin square design; grass silage/whole-crop wheat (0. 50 : 0. 50, DM basis) and 8 kg/d of a high protein concentrate (GWH); grass silage/whole-crop wheat/high tannin forage pea silage (0. 25 : 0. 25 : 0. 50 respectively, DM basis) and 8 kg/d of a high protein concentrate (HTH) or 8 kg/d of a low protein supplement (HTL).

30|$|Rice–wheat (RW) {{cropping}} system {{is one of}} the world’s largest agricultural production systems, covering an area of about 26 million hectares (Mha) spread over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) in South Asia and China (Sarkar 2015). The conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices and diversified farming system approach not only saves natural resources but may help in improving productivity, growth of cereals, accelerating farm income, mitigating environment pollution and climate change effects on agriculture. In IGP of North-West (NW) India, management of voluminous rice residues (8 – 10 t ha− 1) in RW fields is still a serious problem which stagnate the area extension under CA. In conventional RW system, wheat planting is generally delayed (by 2 – 3  weeks) because of little turn-around time between harvesting of rice and sowing of wheat and the presence of heavy loads of rice straw left on the field after combine harvesting. Among current options available to farmers for rice residue management before wheat <b>sowing</b> are: (1) <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> incorporation <b>in</b> the soil using rotavator; (2) removal or partial burning of loose residue followed by zero-till <b>sowing</b> of wheat <b>in</b> anchored residue; (3) full residue retention using happy seeder machine for sowing of wheat and; (4) <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> open field burning followed by conventional wheat sowing. About 40 % of crop residues (CRs) in IGP are being disposed-off through open field burning due to unavailability of happy seeders for sowing under residue conditions and fast decomposing bioagents (Jain et al. 2014). Burning of crop residues result in emission of noxious air pollutants and greenhouse gases along with particulate matter and hydrocarbons which affect the atmospheric chemistry (Kanabkaew and Oanh 2011). CRs are good source of plant nutrients and organic matter (40 % of the total dry biomass constituted by C) and are important for stability of agricultural ecosystems (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2002).|$|R

40|$|Confinement of {{breeding}} {{sows and gilts}} {{is one of the}} most controversial issues in livestock production and there is worldwide interest in finding alternative housing systems for gestating sows and gilts. The present study was conducted to measure aspects of the. welfare of gestating <b>sows</b> housed <b>in</b> either large groups on deep litter (Hoops) or conventional stalls (Stalls). Six hundred and forty sows were studied, with 40 recently mated sows entering each treatment each week over an 8 -week period. Large groups were formed by 40 experimental and 45 non-experimental (n = 85) animals per group. <b>Sows</b> <b>in</b> Hoops had a higher (P < 0. 001) number of scratches, presumably due to fighting, particularly in the first week of gestation (25 vs. 3. 3 scratches/sow). In addition, there was a strong tendency (P = 0. 06) for higher salivary cortisol concentrations in week 1 of gestation <b>in</b> the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> large group housing (6. 29 vs. 4. 03 nM), which may correspond to increased aggression as reflected by more scratches and a higher (P < 0. 01) return rate to oestrus between 19 and 43 days after mating (13. 2 % vs. 7. 4 %). <b>Sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls had a higher (P < 0. 01) incidence of lameness at 9 weeks of gestation (7 % vs. 0 %), and this treatment difference became more pronounced (P < 0. 001) later in gestation (13. 8 % vs 0. 8 %. at week 15). There was evidence that the capability of the immune system of the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stalls treatment, perhaps as a consequence of stress, was reduced late <b>in</b> gestation: <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stalls treatment had a higher (P < 0. 05) percentage of neutrophils (46 % vs. 41 %) and a lower (P < 0. 05) number and percentage of lymphocytes (4. 59 x 106 vs. 5. 16 x 106 c/mI and 41. 6 % vs. 46. 5 %) and consequently a higher neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (1. 22 vs. 0. 94, P < 0. 05) than <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the large groups on deep litter. There was a strong tendency (P =. 0. 06) for a higher reproductive failure in the Hoops treatment (27. 3 % vs. 14. 5 %). The Stalls treatment had a higher (P < 0. 001) farrowing rate (76. 8 % vs. 66 %) and while <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls weaned less piglets (P < 0. 01) per litter (8. 31 vs. 8. 97), the average weaning weight of these piglets was higher (P < 0. 005) than <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Hoops (8. 69 kg vs. 8. 01 kg). The combination of these reproductive parameters shows that the <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the Stall treatment weaned the equivalent of 46 more piglets per hundred mated sows. The results of this experiment suggest that <b>sows</b> housed <b>in</b> large groups on deep litter may have faced greater welfare challenges in the early stages of gestation whereas <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> Stalls may have experienced greater welfare challenges later in gestation. However, further more detailed research on the welfare of gestating <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> these two housing systems is clearly required.

Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter for <b>sows</b> and litters <b>in</b> the lactation stage.
