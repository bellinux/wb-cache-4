5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|The robin also sings when storms {{approach}} and again when storms have passed. In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> such as when a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, West Cobalt {{was sold}} to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, which {{assigned}} her to its Ripley Steamship Company subsidiary. During the 1930s, Lykes Brothers operated cargo ships between Gulf Coast and Caribbean ports, and though there is little <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> available regarding West Cobalts movements, {{it is likely that}} she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports as well. One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in The New York Times in 1937, when the newspaper reported West Cobalts arrival in New York on 30 October, ten days after sailing from New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|Social insects, such as termites, ants {{and many}} bees and wasps, {{are the most}} {{familiar}} species of eusocial animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed {{one of the few}} non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> about something in the environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown. Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors. Bombus terrestris, for example, exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, when they can see a conspecific foraging on the same species.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial. The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no <b>specific</b> <b>information</b> {{about what people}} should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E

These results suggest that remedial readers may not benefit much from minimal information on how strategy use can improve performance. Multiple sources of strategy value information may be necessary to enhance self-efficacy and comprehension skill.
