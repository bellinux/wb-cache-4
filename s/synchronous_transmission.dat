We consider networks modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process operating under different {{medium access control}} schemes, namely unslotted and slotted ALOHA, and CSMA with carrier sensing at the transmitter and with carrier sensing at the receiver. For these scenarios, we derive analytical expressions to compute {{the maximum number of}} retransmissions attempts that leads to the optimal transmission capacity. Numerical results based on our formulation show that CSMA with carrier sensing at the receiver (asynchronous transmissions) reaches the highest maximum transmission capacity when traffic intensity is low, while slotted ALOHA (<b>synchronous</b> <b>transmissions)</b> is the best choice when traffic intensity is high.

40|$|Although the FDDI MAC {{protocol}} {{has been}} studied quite extensively, many of the analyses that have been performed so far are complex approximations and require {{a significant number of}} simplifying assumptions to be made to the protocol to keep their solution tractable. The need for these simplifications and the general difficulty (often requiring the use of numerical methods) in obtaining these approximate solutions, limit the scope and usefulness of the results to only simple cases. In {{the first part of this}} two-part paper, we present an alternative method for computing the exact mean throughput of a symmetric FDDI network with both asynchronous and <b>synchronous</b> <b>transmissions</b> using a simple mean value approach. Closed form solutions for the exact mean throughput and token rotation time of a single priority symmetric network are derived. For networks with multiple levels of priorities, an iterative algorithm is presented which allows the same quantities to be computed. The approach works even when the synchronous traffic stream is not saturated. Results of extensive computer simulations used to verify the accuracy of our approach are also presented.

These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest asynchronous voice-band modem could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while synchronous modems could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>transmission</b> used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar asynchronous transmission, since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by modems which convert asynchronous data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs.

In some conceptions, a transmission grid of HVDC transmission lines forms a layer that is distinctly separate {{in the way that}} a superhighway system is separate from the system of city streets and regional highways. In more conventional conceptions such as the proposed unification of the synchronous European grid UCTE and the IPS/UPS system of the CIS, such a mega grid is no different from typical wide area <b>synchronous</b> <b>transmission</b> systems where electricity takes an ad-hoc transit route directly through local utility transmission lines or HVDC lines as required.Studies for such continental sized systems report there are scaling problems as a result of network complexity, transmission congestion, and the need for rapid diagnostic, coordination and control systems. Such studies observe that transmission capacity would need to be significantly higher than current transmission systems in order to promote unimpeded energy trading across distances unbounded by state, regional or national, or even continental borders.As a practical matter, it has become necessary to incorporate smart grid features such as wide area sensor networks (WAMS) into even modest sized regional grids in order to avert major power outages such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003. Dynamic interactions between power generation groups are increasingly complex, and transient disturbances that cascade across neighboring utilities can be sudden, large and violent, accompanied by abrupt changes in the network topology as operators attempt to manually stabilize the network.|$|E
