40|$|Abstract – Robotic {{researches}} {{can contribute}} to the restoration of some functions lost by handicapped people. The over-cost generated by the additive potentialities must be affordable and related to the value of the usual product. In most cases, autonomous functions are direct transpositions of solutions applied in industrial robotics. If we consider that in addition with cost, security is a supplementary constraint of rehabilitation robotics, an important research effort is needed to propose technological components.

40|$|Learning - {{the process}} by which new skills and {{behaviours}} are acquired - is a central concept in the understanding of mental handicap. Discrimination learning Is specifically identified as an essential pre-requlslte for the acquisition of a variety of more complex behaviours and skills. Many studies have reported that <b>severely</b> mentally <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> show a relative inability to profit from unstructured learning experiences, and frequently fail to learn discriminations trained through simple differential reinforcement (trial-and-error training). Programmed training procedures are identified as important vehicles to facilitate the discrimination learning of <b>severely</b> mentally <b>handicapped</b> children. An initial study is reported that confirms the superiority of programmed over trial-and-error discrimination training, and demonstrates this superiority is maintained over a series of similar discrimination tasks. The results also demonstrate that stimulus fading procedures can be successfully implemented using micro-computer technology, and that 'errorless' learning can be effected through the sequencing and fading of trainer prompts. However, programmed procedures are not invariably effective in teaching discriminations to developmentally impaired persons, and failures to learn following programmed training are not infrequently reported. In a series of studies, some of the basic procedural parameters underlying diverse programmed techniques were evaluated as determinants of the development (or lack of development) of appropriate stimulus controL Increasing the salience of S+, whether through manipulation of S+ or S-, was shown to be more effective than increasing the salience of S-. Further, congruence between prompt and training cue dimensions was shown to be a significant variable affecting the outcome of training. The effectiveness of programmed procedures was also shown to interact with task difficulty. Finally, wide individual differences in learning within the population of <b>severely</b> mentally <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> have frequently been reported, and were also observed in the present research. In a final study, individual differences in some basic cognitive abilities and aspects of classroom behaviour were assessed and shown to be significantly correlated with discrimination performance. The results are related to the literature on compound conditioning (e. g., Kamin, 1968) and theories of discrimination learning (Terrace, 1966; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972; Zeaman and House, 1963, 1979), and suggest the importance of attentlonal processes in discrimination learning. Lastly, some educational implications of the results are discussed. Plymouth Health Authorit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It may be {{considered}} a cliché to say that brain is an electrochemical organ; researchers have speculated that a fully functioning brain can generate as much as 10 watts of electrical power. We can actually see these electrical changes {{in the form of}} brain waves as shown in an EEG (electroencephalogram). There are four categories of these brainwaves, ranging from the most activity (beta waves) to the least activity (delta waves). The purpose of the paper is to pragmatically assimilate the concept of brain emitting electrical power to perform basic task of password recognition when user “imagines ” a hand movement. Such a system could allow a <b>severely</b> physically <b>handicapped</b> <b>person</b> to communicate with his computing surroundings securely. Here the distinction must be made between physically and mentally handicapped.

5000|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance allowances for participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special allowances for refugees from East Germany. There was determined, by statutory regulation issued in February 1970, the category of persons most seriously disabled “to whom, with regard to maintenance aid, an increased demand (50% of the appropriate rate) is being conceded, and, within the scope of relief in special living conditions: a higher rate of nursing aid.” In 1971, the retirement age for miners was lowered to 50.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of professional preparation and employment of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> Employment of <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> {{is a general}} problem. Visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> belong to group with the least prospect on labour market but it is concurrently clear {{that they want to}} be employed. The theoretical part of this thesis is focused to definition of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> including specificities of their development. The second chapter deals with teaching the visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> in primary-, secondary- and tertiary education, with attention paid also to the choice of profession. Conclusion of the theoretical part deals with employment of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and namely with employment policy. The practical part describes concepts of and expectations from employing the visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons,</b> motivation to work, a valuation list of the respondent visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and a role of parents in the choice of profession. Furthermore, it describes accomplishments necessary for job finding gained by the respondent visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons,</b> opinions on possible causes of unemployment of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> and supporting mechanisms of employing such persons, utilized by particular respondents. Research was carried out in a form of dialogue with six visually handicapped respondents with handicaps in the range of amblyopia and sightlessness. One of the main goals of this thesis was to monitor study possibilities for visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> The next goal was to find out what were the problems of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> during their studies, what was perceived as obstacles during studies, during the choice of profession or, appropriately, during pursuance of the profession. A problem may be in wrong choice of the school e. g. due to insufficient self-confidence of the <b>handicapped</b> <b>person</b> and low confidence of the family and teachers. Prejudice of the employers is an important and still persisting problem, as well as the lack of job opportunities for visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons.</b> In my opinion, the possibilities for employment of visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> do improve but there are persisting barriers mainly in the attitudes of intact people and potential employers. They are frequently affected by insufficient information on the support and possibilities of employing <b>persons</b> with visual <b>handicap.</b> The attitude of the nowaday´s society placing emphasis on quickness and quantity plays its role also. With visually <b>handicapped</b> <b>persons</b> it is necessary to build up their self-confidence already since their childhood. Contemporarily, it would be appropriate to enhance the awareness of potential employers, what could be provided by means of media and seminars. Cooperation of intact pupils with visually handicapped ones could be carried out at schools. It would be necessary to perceive the handicap as something common already since the childhood.
