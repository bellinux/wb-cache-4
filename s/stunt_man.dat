5|$|Hershey {{landed a}} role in Richard Rush's The <b>Stunt</b> <b>Man</b> (1980), marking {{a return to the}} big screen after four years and earning her {{critical}} praise. Hershey felt that she would be forever in debt to Rush for fighting with financiers to allow her a part in that film. She also felt The <b>Stunt</b> <b>Man</b> was an important transition for her, from playing girls to playing women.|$|E
5|$|The press {{would not}} meet Dalton and d'Abo until 5 October 1986, when the main unit {{travelled}} to Vienna. Almost {{two weeks after}} the second unit filming on Gibraltar, the first unit started shooting with Andreas Wisniewski and <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> Bill Weston. During the course of the three days it took to film this fight, Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once. The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House, doubling for Bladen's Safe House, the first scene Jeroen Krabbé filmed.|$|E
5|$|Maurice Binder {{was hired}} to design the title sequence, and was {{involved}} in a dispute with Eon Production to have his name credited in the film. As Thunderball was the first James Bond film shot in Panavision, Binder had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel, but also made Connery appearing in the sequence {{for the first time a}} reality, as <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> Bob Simmons had doubled for him in the three previous films. Binder gained access to the tank at Pinewood which he used to film the silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in the opening sequence, which was the first time actual nudity (although concealed) had ever been seen in a Bond film.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E
5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E

25|$|For his {{contribution}} to the motion picture industry, Yakima Canutt has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street. In 1967, he was given an Honorary Academy Award for achievements as a <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> and for developing safety devices to protect stunt men everywhere. He {{was inducted into the}} Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 1975.|$|E
25|$|McQueen, an {{accomplished}} driver, drove in the close-up scenes, while stunt coordinator Carey Loftin, stuntman and motorcycle racer Bud Ekins, and McQueen's usual stunt driver, Loren Janes, drove for the high-speed {{part of the}} chase and performed other dangerous stunts. Ekins, who doubled for McQueen in The Great Escape sequence where McQueen's character jumps over a barbed wire fence on a motorcycle, lays one {{down in front of}} a skidding truck during the Bullitt chase. The Mustang’s interior rear view mirror goes up and down depending on who is driving: when the mirror is up, McQueen is visible behind the wheel, when it is down, a <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> is driving.|$|E

25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed {{a group of kids}} trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} part of the film's Asia release, Variety {{reported}} that the film enjoyed a tremendous start to its theatrical run across East Asia since its release date on 10 July 2008. The film scored a record-breaking opening weekend across six Asian territories. Variety also reported that the film received a generally positive critical reception in Hong Kong, China. In South Korea, the opening day of Red Cliff knocked Hancock down to 79,000 admissions Thursday, or an estimated gross of $550,000. The film also drew more than 1.6 million viewers in South Korea— about 130,000 more than the Batman sequel The Dark Knight. At a budget of US$80 million, along with media scrutiny over its lengthy and troubled shoot, including the death of a <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> and the hospitalisation of its producer, the film was thought by many a big financial gamble, but industry insiders reported that good word-of-mouth and positive reviews appeared to be paying off for the film's strong box-office revenue.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time that another {{character}} had joined Dexter with a victim in one of his murder scenes. While filming this scene during October 2008, Smits accidentally stabbed <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> Jeff Chase with a real knife rather than the scene's prop knife. The knife struck a small piece of plastic on Chase's chest and he was unharmed. [...] "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] received generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E

5000|$|According to Milius, {{virtually}} all of the film's stunts were performed by Terry Leonard. Leonard was the stunt coordinator and did some of the stunts and also has a minor part as Roosevelt's boxing opponent early in the film. Milius claims that only four American <b>stunt</b> <b>men</b> were used in the entire final battle scene; the number of Spanish <b>stunt</b> <b>men</b> was close to twenty throughout the filming. He and Leonard have defended the film against criticism for alleged [...] "animal cruelty", claiming that not a single horse was seriously hurt during filming. While filming this scene, Antoine Saint-John revealed himself to be terrified of horses, and would often hide somewhere on the set when his sword fight with Sean Connery was to be filmed.|$|R
500|$|The episode used several special effects. However, {{in order}} to ensure that the episode felt [...] "camera-real" [...] to {{preserve}} the theme of magic and illusions, many of the more intense effects were replaced with more conventional effects. For instance, the scene wherein Bill LaBonge's hand erupted into flames was created through the use of <b>stunt</b> <b>man,</b> rather than through expensive and, ultimately, [...] "less convincing" [...] CGI effects. The scene featuring The Amazing Maleeni turning his head 360 degrees was created using a prosthetic head, courtesy of John Vulich's Optic Nerve Studios.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, {{the film}} version of Walter Tevis' novel The Hustler was released. The film {{tells the story of a}} pool shark named [...] "Fast Eddie" [...] Felson and his quest to beat the {{greatest}} pool player in America, [...] "Minnesota Fats". World Champion Willie Mosconi served as a technical advisor and trick shot <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> for the film. Wanderone almost immediately dropped his [...] "New York Fats" [...] nickname, adopted the name [...] "Minnesota Fats" [...] and began spreading the story that the character was based on him. Tevis denied this for the rest of his life.|$|E
500|$|The scenes where Dwight {{climbs into}} a box almost {{did not make the}} episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight {{climbing}} into the box would not only make the episode [...] "crazy broad," [...] but also make the rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as [...] "the most natural thing in the world." [...] Phil Shaw, the <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his [...] "action hero" [...] moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien.|$|E

50|$|Billy Hughes (November 28, 1948 - December 20, 2005) (Billy Eugene Hughes, Jr.) was an American actor {{best known}} for various {{television}} and film roles he played during the 1960s. His Hollywood lineage included both his father (Bill Hughes) and uncle (Whitey Hughes), who were both <b>stunt</b> <b>men.</b> While in Alma, Arkansas in 2005, he apparently died in his sleep.|$|R
500|$|Some of the [...] "women roles" [...] that {{followed}} The <b>Stunt</b> <b>Man</b> included the horror movie The Entity (1982); Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), {{in which she}} played Glennis Yeager, wife of test pilot Chuck Yeager; and The Natural (1984), in which she shot Robert Redford's character, inspired by a real-life incident where Ruth Ann Steinhagen shot ballplayer Eddie Waitkus. For the role of Harriet Bird, Hershey had chosen a particular hat as her [...] "anchor". Director Barry Levinson disagreed with her choice, but she insisted on wearing it. Levinson later cast Hershey as the wife of Danny DeVito's character in the comedy Tin Men (1987).|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} [...] "Furnace Trap" [...] came from the house having been a crematorium at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace {{would be part of}} the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized {{in the form of a}} computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> using a fire-retardant gel crawled into the fire.|$|E
500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through {{the barrel of a}} gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with <b>stunt</b> <b>man</b> Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E
50|$|The stunt {{arranger}} for {{the series}} was Frank Maher, who worked on Department S at the same time, he had previously performed the same job on Danger Man (1964-66) and The Prisoner (1966/67).
