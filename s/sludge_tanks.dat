50|$|Fine bubble {{diffusers}} {{have largely}} replaced coarse bubble diffusers and mechanical aerators {{in most of}} the developed world and in much of the developing world. The exception would be in secondary treatment phases, such as activated sludge processing tanks, where 85 to 90 percent of any remaining solid materials (floating on the surface) are removed through settling or biological processes. The biological process uses air to encourage bacterial growth that would consume many of these waste materials, such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are dissolved in the wastewater. The larger air release openings of a coarse bubble diffuser helps to facilitate a higher oxygen transfer rate and bacterial growth. One disadvantage of using fine bubble diffusers in activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> is the tendency of floc (particle) clogging the small air release holes.|$|E

40|$|Aeration of {{activated}} sludge is very costly {{and therefore it}} is desirable to operate the treatment plant at as low DO concentration as possible without risking poor effluent quality. This paper presents {{a study of the}} impact of DO concentration on sludge properties at a full scale wastewater treatment plant which utilizes pre-denitrification followed by aeration in {{activated sludge}} and with post-nitrification in nitrifying trickling filters. The DO concentration has in the past generally been kept high at the plant (> 5 mg/l) as it has been believed to give better effluent quality.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of organic micropollutants are usually low in wastewaters (order of magnitude of mg L− 1). However, their emission standards, {{especially in the}} case of carcinogenic and bioaccumulating substances, are often much lower (order of magnitude of μg L− 1). Since these substances, in some cases, can be adsorbable or volatile, their removal via volatilization, biodegradation or sludge adsorption in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) becomes a significant feature to include in the usual design process, in order to verify the emission standards in gas and sludge too. In this study a simple screening batch test for the evaluation of the fate of organic micropollutants in water, air and sludge is presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{a study of the}} behavior of technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) during high level waste (HLW) processing operations at Savannah River Site (SRS). Its behavior during HLW processing is important to understand because Tc- 99 can fractionate in the waste and appear in both the sludge and the salt tanks at SRS. It can also be soluble in groundwaters and thus is an important radionuclide that may dictate how much waste has to be removed from a tank to prepare it for permanent closure. The HLW processing steps considered in this study are: (1) The initial caustic neutralization of the acidic waste streams generated in the SRS canyons to prepare the waste for storage in the mild steel tanks in the SRS Tank Farm. Waste that is insoluble in caustic precipitates while soluble elements remain in the supernates. At SRS insoluble components are segregated into <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> and soluble components into the salt tanks. (2) The operations in the SRS Tank Farm that wash the sludge in preparation for immobilization for permanent disposal.

40|$|In a {{conventional}} clarification plant, {{the water from}} sludge digestion (wash water containing sludge) is fed back into the waste water inlet. The ammonium load, that in this way can be recycled to the facility, can contribute 30 % of the total ammonium loading. Because of this additional ammonia freight, a clarification plant requires larger activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> {{and the need for}} oxygen increases, i. e., higher investment and energy costs arise in the treatment of the waste water. In a Fraunhofer IGB project, the filtrate of a biological sludge digestion developed at the IGB was studied. This wash water containing sludge has, because of the higher degree of decomposition in the sludge digestion, a higher ammonium content of 2 g/L than the wash water containing sludge in conventional clarification plants. Also, this muddy water is free of particles and microorganisms for the necessary microfiltration. These prerequisites permit the cost effective obtaining of the ammoni um from the sludge filtrate. To separate the ammonium from the muddy water, a hollow fiber membrane contactor is used. The filtrate is stripped with air. The ammonia laden air is washed with acids or freed of its ammonia load by cooling. Marketable products are thus obtained of ammonium salts such as fertilizer or ammonia solution for flue gas desulfurization. With this process the ammonium concentration in the muddy water can be reduced to over 99 % without pH elevation. A higher pH value can considerably accelerate the ammonium removal by the shift of the ammonium/ammonia equilibrium. The addition of alkali has the disadvantage that the waste water becomes loaded with chemicals, in this case, dissolved salts. Technically worthwhile is the ammonium reduction by 90 - 95 % that can be made with the "saved" energy through smaller ammonium loads in the clarification plant...|$|E
40|$|As {{energy costs}} rise, water {{reclamation}} facilities (WRFs) desire lower cost, easily operated systems to remove BOD 5 and suspended solids. WRFs typically utilize an aerobic process called activated sludge to remove {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD). BOD, specifically 5 day BOD (BOD 5), is used {{as an indicator of}} the organic strength of a solution. Anaerobic treatment provides an alternative to activated sludge by removing BOD 5, generating biogas containing methane for energy and producing less biomass that requires disposal. Anaerobic treatment functions as an exceptional alternative to activated sludge when packaged as a system with a small footprint that operates at ambient temperature. These systems can produce effluent with organic constituent quality similar to activated sludge without requiring the energy inputs that conventional treatment demands. In this work, an anaerobic, fluidized bed reactor (FBR) treating both synthetic and real domestic primary effluent was utilized to remove BOD¬ 5 from wastewater. The reactor was operated at 10 °C to determine operation under challenging, low-temperature conditions. An external, cross-flow tubular membrane, gravity settling, enhanced chemical coagulation, electrocoagulation and FBR treatment with no subsequent solids removal were all tested in an effort to increase effluent quality, targeting a final BOD 5 of 10 mg/L or less. FBR treatment with no subsequent solids removal with an hydraulic residence time of 9 hours reduced BOD 5 by 68 %, from 199 ± 26 mg/L to 67 ± 15 mg/L (n= 8). Clarification of anaerobic effluent by membrane filtration resulted in an average permeate BOD 5 of 7 ± 4 mg/L. Gravity settling alone achieved an average BOD 5 of 35 ± 5 mg/L (n= 2). Chemical coagulation with 30 mg/L ferric chloride followed by gravity settling reduced the BOD 5 to 14 ± 5 mg/L (n= 8). In comparison, full scale activated sludge with secondary settling achieved a final BOD 5 of 9 ± 2 mg/L (n= 9). Anaerobic treatment with enhanced sedimentation may lend itself to retrofitting existing plants by use of activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> and existing secondary clarifiers, whereas membrane filtration requires large capital investment. Additionally, enhanced sedimentation is a robust and relatively simple process in comparison to membrane filter operation. Enhanced sedimentation is a viable option for clarification of anaerobic effluent from an anaerobic FBR treating primary effluent...|$|E

40|$|The noble metals Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag were {{produced}} in the Savannah River Site (SRS) reactors as products of the fission of U- 235. Consequently {{they are in the}} High Level Waste (HLW) sludges that are currently being immobilized into a borosilicate glass in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The noble metals are a concern in the DWPF because they catalyze the decomposition of formic acid used in the process to produce the flammable gas hydrogen. As the concentration of these noble metals in the sludge increases, more hydrogen will be produced when this sludge is processed. In the SRS Tank Farm it takes approximately two years to prepare a sludge batch for processing in the DWPF. This length of time is necessary to mix the appropriate sludges, blend them to form a sludge batch and then wash it to enable processing in the DWPF. This means that the exact composition of a sludge batch is not known for {approx}two years. During this time, studies with simulated nonradioactive sludges must be performed to determine the desired DWPF processing parameters for the new sludge batch. Consequently, prediction of the noble metal concentrations is desirable to prepare appropriate simulated sludges for studies of the DWPF process for that sludge batch. These studies give a measure of the amount of hydrogen that will be produced when that sludge batch is processed. This report describes in detail the measurement of these noble metal concentrations in sludges and a way to predict their concentrations from an estimate of the lanthanum concentration in the sludge. Results for two sludges are presented in this report. These are Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) currently being processed by the DWPF and a sample of unwashed sludge from Tank 11 that will be part of Sludge Batch 4. The concentrations of the noble metals in HLW sludges are measured by using mass spectroscopy to determine concentrations of the isotopes that comprise each noble metal. For example, the noble metal Ru is comprised of isotopes with masses 101, 102, and 104. The element Rh has a single isotope with mass 103. The element Pd is comprised of five isotopes. These are at masses 105 - 108 and mass 110. As does Rh, Ag has only one isotope. This is at mass 109. However, results in this report show that the Ag concentration in the two samples was due to natural Ag being in the samples. Natural Ag has masses at 107 and 109. The Ag- 107 interferes with the measurement of Pd- 107. This Ag was used in one of the processes at SRS. The results also show that natural Cd is in the two samples. Cadmium has isotopes at masses 106, 108 and 110, thus it interferes with the analysis of the Pd isotopes at these masses. Cadmium was also used in one of the processes at SRS. However, the concentrations of the Pd isotopes at masses 106, 107, 108 and 110 could be calculated using the fission yields for the Pd isotopes, and the measured concentration of Pd at mass 105 where there is no Ag or Cd interference. Based on the measurements of the concentrations of the isotopes of each noble metal, the total concentration of that noble metal can be determined by summing the concentrations of the individual isotopes. The results in this report show that the relative concentrations of the isotopes of Ru and Rh are in proportion to their yields from the fission of U- 235 in the reactors. These results were expected since these elements are very insoluble in caustic and thus are primarily in the <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> rather then the salt tanks of the SRS Tank Farm. The relative concentration of Pd is somewhat lower than that based on the relative fission yields of its five isotopes. This indicates that some of the Pd is in the salt tanks rather than the <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> of the Tank Farm. The concentrations of the noble metals were predicted using the High Level Waste Characterization System (WCS) at SRS. This system keeps record of the inventory of the major compounds and select radionuclides that are in each of the SRS HLW tanks. Using this system, the Closure Business Unit (CBU) can predict the major composition of a sludge batch by knowing the tanks involved in that batch and the estimates of the volume of sludge from each tank that will be blended to make the final sludge batch. The system does not track the inventories of Rh, Pd, and Ag. It does track Ru, but Ru is not included in the projections by CBU. However, another U- 235 fission product is tracked by WCS. This fission product is La. The element La was not used in any of the chemical processes at SRS. Results in this study show that it is in the HLW primarily as a U- 235 fission product. This fission product is comprised solely of the isotope La- 139 which can be measured along with the isotopes of the noble metals that do not have interferences from Ag or Cd. The concentrations of La in SB 3 and in the Tank 11 sample have been estimated by the CBU using WCS projections...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{behaviour}} {{in a large}} denitrifying {{activated sludge}} tank, located at the Rya Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Göteborg Sweden, was investigated and optimized by using fullscale tracer test and hydraulic modelling. The Rya WWTP is a high loaded plant with a small footprint. Expansion of the site is limited due to several restrictions. An efficient use of already existing facilities is therefore of great importance {{in order to meet}} the demands of decreased effluent limits, set by authorities. The presence of a short circuiting stream was identified with full-scale tracer tests and the hydraulic situation was successfully quantified using the Martin model, a compartment model based on curve fitting to the residence time distribution curve (RTD-curve) from the full-scale tracer test. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 3 D modelling was used for virtual prototyping of different corrective measures near the inlet to break the previously identified short circuiting stream. From an operational point of view, inlet baffles were chosen as the preferable alternative. After implementation, improved tank hydraulics, were verified with another full-scale tracer test. At a normal flow (3. 6 m 3 /s), the space time in the tank was found to be 16 minutes. In the original tank 30 % of the water had a residence time of less than 8 minutes, 49 % of the water had a residence time between 8 and 24 minutes and 21 % of the water had a residence time of more than 24 minutes. After implementation of corrective measures, the tank with baffles had 6 % of the water with a residence time of less than 8 minutes. 77 % of the water had a residence time between 8 and 24 minutes and 17 % of the water had a residence time of more than 24 minutes. Also, the mixing characteristics in the tank achieved a more plug-flow like character. Full-scale tracer tests are very informative when investigating hydraulic situations in activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks.</b> Mathematical modelling using black box approach can help to quantifying the hydraulics in a tank. For example can use of the Martin model help to quantify short circuiting streams and dead volumes. CFD modelling is a useful and informative tool for analyzing problematic hydraulics at wastewater treatment plants and for the design of theoretical corrective measures. Being a useful tool for virtual prototyping, this type of modelling also deserves to have a more central role when designing large reactors and other hydraulic systems. I.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{that are}} {{intended}} for human use are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. This is predominantly from the excretion of pharmaceuticals by patients, in their urine and faeces, which subsequently enter sewage treatment plants. Sewage treatment provides a final opportunity for pharmaceutical removal, prior to discharge into the environment, however, removal is often incomplete. Once in the environment, pharmaceuticals {{have the potential to}} cause effects on aquatic organisms. Sewage treatment plants, that are designed to meet statutory discharge consents for nutrients, are increasing in number. These plants, capable of biological nutrient removal, are understudied for the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals. This thesis presents research findings on the behaviour, fate and removal of selected pharmaceuticals in a bespoke laboratory rig, and in operational biological nutrient removal sewage treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals possessing a broad range of physical and chemical properties were selected for this research, they included: salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Sensitive chromatographic methods were developed to quantify the analytes in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor rig and in operational plants. Radiolabelled 14 C isotopes of salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol and diclofenac were dosed into the laboratory rig. The compounds exhibited different behaviours during a simulated sewage treatment process. Salicylic acid and caffeine produced the highest amount of biodegradation, with 25. 2 % and 14. 5 % of the radiolabel mineralised to 14 CO 2 in the rig. However, parent degradation is likely to have been higher, since neither compound could be detected in the effluent by specific chemical analysis. These findings were replicated in the operational sewage treatment plants, with > 97 % removal of both pharmaceuticals, in all three plants investigated. Propranolol and diclofenac were less affected by biodegradation processes, and produced 3. 7 % and 0. 2 % mineralisation, respectively, in the laboratory rig. Furthermore, 33. 8 % of the radioactivity associated to 14 C propranolol was detected in the rig solids. These compounds showed insignificant removal from two operational plants; 6. 8 % and 20. 9 % (propranolol) and - 0. 9 % and - 39. 4 % (diclofenac). Monitoring of operational plants showed that concentrations of propranolol were highest in the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tanks</b> at all three sites. This supports the findings from the rig, that propranolol interacts with the sludge, which might be more significant in plants with lower sludge wastage rates, such as sequencing batch reactors. This could have implications for the terrestrial environment, and therefore, terrestrial risk assessments should be refined accordingly. Monitoring of the operational sewage treatment plants highlighted the widespread presence, and recalcitrant behaviour, of carbamazepine during biological sewage treatment. Future work should focus on investigating the mechanisms of removal, of this pharmaceutical in the laboratory sequencing batch reactor. This work highlighted the problems biological systems face in effectively removing recalcitrant pharmaceuticals. Advanced wastewater treatment should be considered, if complete removal is desired.

40|$|Emerging organic micropollutants are {{compounds}} {{measured in}} water in μg/l or ng/l {{which may have}} long-term negative effects on both wildlife and humans. The purpose of this work was to perform a mass balance of emerging organic micropollutants on activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> and on secondary settling tank in a small wastewater treatment plant in the Municipality of Rome. The analytes monitored in this work were: Estrone (E 1), 17 β-Estradiol (E 2) and 17 α- Ethinylestradiol (EE 2) for steroid hormones, 4 -Nonylphenol (4 -NP) and Bisphenol A (BPA) for substituted Phenols and Alkylphenols, Amphetamine (AM), Methamphetamine (MET), Benzoylecgonine (BEG) and 11 -nor-Δ 9 -THC- 9 carboxy (THC-COOH) for drugs of abuse. Mass balance on activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> showed that the emerging organic micropollutants removed were BPA (59 %), EE 2 (34 %), AM (56 %) and THCCOOH (35 %). The processes occurring in the secondary settling tank were able to reduce 4 -NP (26 %), BPA (74 %), E 1 (82 %), EE 2 (93 %), AM (44 %), MET (80 %), BEG (72 %) and THC-COOH (39 %). The residual amount of each substance was distributed between the effluent, the return sludge line and the excess sludge. Since the removal of emerging organic micropollutants was partial, the conventional wastewater treatment plant {{is not able to}} completely break down these substances. Accordingly, these compounds are found in water body potentially active and dangerous to wildlife and humans. © 201 WIT Press...|$|R
30|$|Second, manual form {{of energy}} has {{the second highest}} share (32  %) during the {{treatment}} process. Most of it is used for light work (45  %) followed by heavy work (39  %). Highest amount of manual energy (35  %) is consumed during the preparation of chemicals for dosing tank. 21  % of manual energy is used for removing the sludge from the <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> and disposing to the nearby garden. Looking to the energy pattern of manual energy, {{it is evident that}} this form of energy contributes to the total energy consumption and it is inevitable. Third, chemical energy and mechanical energy have insignificant share of 7 and 9  %, respectively.|$|R
30|$|The maximum TMP {{value that}} {{indicated}} {{a need for}} chemical cleaning was dependent on the start-up pressure, because depending on location of pumps, etc., the start-up pressure could be different from application to application. Hence, a decision must be asserted on the TMP. In our operation, if the pressure increases to approximately 300  mbar, a chemical cleaning cycle was performed. The rotating VRM plates of the MBR system were cleaned chemically after 101  days of operation. The cleaning process occurred in situ without removal of the plate module. The activated sludge was drained outside the VRM chamber. The filter driving motor operated continuously to apply water on the membrane, ensuring the membrane remained wet. Next, the chamber was filled with approximately 500  ppm of sodium hypochlorite solution until the membrane was completely immersed in the solution. The operation continued for several hours with the filter driving motor and scoring air blower operating, to allow sufficient reaction time for the chemicals to dissipate the thick sludge. The solution was drained and the chamber was filled with clean water. Thereafter, that water was drained. The cleaning and draining steps may be repeated according to actual applications. Finally, the chamber was filled with activated sludge and the system was returned to regular operation. The plate modules were not cleaned mechanically from the outside. For a large capacity VRM unit, another option would be to perform the cleaning process outside the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank</b> using the same cleaning steps, reinstall in the activated <b>sludge</b> <b>tank,</b> and return to normal operation.|$|R
