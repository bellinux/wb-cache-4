25|$|Perales {{is married}} to Mariano Menor and has one child, a son. Perales met her husband, a journalist, during the 2000 Sydney Paralympics because he was {{interviewing}} her. They started dating following those Games. He proposed to Perales at the Eiffel Tower following a taxi ride to the location and a limo ride back to a Paris hotel. She married him in 2004 after the Athens Paralympics. She had problems selecting a wedding dress because some interfered with her ability to roll in her wheel chair. She got married in the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in 2005. She <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> her wheelchair {{in order to take}} her vows. The ceremony was attended by a number of high-ranking political figures. She had her son after the 2008 Beijing Paralympics.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

2500|$|Slice {{made his}} MMA debut against Mercer at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 5, in Atlantic City on June 23, 2007. The match was {{scheduled}} as a three-round exhibition utilizing all professional rules of MMA combat. Slice defeated Mercer with a guillotine choke at 1:12 {{into the first}} round. CFFC V sold 20,000 ppv buys In a post-fight interview, Slice stated {{that he would like}} to fight David [...] "Tank" [...] Abbott. Abbott, who was a spectator, <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his seat and accepted the call out. One of the matchmakers for CFFC asked Slice for his assurance so that an October 12 bout at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 6 between Slice and [...] "Tank" [...] Abbott could be organized. This event was later canceled due to a promotion dispute. On October 11, 2007, ProElite announced that they had signed Slice to a deal and that he would make his debut on the November 10, 2007 EliteXC. He was originally set to make his professional MMA debut against Mike Bourke, a reformed street fighter, but a shoulder injury from Bourke led him to face Bo Cantrell. Slice defeated Cantrell 19 seconds into the first round by submission due to strikes.|$|E

[...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E

In the study, three participants are made to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> a chair using a pair of crutches in seven postures that are combinations of different foot positions, crutch positions, body positions, and eye lines to consider their effects. When standing <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the chair, the CG of the body is measured by a stabilometer, and {{the safety and}} ease of standing <b>up</b> are determined <b>from</b> the trajectories, their lengths, and subjective impressions.
