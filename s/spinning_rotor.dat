25|$|The HSI crushers break rock by {{impacting}} {{the rock}} with hammers that are fixed upon {{the outer edge}} of a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor.</b> HSI machines are sold in Stationary, trailer mounted and crawler mounted configurations. HSI's are used in recycling, hard rock and soft materials. In earlier years the practical use of HSI crushers is limited to soft materials and non abrasive materials, such as limestone, phosphate, gypsum, weathered shales, however improvements in metallurgy has changed the application of these machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position. The rotor {{simultaneously}} spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two other axes, and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point (except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin). Some gyroscopes have mechanical equivalents substituted for {{one or more of}} the elements. For example, the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> may be suspended in a fluid, instead of being mounted in gimbals. A control moment gyroscope (CMG) is an example of a fixed-output-gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the lateral and torsional motion of <b>spinning</b> <b>rotors</b> is replete with applications of Newton's and Euler's equations. Sometimes the intricacies of these equations overshadow their simpler physical meaning. This paper attempts to compensate for this by explaining the dynamic behavior of <b>spinning</b> <b>rotors</b> without writing any equations...|$|R
25|$|In the 20th century, new {{techniques}} including Open End <b>spinning</b> or <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> were invented to produce yarns at rates {{in excess of}} 40 meters per second.|$|R

2500|$|A control moment {{gyroscope}} (CMG) is {{an attitude}} control device generally used in spacecraft attitude control systems. A CMG {{consists of a}} <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> and one or more motorized gimbals that tilt the rotor’s angular momentum. [...] As the rotor tilts, the changing angular momentum causes a gyroscopic torque that rotates the spacecraft.|$|E
2500|$|VSI crushers {{generally}} utilize a {{high speed}} <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> {{at the center}} of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed rock. Utilizing cast metal surfaces 'anvils' is traditionally referred to as a [...] "Shoe and Anvil VSI". Utilizing crushed rock on the outer walls of the crusher for new rock to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as [...] "rock on rock VSI". VSI crushers can be used in static plant set-up or in mobile tracked equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The generator, [...] {{long and}} [...] in diameter, {{contains}} a stationary stator and a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor,</b> each containing miles of heavy copper conductor—no permanent magnets here. In operation it generates up to 21,000 amperes at 24,000 volts AC (504MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 rpm, synchronized {{to the power}} grid. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with hydrogen gas, selected because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity, which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that a highly explosive hydrogen–oxygen environment is not created.|$|E
50|$|Ewald Rohlfs (1911 Bremen, Germany - 1984) {{was a test}} pilot. In 1936 Rohlfs {{made the}} first flight of a {{helicopter}}, the Focke-Wulf Fw 61. One year later he took the helicopter to an altitude of 1,130 feet (344 m) and then idled the engine. using its <b>spinning</b> <b>rotors</b> to descend safely to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{spinning}} mills {{are mainly}} built around open end <b>spinning</b> techniques using <b>rotors</b> or ring <b>spinning</b> techniques using spindles. In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring spinning spindles installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in Asia or Oceania and 44% being within China. In {{the same year}} there were 7,975,000 open end <b>spinning</b> <b>rotors</b> installed, with 44% of these being within Asia or Oceania and 29% within Eastern Europe. The average age of installed rotors is much {{lower than that of}} spindles and as rotors are between 7 and 10 times more productive they are responsible for 20% of the cotton spun worldwide.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{instrument}} used {{more like an}} actual gyroscope was made by Johann Bohnenberger of Germany, who first wrote about it in 1817. At first he called it the [...] "Machine". Bohnenberger's machine {{was based on a}} rotating massive sphere. In 1832, American Walter R. Johnson developed a similar device that was based on a rotating disc. The French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, working at the École Polytechnique in Paris, recommended the machine for use as a teaching aid, and thus it {{came to the attention of}} Léon Foucault. In 1852, Foucault used it in an experiment involving the rotation of the Earth. It was Foucault who gave the device its modern name, in an experiment to see (Greek skopeein, to see) the Earth's rotation (Greek gyros, circle or rotation), which was visible in the 8 to 10 minutes before friction slowed the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> with {{aerofoil}} section blades (a rotary wing) {{to provide}} lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound rotorcraft.|$|E
5000|$|... 1969 Aug 2 : {{helicopter}} landing accident : During NASA astronaut helicopter flight training, astronaut Edward G.

Gibson was uninjured.|$|E
50|$|DREF yarns {{have been}} seen to be {{inferior}} in terms of unevenness, imperfections, strength variability and hairiness. DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarns as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction spun yarns are more hairy than the ring <b>spun</b> yarns. <b>Rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarns show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while ring spun yarns are most even.|$|R

50|$|It is {{also known}} as break <b>spinning</b> or <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning.</b> The {{principle}} behind open-end spinning {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the <b>rotor,</b> is <b>spun</b> into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring <b>spinning</b> with <b>rotor</b> speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each type of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|R
50|$|A control moment {{gyroscope}} (CMG) is {{an attitude}} control device generally used in spacecraft attitude control systems. A CMG {{consists of a}} <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> and one or more motorized gimbals that tilt the rotor’s angular momentum.

50|$|As noted {{there is}} a spring assist to lift the VertiBird. However, in actual {{operation}} the assist {{is not enough to}} lift the VertiBird off the ground. Most of the lift comes the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> itself. Subsequently, dropping heavy items during flight will result in a very rapid ascension of the VertiBird unless the pilot has good flight skills.|$|E
50|$|Gary Hudson's and Bevin McKinney's initial {{concept was}} to merge a launch vehicle with a helicopter: <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, powered by tip jets, would lift the {{vehicle in the}} {{earliest}} stage of launch. Once the air density thinned {{to the point that}} helicopter flight was impractical, the vehicle would continue its ascent on pure rocket power, with the rotor acting as a giant turbopump.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed the {{influence}} of the number of undulations of polyacrylonitrile fibers, cotton type, on the properties of yarns with Nm 50 / 1 fineness, made on BD 200 the <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine. <b>Rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> of the synthetic fibers is largely influenced by some characteristics of the fibers as being: {{the quality and quantity of}} the avivage, frequency of undulations and the number of defects fiber.

An effective action consisting of a <b>spin</b> <b>rotor</b> and a fermion is derived and the corresponding saddle-point action is analyzed. Zero-temperature phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Hubbard model is presented. While the magnetic phase persists for all values of the Hubbard interaction U, the single-particle spectral function exhibits a crossover into an incoherent phase when the magnetic moment m (and the corresponding U values) lies within a certain window m_c < m < 1 -m_c, indicating a possible deviation from the Hartree-Fock theory...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} of longitudinal yarn structure aimed {{to confirm the}} production process of the yarn employed in this study, {{due to the fact}} that denim can be produced through a ring <b>spinning</b> system or <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> (open-end) (Figure 2 a). This last one is the most common system for producing yarn for denim weaving (Adanur, 2001; Kaswell 1963).|$|R

50|$|The {{brake caliper}} pistons then apply {{force to the}} brake pads, pushing them against the <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the {{friction}} between the pads and the rotor causes a braking torque to be generated, slowing the vehicle. Heat generated by this friction is either dissipated through vents and channels in the rotor or is conducted through the pads, which are made of specialized heat-tolerant materials such as kevlar or sintered glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} creating {{an image of a}} waveform was through a laborious and painstaking process of measuring the voltage or current of a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> at specific points around the axis of the rotor, and noting the measurements taken with a galvanometer. By slowly advancing around the rotor, a general standing wave can be drawn on graphing paper by recording the degrees of rotation and the meter strength at each position.|$|E
40|$|Use of nylon/cotton blend yarn in {{military}} uniform is common {{and due to}} advantages in its fabric in comparison to 100 % cotton fabrics, capabilities of military uniforms have been improved. In this {{study the effects of}} navel type on properties of (50 %- 50 %) nylon/cotton blend yarn and wrapper formation were investigated and compared with similar ring <b>spun</b> yarn. <b>Rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarn was produced on a single head laboratory <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine with four navels (smooth, spiral, 3 grooved, and 4 grooved) and ring yarn was produced on a zinser 319 ring spinning machine.

Elongation of a 100 % cotton <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarn is more than similar ring yarn, but it was not observed in cotton/nylon blend.

25|$|CMGs {{differ from}} {{reaction}} wheels. The latter apply torque simply by changing <b>rotor</b> <b>spin</b> speed, but the former tilt the <b>rotor's</b> <b>spin</b> axis without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For {{a few hundred}} watts and about 100kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of newton meters of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require megawatts of power.|$|R
50|$|On May 16, 1977, {{the landing}} gear failed on a Sikorsky S-61L (N619PA) while it was taking on {{passengers}} {{on the roof of}} the Pan Am Building. The aircraft rolled onto its side. Its <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> blades killed four passengers waiting to board (including movie director Michael Findlay) and injured a fifth. Parts of a broken blade fell into the streets below, killing one pedestrian and injuring another. The accident precipitated the permanent closure of the heliport.|$|E
50|$|The {{tremendous}} rotational {{kinetic energy}} of the rotor in an operating ultracentrifuge makes the catastrophic failure of a <b>spinning</b> <b>rotor</b> a serious concern. Rotors conventionally have been made from lightweight metals, aluminum or titanium. The stresses of routine use and harsh chemical solutions eventually cause rotors to deteriorate. Proper use of the instrument and rotors within recommended limits and careful maintenance of rotors to prevent corrosion and to detect deterioration is necessary to mitigate this risk.|$|E

This semi-analytical method of averaging is basically similar to the one used in purely analytical 'general perturbation' theories.
