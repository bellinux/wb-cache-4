The vehicle would have its body {{removed from the}} chassis, and then the running units such as brake system, axles, springs and other <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> apart from the engine and gearbox would {{be removed from the}} chassis and would be inspected and, if needed, overhauled (at Chiswick works). Each one of these sub-structures would be sent off for inspection and overhaul on its own line at Chiswick. The bodies would be placed on an inverting frame and rotated to access the underside so that road debris could be removed by steam cleaning. The body would then be moved by travelling crane to one of the many parallel bays in the main shop area. The body was placed on stands with staging all around for maximum access to all parts of the body.|$|E

So-called light-weight formal methods have been used to allow a smooth integration of formal methods into their current development process. To show different applications of formal methods, three different tasks have been performed. This thesis describes these tasks along with their results.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} prognostics system has been developed for EMA which plays a dominant rule in controlling surfaces of new-generation fly-by-wire aircraft and spacecraft in severe conditions [53, 54]. EMA is a <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>part.</b> The ability to confidently monitor, diagnose, and prognose EMA can save lives as well as millions of dollars. NASA Ames Diagnostic & Prognostic Group in collaboration with Impact, Moog, Georgia Institute of Technology, California Polytechnic State University, Oregon State University, and US Army developed a very useful PHM system for EMA. The developed system can be used onboard in real time to provide current and predicted EMA health that allows safe reconfiguration. To achieve this goal, a flyable electromechanical actuator test stand is developed and used in laboratory experiments as well as in flight onboard UH- 60 Blackhawk aircraft. After the diagnostics system catches the fault, the prognostics system which uses GPR is initiated for RUL estimation based on the fault mode and intersection of fault progression with the fault threshold. Results show that prediction error of time to failure is less than 10  %.|$|R

Each Service within DOD has their own practices and procedures for management, acquisition, and categorizing of FSCP, e. g., Flight Safety Parts, Flight Safety Critical Items, Flight <b>Safety</b> <b>Critical</b> <b>Parts,</b> Critical Safety Items, etc. Due to the diversity between Services, there is significant confusion within DOD and private industry regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of FSCP. Many of the parts identified as FSCP are used on aircraft operated {{by more than one}} Service and on civilian aircraft. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) manages parts that are common between Services, which include many FSCPs. Management for FSCP that cross component lines, with each Service providing unique specification, is very difficult. Identification, procurement, testing, and management of Flight Safety Parts need to be consistent between Services in order to provide one standard and one face to industry.

40|$|X-Rays {{are used}} as {{reliable}} technique for today’s quality assurance of <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts,</b> for example in the automotive or in the aerospace industry. Radiography systems are used to ensure a high throughput {{in the field of}} hundred percent testing of a batch. In such systems digital images are acquired by using either flat-panel detectors with a high dynamic range or image intensifiers including nearly noiseless, light-sensitive CCDsensors inside. The resulting digital X-Ray images are perspective-projections of the threedimensional density information of the test part onto the two-dimensional picture-plane represented by the dedicated sensor. Due to this projection, structure information and defects may overlap each other. This requires a careful positioning of the test parts to get a penetration of the material as homogeneous as possible. Nevertheless, the three-dimensional spatial information of possible defects is lost in the resulting radiography X-ray image. Also systematic variances of the part (e. g. burr) interfere the defect detection. Therefore sometimes it is hard to decide if possible defects comply to a given specification, i. e. whether a defect in a certain application becomes relevant or not...|$|E
40|$|For {{upcoming}} decades, {{air traffic}} is forecasted to grow significantly. Airport capacity {{as well as}} environmental issues, especially noise mitigation, can be identified as major challenges that aviation will face. One {{way to deal with}} these challenges is the development of new operational procedures based on satellite navigation. The implementation of either a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) with an advanced functionality or Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures has the potential to facilitate the design of more flexible and noise mitigating procedures. But for safety reasons independent parallel approaches can only be conducted when performing straight precision approaches according to ICAO guidelines. To pave the way toward independent segmented parallel approaches, a main safety aspect is going to be addressed in this work: the risk of collisions due to aircraft deviations toward the parallel approach path—so called blunders. To evaluate their influence on overall safety, a blunder analysis for the <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>part</b> of a segmented approach is performed in this work.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{embedded}} systems are widely used. It {{is extremely difficult}} to analyze safety issues in {{embedded systems}}, to relate the safety analysis results to the actual parts, and to identify these parts in the system. Further, it is very challenging to compare the system’s safety development and the different safety metrics to find their most critical combinations. Due to these fundamental problems, a large amount of time and effort is spent for analyzing the data and for searching for important information. Until now, {{there is a lack of}} visualization metaphors supporting the efficient analysis of safety issues in embedded systems. Therefore we present “Enhanced CakES”, a system that combines and links the existing knowledge of the safety analysis and the engineering domain and improves the communication between engineers of these domains. The engineers can directly explore the most <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts,</b> retaining an overview of all critical aspects in the actual model. A formal empirical evaluation was performed and showed the increase of accuracy from ESSaRel 28. 7 % to 83 % for CakES.

40|$|Additive {{manufacture}} {{gives the}} opportunity to create complex hydraulic components (e. g. valve bodies) which are of much reduced weight, only adding material where necessary. The geometry can be optimized to meet stringent design requirements, without the normal subtractive manufacturing constraints. For small production runs, for example production numbers typical in aerospace, manufacture can be very cost-effective, with high repeatability and low material waste. A significant reduction in part count and consequent simplification of assembly is also possible. With the dramatically increased speed of prototyping, AM promises a much shorter development cycle. In this talk, the potential and challenges of AM for hydraulic components are reviewed, focussing on the powder bed fusion laser melting process. A detailed example is given of an aerospace servovalve body additively manufactured from titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) on a Renishaw AM 250. Laser melting {{is known to be}} successful with this material, although research is still required to ensure the characteristics and quality are suitable for aerospace applications. In particular, fatigue life is affected by surface finish and microstructure, and the effects of build process parameters and heat treatment are just starting to be understood. Certification questions arise with flight actuators and using additive manufacturing for <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> requires new standards to be developed.

40|$|Abstract More {{and more}} {{companies}} and institutes report about radiographic film replacement techniques and publish {{different ways to}} prove the required and obtained image quality. The motivation is usually cost reduction due to shorter exposure times and lower storage costs, smaller space requirements and elimination of chemical processing inclusive associated waste handling and disposal. There are no other publications known, which explore these upper limits of image quality achievable by the new digital techniques. This is important for inspection of safety relevant and high risk parts, as e. g. in nuclear or aerospace industries. A new calibration and measurement procedure for digital detector arrays (DDA) was explored to obtain the maximum signal/noise ratio achievable with DDAs. This procedure yields a contrast sensitivity which allows distinguishing wall thickness changes of up to 1 / 1000 of the penetrated material thickness. Standard film radiography using NDT film systems (with and without lead screens) achieves a wall thickness contrast which is not better than 1 / 100 even with the best film system class (class “C 1 ” according to EN 584 - 1 or “special ” according to ASTM E 1815). The comparison is based on parameter studies which measure contrast/noise ratios and determine the basic spatial resolution {{as well as a}} comparison of radiological images of selected parts with fine flaws. This paper also presents a probability of detection study (POD) comparing the four different technologies used today – double wall- and single wall film technique, realtime imaging and imaging with digital detector arrays and frame integration. Experiences from practical aerospace applications with welds and turbine blades verify the advantages of film free systems.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of creep damage limits {{the lifetime of}} component that are exposed to stresses at temperatures higher than approximately half the melting temperature. Such conditions are generally met {{by a lot of}} structural components especially in power plants (pipes, turbines, etc.). According to conventional <b>safety</b> rules <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> are usually exchanged long before any failure has to be expected. This procedure is based on statistics drawn from material tests by standardized methods rather than on the actual state of the component concerned. During the last years an increasing need can be stated to develop NDE methods for the detection of early damage stages in order to improve the reliability and safety of components. Basically, techniques are required which are sensitive to either small strains or, better, to small concentrations of micropores and microcracks, respectively. With regard to in-field applications, only replica techniques are used successfully for that purpose up to now [1, 2]. These metallographic techniques are restricted to surfaces where appropriate spots have to be selected and to be prepared carefully.

40|$|Curve {{squealing}} {{noise of}} railroad vehicles {{has been researched}} for over four decades. To describe this phenomenon, several models have been developed. An increasing stick-slip motion between the wheel and the rail {{is assumed to be}} a key component for the occurrence of squealing. Nevertheless, the circumstances necessary to initiate, uphold and amplify the stick-slip motion in this case are not yet fully described,and existing models need validation. However, due to the non-linear nature of the phenomenon as well as its dependency on a large number of parameters, precise in-situ measurements are difficult to conduct. This Master’s Thesis describes the conception, design and construction of a test rig to create and measure curve squeal noise. A conception of the basic setup is done using knowledge about comparable rigs built. A rig with two interacting wheels, one of them functioning as the rail, is targeted. To ensure the functionality as a test-rig for validating existing simulation-based models, certain settings of the rig need to be changeable. These settings, including for example applied normal force, creepage and rolling speed, are quantified in a parameter study. A wide range of input parameters is used in a repeated time-domain simulation of the interaction, and the number of squealing occurrences is evaluated. A 3 D model of the rig necessary to provide the contact with the found set of parameters is developed. All parts involved are described and drawings are generated.

40|$|Two major {{drivers for}} the use of newer steels in the {{automotive}} industry are fuel efficiency and increased safety performance. Fuel efficiency is mainly a function of weight of steel parts, which in turn, is controlled by gauge and design. Safety is determined by the energy absorbing capacity of the steel used to make the part. All of these factors are incentives for the U. S. automakers to use both Highly Formable and Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) to replace the conventional steels used to manufacture automotive parts in the past. AHSS is a general term used to describe various families of steels. The most common AHSS is the dual-phase steel that consists of a ferrite-martensite microstructure. These steels are characterized by high strength, good ductility, low tensile to yield strength ratio and high bake hardenability. Another class of AHSS is the complex-phase or multi-phase steel which has a complex microstructure consisting of various phase constituents and a high yield to tensile strength ratio. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels is another class of AHSS steels finding interest among the U. S. automakers. These steels consist of a ferrite-bainite microstructure with significant amount of retained austenite phase and show the highest combination of strength and elongation, so far, among the AHSS in use. High level of energy absorbing capacity combined with a sustained level of high n value up to the limit of uniform elongation as well as high bake hardenability make these steels particularly attractive for <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> <b>parts</b> and parts needing complex forming. A relatively new class of AHSS is the Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) steels. These steels seem to offer higher ductility than the dual-phase steels of similar strengths or similar ductility as the TRIP steels at higher strengths. Finally, martensitic steels with very high strengths are also in use for certain parts. The most recent initiative in the area of AHSS is the so-called “ 3 rd Generation” AHSS. These steels are designed to fill the region between the dual-phase/TRIP and the Twin Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steels with very high ductility at strength levels comparable to the conventional AHSS. Enhanced Q&P steels may be one method to achieve this target. Other ideas include TRIP assisted dual phase steels, high manganese steels and carbide-free bainitic (CFB) steels. Finally the post hardened steels (PHS) are {{an important component of the}} strategy of future vehicles. In this paper, some of the above families of advanced formable and high strength steels with micro-alloying additions, utilized in the automotive industry will be discussed...|$|E
