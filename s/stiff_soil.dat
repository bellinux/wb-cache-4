30|$|The natural {{frequencies}} obtained from SSI analysis {{were compared with}} that obtained from the analysis of chimney with fixed base and is given in Table  3. The fundamental natural frequency obtained from chimney with fixed base is higher than that obtained from SSI analysis. The variation of fundamental frequency of chimney with flexible base from that of chimney with rigid base is more for 100  m chimney (H/D b =  7 and D o/t =  22.5) resting on soil type S 1 and the variation is 32.26  %. The variations of same chimney resting on soil types S 2, S 3 and S 4 are 17.69, 8.21 and 2.83  %, respectively. It is seen that the percentage variation of natural frequency between that of flexible base and fixed base conditions of chimney is considerable for soil type S 1 and S 2. Due to interaction with <b>stiff</b> <b>soil</b> types S 3 and S 4, the above variation is less than 10  %. Therefore, it can be inferred that the SSI effect is prominent on flexible soil types rather than <b>stiff</b> <b>soil</b> types.|$|E

Kaolinite was used to represent the sediment solid phase and Soltrol 130 (a type of mineral oil) was used to represent the NAPL. The tests with no organophilic clay showed that higher NAPL saturation resulted in a <b>stiffer</b> <b>soil</b> matrix, which reduced NAPL expUl-sion.

In this second part after investigating the mechanical behaviour of the local model we reproduce, with an assembly of disks (global model), the real behaviour of <b>stiff</b> <b>soils</b> and rocks under standard loading paths. The change of scale from the local to global level is carried out through dimensional analysis.

30|$|The {{pile toe}} {{condition}} on a <b>stiffer</b> <b>soil</b> layer {{plays an important}} role to transmit loads from the superstructure to the soil. Given the complexity of the soil–pile–slab interaction problem and the strong coupling between the different elements forming this foundation system, a three-dimensional finite element numerical modeling with absorbing boundaries is proposed. The aim of this modeling is to analysis the influence of the fixing conditions of the piles in the hard soil on the dynamic response of soil–pile–slab systems. To model the soil and piles, volumic elements are considered and the slab is considered using structural elements. The dynamic impedances are calculated from the displacements obtained at the point of application of the exciting force. Floating, rested and anchored piles in a hard soil layer are analyzed and the effect of groups is also studied. The vertical and horizontal dynamic impedance are presented for different configuration.|$|R
