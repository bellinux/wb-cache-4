5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause <b>sunburn,</b> skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against <b>sunburn,</b> skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} dark {{pigments}} such as melanin in their skin, eyes and fur {{to protect themselves}} against <b>sunburn</b> (damage to living tissues caused by ultraviolet light).|$|E

50|$|The primary {{measure is}} {{avoiding}} further {{exposure to the}} sun. The best treatment for most <b>sunburns</b> is time. Most <b>sunburns</b> heal completely within a few weeks.|$|R
50|$|Minor <b>sunburns</b> {{typically}} cause {{nothing more}} than slight redness and tenderness to the affected areas. In more serious cases, blistering can occur. Extreme <b>sunburns</b> can be painful {{to the point of}} debilitation and may require hospital care.|$|R
25|$|Having {{multiple}} severe <b>sunburns</b> {{increases the}} likelihood that future <b>sunburns</b> develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage. The sun and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.|$|R

5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent <b>sunburn.</b> Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{preparations}} of zinc {{include those}} {{used on the}} skin, often {{in the form of}} zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against <b>sunburn</b> in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} benign melanocytic nevi (moles), {{suspected}} precursors or markers for melanoma, was con-ducted in Washington State among 717 randomly selected 18 - to 50 -year-old white adults {{who participated in}} a telephone interview in 1990 - 1991. Participants were questioned about constitutional factors, time spent in the sun, and severe <b>sunburns</b> over three time periods and were asked to count the raised nevi on both their arms. Logistic regression was used to examine the risk for 2 + nevi compared with none. An odds ratio (OR) of 2. 0 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 1. 3 - 3. 1) was seen for current freckling. Skin color, tendency to bum, and inability to tan were important risk factors but were not independent of each other. Individuals with a history of severe <b>sunburns</b> had an increased risk of nevi: OR = 1. 9 (95 % Cl 0. 9 - 3. 9) for 3 + severe <b>sunburns</b> compared with none in the last 5 years; OR = 2. 0 (95 % Cl 1. 2 - 3. 1) for 4 + severe teenage sunburns; and OR = 3. 1 (95 % Cl 1. 7 - 5. 3) for 4 + severe childhood <b>sunburns.</b> Furthermore, childhood <b>sunburns</b> were related to nevi inde-pendently of sun sensitivity and teenage and recent sunburns: OR = 2. 0 (95 % Cl 1. 0 - 4. 0) for 4 + severe <b>sunburns.</b> These data suggest that childhood <b>sunburns</b> are important in the etiology of nevi. This study supports prior studies of the relation between melanoma and early sun exposure.

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to <b>sunburn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against <b>sunburn</b> and other damage to the skin caused by {{ultraviolet}} light (see sunscreen). It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed into the skin.|$|E
25|$|The UV Index is {{designed}} as an open-ended linear scale, {{directly proportional to}} the intensity of UV radiation that causes <b>sunburn</b> on human skin. For example, if a light-skinned individual (without sunscreen or a suntan) begins to <b>sunburn</b> in 30 minutes at UV Index 6, then that individual should expect to <b>sunburn</b> in about 15 minutes at UV Index 12 – twice the UV, twice as fast.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} cutaneous malignant melanoma and multiple <b>sunburns</b> in the Queensland population. Interview data were gathered from 236 case-control pairs concerning their lifetime experience of severe <b>sunburns,</b> their occupational and recreational sun exposure, and their skin type. Excluding the lentigo maligna melanoma subtype, an association between multiple <b>sunburns</b> and melanoma was evident. After controlling for other major risk factors {{there was a significant}} dose-response relationship (P < 0. 05) : the estimated relative risk associated with 2 - 5 <b>sunburns</b> in life was 1. 5, and with 6 or more was 2. 4. This observation extends the hitherto circumstantial evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and melanoma, and suggests that precautionary measures could prevent the development of this disease in a proportion of cases in fair-skinned populations. In spite of the widely held view that exposure to sunlight is related to melanoma, {{there is a lack of}} direct supporting evidence (Editorial, Lancet 1981). This may be related in part to problems in quantifying the harmful solar radiation that penetrates the epidermis during sun exposure. Ther...|$|R

25|$|<b>Sunburn</b> {{and skin}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause <b>sunburn,</b> but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light will deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a <b>sunburn.</b> A photon of infrared light will deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a <b>sunburn.</b>|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} the nature, incidence and molecular pathogenesis associated with non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). These comprise the basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), {{the most frequent}} though rarely metastasizing skin tumours, the more aggressive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), which are a problem especially in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. UV radiation is a key risk factor for both BSC and SCC. Whereas BCCs {{are associated with a}} limited number of <b>sunburns</b> (may be a one or more severe <b>sunburns),</b> SCCs usually occur after with recurrent UV exposure - with sun damage induced actinic keratoses as a well-established precursor. Each carcinoma may be associated with several chromosomal mutations and prevention is preferred to treatment, of which surgery is the first choice...|$|R

25|$|The main other {{hypotheses}} {{that have}} been put forward through history to explain the evolution of dark skin coloration relate to increased mortality due skin cancers, enhanced fitness {{as a result of}} protection against <b>sunburns,</b> and increasing benefits due to antibacterial properties of eumelanin.|$|R
