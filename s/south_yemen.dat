5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|YMD, YAR. Prior to Yemenite {{unification}} in 1990, North Yemen participated as the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> participated as the Yemen Democratic Republic (YMD) in the 1988 Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{recorded}} in the northeast African nations of Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, the Western Asian nations of Iran, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen (including the Yemeni island of Socotra), and the South Asian nations of India and Pakistan. Within India, it is documented in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} {{is native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely {{confined}} to the Horn of Africa today, the species historically ranged from Awash (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except {{the north and the}} northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The only evidence for its existence in the Arabian peninsula is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> and another in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March 1965, Douglas DC-3 VR-AAA {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair {{after it was}} groundlooped following a downwind landing at Hadibo Airport, Socotra, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{were killed}} in 1986 in the <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> Civil War. President Ali Nasser Muhammad fled {{to the north and}} was later sentenced to death for treason. A new {{government}} formed.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} meeting, Cuba also {{announced}} {{its decision to}} boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics. By the end of June, North Korea, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> Ethiopia and Angola had done the same.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Muhammad {{traveled}} to visit Yemen, where he stayed 16 months. He {{worked as an}} English teacher and learned how to speak Arabic. While there, in September 2008 he married Reena Abdullah Ahmed Farag, {{an elementary school teacher}} from <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Administration {{announced}} {{that they would be}} convening a Federal grand jury to consider an indictment against the four hijackers and Abbu Abbas who was believed to have fled to <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> (a pro-Soviet Arab nation with no diplomatic relations to the U.S.).|$|E
25|$|Arabic is the {{official}} language; English is also used in official and business circles. In the Mahra area (the extreme east), several non-Arabic languages (including Mehri) are spoken. When the former states of north and <b>south</b> <b>Yemen</b> were established, most resident minority groups departed.|$|E
25|$|The United States Geological Survey {{reported}} that 2,800 lives were lost and that another 1,500 were injured. In all, nearly 300 villages were severely {{damaged or destroyed}} and about 700,000 were made homeless. The earthquake was felt in North and much of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> as well as into Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Saleh became Yemen's first {{directly}} {{elected president}} in the 1999 presidential election, winning 96.2% of the vote. The only other candidate, Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha'abi, {{was the son of}} Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi, a former president of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> Though a member of Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Yemenis {{are mainly}} of Arab origin. When the former states of North and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> were established, most {{resident}} minority groups departed. Yemen {{is still a}} largely tribal society. In the northern, mountainous parts of the country, there are some 400 Zaidi tribes. There are also hereditary caste groups in urban areas such as Al-Akhdam.|$|E
25|$|Monte {{spent over}} three years in Fresnes and Poissy prisons. He was {{released}} in early 1989 and sent from France to <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> where he was reunited with his girlfriend Seda. Together they spent {{year and a half}} living underground in various countries of eastern Europe in relative poverty, as one regime after another disintegrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{domino effect}} of the {{revolutions}} of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The South African apartheid regime and Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. Argentina, Ghana, Indonesia, Nicaragua, South Korea, Suriname, Republic of China (Taiwan), and North and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> among many others elected democratic governments.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, in {{the wake}} of the {{departure}} of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate as well as the other states of the former Aden Protectorate were abolished. On 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> Since Yemeni unification in 1990, it has been part of the Republic of Yemen.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} in the north coincided with the Aden Emergency, which hastened the end of British rule in the south. On 30 November 1967, the state of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> was formed, comprising Aden and the former Protectorate of South Arabia. This socialist state was later officially known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and a programme of nationalisation was begun.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing regime {{suffered}} several coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, {{and a huge}} refugee problem. In 1977, Somalia, {{which had}} been receiving assistance and arms from the USSR, invaded Ethiopia in the Ogaden War, capturing part of the Ogaden region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the USSR, Cuba, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> East Germany, and North Korea. This included around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the {{two governments}} reached a full {{agreement}} on the joint governing of Yemen, and the countries were merged on 22 May 1990, with Saleh as President. The President of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> Ali Salim al-Beidh, became Vice President. A unified parliament was formed and a unity constitution was agreed upon. In the 1993 parliamentary election, the first held after unification, the General People's Congress won 122 of 301 seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the fictional Sheikdom of Ramat is not revealed in the novel, but by some hints (proximity to Aden and mountains) {{it is likely that}} Ramat was one of numerous principalities of <b>south</b> <b>Yemen</b> which still existed at the time when the book was finished. Sheik Ali Yusuf of Ramat was a graduate of an unnamed English public school. Agatha Christie spent considerable time in Iraq, whose last King, Feisal II, was a graduate of Harrow.|$|E
25|$|As a heraldic symbol {{identified}} with Arab nationalism, the Eagle of Saladin was subsequently adopted as the coats of arms of Iraq and Palestine. It {{has previously been}} the coat of arms of Libya, but later replaced by the Hawk of Quraish. The Hawk of Quraish was itself abandoned after the Libyan Civil War. The Eagle of Saladin {{was part of the}} coat of arms of <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> prior to that country's unification with North Yemen.|$|E
25|$|Yemeni {{ethnic groups}} are {{predominantly}} Arabs, followed by Afro-Arabs, South Asians and Europeans. When the former states of North and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> were established, most resident minority groups departed. Yemen is a largely tribal society. In the northern, mountainous {{parts of the}} country, there are 400 Zaidi tribes. There are also hereditary caste groups in urban areas such as Al-Akhdam. There are also Yemenis of Persian origin. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1975, he was {{released}} {{as part of the}} Peter Lorenz kidnapping and exchange together with Rolf Heissler, Verena Becker, Ingrid Siepmann and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and ended up in <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> On 21 July 1976, he was arrested again in Athens but first extradited to Germany on 1 October after a lengthy negotiation with Greece. On top of his original conviction he was given a further three years and three months. He {{was released}} in 1982 and returned to Greece two years later.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, Cuba {{became the}} {{eleventh}} country to announce its {{participation in the}} boycott, making front-page news in the United States {{because it was a}} “serious blow to boxing and baseball”. <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> was the twelfth country to remove itself from the event (May 27); the Los Angeles Times stated that this was due to their “Marxist” connections. North Korea was the thirteenth nation to boycott the 1984 Olympics. Ethiopia became the first African state to participate in the boycott, followed by Angola.|$|E
25|$|The multirole F.53s {{served in}} the ground-attack and {{reconnaissance}} roles {{as well as an}} air defence fighter, with Lightnings of No 6 Squadron RSAF carrying out ground-attack missions using rockets and bombs during a border dispute with <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> between December 1969 and May 1970. One F.53 (53–697) was shot down by Yemeni ground fire on 3 May 1970 during a reconnaissance mission, with the pilot ejecting successfully and being rescued by Saudi forces. Saudi Arabia received Northrop F-5E fighters from 1971, which resulted in the Lightnings relinquishing the ground-attack mission, concentrating on air defence, and to a lesser extent, reconnaissance.|$|E
25|$|Rolf Heissler (born 3 June 1948) became {{acquainted with}} Brigitte Mohnhaupt {{in the late}} 1960s and first {{became a member of}} the Munich Tupamaros and later joined the RAF {{together}} with his ex-wife Mohnhaupt, but he was also closely acquainted with the Movement 2 June. On 13 April 1971 he was involved in a bank robbery in Munich but was arrested. In 1972 he was sentenced to a six-year imprisonment. On 3 March 1975, he was released as part of the Peter Lorenz kidnapping and exchange together with Rolf Pohle, Verena Becker, Ingrid Siepmann and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and ended up in <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Haile Selassie's reign {{came to an}} end in 1974, when a Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist {{military}} junta, the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, deposed him, {{and established}} a one-party communist state, which was called the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the government of President of Somalia Siad Barre sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. By September 1977, the Somali army controlled 90% of the Ogaden, but was later forced to withdraw after Ethiopia's Derg received assistance from the USSR, Cuba, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> East Germany and North Korea, including around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009 Al Jazeera aired a {{documentary}} on toxic waste dumped in Somalia. A Somali journalist who studied {{the contents of the}} two-part Al Jazeer{{a documentary}}, The Toxic Truth, has concluded that Al Jazeera failed to rigorously research the story because one of the letters used to substantiate arms smuggling was issued on 15 April 1992, from the Ministry of Defence of People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, almost two years after <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> and North Yemen united to form the Republic of Yemen in May 1990. Another criticism of the documentary was that Al Jazeera did not allow Ali Mahdi Muhammad, former interim president of Somalia, to exercise his right of reply for being accused of authorising Italy based companies to build dumping grounds in Somalia.|$|E
25|$|Ingrid Siepmann (born 12 June 1944) was in 1974 {{sentenced to}} 13 {{years in prison}} for robbing a bank in Hamburg on 6 August 1973 {{together}} with Ilse Stachowiak. On 3 March 1975, she was released as part of the Peter Lorenz kidnapping and exchange together with Rolf Pohle, Verena Becker, Rolf Heissler and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann and ended up in <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> She then lived in a training camp for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP) and should {{have been part of the}} abduction of the Austrian textile industrial Walter Palmers in November 1977 but was not involved when it was put into action. She is believed to have been killed by an Israeli airstrike in 1982 in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The Ogaden War, {{also known}} as the Ethio-Somali War, was a Somali {{military}} offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden starting with the Somali Democratic Republic's invasion of Ethiopia. The Soviet Union disapproved of the invasion and ceased its support of Somalia to instead start supporting Ethiopia, whereas the United States conversely ceased its support of Ethiopia and started supporting Somalia. The war ended when the Americans brokered a ceasefire. Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies ($7 Billion), the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops, 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> also airlifted to reinforce Addis Ababa. Despite this, large parts of the Ogaden remained in Somali hands until 1980.|$|E
25|$|Today 45 {{countries}} around the world recognize the legitimacy of the Polisario over Western Sahara. Support for the Polisario Front came mostly from newly independent African states, such as Angola and Namibia. Most of the Arab world had supported Morocco; only Algeria and Libya have, at different times, given any significant support to Polisario. Iran recognized the SADR in 1980, Mauritania had recognized the SADR in 1984, and Syria and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> had supported the Polisario position on the conflict when they were all members of the Front of Refusal. Additionally, many third world non-aligned countries have supported the Polisario Front. Ties with Fretilin of East Timor (occupied by Indonesia in 1975) were exceptionally strong and remain so after that country's independence; both Polisario and Fretilin have argued that there are numerous historical parallels between the two conflicts.|$|E
25|$|After two years' deployment, Nilsen {{returned}} to Aldershot, where he passed his official catering exam before being deployed {{to serve as}} a cook for the British Army in Norway. In 1967, he was deployed to Aden, <b>South</b> <b>Yemen,</b> where he again served as a cook at the Al Mansoura Prison. This posting was more fraught with risks than his previous postings in West Germany or Norway, and Nilsen later recalled his regiment losing several men, often in ambushes en route to the army barracks. Nilsen was himself kidnapped by an Arab taxi driver, who beat him unconscious and placed him in the boot of his car. Upon being dragged out of the boot of the taxi, Nilsen grabbed a jack-handle and knocked the taxi driver to the floor before beating him unconscious. He then locked the man in the boot of the taxi.|$|E
25|$|Yemen was {{the home}} of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a {{thousand}} years and also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the fourth century. Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries, the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. <b>South</b> <b>Yemen</b> remained a British protectorate known as the Aden Protectorate until 1967 when it became an independent state and later, a Marxist state. The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is {{a country}} {{situated}} in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or <b>South</b> <b>Yemen)</b> are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, {{and in the early}} 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union was {{dissolved}} in December 1991, resulting in 11 new countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) which had declared their {{independence from the}} Soviet Union {{in the course of}} the year, while the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) regained their independence. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, became Russia in December 1991. Communism was abandoned in Albania and Yugoslavia between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia split into five successor states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was later renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 and eventually split into two states, Serbia and Montenegro, in 2006. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the partially recognised state of Kosovo in 2008. Czechoslovakia was dissolved three years after the end of Communist rule, splitting peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1992. The impact was felt in dozens of Socialist countries. Communism was abandoned in countries such as Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mongolia (which democratically re-elected a Communist government that ran the country until 1996) and <b>South</b> <b>Yemen.</b> The collapse of Communism (and of the Soviet Union) led commentators to declare the end of the Cold War.|$|E
