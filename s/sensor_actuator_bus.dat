40|$|A novel {{approach}} for placement of <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> {{in control of}} flexible space structures is developed. Using an approximation of the control forces and output measurements by spatially continuous functions, the approach follows a nonlinear programming technique to determine optimal locations for <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators.</b> Two different criteria are considered for the placement of <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators.</b> The first criterion optimizes {{the location of the}} <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> in order to move the transmission zeros of the system farther {{to the left of the}} imaginary axis. The second criterion, however, places the <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> to optimize a function of the singular values of the Hankel matrix, which includes both measures of controllability and observability. Moreover, the effect of actuator dynamics in the placement of <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> are {{critical}} components of several embedded systems (ES) and can trigger {{the incidence of}} catastrophic events [1 - 3]. <b>Sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> faults detection is difficult [2, 3] and impacts critically the system performance. While integrating <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> {{with the rest of}} (sub) system, {{there is a need to}} identify all failure modes and rectify them. Several researchers have addressed software integration issues [6, 7]; however <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> integration issues were not addressed so far. This paper focuses on the problem of integration testing of <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> in ES. A fault model, applicable to both <b>sensors</b> and <b>actuators</b> is proposed based on embedded system model in [12] and some of the observed faults are described. They are similar to the control flow and data flow faults [10]. The integration testing of <b>sensor</b> / <b>actuator</b> within ES is the problem of diagnosing faulty machine in a sequence of two CFSM [11]. For solving the diagnostic methodology [13] is used. The integration testing of <b>sensors</b> / <b>actuators</b> is a subset of general diagnostic problem. The sensor/actuator integration method is described with an example and shows that solution exists for the case of integration. Manifestation of faults in real interfaces is described from integration point of view...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{statistical}} theoretical framework for incorporation of <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> faults in dynamic simulations of wastewater treatment operation. <b>Sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> faults and failures are often neglected in simulations for control strategy development and testing, {{although it is}} well known that they represent a significant obstacle for realising control at full-scale facilities. The framework for incorporating faults and failures is based on Markov chains and displays the appealing property of easy transition of <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> history into a model for fault generation.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for designing cost-effective optimal <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> configurations useful for structural model updating and health monitoring purposes. The optimal <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> configuration is selected {{such that the}} resulting measured data are most informative {{about the condition of}} the structure. This selection is based on an information entropy measure of the uncertainty in the model parameter estimates obtained using a statistical system identification methodology. The optimal <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> configuration is selected as the one that minimizes the information entropy. A discrete optimization problem arises which is solved efficiently using genetic algorithms. This study also addresses important issues related to robustness of the optimal <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> configuration to unavoidable uncertainties in the structural model, as well as issues related to the optimal <b>sensor</b> and <b>actuator</b> configurations designed to monitor multiple damage scenarios.
