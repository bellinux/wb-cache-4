5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the <b>structural</b> <b>steelwork</b> erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E
25|$|Bosa Contracts {{were invited}} by Hall Construction Limited and Wates to provide {{recommendations}} {{to overcome the}} specific problems in the structural concrete elements including beams and retaining walls within the original structure. With the assistance of Sika Ltd and EPMS proposals and costings were produced using Sika Monotop for concrete repairs, Icosit Activ Primers for <b>structural</b> <b>steelwork</b> and a Vapour-Proof Sika 1 Structural Waterproofing System for ground retaining walls.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contract}} for the station buildings was awarded to Edward Wood and Sons of Derby on 23 January 1903, who were also awarded the {{contract for}} the buildings on platforms 1 and 2 on 16 September 1903. The {{contract for the}} buildings on platforms 4 and 5 was awarded to Kirk, Knight & Co of Sleaford on 18 June 1903, who were also responsible for building the parcels office (Forward House) on Station Street, which opened in November 1903.

40|$|Aims principally at {{students}} who are following courses in steelwork design {{as well as at}} practicing professionals who are interested in the subject. The book consists of design calculations of building elements such as beams, columns, and connections, using locally produced steel sections. Step by step calculations in the design of these elements are presented here to assist civil engineering students and interested professionals alike. The design is based on BS 5950 : Part 1 : 1990 <b>Structural</b> use of <b>steelwork</b> in buildings using the dimensions and properties of hot-rolled steel sections produced locally by PERWAJA Steel Sdn.

40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is to provide {{students}} and practicing engineers with a guide of structural steel design to meet the requirement of BS 5950 :Part 1 : 2000 <b>Structural</b> Use of <b>Steelwork</b> in Building. The emphasis has been to illustrate the clauses in the code rather than to match practical cases exactly. The {{first part of the}} book gives basic design concepts of structural elements comprising beam, column, connection, roof truss, and plate girder. In the second part, it presents worked examples of design of structural steel elements which are of commonly used in building frame structures. The examples have different design problem, which require different approach of loading analysis and design formula...|$|R
40|$|Early finding {{shows that}} Civil Engineering {{students}} of KUiTTHO face difficulties {{when it comes}} to cogniti ve perceptions of concepts and procedures of Steel Structural Design subject. Due to the complex and long derived calculations, students are easily confused and tend to loose interest and concentration in this subject. In order to help such ones, a programme called PRRK was built using Microsoft Excel software for the design of steel beam. PRRK is prepared based on the design procedures adopted by British Standard Institutions BS 5950, <b>Structural</b> Use of <b>Steelwork</b> in Building. A group of twenty one final semester Diploma students from Civil Engineering Department of KUiTTHO taking up Structure Design were asked to evaluate the programme. Evaluation was done on the content, user friendliness and feasibility of the programme using mean score method. The researcher also tried to see if there existed any relationship between the experiences of computer usage in studies by students with their evaluation of the PRRK. Mean score results reveals that the programme content is good, user friendly and feasible. Spearman Correlations test revealed that there is no significant relationship between the experiences of computer usage in studies by students with their evaluation of the PRRK...|$|R
500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} involved building 18 new platforms with two track bays to handle parcels above this, along with a signal and communications building and various staff offices. The parcel deck was reinforced by 5,500 tons of <b>structural</b> <b>steelwork.</b> The signalling on the main routes leading {{out of the station}} was completely reworked along with the electrification of the lines, including the British Rail Automatic Warning System. Fifteen platforms had been complete by 1966, and the full electric service began on 3 January. A fully automated parcel depot, sited above platforms 3 to 18, opened on 7 August 1966.
