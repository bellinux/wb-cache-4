25|$|Three sets of grades {{exist in}} Swedish {{universities}} and university colleges. Some universities have introduced a seven-grade scale (A-F, Fx), that {{similar to the}} ECTS scale, but with a criterion-referenced grading instead of relative grading. The most common scale is a three-grade scale that consists of U (Underkänd in Swedish, fail), G (Godkänd, pass) and VG (Väl godkänd, pass with distinction). In this set VG is the highest. The other grade set consists of (U, 3, 4, 5) where 5 is the highest. This grade set is normally given in courses within technical professional degrees.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the “Escuela Nueva ” model (New School or EN) on student achievement, using test score data from SABER 2002 and 2005, a national standardized test administered to 5 th and 9 th graders in Colombia. EN is an educational model originally designed to improve the effectiveness of rural schools. It is characterized by multigrade classrooms (i. e., one instructor teaches students in various grades in the same classroom), a child-centered curriculum, flexible <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> and promotion, intensive teacher training, and parental involvement. To mitigate the concerns about systematic selection of schools into EN that might bias the estimations of the EN impact, this study implements a school fixed effects model that controls for time-invariant characteristics within the school. Results show that among schools that switched models between 2002 and 2005, the cohorts of 5 th grade students exposed to EN have on average 0. 135 of a standard deviation higher language test scores than cohorts exposed to other models, while there is no statistically significant impact on switching to EN for 9 th graders. The impact of EN is largest among rural schools and the poorest schools in the sample. The paper also implements propensity score matching methods to identify a control group of schools that have similar probabilities of implementing EN...|$|E
40|$|Background Histopathological grading of adenoid cystic {{carcinoma}} (ACC) is {{a controversial}} issue. It is {{generally agreed that}} solid type ACC has a relatively poor prognosis. However, the amount of solid regions within this often mixed type tumor that predicts a poor prognosis is not firmly established. Some authors stipulate {{that the presence of}} a solid component regardless of the amount is a poor prognosticator where others argue that the amount should be taken into consideration. Two grading systems most commonly used are those described by Perzin et al. /Szanto et al. and Spiro et al., respectively. They report that prognosis of ACC is poor if > 30 % and > 50 % of the tumor volume has a solid growth pattern, respectively. Material and methods The described grading systems are applied to a series of 81 surgically treated cases of ACC at the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Moreover, we introduced an alternative grading system, in which the presence of a solid component, irrespective of its amount, is considered. All three <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> were tested for inter-observer concordance and prediction of prognosis. Results Inter-observer concordance for grading ACC according to Perzin et al. /Szanto et al. and Spiro et al., proved to be moderate with Kappa Scores of 0. 393 and 0. 433, respectively. Our alternative grading system yielded inter-observer concordance with a Cohen’s kappa result of 0. 990. All systems were comparable in discriminating patients with poor clinical outcome. Histopathological grade proved to be an independent prognosticator. Conclusion The presence of any solid component in ACC is a negative prognosticator, and can histopathologically be diagnosed with a high reliability. These results suggest to merely register {{the presence or absence of}} a solid tumor component since its inter-observer variability is very low, its reproducibility is high and its predictive value is comparable to the traditional grading systems used...|$|E
40|$|The circumstances, {{evaluation}} and {{results of the}} management of 67 colonic and rectal injuries during the period 1992 - 2003 in Clinical Centre of Podgorica are presented. In 32 war and 37 civilian injuries to colon, several systems of the severity trauma determination, as well as <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> and classification of injuries of colon were evaluated, and the surgical access according to achieved results was investigated {{in order to determine}} the use of enetrostomy in the management of these injuries. From the presented and statistically evaluated results, it can be concluded that Flint‘s 3 grade classification can be used as the most reliable indicative and prognostic system. For the success of One stage surgical procedure, the most critical fact is differentiation between Flint‘s Grade I and II (Chi Square 4. 514; P) as well between Grade II and III. That means that by using One stage procedure, unfavourable results may be expected not only in Grade II, but as well in border cases between II and III. Also, according to the presented results, there were not differences observed in the success of management between Grade II and III (Chi Square 0. 678; P 0. 05). That means that using Two stage procedure, unfavorable results can be prevented not only in the borderline cases between Grades II and III, but also in the Grade III. Two stage surgical approach in the repair of injured colon remains valuable and useful surgical procedure, even in spite of success of surgical technology and operative technique, in cases with severe and multiple abdominal injuries, and in borderline decision making. These procedures are also inevitable in the management of any complication of primary repair of the colonic wound. Using rational {{evaluation and}} good surgical technique, primary repair of can be used in almost 50 % of civilian and war injuries of colon...|$|E

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of up-to-date concepts of the human neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the digestive system, which are a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. The review summarizes {{the information about the}} specifics of the recent histological classifications and criteria of diagnosis the different types of neuroendocrine neoplasms accounting histological and immunohistochemical parameters. In the light of these criteria, current issues of the nomenclature, as well as <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> and staging are discussed. Well-differentiated NETs generally present characteristic histopathological features with nests, trabecular or gland-like formations, low mitotic activity and Ki- 67 labeling indices and are mostly classified as either G 1 or G 2 NET. In contrast, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas have diffuse growth pattern, high-grade nuclear atypia and cellular proliferation, necrosis. They are always classified as G 3 and further subclassified into small-cell or large-cell types based on their histological features. Immunohistochemistry is a powerful tool in confirming neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor cells by the expression of chromogranin A and/or synaptophysin. The grade (G) is based on the proliferative activity of the tumor assessed by the mitotic rate or by Ki- 67 immunohistochemistry. Several markers are useful in the identification of a primary organ of NETs in metastatic lesions are also discussed. NETs represent challenging neoplasms in terms of clinical management and prognosis assessment. Morphology alone and immunophenotypic features have no specific predictive implications. Ki- 67 has been proven the only significant prognostic marker and can predict response to therapy. Additionally, data on key signaling pathways and potential predictive molecular markers involved in the development of neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are presented in this review. New molecular targeted therapies have become available in patients with NETs. Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are expressed by these tumors and show high affinity for somatostatin analogues. Immunohistochemical positive staining, especially of the subtype SSTR 2 А, {{has been shown to be}} well associated with therapeutic response to somatostatin analogue therapy. Detecting the expression of SSTRs helps to predict not only the efficacy of treatment but also the prognosis in NETs. The PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a crucial role in development of neuroendocrine neoplasms and is targeted by specific inhibitors. However, the exact cellular molecules, which may help predict response, their expression levels and prognostic values are still to be defined. Determining specific prognostic and predictive molecular markers in NETs can significantly improve biological and morphological characterization of individual neuroendocrine neoplasms and identification of patients that may benefit from targeted therapy...|$|E
