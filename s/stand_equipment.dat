40|$|The present paper {{considers}} a new measurement concept of modeling measuring instruments for gyro-free {{determination of the}} parameters of moving objects. The proposed approach eliminates the disadvantages of the existing measuring instruments since it is based, on one hand, on a considerably simplified mechanical module, {{and on the other}} hand, on the advanced achievements in the area of nanotechnologies, microprocessor and computer equipment. A specific measuring system intended for measuring the trim, heel, roll, and pitch of a ship has been developed in compliance with the basic principles of this concept. The high dynamic accuracy of this measuring system is ensured by an additional measurement channel operating in parallel with the main channel. The operating principle of the additional measurement channel is based on an appropriate correction algorithm using signals from linear MEMS accelerometers. The presented results from the tests carried out by means of <b>stand</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in the form of a}} hexapod of six degrees of freedom prove the effectiveness of the proposed measurement concep...|$|E
40|$|Rolling {{process is}} a key step in the {{production}} of flat steel products. Because of automation commonly implemented in flat product rolling mills, the products should meet the requirements of tight tolerances. one of the major defects observed in the rolling process is flatness and lack of attainment of the desired surface profile due to deflection of the rolls. The spatial shape and dimensions of the roll gap are influenced by the elastic deformation of all parts of the rolling <b>stand</b> <b>equipment</b> affected by the roll pressure. The current study aims to determine the variation of the deflection in rolls in a two high mill with varying percentage reduction of the sheet i. e, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % on annealed and non-annealed IF steel sheet and analyzing possible solutions to reduce the elastic deflection of rolls with special emphasis on cambering and modelling of the same in Abaqus CAE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} leaning posture on the kitchen counter, which was observed during dishwashing in a kitchen, on subjective discomfort and muscle activity in the low back and legs. Twelve female volunteers were asked to wash plates for 30 min in each of three working postures: (a) without support (No support), (b) supported by the kitchen counter (Counter), and (c) supported by a standing aid which was a <b>stand</b> <b>equipment</b> to support the shins and the counter (Aid and counter). In the “Aid and counter ” posture, {{the angle of the}} bent trunk and the muscle activity in the low back were less than that in the “Counter ” posture, which was less than that in the “No support ” posture. Also, the muscle activities in the legs were greater in the “Counter” and “No support ” postures than in the “Aid and counter ” posture. We concluded that the effects of leaning posture on the kitchen counter were not enough to decrease the workload on the low back and legs. To improve the comfort of the dishwashing task, new measures, such as the standing aid, are needed...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{systems are}} {{susceptible}} to fires caused by particle and nonvolatile residue (NVR) contaminants, therefore cleaning and verification is essential for system safety.. Cleaning solvents used on oxygen system components must be either nonflammable in pure oxygen or complete removal must be assured for system safety.. CFC - 113 was the solvent of choice before 1996 because it was effective, least toxic, compatible with most materials of construction, and non]reactive with oxygen. When CFC - 113 was phased out in 1996, HCFC - 225 was selected as an interim replacement for cleaning propulsion oxygen systems at NASA. HCFC- 225 production phase-out date is 01 / 01 / 2015. HCFC] 225 (AK] 225 G) is used extensively at Marshall Space Flight Center and Stennis Space Center for cleaning and NVR verification on large propulsion oxygen systems, and propulsion test stands and ground support equipment.. Many components are too large for ultrasonic agitation - necessary for effective aqueous cleaning and NVR sampling.. Test <b>stand</b> <b>equipment</b> must be cleaned prior to installation of test hardware. Many items must be cleaned by wipe or flush in situ where complete removal of a flammable solvent cannot be assured. The search for a replacement solvent for these applications is ongoing...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} component and system performance testing associated with the Vitrification Facility (VF) following construction turnover. The VF at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) was designed to convert stored radioactive waste into a stable glass form for eventual disposal in a federal repository. Following an initial Functional and Checkout Testing of Systems (FACTS) Program and subsequent conversion of test <b>stand</b> <b>equipment</b> into the final VF, a testing program was executed to demonstrate successful performance of the components, subsystems, and systems {{that make up the}} vitrification process. Systems were started up and brought on line as construction was completed, until integrated system operation could be demonstrated to produce borosilicate glass using nonradioactive waste simulant. Integrated system testing and operation culminated with a successful Operational Readiness Review (ORR) and Department of Energy (DOE) approval to initiate vitrification of high-level waste (HLW) on June 19, 1996. Performance and integrated operational test runs conducted during the test program provided a means for critical examination, observation, and evaluation of the vitrification system. Test data taken for each Test Instruction Procedure (TIP) was used to evaluate component performance against system design and acceptance criteria, while test observations were used to correct, modify, or improve system operation. This process was critical in establishing operating conditions for the entire vitrification process...|$|E

40|$|Diesel fuel is {{a widely}} used fossil fuel {{throughout}} numerous and various fields of application. A formidable alternative to diesel fuel is {{what is known as}} Biodiesel. Its benefits include decreased harmful emissions as well as being an inherently renewable resource, as the original source of the fuel is farm produce. Comprehensive evaluations of various biodiesel fuels', one purchased and one "home-made", performance and physical characteristics are evaluated to those of regular petroleum D- 2 diesel. A 5 HP diesel engine and performance testing equipment with an adequate data acquisition set-up was used to test each fuel's performance. The soy oil based biodiesel fuel that was purchased from a commercial manufacturer did not compare well with D- 2 diesel in these tests, but overall it performed sufficiently for most general applications where performance is not of great concern. The other, the home-made canola oil based biodiesel, performed remarkably well and with statistically significant similarity to that of D- 2 diesel.

The optimum structure of computer-aided stand has been proposed, {{the structure of the}} precise rotation speed stabilization system on base of the contactless electric drive with digital correction on the side of master action has been proposed. The laser goniometric measurement method has been improved. Thenew procedure for determining position of the measuring axle in the ring laser has been proposed. The experimental prototype of computer-aided stand having the increased accuracy, quick-action and widened functional possibilities has been developed. The large amount of the different measurement facilities has been performed on the new qualitative level. The developed programmed synthesizer can be used as an independent device for generation of the signals in the information-measuring systems and for control of the electric drives. The investigation results have been introduced in the plant made during performing the planned research works.
