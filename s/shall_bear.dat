[...] On January 4, 1859, {{he was asked to}} deliver the final address in the Old Senate Chamber; in the speech, he expressed his desire that the Congress find a solution that would preserve the Union. During its half century in the chamber, the Senate had grown from 32 to 64 members. During those years, he observed, the Constitution had [...] "survived peace and war, prosperity and adversity" [...] to protect [...] "the larger personal freedom compatible with public order." [...] Breckinridge expressed hope that eventually [...] "another Senate, in another age, <b>shall</b> <b>bear</b> to a new and larger Chamber, this Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that the last generation of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the Representatives of American States, still united, prosperous, and free." [...] Breckinridge then led a procession to the new chamber. Breckinridge opposed the idea that the federal government could coerce action by a state, but maintained that secession, while legal, was not the solution to the country's problems.|$|E

500|$|Matthew's account {{suggests}} that the Magi knew from the star that the [...] "king of the Jews" [...] had been born even before they arrived in Jerusalem. They present Jesus with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and as verse 11 describes: [...] "they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him". In a dream, they are warned not to return to Jerusalem, so they leave for their own country by another route. When Herod realizes he has been tricked, he orders the execution of all male children in Bethlehem [...] "two years old and younger," [...] based on the age the child could be {{in regard to the}} information the magi had given him concerning the time the star first appeared. Joseph, warned in a dream, takes his family to Egypt for their safety. The Gospel links the escape to a verse from scripture, which it interprets as a prophecy: [...] "Out of Egypt I called my son." [...] This was a reference to the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses, so the quote {{suggests that}} Matthew saw the life of Jesus as recapitulating the story of the Jewish people, with Judea representing Egypt and Herod standing in for pharaoh. After Herod dies, Joseph and his family return from Egypt, and settle in Nazareth in Galilee. This is also said to be a fulfillment of a prophecy ("He will be called a Nazorean," [...] (NRSV) which could be attributed to Judges 13:5 regarding the birth of Samson and the Narazite vow. The word [...] "Nazareth" [...] is related to the word [...] "netzer" [...] which means [...] "sprout", and which some Bible commentators think refers to Isaiah 11:1, [...] "And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots <b>shall</b> <b>bear</b> fruit."

2500|$|Noting that [...] (20:12 in NJSP) commands, [...] "Honor {{your father}} and your mother," [...] and [...] directs, [...] "Honor the Lord with your substance," [...] the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that Scripture thus likens the honor due to parents to that due to God. Similarly, as [...] commands, [...] "You shall fear {{your father and}} mother," [...] and [...] commands, [...] "The Lord your God you shall fear and you shall serve," [...] Scripture likens the fear of parents to the fear of God. And as [...] commands, [...] "He that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death," [...] and [...] commands, [...] "Whoever curses his God <b>shall</b> <b>bear</b> his sin," [...] Scripture likens cursing parents to cursing God. But the Baraita conceded that with respect to {{striking}} (which [...] addresses with regard to parents), that it is certainly impossible (with respect to God). The Baraita concluded that these comparisons between parents and God are only logical, since the three (God, the mother, and the father) are partners in creation of the child. For the Rabbis taught in a Baraita {{that there are three}} partners {{in the creation of a}} person – God, the father, and the mother. When one honors one's father and mother, God considers it as if God had dwelt among them and they had honored God. And a Tanna taught before Rav Nachman that when one vexes one's father and mother, God considers it right not to dwell among them, for had God dwelt among them, they would have vexed God.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} Sammael (identified with Satan) complained to God that God {{had given him}} power over all {{the nations of the}} world except for Israel. God told Sammael that he had power over Israel on the Day of Atonement if and only if they had any sin. Therefore, Israel gave Sammael a present on the Day of Atonement, as [...] says, [...] "One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for Azazel" [...] (identified with Satan or Sammael). The lot for God was the {{offering}} of a burnt offering, and the lot for Azazel was the goat as a sin offering, for all the iniquities of Israel were upon it, as [...] says, [...] "And the goat <b>shall</b> <b>bear</b> upon him all their iniquities." [...] Sammael found no sin among them on the Day of Atonement and complained to God that they were like the ministering angels in heaven. Just as the ministering angels have bare feet, so have the Israelites bare feet on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have neither food nor drink, so the Israelites have neither food nor drink on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have no joints, likewise the Israelites stand on their feet. Just as the ministering angels are at peace with each other, so the Israelites are at peace with each other on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels are innocent of all sin on the Day of Atonement, so are the Israelites innocent of all sin on the Day of Atonement. On that day, God hears their prayers rather than the charges of their accuser, and God makes atonement for all the people, as [...] says, [...] "And he shall make atonement for the holy place." ...|$|E
