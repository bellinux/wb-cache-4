50|$|In {{rural areas}} where {{municipal}} water {{systems are not}} available, dry hydrants are used to supply water for fighting fires. A dry hydrant is analogous to a standpipe. A dry hydrant is usually an unpressurized, permanently installed pipe that has one end below the water level of a lake or pond. This end usually has a strainer to prevent debris from entering the pipe. The other end is above ground and has a hard <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector.</b> When needed, a pumper fire engine will pump from the lake or pond by drafting water. This is done by vacuuming {{the air out of}} the dry hydrant, hard sleeve, and the fire engine pump with a primer. Because lower pressure now exists at the pump intake, atmospheric pressure on the water and the weight of the water forces water into part of the dry hydrant above water, into the hard sleeve, and finally into the pump. This water can then be pumped by the engine's centrifugal pump.|$|E

The objectives of the investigation are to study the bond mechanism of grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> and to study the effects of confinement provided by the grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector.</b> Two different configurations (welded bar sleeve and tapered sleeve) of <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> were used in this study. Various sleeve diameters were used in this research to study their effects on the bond mechanism. The bond failure progression inside the grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> was observed visually as halved welded steel bar connector and tapered head connector were used. The experimental works consisted two phases where phase I was the testing of plain grouted sleeve. Phase II involved the testing steel fibre reinforced grout sleeve. Steel fibres of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 % were introduced to the connector in a way so the grout inside the connector will exhibit post-cracking behaviour. Pull-out tests were carried out and it was observed that the performance of tapered sleeve was better than welded bar sleeve due to higher confinement level. The provision of sufficient confinement stress able to delay the development of splitting cracks. The test result showed that welded bar sleeve was governed by splitting failure mode, whereas tapered sleeve failed in pull-out failure mode...|$|E
40|$|The grouted splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> system takes {{advantage}} of the bond-slip resistance of the grout and the mechanical gripping of reinforcement bars to provide resistance to tensile force. In this system, grout acts as a load-transferring medium and bonding material between the bars and sleeve. This study adopted the end-to-end rebars connection method to investigate the effect of development length and sleeve diameter on the bonding performance of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector.</b> The end-to-end method refers to the condition where reinforcement bars are inserted into the sleeve from both ends and meet at the centre before grout is filled. Eight specimens of grouted splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> were tested under tensile load to determine their performance. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> was designed using 5 mm thick circular hollow section (CHS) steel pipe and consisted of one external and two internal sleeves. The tensile test results show that connectors with a smaller external and internal sleeve diameter appear to provide better bonding performance. Three types of failure were observed in this research, which are bar fracture (outside the sleeve), bar pullout, and internal sleeve pullout. With reference to these failure types, the development length of 200 mm is the optimum value due to its bar fracture type, which indicates that the tensile capacity of the connector is higher than the reinforcement bar. It is found that the performance of the grouted splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> is influenced by the development length of the reinforcement bar and the diameter of the sleeve. ...|$|E
40|$|A sleeve {{combined}} with grout is a cylindrical connector used to join two discontinuous steel reinforcement bars without complying {{to the conventional}} lap length. It acts as the connection for joining steel reinforcement bars to safely transfer the tensile force from one reinforcement bar to the other to ensure the integrity of a structural frame system. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the behavior and the feasibility of fifteen new proposed grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> for the connection of precast concrete components. The connectors were tested to failure under incremental tensile load. The configurations of the grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> were varied and their tensile performances were evaluated in terms of the ultimate tensile resistance, stiffness, yield strength, ductility and failure modes. The results show that the grouted splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> could provide comparable ultimate tensile strength of the connected steel bars. It is seen that the bond between bar-and-grout,and also between grout-and-sleeve are essential {{to the success of the}} tensile load transfer between the steel bars. It is also seen that the confinement provided by the sleeve enhances the bar-and-grout bond dramatically by controlling the splitting cracks...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{investigate}} the use of precast concrete connections is a topic of growing demand. The precast structural members are normally connected via lapping of reinforcement bar. However, {{the large numbers of}} connections that are required in precast concrete system pose problems in term of strength and the failure of the connection. The application of grouted splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> in the market is fast gaining popularity. The adoption of existing splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> are not economics as these connectors in the market are proprietary and purchased from foreign country. The stability of precast concrete structure depends on the continuity between the structural member and the connection, thus the connection must exhibit the ability of transferring loads, possess sufficient strength and ductility and easy to handle and simple to erect. In this research, the connections, were the main criteria to be observed based on their performance, shear, bending and the connection failure. This research aims to develop a connection in precast wall by using different number of grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors,</b> to test the bond strength of a connection with spiral bar connectors in the wall under four point bending test and to determine the types and behavior of failure that may occur in the connection and wall panel. Based on the study conducted, the connectors were inserted in three precast wall with same size each to form one wall panel. These wall panels were tested under four point bending test in order to review the performance of the connection between the walls. In four point bending test, a uniform maximum two point loads were applied {{on the top of the}} wall panel to check the connection failure and shear failure in the wall. After tested, the results show that the grout failure occurred on the gap between the wall connections. There was deflection on the precast wall panel and no shear failure occurred at the supports.

30|$|In {{the laser}} system, see Figure  2, the MOPA is {{followed}} by an optical isolator (Thorlabs) and a 99 : 1 fiber splitter, where few mW are separated from the main beam for frequency measurements with the frequency comb {{that is part of}} another payload aboard the TEXUS 54 mission. A second fiber splitter divides the main beam into pump and probe beam for modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS). The probe beam is connected to a fiber-coupled PPLN wave guide module (NTT Electronics) for second harmonic generation. The pump beam is frequency shifted by 150  MHz using a fiber-coupled AOM (Gooch & Housego) to shift spurious interference between pump and probe beam outside the detection bandwidth of the MTS signal. The frequency-shifted beam is then phase-modulated at ≈ 300  kHz by a fiber-coupled EOM (Jenoptik) and will later also be frequency-doubled by a second SHG module. Taking nominal losses of the components, splice connections and the conversion efficiency of the SHG modules into account, we expect an optical power of 10  mW and 3  mW for the pump and probe beam at 532  nm, respectively, which is sufficient for saturation spectroscopy. The power of the pump beam can be stabilized by using a voltage controlled attenuator (VCA) and a feedback loop (see Figure  2). Several fiber taps are used for power monitoring at various positions in the laser system during flight. The pump and probe beam are finally guided from the laser module to the spectroscopy module by polarization maintaining fibers at 1, 064  nm and mating <b>sleeves</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental tests on splice connectors joining two main steel bars. The objective was to investigate bond strength, slip and failure modes of the connected steel bars confined by the grouted sleeve connectors. A total of 21 grouted splice connectors were tested until failure under increasing axial load. Each <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> consisted of steel pipe, steel spiral with vertical bars and cement grout. The key parameter was the diameter of the spiral reinforcement which confined the splicing of two steel reinforcement bars. The effects of spiral diameter of 35, 45, 55, 65, 75 and 85 mm on the bond strength and slip were critically investigated. The test results indicate that specimens with smaller spiral reinforcement accompanied by four shear keys provide greater bond strength. The improvement in bond strength is due to the confinement provided by the spiral reinforcement which eventually increases the axial tension capacity of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector...</b>|$|E

The connector utilized mild steel pipe as sleeve where the sleeve consists of external and internal sleeve with the diameter of the external sleeve is larger than internal sleeve. The mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in the sleeve. The test shows that, there are two modes of failure which were bar slipped and bar fractured outside the sleeve. Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside the sleeve and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted sleeve connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral.

Various types of connections have been developed by previous researchers to improve the existing connections in the market. This study was conducted to develop a new splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector,</b> using spiral and elongated bar, which can produce comparable bond strength with the tensile capacity of reinforced bars. In the first phase of the study, 52 specimens were tested under tensile loads until all specimens reached their ultimate failure state. Based on the study conducted, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 specimens with bar embedment length of 200 mm, spiral inner diameter of 65 mm, four elongated bars of Y 10 inside the spiral bar, and use of grout was selected. In phase 2, the selected splice <b>sleeve</b> <b>connector</b> was used in the precast concrete wall panel system. Then, the connector was tested under shear loads to study the connection’s performance. In this phase, three monolithic specimens, three specimens with Nisso Master Builders (NMB) connectors, and three specimens with the proposed connector were tested. The performance of connections under tensile and shear loads was evaluated based on the ultimate loading capacity, displacement, strain, stress and failure mode. The results show that the wall specimens using spiral and elongated bar connectors, ES- 65 - 4 - 200 achieve satisfactory structural performance with the ultimate shear capacity 28 % higher than monolithic wall and NMB wall connection.

40|$|Overhead and {{underground}} line {{work in the}} electric power industry is physically very strenuous and can expose workers to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), particularly in the upper extremity. Crimping compression connectors—such as <b>sleeve</b> <b>connectors</b> and lugs—and cutting cables {{are two of the}} most frequent tasks that line workers perform. Line workers at many utilities in the US crimp connectors and cut cable with long-handled manual tools. However, the actual magnitude of the forces applied to the handles of these tools is not known. The objectives of this laboratory study were to measure the forces applied to the handles of a manual press and a manual cutter in order to connect typical wire gauges and cut common cables, respectively. The handles of the manual press and cutter were attached to the drive cylinder and load cell of an Instrom Material Testing System, and peak forces exerted against the handles were measured. Results showed that the outer die of the manual press required about 50 % more handle force than crimping connectors with the inner die location. The peak handle forces required to cut aluminum conductor cable as large as 2 cm diameter exceeded 500 N and were about 200 N greater than the peak forces to compress connectors manually. When the peak force data were compared to strength capabilities reported in the literature, less than 1 % of the general population was found to have the maximum strength to manually make one crimp on a common overhead connector. Less than 1 % and approximately 50 % of the female and male general population, respectively, were found to have the maximum strength to manually cut a cable with a 2 cm diameter conductor. Handle force data from this study provide a biomechanical framework for explaining how the job demands of overhead and {{underground line}} workers could possibly cause MSDs. Relevance to industry Electric power utilities can review their work practices and tools in order to determine whether they can reduce the exposure of their workers to risk factors of MSDs, as well as reduce their cost of health care.

40|$|Purpose: of this paper: The check valve, {{which is}} {{composed}} of <b>sleeve,</b> <b>connector</b> and poppet, is the one direction valve that blocks fluid flow. The sleeve and connector are constrained and fixed. But {{the position of the}} poppet is swiftly moved by the direction of the fluid pressure. In this check valve, water hammer is applied to the poppet by rapid pressure change. Impact of the water is a reason why the fracture of the poppet is occurred. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element method (FEM), the design of the poppet was verified and modified to avoid the fracture. The diameter of the flow path in the poppet decreased from 6. 0 mm to 5. 0 mm. By CFD, differential pressure of the modified design was compared with differential pressure of the initial design. So, safety for the structure of the poppet was analyzed and verified using available commercial software MSC. MARC. Based on the numerical results, differential pressure increased about 8. 7 %. However, Von Mises stress of the old poppet with 6. 0 mm was two times that of the new poppet. It is verified and disclosed from the experiment results that the newly modified poppet had no problem being used in a practical product. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, pressure loss was calculated by CFD. As such, safety for the structure of the poppet was analyzed and verified using available commercial software MSC. MARCFindings: Safety and pressure loss of the modified design are obtained from CFD and FEM. Research limitations/implications: CFD is very complicated in regards to boundary and surface condition of the wall such as surface roughness. Therefore, calculated results using CFD are definitely verified by practical experimentation. Practical implications: When the design is modified, the number and expense of the experiment is reduced.
