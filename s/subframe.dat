25|$|The Toronado was GM's first <b>subframe</b> automobile, {{which means}} it was partly unitized, and used a <b>subframe</b> that ended at the forward end of the rear {{suspension}} leaf springs, serving as an attachment point for the springs. It carried the powertrain, front suspension and floorpan, allowing greater isolation of road and engine harshness (the design was conceptually similar to the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird that would debut for 1967).|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change was}} the front <b>subframe</b> {{assembly}} — {{as compared with}} Ford, Chrysler and AMC, in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate <b>subframe</b> housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM's full-size, full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the front <b>subframe</b> design was unique for the Nova, the Camaro introduced a year earlier {{was the first to}} incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and head restraints. There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy Nova fell by half. In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car's name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.|$|E
25|$|The Mark IV, {{launched}} in 1976, introduced a front rubber mounted <b>subframe</b> with single tower bolts and larger bushes {{in the rear}} frame. In addition twin stalk indicators were introduced with larger foot pedals, and from 1977 onwards the rear indicator lamps had the reverse lights incorporated in them.|$|E
30|$|The eNodeB transmits System Information Blocks (SIBs) {{through the}} {{broadcast}} control channel (BCCH)[22]. There are two SIBs related to E-MBMS: SIB 2 and SIB 13. SIB 2 informs the user about which <b>subframes</b> {{are reserved for}} MBSFN. On the other hand, SIB 13 indicates how many MBSFN areas are configured in a cell and which are the <b>subframes</b> and the MCS used by the MCCH of each MBSFN area. MCCHs are periodically transmitted {{over one of the}} MBSFN-capable <b>subframes,</b> being this period broadcasted over the SIB 13. It {{is important to note that}} among the 10 <b>subframes</b> included in a radio frame, the maximum number of MBSFN <b>subframes</b> is six, since <b>subframes</b> # 0, # 4, # 5, and # 9 are reserved for unicast transmission.|$|R
30|$|Rk {{denotes the}} number of <b>subframes</b> {{occupied}} by sub resource pool k which is corresponding to geographic area pair ik– jk, and Ttotal is {{the number of}} total <b>subframes</b> in the resource pool. The division of resource pool still obeys TDM rules and every sub resource pool randomly occupies different amounts of <b>subframes</b> in the time domain.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a {{resource}} fair round robin scheduling is applied for all UEs. We assume that <b>subframes</b> configured for the relay link are assigned exclusively to RNs at the DeNB, i.e., co-scheduling of MUEs and RNs is not considered. For the resource allocation on the backhaul <b>subframes</b> and access link, we utilize the scheme in[28], where resource {{shares of the}} RNs on the relay link are proportional {{to the number of}} attached RUEs. The available capacity on the relay link is then distributed among RUEs utilizing max–min fairness. Moreover, the number of backhaul <b>subframes</b> to be allocated to RNs is chosen such that the overall system performance is optimized; two and four <b>subframes</b> are configured in case of urban and suburban 4 -RN deployments, respectively[28].|$|R
25|$|The St. Tropez {{conversion}} {{was designed}} by Paul Bailey and his company PBB Design, which was established in 1987. The conversion involved removing the roof and rear bodywork. The wheel arches were also widened and new Compomotive wheels {{were part of the}} package. The A-pillar and the chassis were reinforced with steel, and a steel <b>subframe</b> was added in the rear.|$|E
25|$|Suspension was a MacPherson strut {{arrangement}} at the front, {{anchored by}} lower alloy L-arms. The wide spacing of the mounting points, compliant bushings and a perimeter <b>subframe</b> gave the model a cushioned yet precise ride with relaxed handling {{that could be}} tuned for different markets or model derivatives such as the later MG ZT. The rear suspension, {{after a period of}} uncertainty during development, was eventually a version of BMW's Z-Axle arrangement first featured on the 1988 Z1 sports car.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel <b>subframe</b> for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E

40|$|The {{time domain}} inter-cell {{interference}} coordination techniques specified in LTE Rel. 10 standard improves the throughput of picocell-edge users by protecting them from macrocell interference. On the other hand, it also degrades the aggregate capacity in macrocell because the macro base station (MBS) does not transmit data during certain <b>subframes</b> known as almost blank <b>subframes.</b> The MBS data transmission using reduced power <b>subframes</b> was standardized in LTE Rel. 11, which {{can improve the}} capacity in macrocell while not causing high interference to the nearby picocells. In order to get maximum benefit from the reduced power <b>subframes,</b> setting the key system parameters, such {{as the amount of}} power reduction, carries critical importance. Using stochastic geometry, this paper lays down a theoretical foundation for the performance evaluation of heterogeneous networks with reduced power <b>subframes</b> and range expansion bias. The analytic expressions for average capacity and 5 th percentile throughput are derived as a function of transmit powers, node densities, and interference coordination parameters in a heterogeneous network scenario, and are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Joint optimization of range expansion bias, power reduction factor, scheduling thresholds, and duty cycle of reduced power <b>subframes</b> are performed to study the trade-offs between aggregate capacity of a cell and fairness among the users. To validate our analysis, we also compare the stochastic geometry based theoretical results with the real MBS deployment (in the city of London) and the hexagonal-grid model. Our analysis shows that with optimum parameter settings, the LTE Rel. 11 with reduced power <b>subframes</b> can provide substantially better performance than the LTE Rel. 10 with almost blank <b>subframes,</b> in terms of both aggregate capacity and fairness.

2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium front <b>subframe.</b> Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel <b>subframe.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{technology}} {{includes a}} pure carbon fiber monocoque and <b>subframe,</b> dry sump lubrication and inboard suspension. [...] ATR Composites Group of Italy produced and assembled the carbon fiber monocoque and <b>subframe.</b> At speeds above seventy mph, the Carrera GT raises its rear wing into the airstream to reduce lift. The {{size of its}} radiator is about five times that of a 911 Turbo. Both its front and rear suspensions comprise pushrod actuated shock absorbers and dampers with anti-roll bars.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{inclusion}} of the speed limiting system in 2000, the Hayabusa remained substantially the same through the 2007 model year. An exception was a response to the problem of the aluminum rear <b>subframe</b> on 1999 and 2000 models breaking when the bike may have been overloaded with a passenger and luggage, and/or stressed by an aftermarket exhaust modification, so 2001 and later Hayabusas had a steel instead of aluminum rear <b>subframe,</b> adding [...] to the 1999 and 2000 models' approximately [...] wet weight.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} settle this issue, the <b>subframes</b> are {{determined}} randomly rather than sequently in one sub resource pool in our proposed EGRSA. If the partition work of two Manhattan scenes is done by different BSs as shown in Fig.  8, <b>subframes</b> selected in these two scenes to form the fifth sub resource pool are also different. Therefore, although the two areas are mapped into the same fifth sub resource pool, they use different <b>subframes</b> actually. Collisions are avoided efficiently in this way so that boundary interference is eliminated.|$|R
30|$|Quality {{adaptation}} {{takes place}} on the intermediate nodes on the fly. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the quality adaptation on the fly is not applied for WMSNs before. We use PJPEG’s structural advantage in this procedure. As explained in Section 3, PJPEG comprises a number of scans (<b>subframes).</b> If some packets of a sub-frame are dropped or corrupted, only the corresponding sub-frame becomes useless instead of the whole image. In our quality adaptation technique, we intentionally drop the packets of some <b>subframes</b> of PJPEG. In order to distinguish <b>subframes</b> of the image, the SUIT packet has two types of information in its packet headers. These data are the number of total <b>subframes</b> that the related frame has, and the sub-frame index that the packet belongs to. Decreasing the quality {{is the responsibility of the}} transport layer. Thus, the application layer always generates full-quality images. In our quality adaptation technique, all PJPEG images are processed starting from the lowest score to highest score (scoring was explained in Section 3.3). In this process, <b>subframes</b> of the PJPEG images are randomly selected and dropped. According to the application requirements, fewer <b>subframes</b> are dropped for the SC case while more <b>subframes</b> are dropped for the FC case. However, the quality cannot be decreased more than a threshold defined for the application. This quality adaptation process is ended when adequate space in the buffer becomes available. If there is still not enough space in the buffer after all images are processed, images are dropped according to the packet prioritization policy.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{spectral}} efficiency and 5 th percentile throughput expressions are derived for HetNets with reduced power <b>subframes</b> and range expansion. These expressions are validated using the Monte Carlo simulations. Joint optimization {{of the key}} system parameters, such as range expansion bias, power reduction factor, scheduling thresholds, and duty cycle of reduced power <b>subframes,</b> is performed to achieve maximum aggregate capacity and proportional fairness among users. Our analysis shows that under optimum parameter settings, the HetNet with reduced power <b>subframes</b> yields better performance than that with almost blank <b>subframes</b> (eICIC) {{in terms of both}} aggregate capacity and proportional fairness. However, transmitting the reduced power <b>subframes</b> with greater than half the maximum power proved to be inefficient because it degrades both the aggregate capacity and the proportional fairness. Increasing the range expansion bias improves the proportional fairness but degrades the aggregate capacity. In the case of eICIC, the duty cycle of almost blank <b>subframes</b> has a significant effect on the fairness, but with reduced power <b>subframes</b> and optimized scheduling thresholds, duty cycle has a limited effect on fairness. Hence, fixing the duty cycle and optimizing the scheduling thresholds is preferable since it avoids the overhead of coordinating the duty cycle among the cells through the X 2 interface. We also compared the 5 th percentile SE results from the PPP model with those from the real BS deployment and hexagonal grid model. We observed that the hex grid model forms the upper bound while the PPP model forms the lower bound. Increasing the PBS density or the PBS transmit power would improve the 5 th percentile SE.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the eICIC technology, it can {{efficiently}} improve the range expanded UEs’ performance and reduce the inter-cell interference among cells in multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks. As a time-domain interference coordination scheme, the eICIC technology divides the time frames into almost blank <b>subframes</b> (ABS) and normal <b>subframes</b> in [11]. And MUEs and range expanded UEs are scheduled on normal <b>subframes</b> and ABSs orthogonally, which can relieve the interference from macrocells to the range expanded UEs and {{improve the quality of}} service (QoS). But the eICIC technology reduces the time resources of MUEs for communication at the same time.|$|R

The front torsion bar suspension was retained, but the multi-leaf springs in the rear were replaced by coil springs. In addition, the Toronado introduced as a novelty what later became a federal mandate in a modified form, two high-mounted taillights above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Riviera. These taillights mirrored brake and turn functions of the normal taillights, but not the nighttime taillights. A rear-wheel ABS became optional.|$|E

The <b>subframe</b> also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts.
