50|$|Pulling on {{the outer}} A-lines during non-accelerated, normal flight folds the wing tips inwards, which {{substantially}} reduces the glide angle with only a small decrease in forward speed. As the effective wing area is reduced, the wing loading is increased, and it becomes more stable. However, the angle of attack is increased, and the craft is closer to stall speed, but this can be ameliorated by applying the <b>speed</b> <b>bar,</b> which also increases the descent rate. When the lines are released, the wing re-inflates. If necessary, a short pumping on the brakes helps reentering normal flight. Compared to the other techniques, with big ears, the wing still glides forward, which enables the pilot to leave an area of danger. Even landing this way is possible, e.g., if the pilot has to counter an updraft on a slope.|$|E

The B-line stall induces descent rates of 6-10 m/s. It increases loading on parts of the wing (the pilot's weight is mostly on the B-lines, instead of spread across all the lines). Finally, a spiral dive offers the fastest rate of descent, at 7-25 m/s. It places greater loads on the wing than other techniques do and requires the highest level of skill from the pilot to execute safely.|$|E

Looking at the facts concerning road safety, as stated by the UN, {{one of the most important}} problems is vehicle speed. The aim of this work is to evaluate the potential influence of traffic-calming measures on drivers' speed. In particular, attention focuses on very simple, low-cost perceptual measures based on the Oppel-Kundt illusion and lateral optic flow manipulation. A driving simulator experiment was used to analyse three countermeasures, located along the approach to a roundabout in a rural area, against the control condition (no countermeasures, corresponding to the current configuration of the roundabout in question) : evenly spaced guide posts, unevenly spaced guide posts, and optical <b>speed</b> <b>bars.</b> Results showed that both evenly and unevenly spaced guide posts significantly reduced drivers' speed with respect to the control condition. Mean speed reduction, measured between the entry and exit points of the analysed segment, was approximately 4. 2 %, which was significant in terms of reduction of risk. No difference was found between the treatments called ‘constant guide posts’ and ‘wide-to-thin guide posts’. The potential for reducing drivers' speed was only moderate in the case of optical <b>speed</b> <b>bars.</b> From the practical point of view, the proposed measures have the additional advantages of being easy to implement and not requiring regular maintenance, compared with other common measures based on pavement marking...|$|R

Due to high rate of fatalities and low budgets available, it is therefore necessary to identify low-cost effective approaches in reducing speeds. Optical <b>Speed</b> <b>Bar</b> (OSB) treatment is one such technique. This research makes an attempt {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of OSBs in reducing approach speeds on two-lane, rural highways approaching small communities. Speed data were collected and analyzed “before” and “after” periods at five sites. Effectiveness of OSBs was evaluated using changes in mean and 85 th percentile speeds under different categories by considering all vehicles, vehicle classification (two axles vs. more than two axles), day of the week (weekdays vs. weekends), and time of day (daytime vs. nighttime), as well as proportions exceeding posted speed limit, using t-test mean speeds, F-test for analysis of variance, and Z-test for proportions of vehicles exceeding posted speed limit between “before” and “after” datasets. Even though motorists were found to slow down on the approaches, in response to speed zones, speeding was noted. “Before” speed data indicated higher speeds than desired at the sites. The 85 th percentile speeds were between 50 and 63 mph while the posted speed limits on the approaches were 45 mph at four sites, and the 85 th percentile speed was about 42 mph at one site with an approach posted speed limit of 30 mph. The “before” degrees of noncompliance were up to 90 % of free-flowing vehicles at the sites. Speed data analysis showed significant reductions in speeds at ends of OSBs at four test sites. Mean and 85 th percentile speeds and standard deviations were found reduced in the after periods. Percent reductions in mean speeds were between 1. 2 and 8. 2 %, with 85 th percentile reductions between 3. 2 and 8. 9 %. At one site, no notable change in mean and 85 th percentile speeds occurred at the end of OSBs, but significant increases in standard deviations were noted. Speed reductions were higher for two-axle vehicles, during the daytime and on weekdays with few exceptions. Results of the study showed, as other previous studies did, OSBs may have some minor effects on vehicle speeds. The study provides an indication that it may be possible to create safety improvements as result of using OSBs on the approach to a rural community. However, magnitude of speed reductions was generally small, though the reductions were statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Because of the non-consistence of the magnitude of speed reductions at the test sites, no conclusion can be drawn as to how much OSB treatment reduced speeds. These results were based on “after” periods up to five months. Therefore, further study would be required to determine whether these safety improvements are sustained over an even longer time period. Even though minor speed reductions occurred, speeds observed at the sites were still higher than the posted speed limits, indicating OSBs were not effective enough in providing the desired speed limit compliance. Additional studies would be helpful to identify combinations of countermeasures, for instance OSBs and other techniques, effective in providing speed limit compliance...|$|E

The {{dynamics}} of a barred galaxy {{depends on the}} pattern <b>speed</b> of its <b>bar.</b> The only direct method for measuring the pattern <b>speed</b> of a <b>bar</b> is the Tremaine-Weinberg technique. This method is best suited {{to the analysis of}} the distribution and {{dynamics of}} the stellar component. Therefore it has been mostly used for early-type barred galaxies. Most of them host a classical bulge. On the other hand, a variety of indirect methods, which are based on the analysis of the distribution and dynamics of the gaseous component, has been used to measure the <b>bar</b> pattern <b>speed</b> in late-type <b>barred</b> galaxies.

40|$|Noncompliance {{with speed}} limits {{is one of}} the major safety {{concerns}} in roadwork zones. Although numerous studies have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of safety measures on speed limit compliance, many report inconsistent findings. This paper aims to review the effectiveness of four categories of roadwork zone speed control measures: Informational, Physical, Enforcement, and Educational measures. While informational measures (static signage, variable message signage) evidently have small to moderate effects on speed reduction, physical measures (rumble strips, optical <b>speed</b> <b>bars)</b> are found ineffective for transient and moving work zones. Enforcement measures (speed camera, police presence) have the greatest effects, while educational measures also have significant potential to improve public awareness of roadworker safety and to encourage slower speeds in work zones. Inadequate public understanding of roadwork risks and hazards, failure to notice signs, and poor appreciation of safety measures are the major causes of noncompliance with speed limits...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study of}} the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) {{properties}} of ringed galaxies has been largely successful. We have identified {{what we think is}} the probable cause of the differences in the IRAS properties among non-interacting barred galaxies as the pattern <b>speed</b> of the <b>bar.</b> The key to identifying this parameter has been our focusing the study on outer-ringed galaxies where we know precisely what is present in the central regions (from available BVI CCD images in our library of images). The theory is that outer rings, through their morphology and other characteristics, can be identified with the outer Lindblad resonance, one of the major resonances in galaxy structure. Using a library of n-body simulations for comparison, we can reliably infer both low and high pattern speed galaxies from the appearance of outer rings and the existence of other ring features. It is clear that in some barred galaxies, the <b>bar</b> pattern <b>speed</b> is high enough to avoid an inner Lindblad resonance, hence such objects do not contain nuclear or circumnuclear star formation. The IRAS observations are most sensitive to nuclear star formation in early-type barred galaxies, and will thus select those barred galaxies where the pattern speed is low enough to allow an inner Lindblad resonance to exist. High pattern <b>speed</b> <b>barred</b> galaxies therefore weaken the correlation between bars and infrared excess. This finding helps to reconcile the inconsistent results found between different studies on the correlation between bars and far-IR emission...|$|R

Meyer, E. 2 Conventional speed studies {{can be used to}} evaluate the effects of various aspects of highway design and traffic control on the speeds at which drivers choose to travel. Typical parameters examined are mean speeds, 85 th percentile speeds, and speed variation indicated by standard deviation or mode. More detailed studies have been conducted using manual techniques and specialized equipment to generate vehicle-specific speed profiles. A useful technique, called vehicle tracing, allows data from common automatic traffic recorders to be used to generate such profiles automatically. The availability of these profiles opens up new avenues of analysis that ultimately promote safer highway design and traffic control practices.
