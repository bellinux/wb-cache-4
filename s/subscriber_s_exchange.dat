40|$|Many major {{corporations}} of the wolrd have cross-listed their stocks in overseas exchanges, with their equilibrium stock prices determined in multiple locations. This paper examines {{the contribution of}} cross-listings to the price discovery for internationally traded securities and discusses policy implications. Specifically, using a sample of Canadian stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) that are also listed in the U. S., we study the contribution of U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> to the price discovery for these stocks. The main findings are as follows. First, the prices on both TSE and U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> are non-stationary with a unit root. However, they are cointegrated with the equality of prices holding as an equilibrium relationship. Second, adjustments maintaining the cointegration equilibrium between the prices on TSE and U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> occur on both exchanges, implying that both exchanges contribute to the price discovery for sample stocks. That is, {{not only do the}} U. S. prices adjust to the Toronto prices but they also provide feedback to the latter so that the TSE prices adjust to the U. S. prices. The relative contribution of U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> to the price discovery ranges from 0. 3 % to 98. 0 %, with an average of 38. 5 %. Third, regression analysis indicates that the TSE share of total adjustment in prices {{is directly related to the}} U. S. share of total trading in a stock and to the U. S. share of firm’s sales, and inversely related to the ratio of bid-ask spreads on U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> and TSE. We do not find the venue of U.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} {{on the characteristics of}} local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings for firms cross-listing on U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges</b> relative to a matched sample of foreign firms currently not cross-listing in the United States to investigate whether U. S. listing is associated with differences in accounting data reported in local markets. We find that cross-listed firms differ in terms of the time-series properties of earnings and accruals, and the degree of association between accounting data and share prices. Cross-listed firms appear to be less aggressive in terms of earnings management and report accounting data that are more conservative, take account of bad news in a more timely manner, and are more strongly associated with share price. Furthermore, the differences appear to result partially from changes around cross-listing and partially from differences in accounting quality before listing.

40|$|We aim {{to provide}} insight into the {{observed}} equity home bias phenomenon by analyzing the determinants of U. S. holdings of equities across a wide range of countries. In particular, we explore the role of information costs in determining the country distribution of U. S. investors' equity holdings using a comprehensive new data set on U. S. ownership of foreign stocks. We find that U. S. holdings of a country's equities are positively related to the share of that country's stock market that is listed on U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges,</b> even after controlling for capital controls, trade links, transaction costs, and historical risk-adjusted returns. We attribute this finding to the fact that foreign firms that list on U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges</b> are obliged to provide standardized, credible financial information, thereby reducing information costs incurred by U. S. investors. This obligation stems from U. S. investor protection regulations, which include stringent disclosure requirements, reconciliation of financial statements to U.

40|$|In this paper, we use methods {{from social}} network {{analysis}} to assess {{the relative importance of}} financial centers around the world. Using data from virtually the entire universe of global equity activity, we present two sets of complete rankings for up to forty-five separate locations for the 1990 - 2006 period. The first phase of our analysis evaluates international stock exchanges based on their ability to attract global initial public offerings (IPOs). The second phase compares the capacity of these exchanges to provide an efficient trading platform for cross-listed companies. U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges</b> are effectively the unique hosts for cross-border equity activity originating from many other locations. Moreover, they are the destination of choice for most companies coming from locations with highly prestigious exchanges.

We do find evidence of the rising importance of competing exchanges - in particular, the London Stock Exchange, the Deutsche B 6 rse, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange - and also of an expanding role for a number of emerging market stock exchanges.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Flow of International Listings This paper examines cross-listing behavior onto U. S. and U. K. stock exchanges following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and tests two propositions. First, has the rate of foreign cross-listings onto U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges</b> decreased in the period following the enactment of the Act? Second, are foreign exchanges- in particular, the London Stock Exchange- attracting foreign firms in the post-Act period that would have otherwise listed on a U. <b>S</b> <b>exchange</b> prior to the enactment of the Act? We find strong evidence that U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges</b> have experienced a decrease frequency of foreign listing following the Act. For the NYSE, the decline {{does not appear to be}} attributed to listings lost to the LSE’s Main Market after the enactment of the Act. In contrast, our evidence suggests that a portion of the decline in foreign listings on the Nasdaq is attributable to firms bypassing a U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> listing and opting to list on the LSE’s Alternative Investment Market following the enactment of the Act. These “lost ” listings are composed of firms that are, on average, smaller and less profitable than both the firms predicted to list on the Nasdaq and that the firms that actually listed on the exchange in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley period. Together, these patterns are consistent with Sarbanes-Oxley screening out firms from the left tail of the distribution of likely U. S. listing candidates along the dimensions of firm performance and size. Together, our analysis provides the first evidence (of which we are aware) of how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has altered the flow of foreign listings across international stock exchanges. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Canadian {{and other}} foreign firms that have been involuntarily delisted from major U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchanges.</b> I find that, for most countries, less than 10 % of firms get delisted from a U. <b>S.</b> <b>exchange</b> during my sample period. For Canada, more than 25 % of firms listed in the United States get involuntarily delisted. This effect is more pronounced in Nasdaq-listed firms, where more than 40 % of Canadian firms eventually get delisted, compared to about 15 % of other foreign firms. After controlling for firm characteristics that {{have an impact on}} involuntary delistings, such as size, exchange listing, previous year's return, volatility, and leverage, Canadian firms still have a higher propensity to get delisted than other foreign cross-listed firms. However, in a comparison to a U. S. matched sample, there is no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of Canadian firms being delisted, relative to these U. S. firms. These results suggest that Canadian firms may have been treated more similarly to U. S. firms under the U.

Three measures of monetary policy shocks are considered: orthogonalized shocks to the Federal Funds rate, the ratio of Non Borrowed to Total Reserves and the Romer and Romer (1989) index. Using data from the flexible exchange rate era, we find that expansionary shocks to U. S. monetary policy lead to sharp. persistent depreciations in U.

The temporal pattern of the depreciation in U. <b>S.</b> nominal <b>exchange</b> rates following a positive monetary policy shock is inconsistent with simple overshooting models of the type considered by Dornbusch (1976).
