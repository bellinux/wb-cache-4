50|$|<b>Sibrafiban</b> (Ro 48-3657, {{proposed}} {{brand name}} Xubix) is the double prodrug of Ro-44-3888, {{which is a}} platelet aggregation inhibitor. It was being developed for secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis following unstable angina pectoris {{and acute myocardial infarction}} (MI). On August 6, 1999, Hoffmann-La Roche announced that the preliminary results from Phase III clinical trials had not shown that <b>sibrafiban</b> was better than aspirin in preventing recurrent ischemic events in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. The development of <b>sibrafiban</b> was terminated.|$|E
50|$|Ro 44-3888 is a non-peptidic, {{selective}} and reversible glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

The development of Ro 44-3888 and <b>sibrafiban</b> was discontinued in 1999 following unfavorable Phase III efficacy data.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} non-peptide orally active RGD mimetic prodrug such as Orbofiban, <b>Sibrafiban,</b> SR 121566, Roxifiban and others {{entered into the}} {{clinical}} evaluation stage. Some of these agents were terminated and some are still in clinical trials. The present study examined the platelet GPIIb/IIIa binding profiles for the active form of Roxifiban, <b>Sibrafiban,</b> SR 121566 and Orbofiban using 3 H-Roxifiban active form (XV 459), 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen. Either DMP 728, Orbofiban, <b>Sibrafiban,</b> SR 121566 or Roxifiban active form {{as well as other}} RGD mimetic bind to the same binding site (s) on human platelets as evident from the competitive inhibition of binding of each other to human platelet. Additionally, Roxifiban active form competed with FITC labeled GPIIb/IIIa antagonist cyclic RGD peptidomimetic (XL 086) as demonstrated using confocal microscopy technique. Roxifiban active form (XV 459) demonstrated the highest potency in inhibiting 3 H-XV 459, 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen binding to human platelets as compared to the others. Structure activity relationship within the isoxazoline Roxifiban series showed that substituent at the α-carbon next to the carboxy terminal represents an exosite for the affinity binding to human platelets leading to slow platelet dissociation rate. These data indicated a distinct binding profile for Roxifiban (high affinity to both activated and resting platelets associated with a relatively slow Koff) as compared to others. These differences might determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmackokinetics of the different GPIIb/IIIa antagonists...|$|E
40|$|We studied stent {{thrombosis}} in 4, 607 {{patients with}} acute coronary syndromes {{who received a}} coronary stent as part of routine care during 2 trials of aspirin versus <b>sibrafiban</b> for secondary prevention. In these patients, stent thrombosis occurred more often than in previous patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention.

40|$|Background Aspirin lowers {{risks of}} death and {{myocardial}} infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Intravenous glycoprotein IIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists further reduce the rates of ischaemic events in these patients, but the efficacy of long-term oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade has not been established. We tested whether the oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist <b>sibrafiban</b> would prevent more cardiovascular events than aspirin, when given within 7 days of, and sustained for 90 days after, an acute coronary syndrome event. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Platelet {{accretion}} into arterial thrombus in stenotic arterial ves-sels involves shear-induced {{platelet activation}} and adhesion. The Cone and Plate(let) Analyzer (CPA) {{is designed to}} simulate such conditions in vitro under a rotating high shear rate in whole blood. In the present study, we evaluated various experimental conditions (including aspirin, temperature, and calcium con-centration) and investigated the effects of small molecules along with peptide glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on platelet adhesion using the CPA system. Concentration-dependent ef-fect of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on shear-induced plate-let adhesion showed marked differences in potencies: IC 50 34, 35, 91, 438, and 606 nM for DPC 802 (a specific glycopro-tein IIb/IIIa antagonist), roxifiban, <b>sibrafiban,</b> lotrafiban, and or-bofiban (free acid forms), respectively, and IC 50 values of 43...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the {{incidence}} and clinical significance of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundElevated creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is prognostically important after PCI, but the prognostic significance of elevated cTnI after PCI is uncertain. MethodsIn a prospective substudy of the <b>Sibrafiban</b> Versus Aspirin to Yield Maximum Protection From Ischemic Heart Events Post-acute Coronary Syndromes (SYMPHONY) trials, which randomized patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) to receive aspirin or <b>sibrafiban,</b> we measured cTnI (positive, ≥ 1. 5 ng/ml) and CK-MB (positive, ≥ 7 ng/ml) in 481 patients with PCI. Samples were collected immediately before and at 0, 8 and 16 h after PCI and analyzed by a core laboratory. The primary end point was the Kaplan-Meier estimate of death, myocardial infarction or severe, recurrent ischemia at 90 days. ResultsOverall, 230 patients (48 %) had elevated cTnI after PCI. Such patients underwent PCI sooner {{and were more likely}} to have coronary stenting. Elevated cTnI was associated with nonsignificantly higher risks of the primary end point (11. 5 % vs. 8. 7 %; p = 0. 15) and of death (1. 8 % vs. 0. 4 %; p = 0. 4) and a significantly higher risk of death or infarction (10. 6 % vs. 4. 2 %; p = 0. 005). This pattern was more pronounced for patients who became positive only after PCI: primary end point, 20. 7 % vs. 10. 1 % for patients who remained negative after PCI (p = 0. 05); death, 5. 2 % vs. 0 % (p = 0. 02); death or infarction, 18. 1 % vs. 4. 1 % (p = 0. 007). ConclusionsElevated cTnI, often observed after PCI in patients with ACS, is associated with worse 90 -day clinical outcomes. This marker, therefore, is a useful prognostic indicator in such patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the magnitude and time course of platelet activation during therapy of acute coronary syndromes with an oral platelet antagonist. BACKGROUNDPlatelet activation and aggregation are central to the pathogenesis of the acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, few data are available on levels of platelet activation over time in patients with ACS, especially in the setting of chronic glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibition. METHODSThe Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 12 trial was a phase II, double-blind trial evaluating the effects of <b>sibrafiban,</b> an oral, selective antagonist of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor in patients stabilized after an ACS. A subset of 90 of the 329 patients in the study had measurement of platelet activation as assessed by the expression of platelet associated P-Selectin on days 0, 7 and 28. Platelet activation was measured in blood samples that were fixed either immediately (spontaneous activation) or after 5 minute incubation with 0, 1 μM or 5 μM ADP in order to assess platelet responsiveness to very low or moderate stimulation. RESULTSAt baseline there was a significant elevation of spontaneous platelet activation as compared to samples obtained from normal donors or from patients who did not have acute coronary syndromes (ACS patients 27. 6 ± 18. 7 %, Normal controls 8. 5 ± 4. 4 %, Patient controls 10. 9 ± 7. 1 %, p < 0. 005 for both). In addition, there was a significant decrease in the levels of platelet activation with time during the 28 days of treatment with <b>sibrafiban.</b> Nevertheless, even on day 28, the TIMI- 12 patients continued to show elevated platelet activation in comparison to the control groups (p < 0. 05 for both). CONCLUSIONSThese results suggest that platelets remain activated long after clinical stabilization post ACS. Although platelet activation decreased after one month of oral GPIIb/IIIa inhibition, levels remained higher than normal, suggesting the need for long-term antiplatelet therapy following ACS...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and selective HPLC-column switching method with single quadrupole mass spectrometric detection {{was developed for}} the simultaneous determination of the oral platelet aggregation inhibitor <b>Sibrafiban</b> (double protected prodrug), its prodrug and the active metabolite in rat, dog, and human plasma. The three analytes together with their tri-deuterated internal standards were isolated from plasma by protein precipitation (0. 5 M perchloric acid). The de-proteinated samples were injected onto a standard-bore trapping column (4. 0 mm i. d., LC-ABZ) of an HPLC-column switching system. Polar plasma components were removed by flushing the trapping column with ammonium formate (pH 3. 6; 5 mM). Enriched compounds (including the analytes of interest) were backflushed onto a narrow-bore analytical column (2. 1 mm i. d., Inertsil ODS- 2) and separated by gradient elution (formic acid/ methanol). The whole effluent (200 microl/min) from the analytical column was passed to the turbo ion spray interface without splitting. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) was used for mass spectrometric detection. The limit of quantification for all three analytes was 1 ng/ml, using a 250 -microl specimen of plasma. The mean precision and inaccuracy for the three analytes in all species were < 6 and < 5 %, respectively. The practicability of the new analytical method was demonstrated by the analysis of about 500 rat and dog plasma and about 14, 000 human plasma samples. The new method represents a successful example {{for the application of}} LC single MS with ionspray ionisation to the analysis of small molecule drugs in biological matrices from toxicokinetic studies and large clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|As the {{glycoprotein}} GPIIb/IIIa receptor is {{the final}} common pathway in platelet aggregation, antagonists of this receptor cause a profound inhibition of aggregation induced by any agonist. The short-term efficacy and safety of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was demonstrated with murine 7 E 3 Fab, but this antibody was immunogenic. Abciximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody that is less immunogenic. The first major trial with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist was the EPIC trial with abciximab, which showed that abciximab reduced the ischemic complications of coronary balloon angioplasty and atherectomy in high-risk patients, but increased the risk of bleeding. Subsequent studies showed that using less concurrent heparin reduced bleeding. Abciximab also reduced the rate of revascularization. Further {{studies have shown that}} the benefits of abciximab extended to all patients undergoing angioplasty (EPILOG), including patients with unstable angina (CAPTURE) and acute myocardial infarction (RAPPORT). Clinical trials with eptifibatide and tirofiban have failed to demonstrate benefit, at the doses used, in angioplasty. Abciximab and eptifibatide, but not oral xemilofiban, improve the safety of the coronary stenting procedure. Shortterm intravenous treatment with lamifiban, eptifibatide or tirofiban is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non-Q wave myocardial infarction). Orally active GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being developed for use in acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. However, no benefit has been shown with lefradafiban in acute coronary syndromes and <b>sibrafiban</b> and orbofiban are harmful. Eptifibatide, lamifiban and abciximab improve coronary patency in myocardial infarction, and long-term trials of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being conducted in acute myocardial infarction. Abciximab can cause thrombocytopenia, and all the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increase the incidence of bleeding, but there is no excess of intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2001 Prous Science.

40|$|PURPOSE: Obesity is a {{coronary}} {{disease risk}} factor, but its independent effect on clinical outcomes following acute coronary syndromes {{has not been}} quantified. We evaluated the relationship between elevated body mass index (BMI) and 30 -day, 90 -day, and 1 -year clinical outcomes postacute coronary syndromes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using 15 071 patients (normal weight [BMI = 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m(2) ], overweight [BMI = 25 - 29. 9 kg/m(2) ], obese [BMI = 30 - 34. 9 kg/m(2) ] or very obese [BMI > or = 35 kg/m(2) ]) randomized from 1997 - 1999 in the SYMPHONY (<b>Sibrafiban</b> vs aspirin to Yield Maximum Protection from ischemic Heart events postacute cOroNary sYndromes) and 2 nd SYMPHONY trials, we evaluated the relationships between BMI and 30 -day, 90 -day, and 1 -year mortality and 30 -day and 90 -day death or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Increasing BMI was associated with younger age, multiple comorbidities, and greater cardiac medication and procedure use; however, systolic function and coronary disease extent were similar for all BMI categories. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier mortality estimates were higher for normal-weight patients than for all other BMI groups. After multivariable adjustment, the 30 -day mortality hazard ratios (95 % confidence interval [CI]) were: overweight, 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 47 to 0. 94); obese, 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 39 to 0. 97); very obese, 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 48 to 1. 64). Adjusted hazard ratios were similar for 90 -day and 1 -year mortality. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} among BMI groups in 30 -day and 90 -day death or myocardial infarction (unadjusted or adjusted). CONCLUSION: Overweight and obese BMI classifications were associated with better intermediate-term survival after acute coronary syndromes than normal weight and very obese, but death or myocardial infarction rates were similar. Further study is required to understand the apparent association of overweight and moderate obesity with better intermediate-term outcomes. status: publishe...|$|E
