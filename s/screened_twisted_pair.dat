25|$|Deformation: <b>twisted</b> <b>pair's</b> {{susceptibility}} to electromagnetic interference greatly {{depends on the}} <b>pair</b> <b>twisting</b> schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation.

40|$|This {{white paper}} {{discusses}} {{the subject of}} 10 Gigabit/second data transmission over balanced twisted-pair cabling. Balanced twisted-pair cabling refers to either unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or <b>screened</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (ScTP) cabling. The term screened or shielded twisted pair generally refers to a TIA recognized cable construction with an overall metallic screen over a 4 -pair core, also designated as F/UTP in the International standards. Arguments {{can be made in}} support of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) or screened twisted-pair (ScTP) cabling for 10 Gb/s applications over copper. It is important for the end user to understand that shielded cabling is not a magic cure {{to solve the problem of}} noise. It can often make the situation worse. When considering all the issues, advanced UTP solutions such as Belden’s IBDN ™ System 10 GX provide not only superior noise performance, and do so without the additional bonding and grounding requirements of ScTP cabling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} issue of the nearfield coupling of an unshielded twisted-wire pair on a nearby single wire. It introduces {{a discussion about the}} appropriate modeling method for predicting the induced current on the victim wire and proposes a cost-effective approach to deal with either ideal or nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> A nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> consists of a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> whose ends are left untwisted for connection to equipment. We show that the current distribution may follow a specific spatial distribution on the nearby wire. These coupling effects are evidenced through the analysis of an equivalent circuit under the low-frequency assumption. These behaviors are illustrated for the case of both an ideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> and a nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> For the latter, the ideal bifilar helix may be modeled by a simple equivalent model bifilar cable...|$|R

25|$|At {{frequencies}} up {{to about}} 1GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.|$|R
40|$|During a study {{performed}} in {{framework of a}} European Space Agency contract, the vulnerability of spacecraft harnesses has been assessed. The harnesses consisted of three different space-grade cable types: power cables, <b>screened</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> data cables and radio frequency (RF) cables. They were alternately shielded by {{two different types of}} representative spacecraft structure walls. Ten hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests at 0 degrees incidence have been performed with impact velocities ranging from 6. 4 km/s to 7. 7 km/s. Projectiles have been aluminium spheres with diameters ranging from 1. 5 mm to 4. 0 mm. During the tests, all cables were operated at their representative conditions and the disturbances, induced by the impacts, were measured. The malfunction observed could be related to two physical failure mechanisms: (1) short circuits caused by a conducting cloud of molten and evaporated aluminium and, for the data cables, (2) strands being bent by impacting fragments creating a short circuit between screen and signal cable. The influence of a more complex structure wall to the failure mechanism in (1) is shown. Malfunction was dependent on mechanical damage, but no clear correlation between severity of malfunction and mechanical damage could be established. The data cables were the most vulnerable cable, while the RF cables were the most robust. The disturbances recorded could pose a significant threat to connected electronic equipment. Examples of electrical performance are given...|$|E
40|$|The micrometeoroid and {{orbital debris}} (MM/OD) {{environment}} {{poses a threat}} to satellites and manned spacecraft. This threat lies in the risk of individual components being affected by an impact of a particle from the MM/OD population. Among spacecraft components, harnesses are especially exposed to that risk due to their ubiquity inside a spacecraft and their importance for fundamental spacecraft functions such as supplying power and relaying digital and analog communications. The degradation or breakdown of such a mission-critical component can shorten the lifetime of a satellite or, in the worst case, lead to loss of a mission. Past impact tests have shown that mechanical damage to cables like cratering and removal of insulation can result in permanent functional degradation after impact. However, during the impact event, transient processes develop which until now have not yet been characterized. These processes include voltage spikes that propagate along a cable poten tially damaging connected equipment such as on-board computers, sensors and other electronics. A hypervelocity impact test campaign was performed on space-grade unshielded single conductor, <b>screened</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> and radio-frequency coaxial lines in a representative experimental setup. This comprised both representative operational parameters and a representative mechanical setup behind an aluminum sandwich panel similar to an actual spacecraft structure wall. Impactors were aluminum spheres with diameters ranging from 2 mm to 5 mm with impact velocities between 3 km/s and 7 km/s. Impact-induced transient responses were recorded. Observed voltage spikes go up to twice the nominal voltage level. The work presented in the paper at hand was performed as part of a European Space Agency contract.

50|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> wire is {{the most}} widely used medium for all telecommunication. Twisted-pair cabling consist of copper wires that are <b>twisted</b> into <b>pairs.</b> Ordinary {{telephone}} wires consist of two insulated copper wires <b>twisted</b> into <b>pairs.</b> Computer network cabling (wired Ethernet as defined by IEEE 802.3) consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second. <b>Twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cabling comes in two forms: unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.|$|R
