The numbers (of equivalence classes) <b>of</b> embeddings <b>of</b> <b>bouquets</b> <b>of</b> circles {{on these two}} nonorientable surfaces are obtained in explicit expressions.

40|$|The {{development}} of the Flower Constellation theory offers an expanded framework to utilize constellations of satellites for tangible interests. To realize the full potential of this theory, the beta version <b>of</b> <b>Bouquet</b> was developed as a practical computer application that visualizes and edits Flower Constellations in a user-friendly manner. Programmed using C++ and OpenGL within the Qt software development environment for use on Windows systems, this initial version <b>of</b> <b>Bouquet</b> is capable <b>of</b> visualizing numerous user defined satellites in both 3 D and 2 D, and plot trajectories corresponding to arbitrary coordinate frames. The ultimate goal <b>of</b> <b>Bouquet</b> {{is to provide a}} viable open source alternative to commercial satellite orbit analysis programs. As such, the coding <b>of</b> <b>Bouquet</b> puts heavy emphasis on flexibility, upgradability and methods to provide continued support through open source collaboration...|$|R
