40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{provides}} an overview of the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, globally and locally. This overview is, followed by measurements of the comparative and competitive advantages of the South African and Argentinean <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industries. Two indexes are used to calculate the comparative and competitive advantages namely the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results show that South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> has a competitive advantage in their primary form, however the value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products show a competitive disadvantage which is opposite to that of Argentina’s <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products. The finding that South Africa is only competitive in the primary <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> market was calculated by means of trade data. Factors that affect the competitiveness of the sunflower industry were identified to indicate why value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products experience a competitive disadvantage. In the analysis {{it was found that the}} South African sunflower industry is price driven. Since price plays an important role in the competitiveness of the industry, imports of cheaper sunflower crude and refined oils are considered to pose a major threat to the industry. Crushing margins has increased over the last few years due to higher sunflower oil and sunflower oilcake prices. In order to increase the competitiveness of the South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, it needs to; be more cost competitive; improve quality; launch new products; invest in new technologies and improve the innovativeness. Emphasis should be placed on the value added seed products as this is where South Africa has a competitive disadvantage. Health issues are of great importance to the local as well as global market and the production of a healthier vegetable oil has become a necessity for this industry. Innovation in this commodity will lead to great improvement in the competitiveness of the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry. Investment towards research and innovation is necessary in order to keep up with the changing environment. The competitiveness of the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry in South Africa cannot be achieved without the help of the government. Policy issues must be put in place to avoid the dumping of cheaper crude vegetable oils as well as bottled cooking oils in South Africa. Master...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{cultivated}} sunflower (Helianthus annum L.) as a host by {{two species}} of seed weevils, Smicronyx fulvus LeConte, the red <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil, and S. sordidus LeConte, the gray <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil, was compared using dissection of achenes from naturally and artificially infested plants. The gray seed weevil oviposits on the tips of unopened sunflower florets before anthesis. Larvae migrate through the corolla tube, penetrate the developing achene, and begin extensive feeding at the achene base. Achenes infested by the gray <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil are enlarged, lack an embryo, and {{appear to be a}} type of gall. The red <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil oviposits internally in more mature achenes after anthesis has begun, and these achenes have well-developed seed embryos...|$|R
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds,</b> and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds,</b> manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E
40|$|Sunflower oil is {{the most}} {{preferred}} vegetable oil in Turkey. 35 % of total consumption of vegetable oil is <b>sunflower</b> oil. <b>Sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> import is approximately 500 - 650 thousand tons while <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> production is 800 - 850 thousand tons in the last years. The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine the reasons of deficiency of vegetable oil in Turkey and to suggest some solutions. For this objective, the prospective situation and the market structure of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> in Turkey has estimated. “One product partial equilibrium analysis ” has been used to estimate the future market structure of <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed.</b> A simulation model from 2003 to 2015 has been created with partial equilibrium analysis. Turkey is a net importer of vegetable oils. <b>Sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> import is approximately 300 thousand tons while crude oil import is approximately 180 thousand tons in 2002. According to the results of simulation model, Turkey will continue to be a net importer for sunflower and other oil seeds. It has been estimated that the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> import will be approximately 1 million tons and crude oil import will be approximately 400 thousand tons at end of the simulation period (2003 - 2015).

5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds,</b> and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E

Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals {{can be seen on}} aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, manioc, <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds,</b> cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.|$|E

We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and population structures of red and gray <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil populations collected {{on either side of the}} Rocky Mountains using nuclear 18 S rDNA, mitochondrial ribosomal DNA, and microsatellites. The results showed that the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevils are sister taxa in a monophyletic clade. No significant relationships attributable to geographic barriers were found. Thirty-three unique mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences (haplotypes) were identified and the sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 68 %. Because more individuals per population could be collected for gray <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil than for red, a more detailed study of population structure was possible for this species. Most of the genetic variation observed in gray <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> weevil resulted from variation within populations. Contiguous range expansion appeared to be the main mechanism for increased variability within the species. Significant differences were found in analyses of five polymorphic microsatellite loci in four geographically separated field populations from which multiple individuals could be collected. More genetic differences occurred among weevil populations collected from sunflowers along the East-West axis than among weevil populations collected on a North-South axis. The overall results are consistent with current theories concerning the origin of the sunflower. The population represented by haplotype 33 from Texas is likely a new species that evolved independently. The sample size for this species was limited and additional studies are needed. ...|$|R
