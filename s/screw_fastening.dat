40|$|Background: Vertebral {{fixation}} by {{pedicle screw}} placement {{is the most}} frequently applied fixation technique in spinal surgery. In this retrospective study we present a comparison of manual and computer-assisted preoperative planning of pedicle screw placement in three-dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) images of deformities in the thoracic spine. Methods: Manual planning of the pedicle screw size and trajectory was performed by two orthopedic surgeons using a dedicated software for preoperative planning of surgical procedures, while computer-assisted planning was performed by automated image processing and analysis techniques through the optimization of <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> strength. The size (diameter and length) and trajectory (pedicle crossing point, inclination in the sagittal plane, inclination in the axial plane) were obtained for 316 pedicle screws from 3 D CT images of 17 patients with thoracic spinal deformities. Results: the analysis of pedicle screw parameters, obtained by two manual and one computer-assisted planning, indicated a statistically significant diï¬€erence in the screw size (p < 0. 05) and trajectory (p < 0. 001). Computer-assisted planning proposed wider (p < 0. 05) and longer (p < 0. 001) screws with a higher (p < 0. 001) normalized fastening strength. Conclusions: The comparison revealed consistency between manual and computer-assisted planning of the pedicle screw size and trajectory, except for the screw inclination in the sagittal plane, as manual planning followed more the straight-forward while computer-assisted planning followed more the anatomical insertion technique. While being faster, more repeatable and more reliable than manual planning, computer-assisted planning was also linked with a higher <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> strength and consequently a higher screw pull-out strength. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> torque applied during bone {{fracture}} fixation has a decisive influence on subsequent bone healing. Insufficient screw tightness {{can result in}} device/construct instability; conversely, excessive torques risk damaging the bone causing premature fixation failure. This effect is even more prominent in osteoporotic bone, a condition associated annually with almost 9 million fractures worldwide. During fracture fixation, screw tightening torque is applied using subjective feel. This approach may not be optimal for patient"s recovery, increasing risk of fixation failure, particularly in osteoporotic bone, and potentially require revision surgical interventions. Besides bone density, various factors influence the performance of screw fixation. These factors include bone geometry, cortical thickness and time-dependant relaxation behaviour of the bone. If the influence of <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> torque on the bone and relationships between these factors was better understood, the surgical technique could be optimised {{to reduce the risk}} of complications. Within this study, we developed an axisymmetric finite element (FE) model of bone screw tightening incorporating viscoelastic behaviour of the cortical bone such as creep and stress relaxation. The model anticipated time-dependent behaviour of the bone for different bone thickness and density after a typical bone fixation screw had been inserted. The idealised model has been developed based on CT scans of bones with varying densities and inserted screws. The model was validated through a series of experiments involving bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the evolution of surface strains with time (Ncorr v 1. 2). Stress distribution was assessed in photoelastic experiments using acrylic analogues. Relaxation tests have been performed in aqueous environment for up to 48 hours to ensure the relaxation would be complete. The creep behaviour (maximum principal strain) was compared against computational predictions. Our early simulations predicted relaxation strains on the surface of the bone to be 1. 1 % within 24 hours comparing favourably to 1. 3 % measured experimentally. Stress distribution patterns were in agreement with photoelastic results. Using experimentally derived viscoelastic properties, the model has the potential to predict creep and stress relaxation patterns after screw insertion with different fastening torques for bones with varying density and geometry. We aim to develop this into a planning tool providing guidance to surgeons for optimal tightening when using screw fixation, particularly in reduced quality bone...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, the {{hot-rolled}} steel {{members have}} been recognized as {{the most popular and}} widely used steel group, but in recent times, the use of cold-formed high strength steel members has rapidly increased. However, the structural behavior of light gauge high strength cold-formed steel members characterized by various buckling modes is not yet fully understood. The current cold-formed steel sections such as C- and Z-sections are commonly used because of their simple forming procedures and easy connections, but they suffer from certain buckling modes. It is therefore important that these buckling modes are either delayed or eliminated to increase the ultimate capacity of these members. This research is therefore aimed at developing a new cold-formed steel beam with two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web formed using intermittent <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> to enhance the flexural capacity while maintaining a minimum fabrication cost. This thesis describes a detailed investigation into the structural behavior of this new Rectangular Hollow Flange Beam (RHFB), subjected to flexural action The first phase of this research included experimental investigations using thirty full scale lateral buckling tests and twenty two section moment capacity tests using specially designed test rigs to simulate the required loading and support conditions. A detailed description of the experimental methods, RHFB failure modes including local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling modes, and moment capacity results is presented. A comparison of experimental results with the predictions from the current design rules and other design methods is also given. The second phase of this research involved a methodical and comprehensive investigation aimed at widening the scope of finite element analysis to investigate the buckling and ultimate failure behaviours of RHFBs subjected to flexural actions. Accurate finite element models simulating the physical conditions of both lateral buckling and section moment capacity tests were developed. Comparison of experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the buckling and ultimate failure behaviour of RHFBs can be simulated well using appropriate finite element models. Finite element models simulating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and a uniform moment loading were also developed in order to use in a detailed parametric study. The parametric study results were used to review the current design rules and to develop new design formulae for RHFBs subjected to local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling effects. Finite element analysis results indicate that the discontinuity due to <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> has a noticeable influence only for members in the intermediate slenderness region. Investigations into different combinations of thicknesses in the flange and web indicate that increasing the flange thickness is more effective than web thickness in enhancing the flexural capacity of RHFBs. The current steel design standards, AS 4100 (1998) and AS/NZS 4600 (1996) are found sufficient to predict the section moment capacity of RHFBs. However, the results indicate that the AS/NZS 4600 is more accurate for slender sections whereas AS 4100 is more accurate for compact sections. The finite element analysis results further indicate that the current design rules given in AS/NZS 4600 is adequate in predicting the member moment capacity of RHFBs subject to lateral torsional buckling effects. However, they were inadequate in predicting the capacities of RHFBs subject to lateral distortional buckling effects. This thesis has therefore developed a new design formula to predict the lateral distortional buckling strength of RHFBs. Overall, this thesis has demonstrated that the innovative RHFB sections can perform well as economically and structurally efficient flexural members. Structural engineers and designers should make use of the new design rules and the validated existing design rules to design the most optimum RHFB sections {{depending on the type of}} applications.

As information about the liaisons is not explicitly available in either the part model or the assembly model, algorithms have been developed for extracting liaisons from the assembly model. The use of liaison is proposed to enable both the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out, as well as maintaining integrity of both product and process models as the inevitable changes happen to both design and the manufacturing environment during the product lifecycle.

40|$|Introduction Osteoporosis is {{the most}} common bone disease, {{contributing}} to over 3. 5 million fragility fractures each year in the EU [1]. Managing these fractures costs â‚¬ 37 billion each year with a 25 % increase predicted by 2025. Fracture fixation in reduced density osteoporotic bone is a surgical challenge and failures are common, occurring in 15 - 40 % of cases [2]. It is hypothesised that the torque used to fasten bone screws during fracture fixation significantly influences the holding strength of screws and thus the likelihood of fixation failure. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the effect of different insertion torques on the holding strength of cortical bone screws for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. Methods Experimental tests (n= 100) were conducted to evaluate cortical screw pull-out strength using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months). The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. Screws were inserted using a range of insertion torques, and the pullout strength was measured for each (Instron 5967, High Widcomb, UK). Additionally, the effect of stress-relaxation was investigated by imaging the surface of the bone surrounding the screw immediately after <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> at logarithmic intervals up till 17 hours post-fixation. Strains were evaluated using digital image correlation (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T., USA). An axisymmetric finite element (FE) model was developed based on the experimental tests. An idealized screw geometry incorporating screw threads was based on CT-images (Simpleware ScanIP, Exeter, UK). Using a maximum tensile strain failure criteria, (considering the tensile yield strain of cortical bone to be 1. 0 %), the FE model was used to predict the pull-out strength for the variables considered (Ansys 15. 0, USA). Results Significant stress relaxation was found to occur post-fixation, with the strain distribution appearing to be related to the proximity of the thread to the surface. There was good agreement in predicted and measured pullout force versus mean cortical thickness. Discussion Although relatively simple, the developed validated model is capable of predicting cortical bone screw pullout strength for a range of bone densities and cortical thicknesses. This study found that significant stress-relaxation occurs post-fixation, in line with previous literature [3]. Currently, the effect of screw insertion and stress-relaxation is not included in the models. The relationship between fastening torque and axial screw preload is well defined [4], thus screw insertion torque can be reasonably approximated in this way. We aim to incorporate both of these effects to understand the post-fixation screw mechanics and further improve our modelling predictions. Our intention is to develop this model into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> torques for different bone qualities. This tool has the potential to enhance construct stability and reduce the incidence of failures. The developed model could also be used as a design tool for screws. References 1.

40|$|Surgeons {{generally}} use subjective feel {{to tighten}} bone screws {{as much as}} possible without stripping the threads; however, subsequent fixation failures are common, particularly in osteoporotic bone. We hypothesise that if the preload generated in reduced bone quality and itâ€™s dissipation over time was better understood, then some of these failures could be avoided through the use of more appropriate fastening torques or a different number of screws. This ongoing study aims to develop a validated finite element model capable of predicting the preload generated for different bone densities and cortical thicknesses. To date, experimental tests (n= 10) were conducted using bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the bone-implant pressure (LLW Prescale Fuji Film) and surface strains (Ncorr v 1. 2, G. I. T.) for a range of tightening torques. The bone density (assessed using CT-images) and cortical thickness of each specimen were recorded. An axisymmetric finite element model was developed based on the experimental tests (Ansys 15. 0). Our early simulations predicted the equivalent strain {{at the edge of the}} implant-bone contact region to be 0. 062 %, which was within the range of the experimentally observed values (0. 04 - 0. 07 %). The predicted bone-implant pressure also compared favorably with a pressure varying between 2. 5 and 0 MPa. Using an experimentally derived relationship between fastening torque and bone-implant pressure, the model has the potential to predict preload for any bone quality. Our intention is to develop this model, in combination with established formulas to calculate stripping torque, into a patient-specific tool providing surgeons with guidance regarding appropriate <b>screw</b> <b>fastening</b> torques for different bone qualities...|$|E

The use of liaison has been proposed to better integrate the product and assembly process. Two facets of integration have been addressed in this thesis. One is concurrent evolution of the process model with the product model {{and the second is}} associativity between product model and process model. A liaison data structure has been proposed, which is set of geometric entities, associated with one or more assembly process that acts as an interface between the product model and process model. As the liaison data is not available explicitly in the product model, a set of algorithms have been developed and implemented to identify and extract the geometric entities defined in the liaison data structure from assembly model. The proposed algorithms can identify and extract liaisons for riveting, welding, bolt fastening, <b>screw</b> <b>fastening,</b> adhesive bonding (gluing) and blind fastening. The developed algorithms have been implemented and tested. The process model needs to evolve with the product model concurrently so that any mistakes or infeasibility in the process model can be flagged right away. The use of liaison enables the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out. A framework based on liaison has been proposed and implemented to demonstrate the concurrent evolution of product and process model. Linking the changes in the product model to flag the changes (or at least identify the need for changes) in the process model forms the associativity problem. The liaison has been used for maintaining associativity between the product and process model. A framework has been proposed for maintaining associativity between product model and process model that makes use of expert knowledge or tribal knowledge to track impact of changes in product model or process model. An aircraft wing box has been used as an example to illustrate and validate the proposed approaches.

Test capacity results were compared with the capacities predicted by the current design rules in the Australian and North American steel design standards, AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100, to verify their applicability to RHFBs. The results show that although the current design rules based on effective width principles predicted the section moment capacities of RHFBs slightly unconservatively in comparison to test results, they can be used for RHFBs provided a suitable screw spacing is used. However, the Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules are found to predict the section moment capacity of this new screw-fastened hollow flange beam section conservatively in most cases. This research shows that the DSM based design rules including the new inelastic reserve bending capacity provisions in AISI S 100 can be used to predict the section moment capacities of both screw-fastened and welded hollow flange beam sections conservatively...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{commercial}} inventions of Artur Fischer was the synchronous camera flash which was sold to Agfa. In 1958 Artur Fischer designed the first plastic S-Plug which enables <b>screws</b> to be <b>fastened</b> into masonry substrate. Strong demand meant the company expanded rapidly and within three years the first subsidiaries were founded in Brazil and France. Originally intended as a novelty Christmas gift, fischertechnik was launched commercially in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|Two engines {{were used}} in the 1954 model year, with the more {{powerful}} Blue Flame unit used with the Powerglide automatic transmission. All 210s had a three-speed synchromesh manual transmission as standard, with two optional transmissions. All engines were of an overhead valve (OHV) design. They are commonly referred to as [...] "stovebolt sixes" [...] because of the large slotted-head <b>screws</b> used to <b>fasten</b> the valve cover and pushrod covers to the block.|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel lipped channel beams (LCB) {{are used}} {{extensively}} in residential, industrial and commercial buildings as load bearing structural elements. Their shear capacities are considerably reduced when web openings are included {{for the purpose}} of locating building services. Past research has shown that the shear capacities of LCBs were reduced by up to 70 % due to the inclusion of these web openings. Hence {{there is a need to}} improve the shear capacities of LCBs with web openings. A cost effective way of eliminating the detrimental effects of large web openings is to attach suitable stiffeners around the web openings and restore the original shear strength and stiffness of LCBs. Hence detailed experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the behaviour and strength of LCBs with stiffened web openings subject to shear, and combined bending and shear actions. Both plate and stud stiffeners with varying sizes and thicknesses were attached to the web elements of LCBs using different screw-fastening arrangements. Simply supported test specimens of LCBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Numerical studies were also undertaken to investigate the strength of LCBs with stiffened web openings. Finite element models of LCBs with stiffened web openings under shear, combined bending and shear actions were developed to simulate the behaviour of tested LCBs. The developed models were then validated by comparing their results with experimental results and used in further studies. Both experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the stiffening arrangements recommended by past research and available design guidelines are not adequate to restore the original shear strengths of LCBs. Therefore new stiffener arrangements were proposed based on <b>screw</b> <b>fastened</b> plate stiffeners. This paper presents the details of this research study and the results...|$|R
50|$|In woodworking, {{there are}} two {{distinctly}} different categories of scarf, based on whether the joint has interlocking faces or not. A plain scarf is simply two flat planes meeting on an angle relative to the axis of the stock being joined, and depends entirely on adhesive and/or mechanical <b>fastening</b> (<b>screws,</b> bolts, etc.) for all strength. Hooked, keyed, and nibbed scarfs {{are some of the}} many example of interlocking scarfs, offering varying degrees of tensile and compressive strength, though most still depend on mechanical fastening to keep the joint closed.|$|R
5000|$|Helmet - A helmet with strap, and {{optionally}} a face cage or visor, {{is required}} of all ice hockey players. Hockey helmets come in various sizes, {{and many of the}} older designs can also be adjusted by loosening or <b>fastening</b> <b>screws</b> at the side or at the back. Ice hockey helmets are made of a rigid but flexible thermoplastic outer shell, usually nylon or ABS, with firm vinyl nitrile foam padding inside to reduce shocks. Even with the helmet and visor/face cage, concussions and facial injuries are common injuries in the sport.|$|R
