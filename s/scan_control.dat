40|$|Abstract- The {{amount of}} die area {{consumed}} by scan chains and <b>scan</b> <b>control</b> circuit {{can range from}} 15 %~ 30 %, and scan chain failures account for almost 50 % of chip failures. As the conventional diagnosis process usually runs on the faulty free scan chain, scan chain faults may disable the diagnostic process, leaving large failure area to time-consuming failure analysis. In this paper, a design-for-diagnosis (DFD) technique is proposed to diagnose faulty scan chains precisely and efficiently, moreover, with the assistant of the proposed technique, the conventional logic diagnostic process can be carried on with faulty scan chains. The proposed approach is entirely compatible with conventional scan-based design. Previously proposed software-based diagnostic methods for conventional scan designs can still be applied to our design.

However, applied practitioners are not always able to achieve this level of control and the subsequent impact on measurement precision is not always taken into account when evaluating longitudinal body composition changes. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to establish the reliability of DXA in an applied elite sport setting to investigate whether real body composition changes can be detected. Additionally, the performance implications of these changes during the training year were investigated. Forty-eight well-trained athletes (from four diverse sports) underwent two DXA scans using a ‘real-world’ approach (with limited pre <b>scan</b> <b>controls),</b> typically within 48 h, to quantify typical error of measurement (TEM). Twenty-five athletes underwent further scans, before and after specific training and competition blocks. ‘True’ body composition changes were evaluated using 2 xTEM thresholds. Twelve bob skeleton athletes also performed countermovement jump and leg press tests at each time point. Many ‘true’ body composition changes were detected and coincided with the primary training emphases (e. g., lean mass gains during hypertrophy-based training). Clear relationships (r ± 90 % CI) were observed between performance changes (countermovement jump and leg press) and changes in lean mass (0. 53 ± 0. 26 and 0. 35 ± 0. 28, respectively) and fat mass (0. 44 ± 0. 27 and 0. 37 ± 0. 28, respectively).
