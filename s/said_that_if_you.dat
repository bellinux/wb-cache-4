500|$|Drummer Chris Columbo, who {{conducted}} the club's orchestra for 34 years, [...] remembered that the early morning shows were the most vibrant because [...] the other clubs in town were closed {{and many of those}} who were appearing at them were now at Club Harlem jamming with the club's musicians.

2500|$|The former Nakajima District, {{which today}} is Peace Memorial Park, was a {{prominent}} business quarter of the city {{during the early years}} of the Showa period (1926–89) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War ll intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union ...|$|E

2500|$|A notable North Campus fixture is the {{cast-iron}} gateway {{that stands}} at its main entrance. Known as [...] "The Arch" [...] (but often erroneously pluralized to [...] "The Arches"), the structure was patterned after the Seal of the State of Georgia, and has faced historic downtown Athens ever {{since it was}} erected in the 1850s. Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government, the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the Georgia Constitution's three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal. There is a superstition about walking through The Arch. It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> walk under The Arch as an undergraduate student, you will not graduate from the University of Georgia on time. Another legend claims that should you walk through The Arch as a freshman, you will become sterile. The steps lining The Arch are noticeably worn due to students avoiding walking under The Arch.|$|E

There has only been one fight which could be called a battle since the war began; and as for the sieges, it means that you lose a lot of men, and have little credit when you take a place, especially as the moment you go out one way the enemy enter on the other side, and there is all the work to be done over again." ...|$|R

[...] The Unwinding follows the decline of a number of American institutions that Packer believes underpinned this contract, including locally owned businesses, unions, and public schools.
