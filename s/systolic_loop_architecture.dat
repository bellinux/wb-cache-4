The computational nodes of the computer are linked together in a systolic ring. The program based on this. topology for large biopolymers increases its computational throughput nearly linearly {{with the number of}} computational nodes. The program developed is closely related to the simulation programs CHARMM and XPLOR, the input files required (force field, protein structure file, coordinates) and output files generated (sets of atomic coordinates representing dynamic trajectories and energies) are compatible with the corresponding files of these programs. Benchmark results of simulations of biopolymers comprising 66, 568, 3 634, 5 797 and 12 637 atoms are compared with XPLOR simulations on conventional computers (Cray, Convex, Vax). These results demonstrate that the software and hardware developed provide extremely cost effective biopolymer simulations.

40|$|Abstract â€” Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) {{circuits}} {{have been}} used extensively in the receivers of optical communication systems, {{and a variety of}} applications of inter and intra chip communications. The primary design/performance metrics of CDR circuits are clock jitter, lock range, acquisition time, power consumption, silicon area, and noise immunity. The main source of jitter is the power supply noise. The present paper investigates the effects of power supply noise on the jitter performance of the well known dual <b>loop</b> <b>architecture</b> of CDR system. In order to improve the jitter performance of the dual loop CDR system, the VCO alone is replaced by the self-biased Maneatis VCO which is well known for its immunity to power supply noise and process variations. The Maneatis VCO is widely used for microprocessors PLL systems but it is rarely used in CDR systems. The combination of the dual <b>loop</b> <b>architecture</b> and self-biased Maneatis VCO together provides the benefits of both schemes. Simulations were then carried out systematically to determine the capability of the proposed CDR circuit to tolerate power supply noise. The results presented in this paper show that while the conventional dual <b>loop</b> <b>architecture</b> cannot tolerate more than 20 mV@ 10 MHz noise on power supply terminal, the proposed CDR architecture can tolerate up t...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A new modular <b>loop</b> <b>architecture</b> for {{distributed}} {{computer systems}} {{has been developed}} and compared with {{three of the most}} prominent <b>loop</b> <b>architectures</b> currently being used. The competitive loops with which the new architecture has been compared are the Newhall loop, the Pierce loop and the DLCN loop. The four <b>loop</b> <b>architectures</b> were compared by means of simulation models, with the new architecture demonstrating significant improvements in throughput and response time over the competitive systems. In addition, the new loop network is highly modular, flexible, and adaptable to network growth, allowing for growth and change in user's request. The new loop structure introduces two major innovations; use of a separate control loop for control messages flowing between nodes and a loop controller and a partitionable structure for a separate data loop with each segment between two adjacent nodes treated as a separate bus. The simulation results, for the new loop network, were used to guide the development of an M /M/m queueing model. This was done by a regression technique to yield an M/M/Z queueing model. The results of the analytical model were then compared with simulation results. The very close fit between the two models suggests a general technique to obtain a closed form model from simulation results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{performance}} improvements introduced by different tracking <b>loop</b> <b>architectures</b> in ionospheric scintillation's environments. Ionospheric scintillation may cause deep and frequent SIS (Signal In Space) amplitude fading and phase variations resulting in degraded received GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) signals. GNSS services availability, integrity and continuity might be reduced during severe scintillation phenomena, especially in certain areas (geomagnetic equator and polar regions are notable examples). Current Thales Alenia Space-Italy receiver architecture for ground reference stations foresees the usage of a 3 rd order Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to track the phase and frequency variations of the incoming signal. The target of this analysis is to identify and implement the best promising tracking <b>loop</b> <b>architecture,</b> in order to minimize the channel tracking loss probability, linked to the occurrence of Loss-of-Lock (LoL) events, and the discontinuities in carrier phase output, named Cycle Slip (CS) phenomenon. After a literature review the analysis has been focused on techniques that result the most appropriate for reference stations or ionospheric monitoring receivers. In order to emulate realistic conditions, at different ionospheric scintillation intensities, complex time series pre-generated with GISM model [8] have been processed and used in the simulator. The best performing tracking <b>loop</b> <b>architecture</b> is then object of further analysis and comparison, in terms of robustness and performance, involving a more reliable semi-analytic model extended also to Delay Lock <b>Loop</b> (DLL).
