5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrite,</b> sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

30|$|Increased {{awareness}} in {{society of the}} consequences of contaminants in drinking water has created a demand for household water treatment systems, which provide higher quality water, to spread. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of household water treatment systems used in Kerman for the removal of cations and anions. Various brands of home water treatment devices commonly used in Kerman were selected, with one device chosen from each brand for study. In cases in which the devices were used extensively, samples were selected with filters that had been changed in proper time, based on the device’s operational instructions. The samples were selected from homes in the center and four geographical directions of Kerman. Then, sampling was conducted in three stages of input and output water of each device. For each of the samples, parameters were measured, such as chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, hardness, <b>sodium,</b> nitrate and <b>nitrite</b> (mg/L), temperature (°C), and pH. The average removal efficiency of different parameters by 14 brands in Kerman, which include chloride ions, sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, <b>sodium,</b> <b>nitrites,</b> nitrates, and total hardness, was obtained at 68.48, 85, 67, 61.21, 78.97, 80.24, 32.59, 66.83, and 69.38 %, respectively. The amount of sulfate, bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, magnesium, hardness, sodium, and nitrate in the output water of household water treatment systems was less than the input water of these devices, but nitrite concentration in the output of some devices was more than the input water and showed a significant difference (p >  0.05).|$|R

Meta-analyses have suggested that the risk associated with processed meat is higher. Most processed meats are cured and cooked, which leads to formation of free nitrosyl heme. We speculated that free nitrosyl heme is more toxic than native myoglobin. The promoting effect of a freeze-dried, cooked, cured ham diet was looked for in a 100 -day study. Colon carcinogenesis endpoints were aberrant crypt foci and mucin depleted foci (MDF). A second study (14 days) was designed 1) to compare the effect of ham, hemoglobin, and hemin; and 2) to test the effect of <b>sodium</b> chloride, <b>nitrite,</b> and phosphate in diet on early biomarkers associated with heme-induced promotion. In the 100 -day study, control and ham-fed rats had 3. 5 and 8. 5 MDF/colon, respectively (P < 0. 0001). Promotion was associated with cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation. In the short-term study, cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation of fecal water, and the urinary marker of lipid peroxidation, increased dramatically in ham- and hemin-fed rat. In contrast, the hemoglobin diet, <b>sodium</b> chloride, <b>nitrite,</b> phosphate diet had no effect. Freeze-dried cooked ham can promote colon carcinogenesis in a rodent model.

40|$|High level {{radioactive}} {{liquid waste}} generated {{as a result}} of the production of nuclear material for the United States defense program at the Savannah River Site has been stored as 36 million gallons in underground tanks. About ten percent of the waste volume is sludge, composed of insoluble metal hydroxides primarily hydroxides of Mn, Fe, Al, Hg, and most radionuclides including fission products. The remaining ninety percent of the waste volume is saltcake, composed of primarily <b>sodium</b> (<b>nitrites,</b> nitrates, and aluminates) and hydroxides. Saltcakes account for 30 % of the radioactivity while the sludge accounts for 70 % of the radioactivity. A pilot plant salt disposition processing system has been designed at the Savannah River Site for interim processing of salt solution and is composed of two facilities: the Actinide Removal Process Facility (ARPF) and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU). Data from the pilot plant salt processing system will be used for future processing salt at a much higher rate in a new salt processing facility. Saltcake contains significant amounts of actinides, and other long-lived radioactive nuclides such as strontium and cesium that must be extracted prior to disposal as low level waste. The extracted radioactive nuclides will be mixed with the sludge from waste tanks and vitrified in another facility.

Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap.

25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrite,</b> and sodium thiosulfate. The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, {{needed in order to}} produce thiocyanate.|$|E

40|$|Several {{prospective}} {{studies have}} reported that risk of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) is elevated in meat consumers, especially when processed meats are consumed. Elevated risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in meat consumers have also been reported. In this overview, the evidence regarding meat consumption {{and the risk of}} diabetes, both type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) and T 2 DM and their macro- and microvascular complications, is reviewed. For T 2 DM, we performed a new meta-analysis including publications up to October 2012. For T 1 DM, only a few {{studies have reported}} increased risks for meat consumers or for high intake of saturated fatty acids and nitrates and nitrites. For T 2 DM, CHD, and stroke, the evidence is strongest. Per 100 g of total meat, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T 2 DM is 1. 15 (95 % CI 1. 07 – 1. 24), for (unprocessed) red meat 1. 13 (95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 23), and for poultry 1. 04 (95 % CI 0. 99 – 1. 33); per 50 g of processed meat, the pooled RR is 1. 32 (95 % CI 1. 19 – 1. 48). Hence, the strongest association regarding T 2 DM is observed for processed (red) meat. A similar observation has been made for CHD. For stroke, however, a recent meta-analysis shows moderately elevated risks for meat consumers, for processed as well as for fresh meats. For the microvascular complications of diabetes, few prospective data were available, but suggestions for elevated risks can be derived from findings on hyperglycemia and hypertension.
