40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the minimum wage (MW) effects for a German <b>sub-construction</b> sector where the MW bites extraordinary hard by international standards. Within a quasiexperiment we estimate the Quantile Treatment Effects of the MW on the conditional and unconditional distribution of earnings. For Eastern Germany, the results indicate significant real (nominal) wage increases that ripple up to about the 0. 6 th quantile. However, the MW also led to declining real wages (stagnating nominal wages) among upper-decile workers, thus reducing the average pay reward for high-skilled labour in the sector. We provide evidence that a rising labour cost burden for firms together with an increased bargaining power of employers over workers still employed in the sector led to wage moderation at the upper decile, particularly among smaller East German firms. Overall this paper demonstrates how a MW geared towards the lower rank may render unexpected side effects for other workers located higher up in the wage distribution and who are mostly assumed to be unaffected by such policy interventions...|$|E
40|$|In {{industry}} {{the employment}} of fluid and gaseous goods is widely spread. Besides standing cylindrical fluid tanks for gaseous materials saddle supported cylindrical tanks are used for the transport of goods in general. The storage and the transport of dangerous goods represent an enormous risk potential for humans and environment. To minimize this risk the legislator makes numerous demands on the operation and the technical design of such tanks. In particular {{the knowledge of the}} carrying behaviour for all foreseen arising loads is important for the technical design. These are beside loads from operating pressure and vertical load also horizontal loads. Thus the "Verordnung über die innerstaatliche und grenzüberschreitende Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf der Straße und mit Eisenbahnen", briefly GGVSE, with reference to "Anlagen A and B des Europäischen vom 30. September 1957 über die internationale Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf der Straße", briefly ADR, demands the separate proof of stability for tanks under a horizontal transverse force amounting to the gravityload. Whereas for the vertical load case both static and dynamic investigations lead to the today valid practical design aids and calculation formulas published in the "AD-Merkblätter" and the "British standard 5500 ", such investigations and design aids are not present for the case of the horizontal transverse load. This dissertation helps to eliminate this deficit and thus to enable a final estimation of the carrying behaviour under consideration of the static and dynamic horizontal transverse load. The development of calculation formulas and design aids should help to estimate the carrying behaviour. Therefore the dissertation is arranged into two parts; a first part, which deals with the stress in the shell under the dynamic horizontal transverse load and a second part, which deals with static calculation and takes the results of the dynamic research into account. In the first part dynamic experiments on a saddle supported cylindrical tank are made. Therefore the tank is stored on two concrete saddles. The saddles are fixed with a <b>sub-construction</b> of doublesymmetrical steel girders. This construction is oscillated in transverse direction. The charge of the tank (charge: water), the distance to the head stiffeners to the saddles and the frequencies are varied. In each experiment the circumferential and logitudinal strains, the accelerations and the contact pressure distribution between the shell and the saddle are measured. The results of the test series serve as reference for a finite element modelling. In this finite element model (fem) the load distribution on the cylindrical wall due to the dynamic horizontal load is of substantial interest. The comparison of the stresses measured in the experiment with the computation results based on a timedepent load distribution, serves as acknowledgement of the chosen load distribution. This load distribution is the basis for static calculation {{in the second part of}} the work. The second part of the work has the intention of developing practice-oriented calculation formulas which enables the engineer already in the pre-dimensioning stage of saddle supported tanks to take the horizontal transverse load, like demanded in the ADR, into account. In addition two different computation methods are analyzed with regard to their suitability for a parameter study of the analyzed system. These are on the one hand the computation with the help of the finite elements method (fem) and on the other hand the computation on basis of an analytic computation method, which is self-depent developed further for the analyzed case. The analytic method is based on the generalised technical bending theory. Both the fem and the analytic method lead to the result that the peak stress at the saddle horn rapidly reaches the theoretical yield stress. Before making the parameter study to develop practice-oriented calculation formulas some calculation based on an elastic-plastic material behaviour are made. Therefore the van Mises’ equivalent stress criterion model is used. A parameter study follows in which the radius, the shell thickness, the contact angle between the saddle and shell, the length, the distance of the head stiffener to the saddle and the saddle rigidity are varied. The evaluation of the computation results supplies calculation formulas suitable for the hand calculation under consideration of the elastic-plastic carrying behaviour in the pre-dimensioning stage of saddle-supported cylindrical shells under horizontal transverse load. This enables the planning engineer in the future to consider the horizontal transverse load appropriately even in the pre-dimensioning stage. The research of practice-oriented questions regarding the magnitude of transverse accelerations affecting the tank, the constructional design of the saddles and the ratio of the maximum stress due to vertical load to the stress due to horizontal load finally completes the dissertation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I suggest an {{interface}} level of semantic representations, {{that on the}} one hand corresponds to morpho-syntactic entities such as phrase structure rules, function words and inflections, and that on the other hand can be mapped to lexical semantic representations that one ultimately needs in order to give good predictions about argument frames of lexical items. This interface level consists of basic constructions that can be decomposed into five <b>sub-constructions</b> (arg 1 -role, arg 2 -role [...] . arg 5 -role). I argue in favour of phrasal constructions in order to account for altering argument frames and maybe also coercion without having to use lexical rules or multiple lexical entries. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsually, {{linguistic}} theories {{make use}} of a hierarchical representation of syntactic information. Even when no relation with tree-like structures is explicit, as for HPSG (cf. [Sag 99]) or Construction Grammars (see for example [Kay 99]), a structure is {{described in terms of}} a hierarchy. This aspect is reinforced by lexicalization: representing syntactic information at the lexical level comes with feature localization in terms of position into a hierarchy, feature propagation being controlled through the head/mother structure. This conception, close to the generative way of representing information, is very rigid in the sense that building a hierarchical structure is a pre-requisite and one cannot say anything about syntactic properties of non-canonical (not to say non-grammatical) utterances. Construction grammars also suffer from this problem. Moreover, for the same reasons, the only way to represent local constraints is <b>sub-constructions</b> inheriting from higher level frames...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGiven {{the large}} number of dynamic {{geometry}} systems (DGS), geometry automated theorem provers (GATP) and repositories of geometric information (constructions and/or conjectures), we face the need of a query mechanism for formal descriptions of geometric constructions. The DGS and GATP describe the geometric constructions using formal languages where the elements and the relations between them are described formally and not in terms of a given geometric model. Given a formal language {{we need to be able}} to look for similar construction, <b>sub-constructions</b> or even different construction sharing a common property, e. g., a set of constructions about right angled triangles. Our approach is to transform the geometric construction into a semantic graph representation of the construction, in a given ontology. Graph pattern recognition algorithms can then be used to search for the similarities we need and the results brought back to the geometric setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{role that}} constructions {{play in a}} {{linguistic}} theory has changed throughout the evolution of generative theories. Construction specific rules are common when transformations are envisioned as tree to tree operations in classical TG. On the other extreme, constructions, {{as well as all}} structural properties, are regarded as derived linguistic properties predictable from various principles in recent GB theories. Since whether a construction is an autonomous linguistic entity or not has great implications for either a formal or a computational linguistic theory, we will examine the status of Mandarin existential construction based on the theory of Construction Grammar [1, 2]. We will show that the Mandarin existential construction represents an unique structure-meaning pair that cannot be captured in a grammar unless the pairing is regarded as a theoretical entity in linguistics ([3]). Since constructions are shown to exist in Mandarin Chinese, we support the theoretical claims of Construction Grammar as well as the position that constructions {{must be taken into account}} in NLP. I. Existential constructions and its two <b>sub-constructions</b> The existential sentences in Mandarin Chinese, such as (1) and (2), have been traditionall...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the emergence {{and development of}} the Cantonese serial verb construction (SVC) in children from 1; 03 to 4; 06 by investigating the naturalistic data from two longitudinal corpora. This study presents a descriptive account of the emergence and development of SVCs in early child Cantonese, seeks to explain the developmental facts from a constructionist usage-based perspective, and compares the development of SVCs in Cantonese-English bilinguals with that in Cantonese monolinguals. It is found that children start to produce SVCs spontaneously at an early age of 1; 10 and that the overall frequency of occurrence is low during the developmental period studied. The early emergence of SVCs is attributed to children’s preference for iconic structures. Four surface forms are identified and shown to emerge with a consistent order: two-verb contiguous (1; 10 - 11) < two-verb non-contiguous (2; 00 - 01) < multi-verb contiguous (2; 02) < multi-verb non-contiguous (2; 03 - 06). Structural and conceptual complexities are suggested to be the possible factors that influence the order. The earlier emergence of contiguous forms than non-contiguous forms is explained by the hypothesis that cross-linguistically unmarked structures tend to be acquired earlier than the marked ones (O’Grady 2000). Such a generalization is compatible with constructionist approaches in suggesting cross-linguistic cognitive functional preferences for language processing. Children tend to use certain component verbs that express eight main semantic notions. The study interprets children’s SVCs as concrete instantiations of eight <b>sub-constructions,</b> which are subsumed by a more abstract high level SVC schema. It is observed that <b>sub-constructions</b> develop asynchronously, as the developmental paths of the four more frequently used SVCs (directional, dative, purpose and resultative SVCs) are more advanced than the four less often produced SVCs (instrumental, benefactive, comitative and locative SVCs). Developmental paths of the former are shown to be consistent with Tomasello’s (2003) usage-based account of language development: from concrete expressions, to pivot schemas, then to item-based constructions. However, this study does not have enough data to suggest the emergence of an abstract schema for the high level SVC. It is found that children imitate adults’ previous SVCs and repeat their own spontaneous productions frequently. These highlight the roles of the ambient language and linguistic use to children’s language development. The overall error rates of SVCs are found to be low. The reasons proposed for error production, that are, adult input, generalization from item-based constructions and complexity of target constructions, are considered as evidence to support the constructionist usage-based approach. This study shows that Cantonese-dominant bilinguals resemble Cantonese monolinguals in developing SVCs. Language dominance is invoked to account for the developmental similarities observed. Only a few code-mixed instances are recorded, suggesting limited English influence on Cantonese SVCs. It is argued that SVCs are not a vulnerable domain as they emerge early, and are produced with low error rates, and are not susceptible to English influence. By delineating the patterns of emergence and development of SVCs in child Cantonese and explaining the findings with the constructionist usage-based framework, it is hoped that this study would contribute to our understanding of child language development. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
