5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use <b>secondary,</b> <b>explosive</b> weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a combat Engineer with Company B, First Engineer Battalion, First Marine Division in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On 27 May 1969, Private First Class Phipps, was a member of a two-man combat engineer demolition team assigned to locate and destroy enemy artillery ordnance and concealed firing devices. After he had expended all of his explosives and blasting caps, Private First Class Phipps discovered a 175mm high explosive artillery round in a rice paddy. Suspecting that the enemy had attached at the artillery round to a <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> device, he warned other Marines in the area to move to covered positions and prepared to destroy the round with a hand grenade. As he was attaching the hand grenade to a stake beside the artillery round, the fuse of the enemy's <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> device ignited. Realizing that his assistant and the platoon commander were both with a few meters of him and that the imminent explosion could kill all three men, Private First Class Phipps grasped the hand grenade to his chest and dived forward to cover the enemy's explosive and the artillery round with his body, thereby shielding his companions from the detonation while absorbing the full and tremendous impact with his own body. Private First Class Phipp's indomitable courage, inspiring initiative and selfless devotion to duty saved the lives of two Marines and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

50|$|High-explosives trains can {{be either}} two-step (e.g., {{detonator}} and dynamite) or three-step (e.g., detonator, booster of primary explosive, and main charge of <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive).</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of {{a primary}} and <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> was the first {{practical}} use of the staged detonation principle, and was revolutionary {{to the safety of}} the mining industry. After this staged detonation is used in everything from explosive lenses in nuclear weapons (where the different properties of each explosive create a perfectly spherical detonation wave moving in towards origo) to mining where each blasting operation requires several stages to detonate each main charge, not only the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> used in the simplest staged detonation.|$|E

50|$|Solid pack {{electric}} {{blasting caps}} use a thin bridgewire in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a primary explosive, which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation {{of the primary}} explosive.

50|$|Mannitol hexanitrate is a <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{formed by}} the {{nitration}} of mannitol, a sugar alcohol. The product is used in medicine as a vasodilator and as an explosive in blasting caps.

50|$|Primary {{explosives}} {{are often}} used in detonators or to trigger larger charges of less sensitive <b>secondary</b> <b>explosives.</b> Primary explosives are commonly used in blasting caps and percussion caps to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical/physical shock, or, {{in the case of}} laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.|$|R

50|$|Tertiary explosives, {{also called}} {{blasting}} agents, are so insensitive to shock that they cannot be reliably detonated by practical quantities of primary explosive, and instead require an intermediate explosive booster of <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive.</b> These {{are often used}} for safety and the typically lower costs of material and handling. The largest consumers are large-scale mining and construction operations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> is less {{sensitive}} than a primary explosive and requires substantially more energy to be initiated. Because they are {{less sensitive}}, they are usable in {{a wider variety of}} applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a primary explosive.|$|E
50|$|Both of the Manhattan bombs—the {{one that}} {{exploded}} {{and the second}} that was disabled—were of the same design, using pressure cookers filled with bearings or metal BBs that were rigged with flip phones and Christmas lights that set off a small charge of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), which served as a detonator for a larger charge of a <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> similar to Tannerite.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of PETN is as an {{explosive}} with high brisance. It {{is more difficult}} to detonate than primary explosives, so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns relatively slowly), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other <b>secondary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} {{detonators}} such as blasting caps {{came from the}} development of safer explosives. Different explosives require different amounts of energy (their activation energy) to detonate. Most commercial explosives are formulated with a high activation energy, to make them stable and safe to handle so they will not explode if accidentally dropped, mishandled, or exposed to fire. These are called <b>secondary</b> <b>explosives.</b> However they are correspondingly difficult to detonate intentionally, and require a small initiating explosion. This is provided by a detonator.|$|R

5000|$|In 1875, H. Julius Smith—and then in 1887 Perry G. Gardner of North Adams, Massachusetts—developed {{electric}} detonators that combined a hot wire detonator with mercury fulminate explosive. [...] These {{were the first}} generally modern type blasting caps. Modern caps use different explosives and separate primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> charges, but are generally {{very similar to the}} Gardner and Smith caps.|$|E
50|$|ANFO is a {{tertiary}} explosive, {{meaning that}} it cannot be set off by the small quantity of primary explosive in a typical blasting cap. A larger quantity of <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive,</b> known as a primer or a booster, must be used.

50|$|Militaries use {{a variety}} of contact {{explosives}} in combat. Some can be manufactured into different types of bombs, tactical grenades, and even explosive bullets. Dry picric acid, which is more powerful than TNT, was used in blasting charges and artillery shells. A lot of contact explosives are used in detonators. For explosives that use secondary explosives, contact explosives are used in the detonators to set off an energy chain reaction that will eventually set off the <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|E

50|$|High {{explosives}} (HE) are {{explosive materials}} that detonate, {{meaning that the}} explosive shock front passes through the material at a supersonic speed. High explosives detonate with explosive velocity ranging from 3 to 9 km/s. For instance, TNT has a detonation (burn) rate of approximately 5.8 km/s (19,000 feet per second), Detonating cord of 6.7 km/s (22,000 feet per second), and C-4 about 8.5 km/s (29,000 feet per second). They are normally employed in mining, demolition, and military applications. They {{can be divided into}} two explosives classes differentiated by sensitivity: primary explosive and <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive.</b> The term high explosive is in contrast with the term low explosive, which explodes (deflagrates) at a lower rate. They are stable and quite insensitive to fire and mechanical shocks.|$|E

50|$|It {{would be}} very {{difficult}} to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and a <b>secondary</b> <b>explosive</b> by others. As a general rule, PETN is considered to be either a relatively insensitive primary explosive, or one of the most sensitive secondary explosives. PETN may be detonated by striking with a hammer on a hard steel surface (a very dangerous thing to do), and is generally considered the least sensitive explosive with which this may be done. For these facts and other reasons, PETN is considered one standard by which other explosives are gauged.|$|E
