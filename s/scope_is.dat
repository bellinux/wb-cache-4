5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{uses the}} {{standard}} setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> larger {{than that of a}} regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment {{on the state of the}} environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channelsâ€”from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray <b>Scope</b> <b>is</b> used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|<b>SCOPE</b> <b>was</b> {{set up as}} a {{subsidiary}} to Scomi Group on 4 Dec 2001. Before <b>SCOPE</b> <b>was</b> set up as {{a subsidiary}} of Scomi, it was known as Prisma Wibawa Sdn. Bhd. (PWSB). At first, PWSB had no production facility but after <b>SCOPE</b> <b>was</b> set up, a production facility {{was set up in}} 2001 in Shah Alam. [...] The General Manager of <b>SCOPE</b> <b>was</b> Shamsul Bahrin Rukiban. In 2001, <b>SCOPE</b> <b>was</b> reported to have secured a contract to supply components to a Dubai-based customer.|$|R
50|$|After {{a raucous}} trial, in which Darrow squared off against William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, <b>Scopes</b> <b>was</b> convicted and fined $100. The {{conviction}} was reversed by an appellate court because the maximum fine <b>was</b> $50, but <b>Scopes</b> <b>was</b> never retried.|$|R
5000|$|In dynamic scoping, if a {{programmer}} declares a variable {{within the scope}} of a function, it is available to subroutines called from within that function. Originally, this was intended as an optimization; lexical <b>scoping</b> <b>was</b> still uncommon and of uncertain performance. [...] "I asked RMS when he was implementing emacs lisp why it <b>was</b> dynamically <b>scoped</b> and his exact reply <b>was</b> that lexical <b>scope</b> <b>was</b> too inefficient." [...] Dynamic <b>scoping</b> <b>was</b> also meant to provide greater flexibility for user customizations. However, dynamic scoping has several disadvantages. Firstly, it can easily lead to bugs in large programs, due to unintended interactions between variables in different functions. Secondly, accessing variables under dynamic <b>scoping</b> <b>is</b> generally slower than under lexical scoping.|$|R
25|$|Gastroscopy, or {{endoscopic}} {{evaluation of}} the stomach, is useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} gastric ulcers, gastric impactions, and gastric masses. A 3-meter <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> required to visualize the stomach of most horses, and the horse must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|A {{few of the}} {{disadvantages}} of the method is that it often fails to distinguish between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-, m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> limited in identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} uses of scopes is troubleshooting malfunctioning electronic equipment. One {{of the advantages of}} a <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> that it can graphically show signals: where a voltmeter may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. The {{concrete}} partitioning of {{a program}} into <b>scopes</b> <b>is</b> application-specific. For example, in [24] a program partitioning is used that allows to trade the number of required test data against the number of instrumentation points. Another feature of <b>scopes</b> <b>is</b> that nested <b>scopes</b> can <b>be</b> used to hide details. This feature allows to reduce the program complexity of the surrounding scope.|$|R
40|$|<b>Scoping</b> studies <b>are</b> {{increasingly}} undertaken {{as distinct}} activities. The interpretation, methodology {{and expectations of}} <b>scoping</b> <b>are</b> highly variable. This suggests that conceptually, <b>scoping</b> <b>is</b> a poorly defined ambiguous term. The distinction between scoping as an integral preliminary process {{in the development of}} a research proposal or a formative, methodologically rigorous activity in its own right has not been extensively examined...|$|R

25|$|Definitions {{based on}} the {{historic}} Oregon Country reach east to the Continental Divide, thus including nearly all of Idaho and parts of western Montana and western Wyoming. Sometimes the Pacific Northwest is defined as being the Northwestern United States specifically, excluding Canada. Note that these types of definitions are often made by government agencies whose <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> limited to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{variable}} types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables. The common feature about automatic variables {{is that they}} have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> left.|$|E
25|$|The Government of the United Kingdom is {{directed}} by the Cabinet, a group of senior government ministers led by the Prime Minister. Most of the day-to-day work of the Cabinet is carried out by Cabinet committees, {{rather than by the}} full Cabinet. Each committee has its own area of responsibility, and their decisions are binding on the entire Cabinet. Their membership and <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> determined by the Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|Endoscopy, {{the looking}} {{down into the}} stomach with a fibre-optic <b>scope,</b> <b>is</b> not {{routinely}} needed if the case is typical and responds to treatment. It is recommended when people either do not respond well to treatment or have alarm symptoms, including dysphagia, anemia, blood in the stool (detected chemically), wheezing, weight loss, or voice changes. Some physicians advocate either once-in-a-lifetime or 5- to 10-yearly endoscopy for people with longstanding GERD, to evaluate the possible presence of dysplasia or Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|A new sight called Dynarange is {{currently}} being procured {{as part of the}} German Infantryman of the Future project. Essentially this is a computer controlled aiming sight with range finder. It is meant to cope with the fact that some soldiers have had difficulties with the regular sight, as its <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> quite complex to the untrained eye. It would increases the weapon's effective range to 600 m (2,000ft) against moving and stationary targets. Dynarange is already in service with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps and the Dutch Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} LQG is one {{possible}} {{solution to the}} problem of quantum gravity, as is string theory. There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses unification, the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction. On the other hand, the consequences of LQG are radical, because they fundamentally change the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} in a third person point of view, though {{interchangeable}} into a first person perspective but {{is more of a}} 'scope' view of the current weapon on hand. Guns with no <b>scopes</b> <b>are</b> given a close up view by the barrel top, while weapons with <b>scopes</b> <b>are</b> given the <b>scoped</b> view.|$|R

25|$|Scope: While new {{reactions}} {{are constantly being}} discovered, most reactions have extremely narrow substrate scope {{and the reason for}} such narrow <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> often not understood. In the field of palladium catalysis, after the foundations of mechanistic understanding were established, the scope of reactions saw rapid growth. Knowing the factors that affected each step of catalysis allowed for the chemists to envision and pursue new reactions of high synthetic utility, such as C-H bond activation reactions. In the field hydrogen bond catalysis, chemists have not yet reached a stage where new types of reactivity can be easily and systematically targeted. At this point, reaction discovery is useful, but more detailed mechanistic study is required to realize the full potential of hydrogen bond catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of its life, a number of {{peripherals}} were released which added to the functionality of the SNES. Many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES: the Super <b>Scope</b> <b>is</b> a light gun functionally similar to the NES Zapper (though the Super Scope features wireless capabilities) and the Super Advantage is an arcade-style joystick with adjustable turbo settings akin to the NES Advantage. Nintendo also released the SNES Mouse in conjunction with its Mario Paint title. Hudson Soft, under license from Nintendo, released the Super Multitap, a multiplayer adapter for use with its popular series of Bomberman games. Some of the more unusual controllers include the BatterUP baseball bat, the Life Fitness Entertainment System (an exercise bike controller with built-in monitoring software), and the TeeV Golf golf club.|$|E
500|$|Holby City {{was created}} by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spinâ€“off from the longâ€“running BBC medical drama Casualty. Young wanted to explore what {{happened}} to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards. While Casualty <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> limited to [...] "accident of the week" [...] storylines about patients entering hospital, Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about longâ€“term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions.|$|E
5000|$|Economies of <b>scope</b> <b>are</b> [...] "efficiencies {{formed by}} variety, not volume" [...] (the latter concept is [...] "economies of scale"). For example, many {{corporate}} diversification plans assume that economies of <b>scope</b> will <b>be</b> achieved.|$|R
5000|$|MILITARY MK II {{product line}} {{designed}} for the military. These <b>scopes</b> <b>are</b> essentially PM II models with an additional laser filtration lens coating to protect operators against being wounded/blinded by laser light sources. The MILITARY MK II <b>scopes</b> <b>are</b> marketed by sniper rifle manufacturer Accuracy International and have the Accuracy International company logo depicted on a turret.|$|R

500|$|Thio Li-ann {{has criticized}} the Court's {{prioritization}} of administrative convenience and efficiency over individual fundamental rights. She {{has argued that}} this has allowed [...] "state interests to trump rights rather than vice versa". This means that {{so long as the}} Minister's motives for the orders were [...] "based on national security considerations and good order, the nature of the ban or its <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> apparently not reviewable". This [...] "manifested a clear bias towards bureaucratic concerns", and gave the Minister excessive power.|$|E
500|$|Noise music (also {{referred}} to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject {{the attempt to}} classify it as a single overall genre, preferring to call noise music a non-genre, an aesthetic, or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Some commentators use the phrase [...] "noise music" [...] (or [...] "noise") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise.|$|E
500|$|Most {{scientists}} and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests {{should only be}} performed where necessary. The [...] "Three Rs" [...] are guiding principles {{for the use of}} animals in research in most countries. [...] Whilst replacement of animals, i.e. alternatives to animal testing, is one of the principles, their <b>scope</b> <b>is</b> much broader. Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups, they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research, and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare.|$|E
