5|$|In {{the matter}} of the annulment, no {{progress}} <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> The Pope seemed more afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply to ignore the Pope, but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E
5|$|With {{war with}} Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia {{in the event}} that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore {{would not be allowed to}} fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take {{priority}} over the Mediterranean. This <b>seemed</b> <b>possible</b> as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

5|$|Slow {{intensification}} {{took place}} after classification as a hurricane, though after recurving northeastward, the storm began to quicken in strengthening. On November 18, the cyclone {{reached its peak}} intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), making it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. Initially, {{it was believed that}} the storm became a Category 4 hurricane, but this was determined to be too strong of an intensity. A relatively small tropical cyclone, the hurricane made landfall along the western coast of Jamaica late on November 18. At the time of landfall, a pressure of 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 inHg) at South Negril Point — the lowest barometric pressure documented anywhere during the storm's existence. Despite only briefly moving inland, the hurricane quickly weakened after landfall and continued to do so upon reentry into the Caribbean Sea. On November 20, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm south of Cuba. Due to ambiguous surface observations in the area at the time, the storm was originally believed to have progressed northwards through the Atlantic before clipping Newfoundland; another scenario indicating that the storm made landfall in New York also <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> However, reanalysis concluded that the system instead tracked westward across the Caribbean, slowly weakening before dissipating on November 22 north of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|The envisioned status {{elevation}} did {{not merely}} serve a decorative purpose, but was regarded a necessity {{to prevail in}} political competition. Though Frederick III held the elevated status of a prince elector, this status was also gained by Maximilian I of Bavaria in 1623, during the Thirty Years' War, also by the Elector of the Palatinate in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and by Ernest Augustus of the House of Hanover in 1692. Thus, the formerly exclusive club of the prince-electors now had nine members, six of whom were secular princes, and further changes <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> Within the circle of prince-electors, August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, had secured the Polish crown in 1697, and the House of Hanover had secured succession of the British throne. From Frederick III's perspective, stagnation in status meant loss of power, and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when the European royals ignored Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697).|$|E

25|$|The Ulster Volunteers were a unionist militia {{founded in}} 1912 to block Home Rule for Ireland.

With a rival Irish Volunteers being formed by nationalists in response, outright civil war in Ireland <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> However, the outbreak of World War I intervened: the Act was put in abeyance until after what {{was expected to be}} a short war.|$|E

25|$|In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat broke 30 {{years of}} hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the {{invitation}} of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the Knesset and was {{a turning point in the}} history of the conflict. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the Middle East in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the Peace Now movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.|$|E
25|$|This led {{naturally}} {{to the second}} issue, involving the sortie rate of the aircraft. In the initial calculations they had assumed similar sortie rates as commercial aircraft like the Boeing 747, flying long multi-hour flights from the oil fields in Alaska to California. However, the sortie rates of commercial aircraft are based on customer preferences on what times they want to fly, not the actual ability of the aircraft. Assuming much shorter routes and 24-hour operation, sortie rates {{on the order of}} 18 to 20 flights a day <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> This greatly reduced the number of aircraft that were needed to provide any particular level of service.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Malay {{society had}} great {{difficulty}} coping {{with both the}} loss of political sovereignty to the British and of economic power to the Chinese. By the early 20th century it <b>seemed</b> <b>possible</b> that the Malays would become a minority in their own country. The Sultans, who were seen as collaborators with both the British and the Chinese, lost some of their traditional prestige, particularly among {{the increasing number of}} Malays with a western education, but the mass of rural Malays continued to revere the Sultans and their prestige was thus an important prop for colonial rule. A small class of Malay nationalist intellectuals began to emerge during the early 20th century, and there was also a revival of Islam in response to the perceived threat of other imported religions, particularly Christianity. In fact few Malays converted to Christianity, although many Chinese did. The northern regions, which were less influenced by western ideas, became strongholds of Islamic conservatism, as they have remained.|$|E
25|$|During Wetz's lifetime, {{his works}} {{remained}} little known outside {{the circle of}} his devotees and music-lovers in his home region, {{to the point that}} he became nearly unknown after his death. Since that time, his compositions have continued to draw few fans despite the eagerness of his enthusiasts and his reputation as a great music pedagogue. Politically, Wetz made decisions towards {{the end of his life}} that may have had an effect on his standing after his death: after the end of the First World War, he became a confessed nationalist who saw the position of his vanquished Germany as a humiliation and longed for resurgence of national greatness, which <b>seemed</b> <b>possible</b> to him in 1933 with the seizure of power by the National Socialists (the Nazis). In May of that same year he enrolled into the Nazi Party and took over the leadership of the music department of the Erfurt branch of the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, where he hoped he could thereby gain the goodwill and the support of the Nazi rulers. This, however, had little influence on his ability to spread his work, leaving him the role of composing primarily propaganda pieces.|$|E
25|$|In Rome, General Ugo Cavallero, the new Capo di Stato Maggiore Generale (Chief of the Italian Supreme Command), {{had urged}} the {{abandonment}} of plans to invade Sudan and {{to concentrate on the}} defence of the AOI. From early January, signs appeared that the Italians were reducing the number of troops on the Sudan frontier and a withdrawal from Kassala <b>seemed</b> <b>possible.</b> News of the Italian disaster in Operation Compass in Egypt, hit-and-run attacks by Gazelle Force and the activities of Mission 101 in Ethiopia, led Frusci to become apprehensive about the northern route to Kassala. On 31 December, the troops on the northern flank withdrew behind Sabdaret, with patrols forward at Serobatib and Adardet and a mobile column in Sabdaret for contingencies. Frusci was ordered to retire from Kassala and Metemma to the passes from Agordat to Gondar but objected on grounds of prestige and proclaimed that the imminent British attack would be scattered. On 17 January, the 12th Colonial Brigade withdrew from Kassala and Tessenei to the triangle formed by the northern and southern roads from Kassala at Keru, Giamal Biscia and Aicota.|$|E

500|$|The French {{government}} had planned the Morea expedition {{in the same}} spirit as those of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the Society of Dilettanti remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover Ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751–1753, and resulted in The Antiquities of Athens, mined by architects and designers for a refined [...] "Grecian" [...] neoclassicism. The expedition of Revett, Richard Chandler and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the “work” of Lord Elgin on the Parthenon {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century had sparked further longing for Greece: it now <b>seemed</b> <b>possible</b> to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.|$|E

The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties.
