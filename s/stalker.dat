5|$|Catherine (Megan Gallagher), {{a social}} worker, is Frank's wife. She moves to Seattle {{with her husband}} when he retires, unaware that their {{relocation}} was motivated by a <b>stalker</b> who was hounding the family. The <b>stalker</b> catches up with the family, kidnapping Catherine. Black rescues her, killing her captor. Repulsed by her husband's rage and disturbed by the incident, she separates amicably from Frank with their daughter Jordan. Before they can reconcile Catherine dies in a viral outbreak launched by the Group, sacrificing herself to ensure Jordan's safety.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in career, the <b>stalker</b> (Doug Hutchison) catches up with Black, {{kidnapping}} Catherine. Black is able to track them down and rescue Catherine, stabbing the <b>stalker</b> {{to death in the}} process. Disturbed by both the abduction and Black's rage, Catherine moves out of their family home with Jordan for a time. Before they can reconcile, Catherine dies in a virus outbreak orchestrated by the Millennium Group, who Black discovers are attempting to control the possibility {{of the end of the}} world at the turn of the millennium. Disgusted by the group's motives and actions, Black breaks rank and returns to work with the FBI in order to take them down.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{schedules}} {{a dentist}} appointment on Valentine's Day to avoid feeling lonely on the holiday. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) meets a successful and attractive CNBC host (Banks). Elsewhere, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is frustrated when her <b>stalker</b> (Sanz) finally loses interest.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{clinical}} study was devised to elucidate the behaviors, motivations, and psychopathology of <b>stalkers.</b> Method: It concerned 145 <b>stalkers</b> {{referred to a}} forensic psychiatry center for treatment. Results: Most of the <b>stalkers</b> were men (79 %, N = 114), and many were unemployed (39 %, N = 56); 52 % (N = 75) had never had an intimate relationship. Victims included ex-partners (30 %, N = 44), professional (23 %, N = 34) or work (11 %, N = 16) contacts, and strangers (14 %, N = 20). Five types of <b>stalkers</b> were recognized: rejected, intimacy seeking, incompetent, resentful, and predatory. Delusional disorders were common (30 %, N = 43), particularly among intimacy-seeking <b>stalkers,</b> although those with personality disorders predominated among rejected <b>stalkers.</b> The duration of stalking was from 4 weeks to 20 years (mean = 12 months), longer for rejected and intimacy-seeking <b>stalkers.</b> Sixty-three percent of the <b>stalkers</b> (N = 84) made threats, and 36 % (N = 52) were assaultive. Threats and property damage were more frequent with resentful <b>stalkers,</b> but rejected and predatory <b>stalkers</b> committed more assaults. Committing assault was also predicted by previous convictions, substance-related disorders, and previous threats. Conclusions: <b>Stalkers</b> {{have a range of}} motivations, from reasserting power over a partner who rejected them to the quest for a loving relationship. Most <b>stalkers</b> are lonely and socially incompetent, but all have the capacity to frighten and distress their victims. Bringing stalking to an end requires a mixture of appropriate legal sanctions and therapeutic interventions...|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>stalkers</b> [...] fit {{categories}} with paranoia disorders. Intimacy-seeking <b>stalkers</b> {{often have}} delusional disorders involving erotomanic delusions. With rejected <b>stalkers,</b> the continual {{clinging to a}} relationship of an inadequate or dependent person couples with the entitlement of the narcissistic personality, and the persistent jealousy of the paranoid personality. In contrast, resentful <b>stalkers</b> demonstrate an almost [...] "pure culture of persecution", with delusional disorders of the paranoid type, paranoid personalities, and paranoid schizophrenia.|$|R
50|$|Profiling of <b>stalkers</b> {{shows that}} almost always they stalk someone they know or, via delusion, think they know, {{as is the}} case with <b>stalkers</b> of celebrities or public persons in which the <b>stalkers</b> feel they know the celebrity even though the celebrity does not know them. As part of the risk they take for being in the public eye, celebrities and public figures are often targets of lies or made-up stories in tabloids as well as by <b>stalkers,</b> some even seeming to be fans.|$|R

5|$|The tour, {{divided in}} five segments, portrays {{a story in}} which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a <b>stalker</b> named Tormento Lancie; played by Rudolf Martin. The first section {{features}} her escaping from prison along with other female inmates. The second segment displays upbeat dance numbers and ends with a performance inspired by Marilyn Monroe. The third section features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics. The fourth segment displays energetic routines and motorcycle costumes. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the <b>stalker,</b> and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.|$|E

Catherine does not yet know that a <b>stalker</b> from their past has resurfaced and has been posting polaroids of the family to Black. Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow Group member Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell) that his family is in no immediate risk.|$|E
5|$|Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{started his}} career as an {{offender}} profiler for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), where his unusual gift for empathising with the killers he was investigating aided in their capture. However, Black retires when he finds that his family—wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady)—are being threatened by an unknown <b>stalker,</b> who is mailing polaroid photographs of the family to Black. After retiring from the FBI, Black moves to Seattle, Washington, and begins to consult for the Millennium Group, a private investigative organisation that aid law enforcement in violent criminal cases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} issue, it is {{revealed}} that the team’s official moniker is Special Counter-Terrorist Unit Delta. G.I. Joe featured an ensemble cast, with the original thirteen characters being Hawk, <b>Stalker,</b> Breaker, Clutch, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Rock ‘n Roll, Steeler, Grand Slam, Flash, Short-Fuze, Grunt and Zap. This reflected their origins in the Hasbro toy line, with the initial characters being {{the same as the}} action figures in the original 1982 release of the toy line. The team roster expanded as additional action figures were released.|$|E
50|$|Erotomanic, {{originating}} {{from the word}} Erotomania, refers to <b>stalkers</b> who genuinely believe that their victims are in love with them. The victims in this case are almost always well known within their community or within the media, meaning that they can range from being small town celebrities or famous personalities from Hollywood. Comprising less than 10% of all stalking cases, Erotomanic <b>stalkers</b> are the least common. Unlike simple-obsessional <b>stalkers,</b> {{a majority of the}} individuals in this category of stalking are women. Similar to love-obsessional <b>stalkers,</b> the behavior of Erotomanic <b>stalkers</b> may be a result of an underlying psychological disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Individuals who suffer from Erotomania tend to believe that the celebrity with whom they are obsessed is utilizing the media as a way to communicate with them by sending special messages or signals. Although these <b>stalkers</b> have unrealistic beliefs, {{they are less likely to}} seek any form of face-to-face interaction with their celebrity obsession, therefore posing less of a threat to them.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>stalkers</b> {{present with}} {{multiple}} suicide risk factors, {{there have been}} no studies of the prevalence of suicide within this at risk group. In this study, 138 <b>stalkers</b> were followed up over three years using national coronial records and relative risk ratios used to compare rates of completed suicide with those in the Australian general population, psychiatric patients, and community-based offenders. <b>Stalkers</b> committed suicide at significantly higher rates than any of the comparison groups. Clinicians working with individuals who stalk must be mindful of the risk <b>stalkers</b> pose to themselves, in addition to their victims, and incorporate suicide risk assessments and crisis management into treatment...|$|R

5|$|James {{made her}} World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) main roster debut in October 2005 and {{was placed in}} a storyline with Trish Stratus, in which James' gimmick was that of Stratus' biggest fan turned obsessed <b>stalker,</b> an angle which ran over eight months. She {{received}} a push, and she won her first WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania 22, a title she has held a total of five times. James also won her first Divas Championship at Night of Champions in 2009 to become the second of five Divas to hold both the Women's and Divas titles. She was released from the company on April 22, 2010, after which she returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).|$|E
5|$|Sanders drew {{inspiration}} for the shooting style and aesthetic of the commercial {{from a variety of}} sources, including news footage from journalists embedded with military forces in Afghanistan, and Russian feature films such as <b>Stalker</b> and Come and See. To keep the details within the commercial consistent with established Halo canon, the creators of the Halo series, Bungie Studios, provided Sanders with information on aspects ranging from appropriate fur color and rank insignia for the Brute, to the armor and weaponry of the ODST soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night <b>Stalker</b> and The Twilight Zone in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E
50|$|Over {{a quarter}} of all {{stalking}} and harassment victims do not know their <b>stalkers</b> in any capacity. About a tenth responding to the SVS did not know the identities of their <b>stalkers.</b> 11% of victims said they had been stalked for five years or more.|$|R
50|$|The dark creeper in {{this edition}} is {{presented}} as a small hoofed creature that lived in the same culture as dark <b>stalkers.</b> Neither creature is stipulated to be greater than the other in hierarchy but the dark <b>stalkers</b> tend to lead groups of dark creepers.|$|R
5000|$|Cyberstalking {{is the use}} of {{computers}} or other electronic technology to facilitate stalking. In Davis (2001), Lucks identified a separate category of <b>stalkers</b> who instead of a terrestrial means, prefer to perpetrate crimes against their targeted victims through electronic and online means. Amongst college students, Ménard and Pincus found that men who had a high score of sexual abuse as children and narcissistic vulnerability were more likely to become <b>stalkers.</b> Out of the women who participated in their study, 9% were cyberstalkers meanwhile only 4% were overt <b>stalkers.</b> In addition, the male participants revealed the opposite, 16% were overt <b>stalkers</b> while 11% were cyberstalkers. Alcohol and physical abuse both played a role in predicting women's cyberstalking and in men, [...] "preoccupied attachment significantly predicted cyber stalking".|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night <b>Stalker,</b> a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013 Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves, when the Apocalypse happens.|$|E
5|$|Carmella is {{introduced}} as a barmaid at the Erinsborough bar Lou's Place. She becomes romantically involved with her colleague, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), to the disapproval {{of her father}} Rocco (Robert Forza). A feud with Connor's ex-girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), results in Carmella slapping her and leaving the area. She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor. She departs from Erinsborough suddenly after she becomes {{the victim of a}} <b>stalker,</b> Frank Romano (Lliam Amor). Before she leaves, she drives around with a shotgun in an attempt to kill Frank. Upon her return, Carmella loses Connor's affection to Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). She attempts to ruin their relationship, which results in Serena's mother Liljana (Marcella Russo) slapping her to warn her off. Carmella then tries a different approach; she borrows money from her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes) to pay for an operation Madeleine needs, then blackmails Connor into spending time with her. She claims to have borrowed the money from a crime mob who are harassing her for repayment, which prompts Connor to steal money to try to pay it back. When Carmella realises the trouble she has caused, she tells Connor the truth and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the <b>stalker</b> is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E

5|$|Eastwood's career {{reached a}} turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had {{discussed}} the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty for Me, a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner's Misty. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous <b>stalker.</b> Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine, Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice, and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James <b>Stalker</b> (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.|$|E
