40|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>mite,</b> Tyrophagus putrescentiae, {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of allergic disorders. Fifteen allergenic components were demonstrated in <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, but only the group 2 allergen Tyr p 2 has been cloned and characterized. In this study, we attempted to identify and characterize new allergens from T. putrescentiae, which is a dominant species of <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> in Korea. Expressed sequence tags were analyzed to identify possible <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> allergens, and the cDNA sequence encoding a protein homologous to fatty acid binding protein, a mite group 13 allergen, was identified and named Tyr p 13. Its deduced amino acid sequence showed 61. 1 to 85. 3 % identity with other mite group 13 allergens. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli using a pET 28 b vector system, and its allergenicity was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The recombinant allergen was detected in 5 of 78 (6. 4 %) T. putrescentiae-positive sera tested, and it inhibited 61. 9 % of immunoglobulin E binding to crude extract at an inhibitor concentration of 10 μg/ml by inhibition ELISA using serum from the patient who showed the strongest reaction by ELISA. In this study, a novel allergen was identified in T. putrescentiae. This allergen could be helpful for more-detailed characterizations of <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> allergy...|$|E
40|$|Storage mites {{may cause}} {{allergic}} respiratory diseases {{in urban areas}} as well as pose an occupational hazard in rural areas.

40|$|Storage mites (acarid mites) {{are related}} to the house dust mite but are usually found in {{agricultural}} environments. They have been shown to cause allergic symptoms in Scottish farmworkers exposed to stored hay, but whether farmworkers who grow and store grain are also at risk is unknown. One hundred and one farmworkers on 22 Essex farms with grain storage facilities (88 % of the available workforce) participated in a survey of respiratory symptoms, with skin tests and determination of serum levels of IgE specific for mite species, including storage mites. Of the 101 workers, 21 reported attacks of cough, wheeze, or breathlessness after exposure to stored grain and 15 reported nasal symptoms after grain exposure. <b>Storage</b> <b>mite</b> specific IgE was found in 59 % of farmworkers with work related respiratory symptoms, in 60 % with work related nasal symptoms, and in only 9 % of symptomless farmworkers. Work related respiratory and nasal symptoms were also significantly associated with atopy, and with positive skin test responses and serum IgE specific for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Storage mites were found in grain samples from 16 farms in which grain was sampled, whereas D pteronyssinus was not found in any. The close association between serum <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> specific IgE and occupational respiratory symptoms suggests that storage mites may be responsible for respiratory symptoms in these Essex farmworkers exposed to grain...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} 279 United Kingdom bakery workers a high {{prevalence}} of immunological response to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> was found. To determine whether this was the consequence of exposure to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> in bakery work, a population of salt packing workers was examined as a comparison group not at occupational risk of exposure to <b>storage</b> <b>mites.</b> Forty two per cent of both groups were atopic (had a positive skin prick response greater than negative controls to D pteronyssinus, grass pollen, or cat fur by 2 mm or more) and 33 % had an immediate skin prick test response {{to at least one}} of four <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> (L destructor, G domesticus, T putrescentiae, A Siro). A higher percentage of the salt packing workers than the bakery workers had a positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) (greater than or equal to 0. 35 PRU) to D pteronyssinus and to the four <b>storage</b> <b>mites.</b> Logistic regression analysis identified atopy as the most significant variable for a positive skin test and RAST response to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> in both groups of workers. RAST inhibition was used to analyse extracted area and personal air samples. Analysis of static area samples for aeroallergen showed immunological identity with flour but L destructor was found in only one of seven exposed filters. The concentration of airborne flour was related to exposure rank of perceived dustiness and gravimetric measurement of total dust. Nineteen out of 32 filters from workers in jobs with higher dust exposure (rank >/= 6) had a level of > 10 microgram/m(3) flour whereas this concentrations was exceeded in only one of 23 filters from workers in low dust exposure (< rank 6). It is concluded that <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> are not of special significance in allergic responses in bakery workers.

40|$|Background The {{presence}} of important house dust and <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> {{species in the}} microenvironment of atopic dogs has not been thoroughly investigated. Objectives To compare the presence and population of five dust mite species (Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Acarus siro, Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Lepidoglyphus destructor) among households with mite-sensitive atopic dogs (Group A), households with clinically healthy dogs (Group B) and households without pets (Group C, n = 25) in Greece. Animals Twenty mite-sensitive atopic dogs and 20 clinically healthy dogs. Methods Dust samples were collected with a vacuum cleaner from owners mattresses (all groups) and from dogs sleeping areas (Groups A and B) or living room couch (Group C), once every season of the year. Following dust flotation, mites were counted and identified. Results Dermatophagoides farinae was the most prevalent (60, 40 and 64 % in Groups A, B and C, respectively), followed by D. pteronyssinus (45, 35 and 48 %, respectively), whereas the three storage mites were found in fewer households. No major differences could be found between Groups A and B or between households with (Groups A and B) and without dogs (Group C) regarding the presence or numbers of the five dust mite species.

In non-sensitized children, dust mite sensitization level was found to be 25. 5 %. Breakdown of sensitization by individual species in this group was; against A. siro and T. putrescentiae at 7. 8 %, against L. destructor at 13. 7 %, and against G. domesticus at 9. 8 %.

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out on {{respiratory}} symptoms and skin prick test response to common allergens (atopy), storage mites, and occupational allergens among 226 bakers and pastry makers from 105 small businesses in northern Italy. Atopy was present in 54 workers (23. 4 %); 40 workers (17. 7 %) were skin positive {{to at least one}} <b>storage</b> <b>mite,</b> 27 (11. 9 %) to wheat flour and 17 (7. 5 %) to alpha-amylase. Work related asthma was reported by 11 (4. 9 %) workers and rhinoconjunctivitis by 31 (17. 7 %); 22 workers (10. 2 %) complained of chronic bronchitis. The distribution of skin prick test results among bakers and among 119 white collar workers did not indicate (by logistic analysis) an increased risk for bakers to skin sensitisation to common allergens, <b>storage</b> <b>mite,</b> or to a group of five flours. Sensitisation to wheat flour, on the other hand, was present only among exposed workers. Skin sensitisation to occupational allergens was significantly associated with atopy (p < 0. 001), smoking habit (p = 0. 015), and work seniority (p = 0. 027). The risk of work related symptoms was associated with sensitisation to wheat or alpha-amylase, and with atopy, but not with sensitisation to storage mites, work seniority, or smoking habit. The results of the study indicate that there is still a significant risk of allergic respiratory disease among Italian bakers. Not only wheat allergens, but also alpha-amylase must be considered as causative agents, although sensitisation to storage mites is not important in the occupational allergic response. Atopy must be regarded as an important predisposing factor for skin sensitisation to occupational allergens and for the onset of symptoms at work. The data confirm that for effective prevention, greater care should be taken not only in limiting environmental exposure, but also in identifying susceptible people...|$|E

Clinical signs were scored before, 6 h after each challenge and then every 24 h {{for a total of}} 5 days using a Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index. Four healthy Beagles, negative on serology and intradermal testing for both house dust and <b>storage</b> <b>mites,</b> were used as controls and similarly challenged. A month after environmental challenge, the atopic Beagles were challenged by the oral route (50 mg of T. putrescentiae for three days in a row) and evaluated as described. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used for comparisons between groups and types of challenges. All atopic Beagles developed erythematous pruritic lesions clinically compatible with AD on the face, pinnae, feet and ventral abdomen after both environmental and oral challenge. Control dogs did not develop dermatitis except for mild pinnal erythema in one dog. In the environmental challenge, ANOVA showed a significant effect of time, group, and group x time interaction, with atopic Beagles showing significantly higher scores than the controls.

40|$|The {{potential}} allergen source {{formed by}} mites and fungi developing on walls {{has been studied}} in a semi-natural model. Gypsum and wooden pieces, representing indoor walls, were artificially soiled with one of two different organic compounds, a yeast/vegetable mixture (Mannite) or a red currant juice (Eden). After acclimatizing to 78 % relative humidity (rH), inoculation of fungi and/or mites followed. Water adsorption of the 10 x 10 x 0. 6 cm pieces was slower than expected, equilibrium was reached after 6 to 8 weeks. Visual mould growth (Aspergillus repens or Penicillium chrysogenum) appeared on soiled pieces after 8 weeks to 5 months, depending on the prevailing humidity. Soiling with Marmite caused a more dense fungal growth than soiling with juice. <b>Storage</b> <b>mites</b> (Glycyphagus domesticus) developed exponentially on all mouldy pieces resulting in a median value of 234 mites on wood and 404 on gypsum 8 weeks after incubation of 50 mites, whereas house dust mites (Derniatophagoides pteronyssinus) survived only barely (less than 10 mites after 8 weeks). <b>Storage</b> <b>mites</b> are presumably living pemanently on mouldy walls, whereas house dust mites are chance visitors.

We describe biochemical and immunological {{properties of the}} native alpha-amylase allergen Aca s 4 from Acarus siro, a medically important <b>storage</b> <b>mite.</b> Results A. siro produced {{a high level of}} alpha-amylase activity attributed to Aca s 4. This enzyme was purified and identified by protein sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis. Aca s 4 showed a distinct inhibition pattern and an unusual alpha-amylolytic activity with low sensitivity to activation by chloride ions. Homology modeling of Aca s 4 revealed a structural change in the chloride-binding site that may account for this activation pattern. Aca s 4 was recognized by IgE from house dust mite-sensitive patients, and potential epitopes for cross-reactivity with house dust mite group 4 allergens were found.

40|$|Abstract. - <b>Storage</b> <b>mites</b> are {{considered}} to be detrimental to grain fitness and commonly cause a change in the chemical composition of the stored wheat. The present study showed the changes in nutritional value of the wheat grains of variety Lasani- 08 when subjected to infestation with varying population levels of the acarid mite, Rhizoglyphus tritici (Acari: Acaridae) for one month and three months. Maximum moisture contents were 17. 06 and 17. 73 % in infested grains as compared to 16. 10 and 16. 36 % for control after one and three months of storage, respectively. The protein contents were lowest (12. 66 %) after three months of storage with highest level of mite infestation. Also, there was a significant effect of mite population on fat contents. Maximum decrease in fat contents was recorded after three months, which was from 1. 28 and 0. 93 % for control and infested wheat with 20 pairs of mites, respectively. The fiber contents increased significantly in infested grains compared to control which was 1. 03 % to 1. 72 % and from 1. 07 to 1. 99 after one and three months interval, respectively. The ash contents increased in treated grains (2. 03 %) compared to control (1. 23 %) after three months of storage.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in the prevalence of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis in most of the industrialised world. In addition, occupational asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and allergies have increased during the last decade. Earlier studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms among farmers and a predominance of <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> as allergens in rural settings. This thesis focuses on sensitisation and exposure to risk factors for respiratory allergy among farmers as well as evaluation of the clinical and serological relevance of the recombinant major allergens of the <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> Lepidoglyphus destructor, rLep d 2, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae, rTyr p 2, and the modified derivative of rLep d 2, rLep d 2. 6 Cys. An extensive epidemiological 12 -year follow-up survey, concerning respiratory symptoms and sensitisation, was conducted in 1996 among farmers on Gotland. Although the overall proportion of fanners with respiratory symptoms was unchanged between 1984 and 1996, {{a significant increase in the}} prevalence of asthma (5. 2 % vs 9. 8 %), as well as asthma in combination with rhinoconjunctivitis (3. 9 % vs 7. 0 %) was found. In spite of the thorough information about health hazards associated with <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> given in 1984, <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> remained predominant allergens, more prevalent than animal danders and pollens. Risk factors for sensitisation to common aeroallergens, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis were assessed, and after adjustments for sex, age and smoking in a multiple regression model, sensitisation to mites (OR= 5. 8) and pollens (OR= 10. 3) remained the only significant risk factors for asthma. The corresponding significant risk factors for rhinoconjunctivitis were sensitisation to mites (OR= 3. 8), pollens (OR= 5. 8) and in addition working full time (OR= 1. 9). Although farmers smoked less than the general population, they more frequently had a reduced lung function, measured as FEV 1. Dust samples were collected from mattresses and living room carpets for the measurement of cat and dog allergens in 403 farmers' homes. The major cat Fe 1 d 1) and dog (Can f 1) allergens were detected in 99. 1 % and 90. 6 % of the farmers' homes, respectively. Cat allergen levels above the suggested risk threshold for sensitisation were present in 69. 2 % of the households and the corresponding figure for dog was 42. 9 %, but only a minority of the farmers were sensitised to the corresponding allergens (cat: 8. 4 % and dog: 7. 4 %). However, a significant association between sensitisation to dog and asthma (OR= 17. 8) and rhinoconjunctivitis (OR= 8. 0) was found, as well as between sensitisation to cat and asthma (OR= 4. 9). To investigate the clinical relevance of rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2, SPTs were performed, and almost all subjects with lgE against the corresponding native allergens were identified. In addition, the SPT reactivity to rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2 correlated well with the lgE and IgG 4 reactivity to these allergens. rLep d 2 and rTyr p 2 seem to be useful tools for the diagnosis of dust mite allergy. Evaluation of the modified rLep d 2. 6 Cys allergen and its unaltered counterpart, rLep d 2, in SPT as well as in skin biopsies obtained 17 - 20 h after allergen challenge, demonstrated that rLep d 2. 6 Cys induced fewer and significantly smaller SPT reactions than rLep d 2. In addition, rLep d 2. 6 Cys, compared to rLep d 2, was significantly less able to trigger mast cell degranulation, induce dermal cell infiltrates, promote an influx of T-cells and activate eosinophils. In the future rLep d 2. 6 Cys may be a promising candidate molecule for immunotherapy treatment of L. destructor allergic patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of atopy in a vocational school so as to evaluate the feasibility of pre-employment screening. METHODS [...] The prevalence of atopy by family diathesis, prick tests, immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations, and personal history of allergic respiratory diseases was investigated in 144 trainee bakers and 81 students on a graphic artists course (mean age 15. 4 years). Skin sensitisation to wheat, rye, and barley flours, to alpha amylase, and to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> was also evaluated. RESULTS [...] Personal allergic symptoms were reported by 13. 2 % of the bakers and 14. 7 % of the graphic artists {{and there was a}} significant association between symptoms and atopy by prick tests (odds ratio (OR) 17. 2; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 5. 27 - 56. 4) and by family history (OR 3. 11; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 9. 53). When bakers were grouped according to the presence of allergic symptoms and results of immunological tests, 6. 9 % had asthma, 6. 3 % had rhinoconjunctivitis, and a high percentage (28. 5 %) were without symptoms but scored positive on prick tests or family symptoms. Skin sensitisation to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> had similar prevalences (16 %) in the two groups of trainees and occurred nearly always in atopic people. Positive skin tests to wheat flour (3. 5 %), rye (0. 7 %), and alpha amylase (0. 7 %) were specific to bakers. CONCLUSIONS [...] Pre-employment screening is a useful source of medical information and allows for counseling. The presence of asthma, or of another allergic disease in a severe form, is suggested as a criterion for excluding students of a vocational school from training as bakers. Student bakers without allergic symptoms but atopic by other criteria should be informed about their risks of developing occupational asthma, and periodic check ups must be recommended. Screening studies in vocational school provide a better understanding of specificity of skin sensitisation to occupational allergens...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{knowledge}} about allergic sensitization {{and its relationship}} with clinical symptoms and diseases among adults in South-East Asia is poor. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence and pattern of allergic sensitization and the association with asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults in urban and rural Vietnam. METHODS: Among 5, 782 responders to a questionnaire survey in northern Vietnam, a random sample was invited to a clinical follow-up and 684 (46 %) participated. The methods included a structured interview using a modified GA 2 LEN study questionnaire on symptoms and possible determinants for diseases. Skin prick test (SPT) with ten common airborne indoor and outdoor allergens, lung function test, and methacholine test was performed among subjects ≤ 60  years of age. RESULTS: In total, one third of subjects had a positive SPT reaction to at least one allergen, 36. 9 % of men and 31. 0 % of women (n. s.). The most common sensitizer was the <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> B. tropicalis (men 27. 7 %; women 18. 7 %) followed by house dust mite D. pteronyssinus (men 16. 5 %; women 10. 6 %), and D. farinae (men 15. 3 %; women 6. 3 %), and cockroach (men 16. 5 %; women 10. 2 %). Sensitization to all major allergens were significantly more common among men and among subjects ≤ 45  years compared with women and subjects > 45  years, respectively. The prevalence of sensitization to animals, pollen and molds were low. The majority of cockroach-sensitized subjects were also sensitized to mites. Sensitization to any allergen and all major allergens were significantly associated with rhinitis, but not with asthma. However, bronchial hyper-reactivity was significantly associated with increasing number of positive SPTs (p[*]=[*] 0. 047). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults in northern Vietnam sensitization to mite and cockroach most common in both rural and urban areas. The dominant sensitizer was the <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> B. tropicalis, which should be included in future studies and also in clinical practice, owing to its association with clinical symptoms. As in the Western world allergic sensitization was associated with rhinitis and bronchial hyper-reactivity. The lack of association with asthma in South-East Asia needs to be studied further...|$|E

A number of VOCs were specifically linked with confused flour beetle T. confusum and not observed with the other insect and mite species. For instance, 2 -methyl-p-benzoquinone and 2 -ethyl-p-benzoquinone were specifically linked to confused flour beetle. However, this study found that benzoquinones were not present in the headspace volatiles of the larvae of confused flour beetle, whereas, 1 -pentadecene was detected in adults and larvae of confused flour beetle. The results of the volatile extraction experiments with saw-toothed grain beetles O. surinamensis showed that several volatiles were detected in the adults and larvae of saw-toothed grain beetle {{but not in the}} other insect and mite species. Some of these VOCs were detected only in adults, and these were butanoic acid, 1 -methylethyl ester and 1, 3 -octadiene. The others were found in both larvae and adults. These were 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol, octane, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 1 -octen- 3 -one and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. The analysis of the headspace from grain weevil S. granarius showed three VOCs which were specifically linked to weevils compared to the other species.

To further characterize IgE-mediated reaction, SDS-PAGE and electroblot studies were performed. Our survey revealed that 15 (34. 9 %) subjects had work-related skin response (> or = 2 + of A/H ratio) to GD, thirteen (30. 2 %) had high specific IgE antibody against GD. The specific IgE antibody was detected more frequently in symptomatic workers (40 %) than in asymptomatic workers (11 %).

40|$|Abstract: A {{rare case}} of {{coexistence}} of occupational airborne dermatitis with rosacea {{is presented in}} a 41 -year-old female farmer. Her first dermatitis symptoms appeared {{at the age of}} 10 when she started helping her parents on the farm. Uncovered skin areas of the face, neck, décolleté, forearms and the hands gradually became involved. The dermatitis symptoms were provoked by agricultural dusts (especially of flax and dried herbs). For the subsequent 30 years, the work-related disease remained undiagnosed {{due to the lack of}} pre-employment and periodical health check in agriculture. She also suffered from protein contact dermatitis of the hands from cow epithelium. About 20 years after the onset of airborne dermatitis, rosacea developed, possibly secondary to the prolonged treatment. Diagnostic tests carried out at our department confirmed hypersensitivity to occupational allergens: type I allergy to <b>storage</b> <b>mites,</b> moulds, and cow epithelium. A cutaneous late-phase reaction on prick tests and serum precipitins to the bacterium Pantoea agglomerans (Erwinia herbicola) also were found. Among non-occupational hypersensitivities, type I allergy to house dust mites and contact allergy to methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (Kathon CG) was found. I...|$|R
40|$|Many soil ecologists still {{encounter}} practical difficulties when extracting microarthropods {{from the}} soil. Methods using a humidity gradient, {{established by the}} use of a heat source, for collecting soil animals appeared not sufficiently efficient in case of sandy soils. For such type of soils, flotation techniques proved more suitable. The use of toxic or aggressive flotation fluids like kerosene, dibromo ethane, carbon tetrachloride and heptane, however, makes these methods less favourable. To circumvent this problem, a novel technique has been developed based on the flotation principle but using olive oil. The method uses a pumping system that injects olive oil {{at the base of a}} Perspex column in which the soil sample is suspended in water using a propeller. In this way, intensive contact between oil droplets and the organisms is established, increasing extraction efficiency. After stopping the propeller, animals can easily be collected from the oil floating to the water surface. Adding coloured mites to soil samples was used to determine extraction efficiency of the method. Average (±SD) recoveries of 82. 7 ± 7. 4 % (n = 34) and 89. 7 ± 10. 0 % (n = 10), respectively were obtained when extracting <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> and predatory mites from a sandy soil. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Background: Serum {{specific}} immunoglobulin E (ssIgE) sensitization {{to common}} inhalant allergens {{has not been}} studied in Indonesia. This study aimed to evaluate specific IgE production of common inhalant allergens in patients with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis in Jakarta, Indonesia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in adult patients with respiratory allergy from September to December 2016 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta. Patients were included if they showed at least one positive skin prick test (SPT) to environmental allergens. Serum specific IgE was assayed by using multiple allergosorbent methods. Inhalant allergens tested were dust mites, pollen, cockroach, animal dander, and mould. Serum IgE level more than 0. 35 kU/L was considered positive. Results: One hundred subjects were enrolled (76 % women). Dust mites made up 75 % of sensitization, followed by cat/dog (31 %), cockroach (27 %), pollen (24 %), and mould (6 %). Almost all patients sensitized to cockroach, pollen, cat/dog epithelia and mould were also co-sensitized with dust mites. Twenty two percent of patients were negative to all tested allergens. Conclusion: IgE-sensitization to inhalant allergens varies widely in respiratory allergic patients. House dust and <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> {{are the most common}} allergens. About one-fifth of the subjects did not show specific-IgE sensitization. Thus, this test should always be combined with SPT to diagnose allergy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate whether allergenic extracts of five house dust and <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> species standardized for humans might be used for the diagnosis of canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). Extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Pyroglyphidae), D. farinae (Pyroglyphidae), Blomia tropicalis (Glycyphagidae), Lepidoglyphus destructor (Glycyphagidae) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acaridae) were evaluated by intradermal testing in 20 healthy dogs (control) and 25 dogs with allergic dermatitis. A significant difference in the response was observed between the two groups (p< 0. 05). Only one dog (5 %) in the control group reacted to the intradermal test, whereas 14 dogs (56 %) in the allergic group were positive for at least one extract (odds ratio = 24. 2). Most of the positive reactions observed in the allergic group occurred against the extracts of T. putrescentiae or L. destructor, each inducing reactions in 10 dogs (40 %). D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus e B. tropicalis extracts induced reactions in 7 (28 %), 3 (12 %) and 3 (12 %) dogs, respectively. The allergenic extracts standardized for humans evaluated in the present study may be used as a tool to complement the diagnosis of the disease, as well as to select potential allergen candidates for allergen-specific immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the risk factors associated with allergic sensitisation and various asthma phenotypes in poultry workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 230 currently employed poultry workers used a modified ECRHS questionnaire, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, Phadiatop and ImmunoCAP for specific IgE to poultry farming associated allergens (chicken meat, feathers, serum protein, droppings, sunflower seeds, <b>storage</b> <b>mite)</b> and mould mix to investigate workrelated asthma. Results: The mean dust particulate concentration (geometric mean (GM) = 11. 04 mg/m³) was highest in the rearing department while mean (1 - 3) -ß-D-glucan (GM= 148 ng/ m³) and endotoxin levels (GM= 2298 EU/m³) were highest in the catching department. Worker's mean age was 37 ± 9 years, 68 % were male, 43 % current smokers, 34 % atopic and 5 % casual workers. The prevalence of non-atopic asthma (NAA= 10 %) was higher than atopic asthma (AA= 6 %) or probable occupational asthma (OA= 5 %). Sensitisation to at least one poultry work related allergen was 24 %, with sunflower seed and <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> sensitisation being the most prevalent (13 %). In multivariate adjusted models, workers sensitised to chicken specific allergens were more likely to be atopic (OR= 20. 9, 95 % CI: 4. 7 - 93. 2) or have casual job status (OR= 6. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 35. 9). Workers with work-related chest symptoms were more likely to work in the rearing department (OR= 3. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 8. 3) and to report episodes of high gas/dust/fume exposures causing asthma symptoms (OR= 4. 8, 95 %CI: 2. 4 - 9. 6). Reversible obstructive airway obstruction was more strongly associated with employment in small broiler farms (OR= 11. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 129. 0) as well as casual work (OR= 6. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 28. 0). Furthermore, NAA was strongly associated with casual work (OR= 5. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 19. 0) as well as working in the automated egg laying system (OR= 8. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 68. 6). Further analysis revealed that the proportion of workers sensitised to at least one poultry work related allergen declined with increasing years of service (chi-square trend p= 0. 023), with workers having 6 years employment (OR= 4. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 13. 8). Conclusion: Non-atopic asthma is the most common asthma phenotype among poultry workers with work in the rearing department demonstrating an increased respiratory risk. The increased risk of reversible airway obstruction among workers in small broiler farms and the declining prevalence of sensitisation with increasing employment duration suggests a healthy worker effect. Preventive measures, including appropriate training, are recommended to reduce respiratory health risks, particularly in novice workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of sensitization to the storage mites Acarus sire (AS), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (TP), and Lepidoglyphus destructor (LD) was studied in 250 sera {{of patients with}} different degrees of sensitization to the house-dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) by measuring IgE binding to extracts of the storage mites. Additionally, allergenic crossreactivity between DP and the <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> species was studied by RAST inhibition with five individual sera (and a pool of these sera) with moderate IgE levels to all three storage mites and to DP. Increased serum IgE to storage mites was found in 46 % of the 200 patients sensitized to DP. Increased prevalence rates of IgE titers to storage mites were associated with higher IgE levels to DP. In 50 sera without sensitization to DP, only five sera showed increased IgE {{to one of the}} storage mites. Extracts of TP almost completely inhibited the IgE binding to AS, and vice versa. DP inhibited IgE binding to all storage mites up to 60 %, whereas IgE binding to DP was only minimally inhibited by extracts of storage mites, In conclusion, cosensitization to storage mites is a frequent finding in patients sensitized to DP Although this is largely the result of cross-reactivity between different mite species, it may nevertheless be of clinical significance in patients exposed to storage mites...|$|E

Design Double blind randomised placebo controlled parallel group study. Setting Hospital in Hampshire. Participants 183 participants aged between 18 and 64 with a history of severe summer hay fever for at least two years; all were skin prick test positive to timothy grass pollen. 90 randomised to active treatment; 93 randomised to placebo. Interventions Active treatment: two injections of enzyme potentiated desensitisation, given between eight and 11 weeks apart, each comprising 200 Fishman units of glucuronidase, 50 pg 1, 3 -cyclohexanediol, 50 ng protamine sulphate, and a mixed inhaled allergen extract (pollen mixes for trees, grasses, and weeds; allergenic fungal spores; cat and dog danders; dust and <b>storage</b> <b>mites)</b> in a total volume of 0. 05 ml of buffered saline. Placebo: two injections of 0. 05 ml buffered saline solution.

40|$|Abstract. House dust <b>mites</b> and <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> are {{well-known}} {{causes for}} allergenic diseases. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the immunogenic sites of Blomia tropicalis, Aleurogyphus ovatus and Glycycometus malaysiensis. The mites were maintained in a culture medium at 25 ºC and 75 % relative humidity. Mites were harvested either with heat escape or floatation method, purified, homogenized, quantified and used for the production of polyclonal antibody and immunostaining. For each species of mites, five male mice and five male rats were randomly selected and immunized intraperitoneally with respective crude mite extract at two-weekly intervals. Blomia tropicalis, A. ovatus or G. malaysiensis whole mites and paraffin-embedded mite sections were immunostained with the respective polyclonal antibody. The faecal pellets of mites were intensely stained for all the three species in the present study. The legs of sectioned A. ovatus were not immunogenic as compared with those of G. malaysiensis and B. tropicalis. The outer layer (cuticle) of whole mites and the eggs for these species were very immunogenic. Hence, the polyclonal antibodies obtained in this study may serve as potential tools in detecting the eggs and immature mites in environmental samples. Future studies should focus on the antigenic components of eggs since they were relatively abundant in dust and highly antigenic as seen in the present study...|$|R

In summer and winter seasons, air sampling was done to measure the airborne fungal spore concentration inside the godowns by Rotorod sampler, UK. Aspergilla, Alternaria, Drechslera, Epicoccum, Nigrospora, Periconia were very much common and found higher in winter compared to summer. The respiratory functional status was assessed in two groups of workers of the same storage grain depot (total n= 316) in summer (n= 136) and in winter (n= 180). List of the workers was collected from the authority and randomly selected every alternate worker and divide them for the studies in summer and winter seasons.

40|$|Tulip virus X (TVX) is a Potexvirus causing {{economic}} losses in tulip. Potexviruses are generally transmitted by mechanical contact and, indeed, several mechanical transmission pathways for TVX {{have been identified}} during tulip bulb production. However, TVX transmission does also seem to occur during bulb storage. Since mechanical transmission is excluded in this period, a biological vector should be involved. The eriophyoid mite Aceria tulipae, the acarid <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> Tyrophagus putrescentiae, and the acarid bulb mite Rhizoglyphus echinopus are the main arthropod pests of stored tulip bulbs. Therefore, we studied their putative role in transmission of TVX during tulip bulb storage. We show that mites {{of each of these}} species can carry TVX with them after feeding on TVX-infected bulbs. In addition, some of the healthy bulbs acquired an infection with TVX when inoculated with mites. Although the current setup of the experiments does not confirm which species of mite transmit TVX, we have strong indications that mites are involved in transmission. Additional research with larger numbers of independent replicates is required to further prove the vector status of each species of mite, the efficiency, and mode of virus transmission. If our results will be confirmed, this would be the first case reporting a Potexvirus to be transmitted by mites, and the first case of an association between acarid mites and a plant pathogenic virus. Consequently, TVX control in tulip bulb production should include an adequate control strategy of both eriophyoid and acarid mites...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Pesticide {{exposure}} {{has been}} increasingly associated with adverse respiratory health effects including asthma and allergy. However, {{few studies have}} been conducted among women and workers in developing countries. South Africa {{is one of the largest}} users of pesticides on the continent and the Western Cape is one of the main agricultural areas in the country, with uncontrolled use posing an increased health risk to farm workers. This study focused on determining the association between pesticide exposure (predominantly organophosphates and carbamates) and the presence of allergy and asthma among women farm workers and residents. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 211 women including those working and living on farms (farm dwellers, n= 121) and those residing in neighbouring farm areas (town dwellers, n= 90). Outcome measurements included the abbreviated European Community Respiratory Health questionnaire, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and immunological tests (a positive Phadiatop test indicating atopy and quantification of specific IgE to house dust mite, <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> and spider mite). The outcome variables included doctor diagnosed asthma, adult onset asthma, current asthma, allergic sensitisation, allergic airway inflammation and the asthma symptom score. The asthma symptom score was a continuous outcome generated as the sum of positive responses to four questions on asthma symptoms in the last 12 months including wheeze with breathlessness, woken up with chest tightness, attack of shortness of breath at rest and woken by attack of coughing.

40|$|Background: The {{involvement}} of the <b>storage</b> <b>mite</b> Tyrophagus putrescentiae in allergies has been increasingly reported in many countries. Molecular analysis has shown that group 3 mite allergens are homologous to trypsin. Similar allergens have not been identified in T. putrescentiae. Our aims were to characterize group 3 allergens in T. putrescentiae and to investigate their significance in allergenicity. Methods: cDNAs of PreTyr p 3 and rTyr p 3 from T. putrescentiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Native Tyr p 3 (nTyr p 3) was purified from spent growth medium with an affinity column coupling of antibody. Biological activities of rTyr p 3 were compared with nTyr p 3 in terms of IgE activity, enzymatic activity and histamine release. Results: Full-length cDNA of PreTyr p 3 encodes a 285 -amino acid trypsin-like protease and acquires enzymatic activity after removing the pre- and pro-sequences. rTyr p 3 is a 26 -kDa protein with equivalent IgE reactivity but weaker enzymatic activity than that of nTyr p 3. A limited level of cross-reactivity has been found between rTyr p 3, Der p 3 and Blomia. Eight of 10 T. putrescentiae-sensitized individuals showed > 50 % histamine release after triggering with rTyr p 3. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that Tyr p 3 is a frequent allergen (58 %) in T. putrescentiae-sensitized patients. Since rTyr p 3 displays equivalent biological activities as nTyr p 3, the role of group 3 allergens can be studied using rTyr p 3 to elucidate the pathogenic effects and diagnostic applications of Tyr p 3.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the results of}} a {{cross-sectional}} epidemiological study undertaken in the period from March 2000 to January 2002 on bakery workers in 6 bakeries in Bergen, Norway. The aims were to study the consequences of different criteria for the diagnosis of occupational rhinitis (OcR), assess the prevalence of IgE sensitization, and to explore the relationships between OcR, upper and lower airway symptoms, IgE-sensitization, nasal indices of inflammation, bronchial responsiveness, and flour dust exposure. We have taken into account possible confounders such as age, gender, smoking, and baseline lung function, and we also present an alternative continuous outcome estimate of bronchial responsiveness. Bakery workers (n= 197) were subjected to interviews, questionnaires, workplace dust measurements, allergy tests, and nasal lavages with and without histamine provocation. The criteria for the diagnosis of OcR were based on the International Consensus Report on Rhinitis (ICR) from 1994. α 2 -Macroglobulin and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured in nasal lavage fluid. Bronchial provocation test with metacholine was carried out according to the American Thoracic Society’s guidelines. Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as slopeconc, a measurement derived by regressing the percent reduction in FEV 1 at each provocation step. The prevalence of OcR varied between 23 and 50 % depending on the diagnostic criteria used. OcR, both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated, was associated with asthma symptoms. The most frequent causes of sensitization were various species of <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> (20 %). Storagemite sensitization was related to both OcR and work exposure (production workers versus administrative staff). α 2 -Macroglobulin, ECP, and the exudative responsiveness to histamine increased significantly with increasing workplace dust exposure (p≤ 0. 035). Similar patterns were seen in workers with OcR and with work related rhinitis symptoms, but occupational sensitization was not a discriminating factor. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) expressed as slopeconc was associated with smoking (p= 0. 017) and asthma symptoms at work (p= 0. 003), but not with IgE sensitization to occupational allergens (p= 0. 221) when we also adjusted for baseline lung function. We demonstrated an association between ECP in nasal lavage and BHR in a subgroup where BHR was defined as slopeconc < 3 (p= 0. 012). No association was seen between bronchial responsiveness and current exposure level of flour dust, nasal symptoms, and a diagnosis of OcR. Using different diagnostic criteria have considerable consequences for the prevalence of OcR. There is a strong relationship between OcR and lower airway symptoms. <b>Storage</b> <b>mites</b> maybe important occupational allergens in Norwegian bakeries. OcR and occupational dust exposure in bakery workers is associated with nasal eosinophilic exudative inflammation. In contrast, occupational sensitization is not a discriminating factor with regard to nasal indices of eosinophilic, exudative inflammation. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness measured by metacholine provocation is related to baseline lung function, smoking, work related asthma symptoms, and nasal eosinophil activity, but not to occupational IgE sensitization. The slopeconc expression seems to be a useful continuous outcome in bronchial responsiveness testing with metacholine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sensitization to flour or fungal {{alpha-amylase}} is {{a prerequisite}} for the development of respiratory allergy in bakers. The knowledge of occupational allergen sensitization among bakery workers will facilitate the implementation of preventive measures for respiratory allergies in bakeries. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase in bakers in Douala. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 of the 151 bakeries that are present in the city of Douala. Demographics, clinical data, as well as results of skin prick tests to wheat flour, α-amylase and common aeroallergens were collected from all participants. A logistic regression model of the SPSS. 20 software was used to identify factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase. Results: Of the 229 participants included in the study, 222 (96. 9 %) were male. The mean age was 36. 3 ± 8. 9 years. The prevalence of sensitization to flour and α-amylase were 16. 6 % and 8. 3 % respectively. After multivariate analysis, factors associated with sensitization to flour were work seniority and sensitization to <b>storage</b> <b>mites</b> while an age of 30 years and above was the only factor associated with sensitization to α-amylase. Conclusion: Bakers in Douala are at risk of sensitization to occupational allergens.

Intradermal testing (IDT) and serology for allergen-specific IgE demonstrated that co-sensitization for all possible pairs {{of the five}} mites was generally 45 % or higher among group A dogs. In the same dogs, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cross-inhibition results indicated that each one of D. farinae, A. siro and T. putrescentiae was a strong inhibitor of all the remaining mites, whereas D. pteronyssinus was a strong inhibitor of L. destructor. A high number of positive IDT and serology test results for D. pteronyssinus, A. siro, T. putrescentiae and L. destructor were recorded among group B dogs. No conclusive evidence of exposure to these mites was found upon analysis of dust samples from their environment and their food {{for the presence of}} mites and guanine. Also, the number of positive test results was generally higher among group B than among group C dogs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cross-inhibition revealed that D. farinae was a strong inhibitor of D. pteronyssinus, A. siro and T. putrescentiae.
