During 2006 and 2007, {{securities fraud}} class actions were driven by market wide events, such as the 2006 backdating scandal and the 2007 <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis.</b> Securities fraud lawsuits remained below historical averages.|$|E

2500|$|Buffett {{ran into}} {{criticism}} during the <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis</b> of 2007–2008, {{part of the}} recession that started in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals. [...] "Buy American. I am." [...] he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008. Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 [...] "poetic justice".

At last, the author analyzes the strategic options for world leading powers responding to the <b>subprime</b> mortgage <b>crisis</b> from the angles of trade protection and financial protection. </p...|$|R
2500|$|This {{downward}} slide {{could be}} attributed to a range of factors: South Africa's worsening current account deficit, which widened to a 36‑year high of 7.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007; inflation at a five-year high of just under 9%; escalating global risk aversion as investors' concerns over the spreading impact of the <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis</b> grew; and a general flight to [...] "safe havens", away from the perceived risks of emerging markets. The rand depreciation was exacerbated by the Eskom electricity crisis, which arose from the utility being unable to meet the country's rapidly growing energy demands.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan {{expressed}} concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance {{to regulate the}} mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that [...] " [...] {{like a man who}} suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up." [...] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis.</b> Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2001 Enron {{accounting}} scandal, the company's ratings {{remained at}} investment grade until {{four days before}} bankruptcy—though Enron's stock had been in sharp decline for several months—when [...] "the outlines of its fraudulent practices" [...] were first revealed. Critics complained that [...] "not a single analyst at either Moody's of S lost {{his job as a}} result of missing the Enron fraud" [...] and [...] "management stayed the same". During the <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis,</b> when hundreds of billion of dollars' worth of triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities were abruptly downgraded from triple-A to [...] "junk" [...] status within two years of issue, the CRAs' ratings were characterized by critics as [...] "catastrophically misleading" [...] and [...] "provided little or no value". Ratings of preferred stocks also fared poorly. Despite over a year of rising mortgage deliquencies, Moody's continued to rate Freddie Mac's preferred stock triple-A until mid-2008, when it was downgraded to one tick above the junk bond level. Some empirical studies have also found that rather than a downgrade lowering the market price and raising the interest rates of corporate bonds, the cause and effect are reversed. Expanding yield spreads (i.e., declining value and quality) of corporate bonds precedes downgrades by agencies, suggesting it is the market that alerts the CRAs of trouble and not vice versa.|$|E

2500|$|The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission {{formed by}} the US Congress in 2009 to {{investigate}} {{the causes of the}} 2008 financial crisis, concluded [...] "the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis". Ben Bernanke, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote that experience and research contradict [...] "the charge that CRA was at the root of, or otherwise contributed in any substantive way to, the current mortgage difficulties." [...] Government economists and officials, including Janet Yellen, then President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and {{studies have shown that the}} CRA has increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households.17 FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan, and Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner, also hold that the CRA did not significantly contribute to the <b>subprime</b> <b>crisis.</b> According to Yellen, now current Chair of the Federal Reserve, independent mortgage companies made risky [...] "higher-priced" [...] loans at more than twice the rate of the banks and thrifts; most CRA loans were responsibly made, and were not the [...] "higher-priced" [...] loans that have contributed to the current crisis. During a 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis, including in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act, when asked if the CRA provided the [...] "fuel" [...] for increasing subprime loans, former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines said it might have been a catalyst encouraging bad behavior, but it was difficult to know. Raines also cited information that only a small percentage of risky loans originated as a result of the CRA.|$|E
