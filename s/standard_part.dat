5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{new works}} dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed {{the music of}} other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He {{was among the first}} violinists to make Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto a <b>standard</b> <b>part</b> of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).|$|E
5|$|Tension {{with the}} Soviet Union and China {{came to a}} head in the Korean War, and {{it became clear that the}} peacetime Navy would have to be much larger than ever imagined. Fleets were {{assigned}} to geographic areas around the world, and ships were sent to hot spots as a <b>standard</b> <b>part</b> of the response to the periodic crises. However, because the North Korean navy was not large, the Korean War featured few naval battles; the combatant navies served mostly as naval artillery for their in-country armies. A large amphibious landing at Inchon succeeded in driving the North Koreans back across the 38th parallel. The Battle of Chosin Reservoir ended with the evacuation of almost 105,000 UN troops from the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} <b>standard</b> <b>part</b> of the materia medica of Western medicine beginning {{at least with}} the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of the <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> optimal control problem {{is to find a}} number, m, of control inputs to a given input-output system {{that can be used in}} different combinations to achieve a certain number, n, of output objectives and to do this in such a way that a specified figure-of-merit measuring the average cost of control is minimized. The problem is especially interesting when m is significantly less than n. Distributed optimization problems of this type arise naturally in connection with recent work on control communication complexity. In what follows a general formulation of the <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> optimization problem is given along with some simple illustrative examples. Control communication complexity is defined, and it is shown how one measure of this complexity naturally leads to a <b>standard</b> <b>parts</b> optimization problem. The entire circle of ideas is explored in the context of quadratic optimal control of the Heisenberg system, and recent results on computability using simple closed curve inputs are presented.
