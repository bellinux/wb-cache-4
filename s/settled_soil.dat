40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} analyze {{the relationship between the}} <b>settled</b> <b>soil</b> volume in water (SSVW) and the growth of Monochoria vaginalis (Burm. f.) Kunth under organic farming conditions. SSVW corresponds to the mud volume per dry matter weight. Soil was sampled from the superficial layer of the topsoil (< 10  mm), which was of a finer texture {{than the rest of the}} topsoil. Without the application of rice bran, there was a negative correlation between SSVW and the number of individuals of M. vaginalis. This finding suggests that SSVW is useful as a physical indicator for the growth suppression of M. vaginalis. The application of rice bran dramatically reduced the number of M. vaginalis. The values of SSVW with rice bran were greater than those without rice bran. The analysis of SSVW indicates that the change in soil physical properties following the application of rice bran was one of the factors responsible for the suppression of M. vaginalis growth...|$|E

The resin is injected incrementally under a structure to achieve a desired foundation level, forming a composite resin–clay material. This solution is not well documented in the literature and some questions arise on the long-term performance of this solution. As injection is usually carried out in a <b>settled</b> <b>soil</b> mass that is dry and dessicated, rehydration of the soil after injection may lead to swelling of the leveled foundation and overlifting of the structure. Experimental research undertaken to investigate this rehydration issue and determine if there is a risk of overlifting in the long term is presented here. In situ and laboratory testing was performed to investigate the most fundamental aspects of the problems. This included the in situ injection of resin, study of resin propagation in the soil mass, influence of resin on the hydraulic conductivity of the soil mass, and large-scale swelling tests. The results suggest that, even though the resin cannot prevent the rehydration of the soil mass, the risk of overlifting in the long term is limited...|$|E

40|$|The {{concern about}} the {{environment}} has required {{that the effects of}} drilling fluids (muds) on surrounding areas be known. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of various muds on plant growth and on soils. In preliminary studies in Phase I (31 individual mud components), it was concluded that the obvious dominant effects on plant growth of detrimental drilling fluid components included excess soluble salts, excess exchangeable sodium percentage, possibly a high pH in some mixtures, and undesirable physical conditions. The latter resulted from the sodium and/or starch, gums, and bentonite. Phase II, the second year 2 ̆ 7 s study of the effect of drilling fluid on six soils and on the plant growth (which is this report) was designed to use seven typical drilling fluids at ratios of 1 : 4 (called the low rate), and 1 : 1 (called the high rate) by volume of liquid mud to disturbed and <b>settled</b> <b>soils</b> using green beans and sweet corn as the test plants. The seven mud mixtures were potassium chloride mud (PCM), diesel oil emulsion mud (DOEM), high pH lime mud (HPLM), lignite lignosulfonate sodium mud (LLSM), lignite lignosulfonate potassium mud (LLPM), dichromate mud (DTM), and a mud base (MB). Each mud contained bentonite and barite plus sodium or potassium hydroxide plus a few other substances. Too much soluble salts or too high an exchangeable sodium percentage was the major cause of reduced plant growth. The dispersing problem of mud-treated soils caused by high exchangeable sodium percentages results from the high sodium hydroxide contents added to the muds. Early attempts at leaching the soils with tap water were unsuccessful because of low permeability. Releaching all samples finally with salty water, first with 1 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and later with 0. 2 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and finally with tap water was effective and plant growth improved in all mud mixtures. In unleached treatments the muds PCM, DOEM, and DTM were most limiting to plants growth. Reclamation of soils into which drilling fluids (muds) are mixed seems to require primarily (1) the removal of excess salts, and (2) a lowering of the content of exchangeable sodium with some additions of chemical amendments (calcium salts) and adequate leaching...|$|R

In a given water layer, the transport distances of eroded soil fractions, and thus {{that of the}} associated substances across landscapes, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and phosphorous, {{are determined by the}} settling velocities of the eroded soil fractions. However, using mineral size distribution to represent the <b>settling</b> velocities of <b>soil</b> fractions, as often applied in current erosion models, would ignore the potential influence of aggregation on the <b>settling</b> behaviour of <b>soil</b> fractions. The destructive effects of raindrops impacting onto aggregates are also often neglected in current soil erosion models. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a proxy method to effectively simulate aggregate breakdown under raindrop impact, and further identify the settling velocity of eroded sediment and the associated SOC. Two agricultural soils with different sandy and silty loam textures were subjected to rainfall using a raindrop aggregate destruction device (RADD). The aggregates sustained after raindrop impact were fractionated by a settling tube into six different classes according to their respective settling velocities. The same mass amount of bulk soil of each soil type was also dispersed and sieved into the same six classes, to form a comparison in size distribution. The SOC content was measured for each settled and dispersed class. Our results show the following: (1) for an aggregated soil, applying dispersed mineral grain size distribution, rather than its actual aggregate distribution, to soil erosion models would lead to a biased estimation on the redistribution of eroded sediment and SOC; (2) the RADD designed in this study effectively captures the effects of raindrop impact on aggregate destruction and is thus able to simulate the quasi-natural sediment spatial redistribution; (3) further RADD tests with more soils under standard rainfall combined with local rainfalls are required to optimize the method...|$|R
