5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and <b>sold</b> <b>off.</b> By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, {{the park}} <b>sold</b> <b>off</b> {{a large number}} of horses, {{including}} herd stallions, and released several stallions with outside bloodlines into the herds. At this point, brothers Leo and Frank Kuntz began purchasing the horses with the aim of preserving the breed, and founded the Nokota Horse Conservancy in 1999, later beginning a breed registry through the same organization. Later, a second, short-lived, registry was begun by another organization in Minnesota. In 2009, the North Dakota Badlands Horse Registry was created, which registers the slightly different type of horses which have been removed from the park in recent years. Today, the park conducts regular thinning of the herd to keep numbers between 70 and 110, and the excess horses are <b>sold</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|John, {{the fourth}} Marquess, {{acquired}} the castle in 1900 {{on the death}} of his father, and the family estates and investments around the castle began to rapidly reduce in size. Cardiff had grown hugely in the previous century, its population increasing from 1,870 in 1800 to around 250,000 in 1900, but the coal trade began to diminish after 1918 and industry suffered during the depression of the 1920s. John only inherited a part of the Butes' Glamorgan estates, and in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century he <b>sold</b> <b>off</b> much of the remaining assets around Cardiff, including the coal mines, docks and railway companies, with the bulk of the land interests being finally <b>sold</b> <b>off</b> or nationalised in 1938.|$|E
