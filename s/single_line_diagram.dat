40|$|Abstract [...] Optimal and {{effective}} {{operation of a}} large power system requires analysis of {{a huge amount of}} information by the system operators. In a large power system, it is a challenge to present the vast amount of data in a way, which assists the operators in assessing the state of the system and responding expeditiously. Restructuring of the power sector worldwide, the advent of new market mechanisms and the need to analyze various parameters and available security margins has made this challenge all the more formidable. These challenges are a prime mover for the continuous improvement and evolution of new visualization techniques. Effective visualization methods, techniques and tools are key to empowering the system operator and facilitating quick operator response under critical conditions. Internet and the development of new IT tools have added a new dimension for the power system operator. Analysis in real time and drill-downs into the data are required by the operator for a detailed investigation. Effective power system visualization capability is a strong motivating factor for the operator for improving his response and productivity. This paper describes the visualization methods, tools and techniques implemented and used by the Indian power system operator. Classical displays including <b>single</b> <b>line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> tabular displays, load curves, bar charts, pie charts, tie <b>line</b> interconnection <b>diagrams,</b> etc. have been discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to study the {{possibility}} of getting a house, isolated to the network, as sustainable as possible. It means to achieve the maximum energy savings without neglecting the economic aspect. This should take into account many factors such as using {{the resources of the}} place in the best efficient way and be innovative whether it is possible or not. As the house is supposed to be placed in a quite mountainous area, resources that should be developed are wind, solar and geothermal power. In order to get energy from those two resources, solar panels, solar collectors and geothermal pipes should be used. So {{at the end of this}} project the house should have the following installations: • Geothermal pump installation in order to keep the house warm: Different alternatives will be analysed so as to get the best option to heat the house. Once the possible solutions are explained, one of those will be choose to be installed in the hotel. • Solar Panels installation so as to connect to the net: In the design of solar photovoltaic installation selling electricity instead of using it for the house own consumption will be more profitable. This is because of the high purchase price of the kWh generated by the photovoltaic solar energy. • Solar thermal installation to provide hot water: This energy will be used in order to produce hot water. Different possible alternatives to this system will be studied and the reasons of the chosen alternative. • Electrical installation: The electrical installation will be performed with its wiring planes and <b>single</b> <b>line</b> <b>diagram.</b> The size of wires will be calculated throughout different criteria.

This study was made in two parts, the firs focused in the evaluation of the power quality of the electrical supply, through the AR-NT-SUCAL- 2015 national normative, where were found values of flicker, harmonic current and voltages, out of the limits. The second part, focused to evaluate the power quality inside the installations, identifying the equipment that introduce distortions to the energy in the electrical network and after that measuring the magnitude of this distortions; for that, recommendations of the AR-NT-SUCAL- 2015, IEEE 1159 - 2009 and IEE 519 - 1992 were taken. To search the causes of the failures and events, the actualization of the <b>single</b> <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> was done and during the pickup of the information like motors nameplate, conductor gauges, protections and contactors, there were detected loose connections and deficient grounding, findings that reduce the power quality that the equipment receives.

40|$|Non-Utility Generating Facilities (NUG) {{are among}} the most {{important}} supply-options available to utilities for generating least cost energy plans. The task of quickly and accurately evaluating the merits of this supply option is becoming an important function of utility system planners and operators. Furthermore, the reliability performance of the composite generation and transmission system together with the reliability indices of service supplied to customers constitute one of the major aspects that are taken into account in the power system planning and operating phases. North American Electric Reliability Council has developed a reference document containing the planning and the minimum operating considerations that both the utility and nonutility generating facilities must follow to assure the continued reliability of the bulk electric system. The most important considerations that affect the reliability assessment of the composite generation and transmission power system are the load-following capability, generation schedule, fuel supply and storage capabilities, maintenance requirements, emergency availability and restoration procedures. An improved computational method has been developed considering the main features of the Monte-Carlo sequential approach and its objective is to calculate an appropriate set of indices that quantify the operational and reliability performance of a power utility system incorporating NUG facilities together with the respective indices for each NUG facility under consideration. The basic improvements of this method are die following: 1) The generation rescheduling and branch overloading techniques have been extended to include the particular operating characteristics of NUG units. 2) A fuel supply control technique has been developed incorporating all the operating characteristics of two alternative models (constant order size or time interval). A particular model is assigned to each NUG plant by the user indicating the fuel order policy being applied. 3) The overall performance of the power system being analyzed is quantified by calculating the following indices: • Expected total energy supplied by all system generating units. • Expected energy supplied by all NUG units. • Expected average production cost of all system generating units. • Expected average production cost of all NUG units. • Expected total cost of energy purchased by the utility. • Expected damage cost of interruptions due to failures in the entire system. • Expected damage cost of interruptions due to failures in the NUG plants. 4) The operational performance of NUG plants is quantified by taking into account the events which occur when the NUG units fail to produce their output capacity agreed due to limitations existing in the NUG plants (failures, maintenance, fuel supply limitations) and utility system (split system, overloaded branches). Another category of events is also considered which cause the operation of NUG plants outside of their agreed time schedule (over-supply while in operation, continue to supply, start to supply while not in operation, continue to supply while there are fuel supply limitations). The following four indices are calculated for all the above categories of events: • Frequency of events being occurred. • Expected annual duration of events being occurred. • Expected energy not supplied (or supplied accordingly) during the events being occurred. • Penalty charges paid by the NUG plants (or the utility accordingly). 5) A technique has been developed that calculates the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of integrating a NUG plant into a utility system for the time period under study. This cost is related to the expected energy supplied by the NUG plant and takes into account the capital cost of the investment and the operating cost of the plant units. 6) The Interrupted Energy Assessment Rate (IEAR) for the entire system (SIEAR) is calculated by taking into account the IEAR indices of all system load-points and their contribution to the total system load demand. The method developed has been implemented efficiently into the self-sufficient and easy to use computer program RANUG which can be used for analyzing alternative system configurations and establishing the impact of various system parameters. The data required for both the utility power system and the NUG facilities are inputted in a very simple way considering the respective <b>single</b> <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> and the operating features being applied.
