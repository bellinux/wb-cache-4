40|$|We {{investigate}} how the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation in risk-adjustment models for health-care costs affects the covariate effect, where the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> {{interest for the}} covariate effect may {{be different from the}} <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. As an illustrative example, we use claims data to estimate the incremental costs associated with heart failure within one year subsequent to myocardial infarction. Here, the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest for the effect of heart failure on costs is additive. However, traditional methods for modeling costs use predetermined <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation - for example, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes an additive scale while log-transformed OLS and generalized linear models with log-link assume a multiplicative <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We compare these models with a new flexible model that lets the data determine the appropriate <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. We use a variety of goodness-of-fit measures along with a modified Copas test to assess robustness, lack of fit, and over-fitting properties of the alternative estimators. Biases up to 19 % in the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> interest are observed due to the misrepresentation <b>of</b> the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation. The new flexible model is found to appropriately represent the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> estimation and less susceptible to over-fitting despite estimating additional parameters in the link and the variance functions.
