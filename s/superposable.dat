5000|$|Axial {{chirality}} is {{a special}} case of chirality in which a molecule does not possess a stereogenic center (the {{most common form of}} chirality in organic compounds) but an axis of chirality - an axis about which a set of substituents is held in a spatial arrangement that is not <b>superposable</b> on its mirror image. Axial chirality is most commonly observed in atropisomeric biaryl compounds wherein the rotation about the aryl-aryl bond is restricted, for example, biphenyl, binaphthyls, e.g., 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol, and certain dihydroanthracenone compounds. Certain allene compounds and spirans also display axial chirality. The enantiomers of axially chiral compounds are usually given the stereochemical labels Ra and Sa. The designations are based on the same Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules used for tetrahedral stereocenters. The chiral axis is viewed end-on and the two [...] "near" [...] and two [...] "far" [...] substituents on the axial unit are ranked, but with the additional rule that the near substituents have higher priority than the far ones.|$|E

The early nucleolar reactivation, revealed by both AgNO 3 staining and ultrastructural autoradiography, {{takes place in}} a similar way in both control and treated embryos. On the other hand, the well known dramatic increase in uridine incorporation together with the further nucleolar maturation, taking place before the onset of blastocyst formation, are reversibly inhibited in the quiescent 8 - 10 cell stage MGBG-treated embryos. After removal of the drug, the genetic activation is restored with a delay perfectly <b>superposable</b> to that induced in the cavitation process. This confirms that cavitation is strictly dependent on molecular differentiation and suggests that polyamines are involved in this process. These results also support the hypothesis of a desynchronisation between chromosome replication progress and cytoplasmic maturation (molecular differentiation) as an explanation for the lower cell number of the 'delayed nascent blastocysts' resulting from a transient treatment with MGBG.

Unfortunately information of different nature is not <b>superposable</b> in an obvious way, but requires a dedicated framework. Because biological abstractions, i. e., genomic or metabolic information, can be easily represented as graphs, it is intuitive to integrate them into a unique graph, in which one can perform graph analysis for investigating a given biological assumption. This study follows such a philosophy and completes a genome and metabolome combination. In a such integrated framework and as illustration, we applied a graph analysis that automatically investigates impacts of the gene adjacency to predict functional relationships between genes and reactions. Our approach, called SIPPER, creates a weighted graph, in which the weights rely on the given relationship between genes, and computes (alternative) chains of reactions catalysed by genes. This method, as a generalisation of methods already published, can be easily adapted to several biological assumptions, properties or measures. This paper evaluates SIPPER on Escherichia coli.

A non-zero signal for solutions is only measured for chiral molecules such as proteins whose mirror image is not <b>superposable</b> on the original molecule. A CD spectrum provides information about the bonds and structures responsible for the chirality. When a small molecule (or ligand) binds to a protein, it acquires an induced CD (ICD) spectrum through chiral perturbation to its structure or electron rearrangements (transitions). The wavelengths of this ICD {{are determined by the}} ligand’s own absorption spectrum, and the intensity of the ICD spectrum is determined by the strength and geometry of its interaction with the protein. Thus, ICD can be used to probe the binding of ligands to proteins.

Addition of a quarter wave plate to a CD spectropolarimeter converts it to a linear dichroism (LD) spectrometer.

40|$|A method {{similar to}} the sucrose-gap {{technique}} introduced be Stäpfli is described for measuring membrane potential and current in singly lobster giant axons (diameter about 100 micra). The isotonic sucrose solution used to perfuse the gaps raises the external leakage resistance so that the recorded potential is only about 5 per cent less than the actual membrane potential. However, the resting potential of an axon in the sucrose-gap arrangement is increased 20 to 60 mv over that recorded by a conventional micropipette electrode when the entire axon is bathed in sea water. A complete explanation for this effect has not been discovered. The relation between resting potential and external potassium and sodium ion concentrations shows that potassium carries most of the current in a depolarized axon in the sucrose-gap arrangement, but that near the resting potential other ions make significant contributions. Lowering the external chloride concentration decreases the resting potential. Varying the concentration of the sucrose solution has little effect. A study of the impedance changes associated with the action potential shows that the membrane resistance decreases to a minimum {{at the peak of}} the spike and returns to near its initial value before repolarization is complete (a normal lobster giant axon action potential does not have an undershoot).

In the present work we have reconsidered the factors that control internalization the other way around: i. e. by introducing potential internalization sequences in complement receptor 1 (CR 1) which does not preferentially associate with clathrin-coated pits. The analysis of the internalization efficiency of NPxY related motifs generated by substituting His 2010 and/or Glu 2015 by either Phe or Tyr indicates that FxNPxY is the stronger promoter of endocytosis and that the signal efficiency depends {{on the presence of}} aromatic residues (including a tyrosine) {{at both ends of the}} -xNPx- motif. Moreover, CR 1 -tyr (substitution of Glu 2015 for Tyr) internalization was <b>superposable</b> to that of a receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CR 1 fused to the intracytoplasmic tail of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (including the FxNPxY motif) (CR 1 -LDL). When analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, the surface mobility of CR 1 -LDL was decreased as compared with that of either CR 1 -tyr or CR 1 -wt, despite a similar association with clathrin-coated pits. The role of receptor mobility in internalization was confirmed by the observation that CR 1 -tl, with a deletion of the cytoplasmic tail, was more mobile and more efficiently internalized than CR 1 -wt...|$|E
