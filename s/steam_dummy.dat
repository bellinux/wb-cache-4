5000|$|The Brooklyn Central and Jamaica Railroad {{opened the}} line along Fifth Avenue, from its Atlantic Avenue Line south to 24th Street at Greenwood Cemetery, on August 28, 1860. The Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road opened on October 5, 1863, running <b>steam</b> <b>dummies</b> from Fifth Avenue and 36th Street (the city line) south to 37th Street, and east on 37th Street and south towards Coney Island. At the same time, the Central Railroad {{extended}} its Fifth Avenue Line south to 36th Street. The Atlantic Avenue Railroad, the Central's successor, {{gained control of}} the Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad, the BB&CI's successor, in January 1893, and soon changed it to an electric trolley line.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{particularly}} from the 1860s to the 1890s, many streetcar operators switched from animals to other types of motive power. Before the use of electricity the use of <b>steam</b> <b>dummies,</b> tram engines, or cable cars was tried in several North American cities. A notable transition took place in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. where horsecars were used on street railways from 1862 to the early 1890s. From about 1890 to 1893 cable drives provided motive power to Washington streetcars, and after 1893 electricity powered the cars. [...] The advantages of eliminating animal drive power included dispensing {{with the need to}} feed the animals and clean up their waste. A North American city that did not eliminate its cable car lines was San Francisco and much of its San Francisco cable car system continues to operate to this day.|$|R

5000|$|In 1859, the Rose Tree Hunt Club was {{organized}} {{south of the}} township, followed by the Lima Hunt Club to the west (1885) and the Radnor Hunt Club {{at the intersection of}} Darby-Paoli and Goshen Roads in 1886. With these developments, many country estates were built in the rolling hills of Newtown Square for [...] "...either country gentlemen of Old Quaker blood...or rich Philadelphians who loved hunting, owned good horses, and were not afraid to ride them." [...] Major transportation developments for the Township did not occur until the mid-1890s, when trolley service was opened to Newtown Square. Before this time, railroad lines had been proposed, but due to a series of reorganizations and competition between companies for right-of-ways as of 1892, no track had been laid. In 1894, however, mule-drawn service was initiated by the Philadelphia and Delaware County Railroad, with <b>steam</b> <b>dummies</b> used to help out on the hills. Electrification was completed the following year and the trolley was open from Newtown to Fernwood in 1895. By 1889, the reorganized Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company had completed the track to West Chester.|$|R

50|$|From 1793 to 1850, Philadelphia and West Chester {{were linked}} by {{a dirt road}} used by horse-drawn {{carriages}} and wagons. The Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Road Company was formed in March 1848 to build a toll road between 38th and Market streets in Philadelphia and Newtown Square. The turnpike was to have five toll houses along its length. The West Chester Pike was constructed to improve farming and manufacturing in Delaware County. The turnpike became a plank road between 1850 and 1868. Rail service was first used on the turnpike in 1859, when the Delaware County Passenger Rail Road Company built a 4 mi horse-drawn rail line from 38th and Market streets in Philadelphia to Howard House in Upper Darby. The entire turnpike between Philadelphia and Newtown Square became a stone road by 1885. The Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company established a trolley service along the West Chester Pike between 63rd Street in Philadelphia and Newtown Square in 1895. <b>Steam</b> <b>dummies</b> were first used but electric trolley cars were introduced a year later. The trolley line was extended west to West Chester in 1898. The trolley line followed {{the south side of}} the turnpike. Following the construction of 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby in 1907, the route of the West Chester Pike saw increasing suburban development. In 1918, the West Chester Pike was taken over by the state, with the tolls removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} later {{extended}} east to Wyckoff Avenue (at the Brooklyn/Queens border). In 1906 the el was connected via a ramp to the Lutheran Cemetery Line, a former <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> line to Metropolitan Avenue that had opened on September 3, 1881. That section was elevated {{as part of}} the Dual Contracts on February 22, 1915.|$|E
50|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> or dummy engine, in the United States and Canada, was a {{steam engine}} {{enclosed}} {{in a wooden}} box structure made to resemble a railroad passenger coach. Steam dummies had some popularity in {{the first decades of}} railroading in the U.S., from the 1830s but passed from favor after the Civil War. In Europe, locomotives of this type were described as Tram engines.|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} that the more {{familiar}} appearance of a coach presented by a <b>steam</b> <b>dummy,</b> as compared to a conventional engine, {{would be less likely}} to frighten horses when these trains had to operate in city streets. Later it was discovered that it was actually the noise and motion of the operating gear of a steam engine that frightened horses, rather than the unfamiliar outlines of a steam engine.|$|E
5000|$|The South Side Railroad was {{incorporated}} March 23, 1860 and organized April 20, 1860 to build from Brooklyn to Islip, with Willet Charlick, {{brother of the}} LIRR's Oliver Charlick, and Charles Fox of Baldwin in control. An April 12, 1867 supplement to its charter authorized an extension to East Hampton. Construction began in June 1866, and it opened for regular service from Jamaica east to Babylon on October 28, 1867. Extensions opened to Islip on September 5, 1868, Sayville on December 11, 1868, and Patchogue on April 10, 1869. It was forced to build its own line west of Jamaica due to a lease made of the Brooklyn Central and Jamaica Railroad (including the Atlantic Avenue Line) by the LIRR in November 1866 and the LIRR's purchase of the New York and Flushing Railroad on July 13, 1867. The line from Jamaica west to Bushwick opened on July 18, 1868, with a streetcar connection to the 8th Street Ferry in Williamsburg, and it opened its own track in Boerum Street, Broadway, and 8th Street to Williamsburg (operated by horses, soon replaced by <b>steam</b> <b>dummies,</b> west of Bushwick) on November 4, 1868. A branch was also built from Maspeth (west of Flushing Avenue) northwest to Furman's Island at the junction of Newtown Creek and Maspeth Creek for freight. However, an extension beyond Patchogue was not built, because the LIRR built the Sag Harbor Branch in 1869 and 1870 {{to cut off the}} competition. [...] Prior to the acquisition by the LIRR, there was a proposal by the SSRRLI to extend the main line southeast towards Bellport, and then northeast to Brookhaven and Southaven. Rather than the Brookhaven station that existed on the LIRR between 1884 and 1958, the planned station in Brookhaven was to be named [...] "Fireplace" [...] after Fireplace Neck.|$|R
50|$|The other {{style of}} steam tram had the steam engine {{in the body}} of the tram, {{referred}} to as a tram engine or <b>steam</b> <b>dummy.</b> The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in Rockhampton, in the Australian state of Queensland between 1909 and 1939. Stockholm, Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of Södermalm between 1887 and 1901.|$|E
50|$|The {{road was}} reorganized in 1868, on January 22, 1879, {{and again on}} December 1, 1885, the latter time {{changing}} {{its name to the}} Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad, formalizing the use of West End in the line's name. Before that time, the original <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> cars, which consisted of a locomotive and passenger car in one railroad-coach-type frame, were replaced by conventional steam locomotives pulling unpowered coaches.|$|E
50|$|This {{streetcar}} {{line was}} initially {{powered by a}} <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> on a narrow gauge 40 lb. rail. The <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> {{at the time was}} an eight-ton locomotive that from the outside looked like a coach rail car. In later years, the rail line became part of Tacoma Railway & Power Company. The line was then converted to standard gauge and electrified. Upon completion of the initial line the last spike was driven by the nephew of Ezra Meeker, Frank Oliver Meeker on June 29, 1890. Frank owned the land near the southwest corner of the newly incorporated City of Puyallup and near where the street car line first entered the city limits. This was also the same area where years later in 1919, the rail lines were washed out, never to be replaced. With the Short Line in place and serving Puyallup from the north, the old line was abandoned up to Woodland and the tracks removed. The communities from Woodland to Tacoma would still be served for a few more years by the Puyallup Hill Line.|$|E

50|$|This {{grade-level}} station {{opened on}} December 28, 1906 {{as a replacement}} for a former station along a <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> line known as the Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad. It has three tracks and a narrow island platform. The platform, which only has one single-sided bench, serves the middle track (Manhattan-bound) and northern one (Rockaway Parkway-bound). The southern-most track is a stub-end track that leads to the Canarsie Yard. The station was rebuilt twice: in the 1970s and in 2005.|$|E
50|$|In August 1879, the City Railroad {{extended}} its Myrtle Avenue Line one block east from Broadway to Bushwick Avenue, and acquired trackage rights over the Bushwick Railroad's Bushwick Avenue Line (which used Myrtle Avenue east of Bushwick Avenue) to Myrtle Avenue Park in Ridgewood, Queens. At Ridgewood, connections {{could be made}} to the Cypress Hills Line and soon the Lutheran Line, two <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> lines to local cemeteries. The City Railroad leased the Bushwick Railroad, which included these cemetery lines, on July 27, 1888.|$|E
50|$|Oakland's first horsecar {{line was}} built in 1869 and ran along Telegraph Road to 36th Street.

50|$|The Suburban Line {{was built}} in 1870 as a <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> line, {{splitting}} from the main line just north of 99th Street, running west along 99th and turning south to the present line at the S-curve just south of 99th. The crossing of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway midway along 99th was known as Dummy Crossing. In the early 1890s the line was extended north to 89th Street {{in conjunction with the}} expansion of the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad, and the portion on 99th was removed.|$|E
5000|$|The Windsor Electric Street Railway was {{the first}} public {{electric}} street railway in Canada, having begun service on June 6, 1886 with official opening ceremonies on June 9. [...] Electricity was replaced with <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> operations in April 1888 until the fall of that year, when it was replaced with horse-drawn carriages afterwards. It was reorganized on April 18, 1893 as the City Railway Company of Windsor, and was leased to the SW&A on March 21, 1894. The SW&A would completely absorb it on June 4, 1904 turning the Windsor-Essex Street Railway into its trolley line to Walkerville, Ontario.|$|E
50|$|The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, also {{referred}} to as the Milwaukee Interurban Lines or the TMER&L is a defunct railroad in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co. was the largest electric railway and electric utility system in Wisconsin. It combined several of the earlier horsecar, <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> and streetcar lines into one system. Its Milwaukee streetcar lines soon ran on most major streets and served most areas of the city. The interurban lines reached throughout southeastern Wisconsin. TMER&L also operated the streetcar lines in Appleton, Kenosha and Racine, as well as its own switching operations at the Port Washington and Lakeside power plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{ancestor of}} the SW&A (and thus, Trainsit Windsor) is the Sandwich and Windsor Passenger Railway Company, which was officially incorporated on March 2, 1872 and operated from July 20, 1874 onwards. On March 3, 1880, it was operated under foreclosure by Mr. A. J. Kennedy, who re-incorporated {{it as the}} SW&A on June 25, 1887. During this period, the SW&A was using horse-drawn streetcars. In Autumn of 1877 to May 1878, the SW&A experimented with using <b>steam</b> <b>dummy</b> railway propulsion for its streetcar and interurban services, before switching to electric power on a full-time basis, from August 15, 1891, until May 6, 1939.|$|E

On July 16, 1974, a fire completely destroyed the original wooden platform and station house along with R27 cars 8202, 8203, 8237 and R30 car 8512 along with some fire damage done to R32 cars 3549, 3659, 3694 and 3695, and the station had to be completely rebuilt. It reopened in 1980 with the current concrete platform and brick stationhouse.|$|E
50|$|On July 18, 1868, {{service on}} the branch began running to Bushwick, and on November 4 to the East River at the South Eighth Street station in Williamsburg, where {{passengers}} would take a ferry into a Manhattan. Due to a law in Brooklyn banning steam locomotives, horses pulled trains from the Bushwick Depot to the East River Ferry Terminal in 1868. <b>Steam</b> <b>dummy</b> engines pulled trains from Bushwick depot to East River Ferry Terminal between 1869 and 1873. The two main railroad routes leading to the East River ferry terminals were along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, a route owned by the LIRR, and in Long Island City, a route owned by the Flushing and North Side Railroad (FNSRR). To provide a marine freight terminal, {{in the summer of}} 1869, a spur was built to the Newtown Creek at Furman's Island, which today is connected by landfill to the rest of Brooklyn.|$|E
