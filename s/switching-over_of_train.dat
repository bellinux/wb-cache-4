40|$|Abstract—Under salt stress conditions, {{the level}} of CpNpG-methylation (N is any nucleoside) of the nuclear genome of the facultative {{halophyte}} Mesembryanthemum crystallinum in the CCWGG sequences (W = A or T) increases two-fold and is coupled with hypermethylation of satellite DNA on <b>switching-over</b> <b>of</b> C 3 -photosynthesis to the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathway of carbon dioxide assimilation. The methylation pattern of the CCWGG sequences is not changed in both the 5 ′-promoter region of the gene of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, the key enzyme of C 4 -photosynthesis and CAM, and in the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Thus, a specific CpNpG-hypermethylation of satellite DNA has been found under conditions of expression of a new metabolic program. The functional role of the CpNpG-hypermethylation of satellite DNA is probably associated with formation of a specialized chromatin structure simultaneously regulating expression {{of a large number}} of genes in the cells of M. crystallinum plants on their adaptation to salt stress and switching-over to CAM metabolism...|$|R

The requirement <b>of</b> <b>training</b> for police officers is {{a minimum of}} 635 hours, the requirement for full-time peace officers is a minimum of 100 hours <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> and the requirement for part-time peace officers is a minimum of 10 hours <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> However, each agency can give their officers as much training as they want {{as long as it}} meets the minimum requirement.

40|$|Employee {{training}} programs {{need to develop}} ways of increasing the likelihood that learned skills and behaviours are used when employees return to their jobs, i. e., that "transfer of training" occurs. One way to facilitate transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is to perform a post-training intervention designed to increase transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> This dissertation has four main purposes. The first purpose was to test the effects of two post-training interventions, relapse prevention and transfer enhancement, in a 2 x 2 experimental design. The two interventions were designed to increase transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> by increasing self-efficacy for the training task, or a person's belief {{in his or her}} ability to perform the training task. Subjects were 147 nurses from one hospital who participated in a two day workshop. Self-efficacy and transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> were measured by both self-reports and supervisor reports at two and six months following training. Contrary to prediction, the two post-training interventions did not result in higher transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> than the control group. It is suggested that the training itself was effective in increasing self-efficacy and in leading to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in control subjects, making post-training interventions redundant for this training program. The second purpose was to test the effect of "motivation to learn" on transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> Strong support was found for the hypothesis that "motivation to learn" is positively related to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> The third purpose of the dissertation was to examine the process by which transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> occurs. This study hypothesized that self-efficacy would be positively related to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> and strong support was found for this hypothesis. The fourth purpose of the dissertation was to examine the influence of transfer climate on transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> It was found that supervisor and coworker support had a positive effect on self-reported but not supervisor-reported transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> A model <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is presented and recommendations for research and practice are discusse...|$|R
