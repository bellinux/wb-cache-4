25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a diagonal <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> {{for each of the}} eight passenger seats when it was delivered new to FLN. However, when Loganair converted the aircraft for ambulance use, they installed the same seats and seat belts they used in the rest of their Islander fleet. The shoulder harnesses were designed to attach to a specific type of lap belt, which was different from the lap belts used by Loganair. At the time of the accident, shoulder harnesses were not required for passengers, and Loganair did not retrofit the seat belts or shoulder harnesses to be compatible with each other.|$|E

New {{mandates}} by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for all 1968 model passenger cars were incorporated. Safety equipment including separate <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> for the front seat belts, two rear lap belts, lighted side markers, padded seat backs, non-glare finish, safety design handles and armrests, energy absorbing steering column and optional headrests. American Motors did not wait for the requirements to cars delivered to dealers after 31 December 1967, but incorporated the safety features starting with the early 1968 model year cars produced in late 1967. Other requirements caused increases {{to the price of}} all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, including exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E
25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached {{to the base of the}} boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E
500|$|Maverick {{features}} six three-car steam-era style trains {{that seat}} twelve passengers each. The trains have tiered seating and are named and colored as follows: Brett— Brass, Brent— Gold, Ben— Gunmetal, Beau— Gold, Bart— Silver, [...] and Sam— Copper. The restraint system, similar to Accelerator Coasters, includes a hydraulic over the <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> and an interlocking seat belt. The station features an elevated dual unloading and loading platform enabling two trains to be loaded and unloaded simultaneously. Maverick features western music, {{contributing to the}} western theme. There is also an elevator shaft designed {{to look like a}} silo, that also contributes to the western theme. The passenger height restriction was initially set to a minimum of [...] In May 2007, the height restriction was raised to a minimum of [...] per recommendations made by Intamin. At the 2015 Winter Chill Out, Cedar Point announced that the traditional over the shoulder restraints would be replaced with the soft vest style restraints seen on Intimidator 305.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued safety {{recommendation}} 2006-101 (regarding <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses)</b> and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the air transport community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses.</b> In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses</b> should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all commercial air transport aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered. The European Commission accepted the EASA opinion, and [...] new regulations requiring <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses</b> as described in the AAIB's safety recommendation 2006-101 became law for commercial air transport operators in Europe.|$|R

2500|$|The paramedic's {{body was}} found {{strapped}} in to his seat with a severe, possibly fatal, head injury from an impact {{against the back of}} the pilot's seat in front of him. Despite the death of both occupants of the aircraft, the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or AAIB, considered the impact survivable by the pilot. Had the paramedic been wearing a <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness,</b> the AAIB concluded it was likely that the paramedic would have survived the impact with the water with little or no injury, though it is possible he might then have succumbed to the cold water. The pilot, whose uninjured {{body was found}} nine months after the accident, and who had been wearing a <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness,</b> most likely survived the accident and escaped the aircraft, only to die of hypothermia in the cold water. As a result of this accident, regulations were enacted in 2015 by the European Union (EU) that require all aircraft of similar size that are used to transport passengers to be equipped with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness,</b> or [...] "upper torso restraint system" [...] (UTR system), for each passenger seat.|$|E
2500|$|All Americans {{received}} a new chrome horizontal grille bar that extended outboard to the headlights, while the grille sections got an attractive [...] "blackout" [...] treatment. The wraparound rear {{window on the}} sedans was modified to a flat unit, with a more squared-off [...] "C" [...] pillar, which changed the appearance from the earlier sedans with their overhanging rooflines. [...] The overall effect was a more formal-looking car. [...] The 440 and Rogue versions picked up a stainless steel trim piece running stem to stern on either body side, straight back between the wheel wells and the belt line. At {{each end of the}} strip were the newly safety-mandated body side reflectors, amber for the front fenders, red for the rear. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards for all passenger cars sold in America for 1968 also called for <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> for the front seats and elimination of reflective interior trim. Other requirements for all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, included exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E
2500|$|The cockpit {{area of the}} Islander had not {{suffered}} significant damage, {{and there}} was sufficient space for the pilot to survive. The pilot's seat belt and <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> were found undamaged and unbuckled, with all stitching intact and the buckle still functional. There {{was no sign of}} impact on the controls or the instrument panel. Both fuel tanks contained a significant amount of fuel, which investigators calculated to be approximately 100 US gallons in each of the two wing tanks, and the fuel selector valve was in the correct position. Several instruments were damaged by the impact or by the pressure and corrosion from sitting on the seabed for six days. The aircraft's horizontal situation indicator, or HSI (a navigational instrument to direct the pilot to or from ground-based navigation aids, including the MAC VOR), was not set properly for the approach. The instrument's course selector was set to 103°, though the approach called for a setting of 115°. A second device on the HSI, called the [...] "heading bug", is a prominent marker for the pilot to set to the desired heading so that when the aircraft is flying that heading, the bug {{is at the top of}} the instrument's display and aligned with a vertical white line. The heading bug on the HSI was set to 157°. A second instrument situated below the HSI and capable of the same VOR navigation, called the omni bearing indicator (OBI), was also set incorrectly to 309° when it too should have been set to 115°.|$|E

50|$|Passengers are {{restrained}} by a <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness,</b> {{as well as}} a secondary locking bar across their laps. Compressed air is used to actuate the <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness,</b> with a fail-safe mechanism which engages the <b>shoulder</b> <b>harness</b> in the event of power failure. The loss of compressed air also causes the shoulder harnesses to engage. In addition, the gondola's sides and roof are made up of closely spaced metal bars, allowing riders to see the world outside, while preventing anyone from falling out while the ride is in motion. Like most ride safety measures, these are only effective if safety and height restrictions are enforced. To date, the only deaths or severe injuries caused on a kamikaze ride have been caused by a failure to follow the height restrictions, or complacency {{on the part of the}} operator or deck personnel. Most carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks require riders to be at least 48 inches (122 cm) or taller.|$|E

25|$|The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} benefit of requiring upper torso restraints (UTR, i.e., <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses)</b> in passenger seats of aircraft weighing less than 5,670kg in response to a safety recommendation arising from the investigation of a 1999 accident involving a Cessna Titan near Glasgow. As a result of that study, the CAA changed its regulations to require <b>shoulder</b> <b>harnesses</b> for passengers on all aircraft registered after February 1, 1989, if that aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 or less and 9 passenger seats or fewer. The CAA also forwarded a recommendation to the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe, recommending that European regulators adopt a similar standard. However, {{at the time of the}} Loganair accident, the JAA had not acted on the recommendation. Although the UK regulation covered the accident aircraft (it was first certified in May, 1989), Loganair had obtained an exemption from the CAA concerning this issue.|$|R
