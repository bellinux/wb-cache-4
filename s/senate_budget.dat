5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act.

Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

500|$|Ryan {{supported}} {{a group of}} three budget reform bills that were considered by the House during the 113th United States Congress.

He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. [...] He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting. Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that [...] "families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington". He said that these three budget reform bills [...] "are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington". Ryan claimed that [...] "by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem".
