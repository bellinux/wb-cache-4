5|$|About a {{year after}} the accident, a monument—a large white cross with an {{attached}} nameplate—was erected on the spot of the crash site to commemorate the victims of LANSA flight 502. In 2006, because of encroaching development, the Peruvian owner of the land where the memorial was originally located, under pressure from the U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Charles E. Schumer, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Consulate General in Peru, agreed to relocate the memorial 150 feet away to protect the site.|$|E
5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E

5|$|William Seward {{was sworn}} in as <b>senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on March 5, 1849, during the brief special session called to confirm President Taylor's cabinet nominees. Seward was seen as having {{influence}} over Taylor: taking advantage of an acquaintance with Taylor's brother. Seward met with the former general several times before Inauguration Day (March 4), and was friendly with Cabinet officers. Taylor hoped to gain the admission of California to the Union, and Seward worked to advance his agenda in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{nominated}} two-term incumbent Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, {{leaving an}} empty {{seat in the}} United States Senate. After two months and many potential names considered, then-Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand as the interim <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Gillibrand was required to run in a special election in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> as Secretary of State. Clinton was confirmed {{by a vote of}} 94-2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her senate seat, effective immediately. This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant Senate seat. Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 {{for the remainder of the}} full term, which ended in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 special {{election}} for the 20th congressional district of New York {{was held on}} March 31, 2009, to fill the vacancy created in January 2009 when the district's representative, Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand, was appointed US <b>senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> replacing Hillary Clinton, who had been appointed Secretary of State in the Obama administration. The two major-party candidates were Democrat Scott Murphy, a private businessman, and Republican Jim Tedisco, the minority leader of the New York State Assembly. A third-party candidate, Libertarian Eric Sundwall, was initially included in the race, but later removed from the ballot.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E
5|$|One of Barack Obama's first {{decisions}} as president-elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton, US <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and former Democratic presidential primary opponent, as Secretary of State; Clinton resigned her Senate seat {{to take the}} position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010. Both the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report listed the race as a toss-up.|$|E

5000|$|By the {{tradition}} of Senatorial courtesy, other Senators generally deferred to a nominee's home state senators when evaluating a presidential nomination. [...] The <b>Senators</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> were Edward Murphy, Jr. and David B. Hill; [...] Hill objected to Cleveland's nominations, and most other Senators supported Hill. [...] Hill was a rival of Cleveland's who had lost the Democratic nomination for President to him in 1892.|$|R

5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, {{and when}} he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but Justin Smith Morrill, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the 47th United States Congress, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (David Davis) who caucused with the Democrats, and one Readjuster (William Mahone), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them, resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other <b>Senator</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Thomas C. Platt, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased when the New York legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} time that U.S. <b>Senators</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> were elected by general ballot. Until 1911, the U.S. Senators had been elected by the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State Legislature, but the lengthy {{stalemate}} between Tammany and a faction led by State Senator Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was decided to impede the election of William F. Sheehan or any other crony of Tammany boss Charles F. Murphy, led to a constitutional amendment. Since 1914, the U.S. Senators have been elected with the state officers on the state ticket, and selected in the party primaries.|$|R
5000|$|On March 24, President James A. Garfield (Half-Breed) {{nominated}} President pro tempore of the State Senate William H. Robertson (Half-Breed) for {{the office}} of Collector of the Port of <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> The two U.S. <b>Senators</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Roscoe Conkling and Platt (both Stalwarts) openly opposed the nomination, causing deadlock in the Senate which was evenly divided with 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats and two Independents. The office of Collector of the Port of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> was the most profitable federal office in the United States, and Conkling insisted in having a Stalwart appointed, but Garfield did not budge.|$|R
50|$|The canvass {{committee}} disagreed {{on whether}} to allow these ballots to be counted or not. The question was referred to the United States <b>Senators</b> <b>from</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Federalist Rufus King and Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr, for arbitration. King said all votes ought to be canvassed, Burr said that the ballots from Clinton County ought to be allowed, the ones from Otsego and Tioga counties should be rejected. Thereupon, {{a majority of the}} canvass committee (Gelston, Tillotson, Smith, Graham, Van Cortlandt, McCarty, Havens) rejected the ballots from all three counties and declared George Clinton duly elected governor by a majority of 108 votes.|$|R
