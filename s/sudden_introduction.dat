2500|$|In {{the natural}} course of events, species become extinct {{for a number}} of reasons, {{including}} but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an invasive alien species does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the [...] "overkill hypothesis", the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (300–1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300–1500 CE), resulted from the <b>sudden</b> <b>introduction</b> of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.|$|E

60|$|The Romance of a Shop, by Miss Amy Levy, is a {{more mundane}} book, and deals with the adventures of some young ladies who open a {{photographic}} studio in Baker Street to the horror {{of some of their}} fashionable relatives. It is so brightly and pleasantly written that the <b>sudden</b> <b>introduction</b> of a tragedy into it seems violent and unnecessary. It lacks the true tragic temper, and without this temper in literature all misfortunes and miseries seem somewhat mean and ordinary. With this exception the book is admirably done, and the style is clever and full of quick observation. Observation is perhaps the most valuable faculty for a writer of fiction. When novelists reflect and moralise, they are, as a rule, dull. But to observe life with keen vision and quick intellect, to catch its many modes of expression, to seize upon the subtlety, or satire, or dramatic quality of its situations, and to render life for us with some spirit of distinction and fine selection--this, I fancy, should be the aim of the modern realistic novelist.

Suitable initial care is essential for a good prognosis of these patients. Objectives To assess the knowledge of the 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among medical students in their final year of undergraduate training. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 217 medical students enrolled in the sixth year of accredited medical schools in Brazil. A structured questionnaire with 27 items was used to record the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and to assess their knowledge base of the 2010 ILCOR guidelines for CPR. Results Only fifty (23. 04 %) out of 217 students achieved results considered as satisfactory in the written evaluation. The average score obtained was 56. 74 % correct answers. Seventeen percent of the students had never performed CPR maneuvers and 83. 80 % had never performed cardioversion or defibrillation.

Transcatheter arterial embolization has been used widely {{in the setting of}} intractable neoplastic hemorrhage arising from primary and metastatic tumors of the lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Here, we detail the use of transcatheter arterial embolization in controlling torrential hemorrhage in a patient with advanced invasive breast cancer and multiple comorbidities. Case presentation We report the case of a 28 -year-old African-American woman who presented with acute torrential hemorrhage from a high-grade invasive ductal breast carcinoma. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a 14 cm mass with extensive muscle, fascial, and cutaneous invasion. Owing to the extent of invasion and multiple comorbidities, she was deemed to be unsuitable for surgical management. Selective angiography of the left internal mammary artery revealed no tumoral blush, extravasation, or pseudoaneurysm. Transcatheter arterial embolization was undertaken, and complete occlusion of the vessel was demonstrated. No further episodes of hemorrhage occurred. Conclusions Though rare, sudden severe hemorrhage from advanced breast cancer may be definitively managed by embolization alone and thus surgery may be avoided. </p...|$|R

We compared the Seattle ECG criteria with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) ECG criteria of 2005 and 2010 for cardiac screening in high-level junior soccer players. Methods During the 2012 - 2013 season, all data from cardiovascular screenings performed on the youth division of two professional soccer clubs were collected. The total study population consisted of 193 male adolescent professional soccer players, aged 10 - 19 years. Five players dropped out of this study. Results Applying the ESC criteria of 2005 and 2010 to our population resulted {{in a total of}} 89 (47 %) and 62 (33 %) abnormal ECGs. When the Seattle ECG criteria were applied, the number of abnormal ECGs was 6 (3 %). The reduction was mainly due to a reclassification of the long QT cut-off value and the exclusion of right atrial enlargement criteria.

Sudden death is the one that happens within an hour from the onset of the subjective discomforts regardless of the existence of any previous disease. According to modern statistics, 450. 000 people die suddenly in the USA and 150, 000 in Germany. Causes of sudden death. The most frequent causes of sudden death are cardiologic or, in other words, a heart rhythm disorder such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and bradycardiac rhythm disorder. All these reasons can be efficiently prevented by the implantation of the cardioverter defibrillators. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator. In comparison with the already known medications, the defibrillator seems to be the most efficient in prevention of sudden cardiac death. This fact has been confirmed by large multicentre studies. The implantation itself is a routine procedure. It lasts about an hour and it often passes without any complications. The patient leaves the hospital {{a few days after the}} procedure. About 150 of these procedures are performed per year at the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Vojvodina.

The subsequent isolation of a pentachlorophenol degrading bacterium, Sphingobium chlorophenolicum, provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study an early evolutionary response to the new selective pressure. The minimal enzymatic pathway required to degrade PCP was laboriously determined before high throughput sequencing was possible. Many of the proteins discovered were identified by following their activities through increasingly stringent fractionations, sequencing the N terminus of the protein, designing degenerate primers, and ultimately cloning the gene from the genome. This highly targeted approach proved to be effective but left many of the evolutionary questions that motivated the study of this pathway and this organism unanswered. Where did these genes come from? Did they originate from horizontal gene transfer, duplication and divergence, or recruitment? What are the regulatory mechanisms of this pathway?

40|$|<b>Introduction.</b> <b>Sudden</b> {{arrhythmogenic}} {{cardiac death}} is {{a major cause of}} mortality in patients with congestive heart failure due to adverse electrical remodelling. To establish whether abnormal conduction is responsible for arrhythmogenic remodelling in progressed stages of heart failure, we have monitored functional, structural and electrical remodelling in a murine model of heart failure, induced by longstanding pressure overload. Methods. Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC; n= 18) or sham operated (n= 19) and monitored biweekly by echocardiography and electrocardiography. At the 16 -week endpoint, electrical mapping was performed to measure epicardial conduction velocity and susceptibility to arrhythmias. Finally, tissue sections were stained for Cx 43 and fibrosis. Results. In TAG mice, fractional shortening decreased gradually and was significantly lower compared with sham at 16 weeks. Left ventricular hypertrophy was significant after six weeks. TAG mice developed PQ prolongation after 12 weeks, QT prolongation after 16 weeks and QRS prolongation after two weeks. Right ventricular conduction velocity was slowed parallel to fibre orientation. In 8 / 18 TAG hearts, polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias were provoked and none in sham hearts. TAC mice had more interstitial fibrosis than sham. Immunohistology showed that Cx 43 levels were similar but highly heterogeneous in TAG mice. All parameters were comparable in TAG mice with and without arrhythmias, except for Cx 43 heterogeneity, which was significantly higher in arrhythmogenic TAC mice. Conclusion. Chronic pressure overload resulted in rapid structural and electrical remodelling. Arrhythmias were related to heterogeneous expression of Cx 43. This may lead to functional block and unstable re-entry, giving rise to polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. (Neth Heart J 2010; 18 : 509 - 15. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Introduction.</b> <b>Sudden</b> {{hearing loss}} is a {{clinical}} entity of ambiguously defined aetiology manifested by hearing loss {{of more than}} 30 dB on three contiguous frequencies occurring within 72 hours. The lack of standard therapy protocol led {{to the use of}} variety of different therapies, thus making difficult objective quantification of their effect. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} present our experience in the treatment of sudden hearing loss with administration of vasoactive and corticosteroid therapy. Methods. Our research included 59 hospitally treated patients with a sudden hearing loss. During the period 1995 - 2004, 37 patients were treated using vasoactive agents (xanthinol nicotinate and pentoxifylline), and from 2004 - 2009, 22 patients were treated using parenteral corticosteroids (dexamethasone). All patients had unilateral sensorineural hearing loss of different level at frequencies from 500 - 4000 Hz, while other diagnostic procedures (laboratory tests, internist and neurology examinations, X-ray) were within normal limits. Evaluation of therapy effect was done by follow-up of hearing threshold changes and subjective complaints. Results. The results showed that full recovery was achieved in patients with a mild and not fully severe hearing loss, with the majority of those (73 %) under corticosteroid treatment. In these patients recovery was also achieved more rapidly. A partial recovery of hearing was detected in patients with hearing loss of more than 80 dB, and mostly in patients treated with corticosteroids. Conclusion. Although statistical evaluation does not indicate significant differences between the application of vasoactive drugs or corticosteroids, clinical findings support advantages of corticosteroid therapy. Treatment of hearing loss, although controversial, requires change of some up-to-now used agents. Advantages should go in favour of contricosteroids...|$|R
