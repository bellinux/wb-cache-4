40|$|In {{the next}} decades, many world wide space {{agencies}} {{are planning to}} colonize new celestial bodies, such as the Moon, Mars and the asteroids. In order to undertake this type of missions different risks {{have to be taken}} into account, including space radiations, which are one of the biggest issue to consider. This work aimed to develop a quick and easy tool able to assess doses received by astronauts during these interplanetary journeys, with the particular feature to take data source directly from satellite recordings and online available dataset. After <b>setting</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> the number, composition and thickness of each layer shielding the incoming ionizing particles, this tool evaluates the effective dose or the ambient dose equivalent released by those particles able to penetrate trough these layers, thanks to the Bethe‐Bloch's equation for the stopping power assessment. Finally, comparisons with results obtained from SPENVIS for both the case to the Moon and to Mars are presented and analyzed...|$|E

50|$|Hatfield College was {{established}} in 1846 as the second college of the University. The establishment of the college as a furnished and catered residence with fees <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> was then a revolutionary idea, but later became general practice at student residences. This idea originated from the founding Master, David Melville, who believed that the poor {{should be able to}} afford college residence and higher education. Three principles of the model were that rooms would be furnished and let out to students with shared servants, meals would be provided and eaten in the college hall, and college battels (bills) were <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Melville's model was not introduced in the university until recommended by the Royal Commission of 1862.
