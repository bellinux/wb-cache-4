5|$|Jean Keene (October 20, 1923 – January 13, 2009), {{also known}} as the Eagle Lady, was a former rodeo trick rider who became the subject of {{national}} attention due to her feeding of wild bald eagles on the Homer <b>Spit</b> <b>in</b> Homer, Alaska. Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized for drawing a large population of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting the feeding of predatory birds.|$|E
5|$|By 11,000 BC, {{the makers}} of the long blades had gone. Two timber {{platforms}} have been identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare Bronze Age (2,500–800BCE) survivals. Seahenge is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5ha (6.1acres) {{at the end of}} a sandy <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47AD.|$|E
5|$|Hurst Castle is an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the Hurst <b>Spit</b> <b>in</b> Hampshire, England, between 1541 and 1544. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway. The early castle had a central keep and three bastions, and in 1547 was equipped with 26 guns. It was expensive to operate due to its size, but it formed {{one of the most}} powerful forts along the coast. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Hurst was held by Parliament and was used briefly to detain King Charles I before his execution in 1649. It continued in use during the 18th century but fell into disrepair, the spit being frequented by smugglers.|$|E

5|$|Keene came to Alaska for {{the first}} time in the early 1970s to attend a cousin's wedding. Attracted by the state's beauty, she {{returned}} for several visits before making the decision in 1977 to move there — alone. Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer <b>Spit</b> <b>in</b> the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 2016, Costa {{received}} his first red card in a Chelsea shirt {{near the end}} their 2–0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Everton for confronting opponent Gareth Barry. Footage appeared to show Costa biting Barry during that confrontation after clashing heads. Earlier in the match, Costa appeared to <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> {{the direction of the}} referee after he was yellow carded for a clash with Barry. Later, both Costa and Barry denied that the bite occurred. Costa's two-match ban was extended to three, and he was fined £20,000. On 2 May, as Chelsea drew 2–2 against Tottenham to deny them the title, Costa was gouged in the eyes by Mousa Dembélé during a mass brawl; the Belgian received a retrospective six-match ban.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> his face.|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} years, the Talune was {{involved}} in two recorded salvage operations. In 1898, it rendered assistance to the SS Ruapehu, stranded on Farewell <b>Spit.</b> <b>In</b> 1899 the Talune fell in with the 5,500-ton 'Perthshire', which had gone missing on a voyage from Sydney to Wellington. For eight weeks, the Perthshire had been drifting helplessly without power in the Tasman Sea with a broken tailshaft. The Talune towed the larger ship back to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Between 1974 and 1980, Kesey {{published}} six {{issues of}} <b>Spit</b> <b>in</b> the Ocean, a little magazine that featured excerpts from an unfinished novel (Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier, {{an account of}} Kesey's grandmother's struggle with Alzheimer's disease) and contributions from such luminaries as Margo St. James, Kate Millett, Stewart Brand, Saul-Paul Sirag, Jack Sarfatti, Paul Krassner, and William S.

500|$|Natural {{features}} seen on {{this stretch}} of coast include arches, pinnacles and stack rocks. In some places the sea has broken through resistant rocks to produce coves with restricted entrances, and in one place, the Isle of Portland {{is connected to the}} land by a narrow <b>spit.</b> <b>In</b> some parts of the coast, landslides are common. These have exposed a wide range of fossils, the different rock types each having its own typical fauna and flora, thus providing evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region.|$|E

Duncan suddenly starts smashing his car before Meg comes out and talks to Duncan, criticizing him. Logan and Veronica are making out before Logan reveals an important piece of information—that he drugged Duncan, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen between them. Logan temporarily leaves Veronica before she notices a camera in the ceiling. She investigates further and finds a whole network of cameras, hinting that Logan was using them for some nefarious purpose. She calls Weevil to pick her up before she enters the house, finding her mother with Keith.|$|E
500|$|The spit {{is subject}} to coastal erosion which has {{gradually}} pushed the spit towards the shore, a process which has eaten away at {{the remnants of the}} 1852 west wing battery and barracks, and has exposed the foundations of the later fortress on occasions. This erosion has increased significantly since the 1940s, due to the construction of groyne barriers at nearby Bournemouth and Christchurch which prevented the natural renewing of the spit with pebbles washed from local cliffs. Erosion caused fresh damage to the eastern end of the castle in early 2013, leading to renewed concerns. Government efforts began in the 1960s to try to stabilise the <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> its current position, both to protect the castle and neighbouring towns, with over [...] of gravel being laid down in the 1990s, and is continuing in the 21st century. The spit and the adjoining coastline is protected as an SSSI.|$|E
500|$|James {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle, and as the eldest son and heir {{apparent}} of the monarch automatically became Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. He was baptised [...] "Charles James" [...] or [...] "James Charles" [...] on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle. His godparents were Charles IX of France (represented by John, Count of Brienne), Elizabeth I of England (represented by the Earl of Bedford), and Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc). Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews, whom she referred to as [...] "a pocky priest", <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> the child's mouth, as was then the custom. The subsequent entertainment, devised by Frenchman Bastian Pagez, featured men dressed as satyrs and sporting tails, to which the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs [...] "done against them".|$|E

500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she <b>spit</b> <b>in</b> our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E
500|$|Before Spit was released, Kittie was {{featured}} in an MTV News 1515 report. In 1999, Kittie released a single for Spit song [...] "Brackish".

Side one of the LP record was recorded with Etron Fou Leloublan at Studio Freeson in Pujaut, France and at Sunrise Studios, Kirchberg, Switzerland in July and August 1980. Side two of the LP consists of four tracks built around extracts from a Massacre concert at CBGB in New York City in April 1980: [...] "A <b>Spit</b> <b>in</b> the Ocean", [...] "Navajo" [...] and [...] "Saving Grace" [...] were later altered and added to by Frith at Sunrise Studios in July and August 1980, while [...] "Conversations With White Arc" [...] is an unaltered improvised piece.
