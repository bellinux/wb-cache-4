5|$|Here are {{the lists}} of {{national}} <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> have no official status.|$|E
5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop {{has a family}} coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, not least because their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
50|$|The symbol {{later came}} {{to have a}} {{different}} meaning to Brodie. After he gained his powers of transformation the <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> spelt danger for others soon became a <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> almost cost him his own life.|$|R
5000|$|... === Changing the [...] "Mascot" [...] === In 2017 a push {{to change}} the school mascot re-emerged. The current yin-yang <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> is used is a {{religious}} <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> many students and staff wish to see changed. There has been a mixture of support and resistance by parents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Symbol</b> <b>that</b> {{represents}} the pack. Scott's symbol is two circles.|$|R
5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An L, {{on the other}} hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the Hungarian {{theoretical}} biologist Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989) {{developed the}} L-system, a formal grammar {{which can be}} used to model plant growth patterns in the style of fractals. L-systems have an alphabet of <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> can be combined using production rules to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by Gottfried Leibniz, Georg Cantor, Helge von Koch, Wacław Sierpiński and others, Benoît Mandelbrot wrote a famous paper, How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension, crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the fractal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalogue, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalogue listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed in the catalogue of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|In other respects, {{individual}} countries had different preferences for styles of memorial. French communities usually chose simple monuments, located in public spaces, and deliberately avoided political or religious imagery and rhetoric. In Australia and the US, memorial halls – {{some of which}} were large, grand structures – were popular. Australia also created the idea of an Avenue of Honour, involving lines of trees, with memorial plaques, along a road. Canadians often brought back various material from Europe for their memorials, including pieces of local European churches and soil from the relevant battlefields. Individual countries also had typical national <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> were widely incorporated, from the British Britannia, to the Gallic rooster to the Romanian vulture. Postcards of war memorials were widely produced in Britain and Italy, and ceramic models of the more famous ones, such as the Cenotaph, were sold as souvenirs.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The compass is a Masonic <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> {{appears on}} {{jewellery}} {{such as this}} pendant.|$|R

50|$|Some Sami shaman drums {{have the}} Beaivi Sami sun <b>symbol</b> <b>that</b> resembles a sun cross.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|Siglas Poveiras are {{a form of}} proto-writing system, with a {{restricted}} number of <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> were combined to form more complex symbols; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system, and as a signature to mark belongings. Merchants wrote them in their books of credit; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them {{in the door of}} Catholic chapels near hills or beaches; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone; and also had magical significance, such as the São Selimão sigla, that {{could be used as a}} protecting symbol and not as family mark. Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency. The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father's symbol. The siglas are still used, though much less commonly, by some families; and are related with Viking traditions.|$|E
5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E

5|$|The Naqada culture {{manufactured}} {{a diverse}} selection of material goods, {{reflective of the}} increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines. During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are <b>symbols</b> <b>that</b> effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, {{these events}} represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
