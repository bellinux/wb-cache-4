However, the driver cannot shift back to R without depressing the <b>shift</b> <b>button,</b> to prevent accidental shifting which could damage the transmission, especially at high speeds.|$|E

5000|$|The Precision Pro {{introduced}} a new stick that was far more ergonomic than the [...] "geometric" [...] design of the 3D Pro. Microsoft also gave {{the rest of the}} Precision Pro a more rounded design, replacing the rectangular base buttons with more rounded versions {{at the top of the}} base, the slider-based throttle with a wheel-based throttle, and the base itself was made more rounded. The Precision Pro also added a <b>shift</b> <b>button</b> to the base, doubling the number of possible button combinations.|$|E
50|$|On a Korean {{computer}} keyboard, text {{is typically}} entered by simply pushing a key for the appropriate jamo; {{the operating system}} creates each composite character on the fly. Depending on the IME and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the <b>shift</b> <b>button.</b> When all jamo making up a syllabic block have been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to Hanja or other special characters using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a separate key for this. Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported to varying degrees in word processors.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} Microsoft's last {{generation}} of SideWinder joysticks, the Precision 2 design was a further refinement {{of the previous}} Precision Pro. Compared to the Precision Pro, the Precision 2 dropped the Pro's <b>shift</b> <b>button,</b> replaced the throttle wheel with a more traditional lever, and rearranged the face buttons on the stick into a symmetric design. The Precision 2 also dropped all gameport compatibility by only shipping in a USB version, and was slightly smaller and lighter than the Pro. Unfortunately, in spite of being Microsoft's 2nd-generation USB controller, the Precision 2 in particular seemed to suffer more from the USB SideWinder's long-standing static buildup problem than the original Precision Pro.|$|E

50|$|The Strategic Commander is {{designed}} to complement a standard mouse/keyboard setup for Real Time Strategy games. It features a total of 6 programmable command buttons, 2 zoom <b>buttons,</b> 3 <b>shift</b> <b>buttons,</b> a macro record button and a 3-point configuration switch. The device also has three movement axes; X, Y and Z (rotation). Through extensive configuration of the <b>shift</b> and command <b>buttons,</b> {{it is possible to}} create a total of 24 different commands per configuration.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the HP LaserJet 4000 in 1997, the control panel was {{completely}} redesigned. The <b>Shift</b> <b>button,</b> which might have been confusing, was gone. There was a Menu, an Item and a Value button. Each of these might be clicked left of right. There was a Select button, a large green Go button, and a small orange Cancel Job button. Configuration through the control panel was easier and more intuitive: menus could be navigated with the Menu button. Then, items within the menu selected with the Item button. The Value button - which had - (decrease) and + (increase) indications - could be used to select a specific setting or value. The Select button was used to select or confirm a particular choice. The display was adapted to a blue-backlit two-line LCD display.|$|E
50|$|Along with {{replacing}} the Precision Pro {{with a new}} design, the Force Feedback Pro was replaced with a Precision 2 derivative, the Force Feedback 2. Compared to the Force Feedback Pro and the Precision 2, nothing new {{was added to the}} Force Feedback 2 that wasn't added to the Precision 2, in fact the <b>shift</b> <b>button</b> was taken away. The overall size and weight difference was not so great with the use of smaller motors. This joystick came in two varieties: one version with a silver trigger, and an updated version with a translucent red trigger. One of the main ideas in the Force Feedback 2 was the removal of the power brick. Since the release of the Force Feedback 2, the stick has garnered a reputation of reliability and resiliency, many Force Feedback 2 sticks are still in use currently. On eBay Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 joysticks regularly sell for more than the original MSRP of $109.|$|E
5000|$|All {{of these}} {{controls}} can be programmed with the included [...] "Nostromo Array Programming Software" [...] to emulate any keyboard function or keyboard macro. They {{can also be}} programmed to change the device's [...] "state". The n52 has 4 different color-coded states, indicated by 3 LEDs below the fifteenth button. If a user changes {{the state of the}} device from the normal one, the red, green, or blue LED lights up, and all other controls now represent a different function. The state-button can be set to act as a temporary <b>shift</b> <b>button</b> that works while it is pressed, a toggle button, or it can be set to work until it is pressed again. In total, this allows up to 104 different functions. The software can recognize games by their executable filenames, and automatically load the appropriate profile when that game is started. User-created profiles, which are technically single files, can be submitted to Belkin via e-mail, making them available for others to download.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time in Falcon's history, Independent Rear Suspension (IRS) became {{available}} as standard on some models and optional on others.

5000|$|A parking lock was not {{provided}} until {{the advent of}} the aluminum-case Torqueflites in 1960 (standard-duty A-904) and 1962 (heavy-duty A-727), at which point a lever was added adjacent to the pushbuttons: Moving the lever to the [...] "Park" [...] position placed the car into Neutral and engaged a lock pawl on the transmission's output shaft. Moving the park lever out of [...] "Park" [...] position unlocked the <b>shift</b> <b>buttons</b> so that a driving range could be selected. The buttons were replaced by conventional steering column- or floor-mounted shift levers in all automatic Chrysler-built vehicles for the 1965 model year, though floor levers were available in certain sporty 1964 models.|$|R

Bouken Silver turns a dial to a particular number (the selection process always starts with No. 11-13), and then presses the button inside the dial to summon or combine. The GoGo Vehicles must be launched one at a time. Accordingly, GoGo Vehicles 4-10, which can combine with GoGo Fire, must be combined one at a time.|$|R
50|$|The AMG {{version of}} the W251, the R63 AMG, was {{introduced}} at the 2006 North American International Auto Show as a 2007 model. It features a handbuilt 6.2 L M156 V8 engine producing 503 hp (375 kW) and 465 lb·ft (630 N·m) of torque. Mercedes-Benz's 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission is standard across the R-Class lineup, with the R63's {{version of the}} gearbox featuring AMG-calibrated shift times with <b>shifting</b> <b>buttons</b> {{on the back of}} the steering wheel. The R63 AMG is electronically limited to a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h), with 0-62 mph time of 4.6 seconds.

50|$|Sequential manual {{transmissions}} {{are true}} manual transmissions, {{and should not}} be confused with automatic transmissions that provide some degree of user shifting input.

5000|$|A ten-speed manual transmission, {{for example}} is {{controlled}} via a six-slot H-box pattern, {{similar to that}} in five-speed cars — five forward and one reverse gear. Gears six to ten (and high speed reverse) are accessed by a Lo/High range splitter; gears one to five are Lo range; gears six to ten are High range using the same shift pattern. A Super-10 transmission, by contrast, has no range splitter; it uses alternating [...] "stick and button" [...] shifting (stick <b>shifts</b> 1-3-5-7-9, <b>button</b> <b>shifts</b> 2-4-6-8-10). The 13-, 15-, and 18-speed transmissions have the same basic shift pattern, but include a splitter button to enable additional ratios found in each range. Some transmissions may have 12 speeds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a new text input device called the chording glove. The keys of a chord keyboard are {{mounted on the}} fingers of a glove.

Aesthetical interaction becomes the central theme. As designing becomes contextual, research should be contextual too. To realise conditional laws, we believe that design research has to become research through design.
