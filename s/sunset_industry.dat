40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{adverse health}} effects of {{asbestos}} are undisputable and well documented in mining environmental literature. The worldwide environmental anti-asbestos campaign begun in the late- 1980 s is premised on this fact. Consequently, major asbestos consumers like Japan, United States and most of Europe will completely ban the use of asbestos by 2005. Most asbestos mines have responded to this challenge by maintaining, reducing or ceasing production thus, portraying the industry as a <b>sunset</b> <b>industry.</b> Anticipating closure, African Associated Mines (AA Mines) took a bold step {{to develop and implement}} an ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) to minimise environmental liability at closure through improved environmental performance. The EMS was certified in February 2004 and apart from initial intentions, it enabled AA Mines to establish new asbestos markets in the Far East.

40|$|Recently, {{large-scale}} surface-water or canal {{irrigation systems}} have been termed ‘a sunset industry’ (Rijsberman 2003). Handing over this <b>sunset</b> <b>industry</b> by means of irrigation management transfer (IMT) policies {{and the creation of}} water user associations (WUAs) has three main objectives: to increase efficiency, equity, and empowerment. The Uzbek government, together with the international organizations, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), is currently promoting IMT and the creation of WUAs nationwide. The onset of the policy seemed to be a rational development since the former state and collective farms, which were also responsible for water management on their territories, were disintegrating, and new private farms were emerging rapidly. This study seeks to assess the potential of IMT policies by examining the broader physical, organizational, socio-economic, and political factors that might facilitate or hinder the main objectives of IMT and the creation of WUAs. These factors are addressed and analyzed separately through eight case study chapters that address questions on basin water management, the organizational capacities, and the socio-political dependencies of the district water management departments, the potential for multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs), the politics of social network structures, and the process of land reforms. The study concludes that none of the external factors is conducive to the introduction of IMT policies and for creating WUAs. The implication is that IMT policies will not increase efficiency, equity, and empowerment, but could even worsen the water management situation. Furthermore, these policies will not increase the empowerment of either the WUAs or their members. Hence, under the current conditions, handing over the ‘sunset industry’ will not lead to a new sunrise for irrigation in Uzbekistan...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, textile {{and apparel}} {{retailers}} from developed countries have started to source globally instead of manufacturing products domestically to reduce costs and become more competitive in textile and apparel markets. However, since global sourcing has extended organizations 2 ̆ 7 supply chains on a worldwide scale, other factors, such as suppliers 2 ̆ 7 capability lead time, logistics service, and trade barriers, should also be seriously considered. Therefore, it is important for buyers to determine the comparative advantages of supplier countries, and suppliers to understand the determinants of their export performance to become more competitive in the era of trade liberalization. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the emerging trends and determinants of Asian developing countries 2 ̆ 7 textile and apparel export performances over the twelve years (2000 - 2011). The research framework in this study was built on the theory of comparative advantages and global value chain framework. The main analysis was conducted in three stages: (1) analyzing the textile and apparel export performance among 11 Asian developing countries, (2) testing the hypothesized relationships between determinants and textile and apparel export performance using a vector auto-regressive (VAR) errors model approach, and (3) comparing the impact of determinants on textile and apparel export performance. SPSS 17. 0 and SAS 9. 3 were used to analyze secondary data sets collected from each country 2 ̆ 7 s available industry and government databases. This study implied that textile and apparel manufacturing industry is a <b>sunset</b> <b>industry</b> in Asian developing countries. In addition, textile and apparel export performance can be influenced by economic levels, immediate and short term impacts. This study also verified elimination of the quota system influence on Asian developing countries comparative advantages and leads to global textile and apparel industry under reconstruction. This study demonstrated that low labor costs may be comparative advantages for Asian developing countries to attract buyer sourcing in Asian, but for a specific Asian developing country, low labor costs will not be the most crucial comparative advantage. Manufacturing competence is not a crucial determinant for textile and apparel export performance in Asian developing countries. Logistics performance has a closer relationship with textile and apparel export performance than lead time. Currency exchange rate has a different impact on textile and apparel export performances among Asian developing countries. Tariffs had a negative impact on textile and apparel export performance in Asian developing countries, especially after the elimination of the quota system. This study makes an important step towards understanding the determinants of textile and apparel export performance, and aids in building a research model of determinants for textile and apparel export performance in Asian developing countries.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine {{electronic}} business developments in manufacturing SMEs in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The lack of studies into the field of e-business and manufacturing SMEs stimulated this piece of research which aims to bridge the knowledge gap that exists in current academic research and literature. The recent economic history of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland shows that whilst the manufacturing industry has {{played an important role}} in economic development over the years, it is now facing the same problems as many of the advanced western economies. Consequently the industrial structure of the marketplace is no longer sufficient, particularly for manufacturing SMEs, who have been impacted by enormous changes in their business processes (Raymond and Bergeron, 2008). Difficulties are apparent within the traditional (<b>sunset)</b> manufacturing <b>industries</b> and in part, technological changes have fuelled their continued decline. At the same time, new technology-based, knowledge intensive manufacturing sector (sunrise) firms have emerged. However due to a dearth of research, the diffusion and assimilation of e- business in various manufacturing sectors represents a key area of investigation (Raymond, 2005; Raymond and St. Pierre, 2007). Theoretically this study has been informed by two contrasting schools of thought namely technological determinism and social constructivism, which philosophically underpin both the diffusion and adoption of a technological innovation, in this case e-business developments. Technological determinism provides a broad view of technology diffusion where technology is viewed as the principal root of societal transformation and is a totally independent process beyond all human control (McLuchan, 1970). Social constructivism proffers the alternative view that the development of a technology is a dependent process, involving actors and social groups who engage in strategies to win from the opposition and to shape technology according to their own plan (Brey, 1997) The research employs a sequential mixed methods (survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews) approach. The rationale for this approach is that the quantitative phase provides an exploratory and broad understanding of the research problem, while the qualitative phase refines and explains those statistical results by exploring participants' views in more depth (Creswell, 2003; Rossman and Wilson, 1985; Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). The objectives of the study are to: assess the level of adoption and usage of e-business in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; to determine the drivers that influence e-business adoption and the benefits derived from e-business developments; to examine the barriers that influence e-business developments; and to understand the factors that impact upon e-business usage and development in Ireland. The main conclusions drawn from the findings are that within the Irish manufacturing sector, SMEs are adopting and developing e-business at varying degrees. However in the majority of cases e-business adoption is erratic and e-business development remains 11 elementary. It is also the case that the full benefits of e-business are not being realised in the majority of firms. Competitive rivalry is dictating the manufacturing firms' strategic approach to e-business adoption and development and ironically one of the most significant barriers recognised by firms to e-enablement is lack of government support. Contrary to the technologically deterministic school of thought which suggests that e- business is adopted sequentially over time, the findings in this study indicate that within manufacturing SMEs the adoption process is a haphazard affair and takes a diverse, contingent and social route, which concurs with the philosophy of social constructivism. In light of the current study it is evident that a firm's environmental, strategic, managerial, operational and technological context are deemed to influence a manufacturing SME's assimilation of electronic business activities. Several practical recommendations are made to assist manufacturing SMEs in developing their use of JCTs. The research also adds to the knowledge base by making several theoretical contributions that serve to confirm, extend and disconfirm previous knowledge in the wider areas of e-business, manufacturing and SME literature. Future research in this area could be extended to other regions and other sectors. It could perhaps attempt to bridge the theory-practice gap by conducting a three strand study involving government, practitioners and academics. Longitudinal and multiple case studies research approaches could also expand on the current study. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
