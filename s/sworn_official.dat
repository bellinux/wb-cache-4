50|$|Law {{enforcement}} has {{an essential}} role, {{but because of}} the complex nature of the forest itself it is really the last resort for obtaining compliance with the law. Where illegal logging, for example, is tied up with conflicting views of forest tenure, using the criminal law to resolve land disputes has obvious limitations.There are at least three approaches to overcoming the difficulties of proving offenses that have taken place in remote locations. One is to focus enforcement on more visible acts, such as transport. Another, common in civil law, is to make the official report of a <b>sworn</b> <b>official</b> admissible as evidence in further proceedings. This effectively shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. A third device is the use of evidentiary presumptions, which similarly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.In many countries the contrast between what forestry law prescribes and what actually happens on the ground is both stark and obvious. Even where the law is strong, illegal behavior by both public and private actors often thrives. The explanations put forward for this phenomenon are familiar: forest departments lack the financial and human resources to monitor and control forest activities, which often take place in very remote areas; government officials entrusted with enforcing the law may be under immense pressure to condone violations, or engage in violations themselves; court systems are backlogged or bankrupt; the difficulties of daily life for the rural poor may overwhelm any likely risks associated with violating the law; etc.These explanations underscore the point that while good forestry legislation is necessary, it is obviously not sufficient. The laws in many countries lie unused or underused for reasons like failure of political will, weak institutions, or even general disregard for the rule of law.|$|E

2500|$|Religion: The Act allowed {{public office}} holders to {{practice}} the Roman Catholic faith, by replacing the oath <b>sworn</b> by <b>officials</b> from one to Elizabeth I and her heirs with one to George III that had no reference to the Protestant faith.

It also reestablished the collection of tithes, which had been stopped under the previous administrative rules, and it allowed Jesuit priests to return to the province.|$|R

50|$|In 2015, {{the city}} of Cedar Rapids {{approved}} a $625 million flood protection plan over 20 years for levee improvements. Although the improvement to the levee system in Cedar Rapids had not been completed due to over $80 million in funding not appropriated by the United States Congresses of 2014 and 2016 and the voting down by local residents of a temporary increase in the local sales tax {{to pay for the}} levee improvements, these students along with {{the hundreds of thousands of}} volunteers and 412 Iowa National Guard troops filled more than a quarter of a million sand bags in a successful effort that prevented any major flooding of the city outside of the evacuation zone. A 9.8 mi system of Hesco barriers, earthen berms, and over 400,000 sand bags were used to plug the gaps in the levee system. The city of Cedar Rapids purchased additional Hesco barriers from Iowa City for $1.4 million. Numerous upstream cities which had been earlier affected by the September flooding and mandatory evacuations including Charles City, Greene, Manchester, Clarksville, Shell Rock, Vinton, Janesville, Cedar Falls and Waterloo sent hundreds of thousands of unused sand bags to support efforts in Cedar Rapids and nearby communities. The remnants of Hurricane Paine did not produce any rain to saturate the temporary earth berms and sand bags, which would have greatly increased the likelihood of breach in the temporary levee structures and thus causing a much greater flooded area; the river crested during very sunny weather in Cedar Rapids. Additionally beginning on the evening of Sunday, September 25, 300 to 400 National Guard troops along with the Iowa State Patrol, other law enforcement agencies, and 60 duly <b>sworn</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> enforced an 8pm to 7am curfew, nightly.|$|R
