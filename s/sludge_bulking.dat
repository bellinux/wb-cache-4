40|$|The {{influence}} of microbial Fe(III) reduction on the deflocculation of autoclaved activated sludge was investigated. Fe(III) flocculated activated sludge better than Fe(II). Decreasing concentrations of Fe(III) caused {{an increase in}} <b>sludge</b> <b>bulk</b> water turbidity, while bulk water turbidity remained relatively constant over a range of Fe(II) concentrations. Cells of the dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella alga BrY coupled the oxidation of H(inf 2) to the reduction of Fe(III) bound in sludge flocs. Cell adhesion to the Fe(III) -sludge flocs was a prerequisite for Fe(III) reduction. The reduction of Fe(III) in sludge flocs by strain BrY caused an increase in bulk water turbidity, suggesting that the sludge was deflocculated. The {{results of this study}} support previous research suggesting that microbial Fe(III) respiration may {{have an impact on the}} floc structure and colloidal chemistry of activated sludge...|$|R
40|$|The {{activated}} sludge {{process is the}} preferred technology for biological wastewater treatment. Despite decades of progress and operation serious operating problems still occur with this process. One major problem is the regular occurrence of excessive growth of filamentous bacteria, phenomena known as filamentous <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge.</b> Poor solid-liquid separation can occur as result of this problem, leading to effluent quality deterioration and to process failure due to uncontrollable loss of biomass with the effluent. The goal of this thesis was to achieve {{a better understanding of}} <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge</b> and the relevant factors involved. To accomplish these objectives, well-controlled laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors with mixed microbial cultures and defined substrates, were operated under different conditions. Traditionally pure culture microbiology or full scale reactor observations have been the basis for the research. The choosen process engineering approach proved to be a success to study <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge.</b> Not only filamentous bacteria grew very well under specific conditions but also the results were reproducible and trends relating sludge settleability and operational conditions were identified. Design guidelines and operation aspects were proposed to control <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge,</b> leading to more robust, reliable, predictive, and sustainable {{activated sludge}} systems. Together with a literature review, the experimental results were the basis to develop a unifying hypothesis about <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge</b> - diffusion based selection. This theory can replace the existing theory based on kinetic selection. Both bacterial morphology and substrate micro-gradients inside microbial aggregates are hypothesized as playing a dominant role in selection for <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge.</b> An individual-based model, originally developed to a biofilm system, is adapted {{for the first time to}} model the competition between different bacterial morphotypes in activated sludge flocs. The first modelling results support qualitatively the hypothesis. Several chapters in this PhD thesis have been published by commercial publishers. These chapters can only be found in publications of these publishers. Bibliographical information of these publications can be found in the different chapters. Applied Science...|$|R
40|$|Sludge {{volume index}} (SVI) can {{evaluate}} and reflect the aggregation of activated sludge sediment properties accurately.

40|$|<b>Sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> is {{the most}} notable cause of {{activated}} sludge plant failure (i. e. exceeding discharge permit quality limits) worldwide. Numerous mathematical methods have been applied to detect and provide warning {{for the prevention of}} <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking.</b> However, these models often fail to reliably forecast <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> events because they focus on the point-by-point 2 ̆ 2 curve-fitting 2 ̆ 2 strategy, while the number of bulking event data points is relatively small in comparison with the large amount of data in the time series. Therefore, three machine learning approaches which focus on detecting the temporal pattern data before the <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> events are considered in this study. The main objective of this research is to apply machine learning and statistical methods to detect the hidden temporal patterns in the sludge volume index (SVI) data and related water-quality parameters occurring before high SVI values (<b>sludge</b> <b>bulking)</b> occur, and then the hidden temporal patterns can be used to forecast high SVI values in the future. Three methods are applied in this research, the improved Time Series Data Mining (TSDM) method, the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) method, and the combined method of Hidden Markov Models and multinomial logistic regression (MLR). The results and analysis show that the improved TSDM method and the HMMs method are capable to detect and predict <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> events.

40|$|Digested sludges {{generally}} exhibit poorer dewaterability than activated sludges. This {{study investigated}} the effects of acidification and oxidation on EPS properties and dewaterability of anaerobic digested sludge in Fenton treatment in order to unravel the underlying mechanism of sludge conditioning. The results indicated that sludge dewatering property was improved after acidification treatment. Meanwhile, fluorescence analysis revealed that the protein-like substances were effectively removed from <b>sludge</b> <b>bulk</b> after acidification treatment. Acidification and Fenton oxidation showed a significant synergetic effect in enhancing sludge dewatering process. Solubilization and decomposition of bound EPS occurred synchronously during Fenton conditioning. Oxidation process is very likely to play a more important role in sludge conditioning than Fenton coagulation. According to pilot test, Fenton treatment performed much better in cake moisture content reduction than chemical conditioning with traditional inorganic coagulants. Additionally, full-scale application of Fenton conditioning will not have detrimental effects on performance of wastewater treatment system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Two 28 L {{continuously}} fed cyclically aerated sequencing batch reactors were operated at {{a constant}} sludge age and hydraulic residence time of 15 and 2, 3, 4 or 8 days, respectively, and an organic load of 7, 14 or 65 g of COD/day to investigate operation strategies to treat whey (a nitrogen unbalanced waste).

To observe performance, biomass appearance and settling behaviour under various nitrogen-limiting conditions, nitrogen was added at rates to maintain COD/N of approximately 20 to 60. The cyclic aeration generated a selector effect in the sludge blanket and controlled bulking. The N-balanced system could be used without the membrane filter and effluent BOD and solids were below 20 mg/L and 25 mg/L, respectively. The effluent of the N-unbalanced systems had BOD below 20 mg/L but generated solids varying between 60 and 100 mg/L. The membrane filter significantly reduced the effluent solids.

40|$|The {{activated}} sludge process (ASP) is widely adopted to remove pollutants in {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs). However, the occurrence of filamentous <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> often compromises the stable operation of the ASP. For timely diagnosis of filamentous <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> for an {{activated sludge}} process in advance, this study proposed a Multi-Output Gaussian Processes Regression (MGPR) model for multi-step prediction and presented the Vector auto-regression (VAR) to learn the MGPR modelling deviation. The resulting models and associated uncertainty levels are used to monitor the filamentous <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> related parameter, sludge volume index (SVI), such that the evolution of SVI can be predicted for both one-step and multi-step ahead.

40|$|Changes of protists, {{which were}} {{categorized}} into different functional groups primarily {{according to their}} feeding habits, in two full-scale municipal wastewater treatment systems experiencing <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> were investigated {{over a period of}} 14 months. Protist biomass represented 3. 7 % to 5. 2 % of total biomass on average under normal sludge conditions, and the percentage increased significantly (p < 0. 05) under <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> conditions. The biomass of Chilodonella spp., capable of eating filamentous bacteria, tended to decrease in both systems when <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> occurred, showing that the abnormal growth of filamentous bacteria did not lead to a biomass bloom of this group of protists. On the other hand, the bactivorous protists represented more than 96 % of total protist biomass, and the biomass of this group, particularly the attached ciliates, increased significantly (p < 0. 05) when <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> occurred. The significant increase of the attached ciliates may have possibly facilitated the growth of filamentous bacteria through selectively preying on non-filamentous bacteria and further exacerbated <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking.</b> The redundancy analysis and correlation analysis results showed that the biomass changes of the attached ciliates were primarily related to the sludge volume index and to some extent related to five-day biochemical oxygen demand loading and hydraulic retention time...|$|E

Volumetric ratios of wastewater sludge to pruning waste, used as a bulking agent, were 1 : 2 (Pile 1), 1 : 2. 5 (Pile 2) and 1 : 3 (Pile 3). Experiments were carried out in an uncovered plant using windrow composting with weekly turning. To monitor the evolution of the three composting piles, routine parameters such as temperature and interstitial oxygen level, chemical parameters such as organic matter, moisture and C/N ratio, and biologically related indices such as respiration indices at process temperature (RIprocess) and at 37 °C (RI₃₇) were monitored. Different responses were observed in the three piles; Pile 1 did not accomplish the necessary requirements in terms of sanitation and RIprocess for a typical composting process; Piles 2 and 3 presented a similar behaviour, reaching thermophilic temperatures for a long period and, due to their high biological activity, high RIprocess. The quality of the product obtained in the three piles in terms of stability (RI₃₇ and the Rottegrade self-heating test) and maturity (germination index) were measured, with compost from Pile 3 the most stable.

With the occurrence of <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking,</b> Actinobacteria and Firmicutes increased sharply, whereas Proteobacteria, which was the predominant phylum in N-AS, decreased markedly. In addition, Nitrospirae, a major lineage of the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, had quite a low abundance in EB-AS (0. 15 %), while it was relatively high in N-AS (1. 17 %). On the other hand, filamentous bacteria accounted for 28. 77 % and 5. 72 % of total sequences in EB-AS and N-AS, respectively.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} with two parallel single reactor intermittently aerated nitrification denitrification systems fed municipal wastewater as influent, that Microthrix parvicella bulking can be stimulated and cured by manipulating the ammonia {{concentration in the}} aerobic period (by inhibiting the nitrifiers) to high and low values respectively.

40|$|Sewage sludge (municipal, or industrial) {{treatment}} {{is still a}} problem in so far {{that it is not}} satisfactorily resolved in terms of cost and final disposal. Two common forms of sludge disposal are possible; the first being direct disposal on land (including agriculture) and the second being incineration (ash production), although neither of these methods are universally applied. Simplifying the issue, direct sludge disposal on land is seldom applied for sanitary and environmental reasons, while incineration is not popular for financial (high costs) reasons. Very often medium and large wastewater treatment plants apply anaerobic digestion for sludge hygiene principles, reducing the amount to be disposed and for biogas (energy) production. With the progress in sewage biological treatment aiming at nutrient removal, primary sludge has been omitted in the working processes and only surplus activated sludge requires handling. Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is more difficult due to the presence of microorganisms, the decomposition of which requires a relatively long time for hydrolysis. In order to upgrade the hydrolysis effects, several different pre-treatment processes have already been developed and introduced. The additional pre-treatment processes applied are aimed at residual <b>sludge</b> <b>bulk</b> mass minimization, shortening of the anaerobic digestion process or higher biogas production, and therefore require additional energy. The water-energy-waste Nexus (treads of) of the benefits and operational difficulties, including energy costs are discussed in this paper.

Annual cyclic changes in microfauna community structures occurred in both systems. RELATE analysis based on Spearman's Rank correlation indicated that microfauna community structures were highly correlated with the sludge volume index (SW) (p< 0. 001), which indicates sludge settleability. Nutrient conditions of raw sewage (p< 0. 01) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (p< 0. 05) were also related to microfauna community structures. Abundances of the species Epistylis plicatilis and Vorticella striata increased significantly with an increase in SW (p< 0. 001) and decrease in water temperature (p< 0. 001), suggesting that <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking</b> may have created favorable conditions for the two species, even under unfavorable temperature conditions. Sludge de-flocculation primarily due to the excessive growth of Microthrix parvicella-like filaments could be an important driving force for the microfauna community changes.

But activated sludge process does have many problems such as <b>sludge</b> <b>bulking,</b> sludge floatation, sludge washout and low adaptability for impact loads. On the other hand, the stuffed media surface is limited and which means limited volume load of bio-film reactor. Therefore, the hybrid biological reactor has become a new wastewater treatment method which has been studied more and more in recent years. It is an integration of activated sludge process and bio-film process. The characteristic is adding media into activated sludge aeration tank as carriers for microbes to grow on or attach on. The co-existence of bio-film and activated sludge improves the treatment efficiency and reliability...|$|E
40|$|Process {{stability}} and final effluent quality largely {{depend upon the}} composition of the biomass in an activated sludge plant. Operational problems such as bulking and scum formation occur when the wrong micro-organisms are dominating the sludge population. Microscopic sludge investigation is therefore essential for process control and stable plant operation. The manual outlines the theoretical framework, extensively illustrated with full-colour micrographs.

40|$|Approximately 1100 {{activated}} sludge samples, mostly derived from purification plants with <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge,</b> were investigated {{for the presence}} of filamentous organisms. Twenty six types were distinguished which are preliminarily classified into seven groups. The sheath forming Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria are classified into Groups I and II, respectively. The organisms morphologically resembling some types of Cyanophyceae are included in Group III. The bacteria of Group IV are characterized by their tiny, curled filaments. The short, straight, multicellular bacteria are classified into Group V, while the organisms of Group VI are motile by a gliding activity. Finally, a number of additional types are collected in Group VII...|$|R
40|$|Activated sludge {{process is}} an aerobic biology process. This process is functioned to treat waste water by {{bacteria}} helped as its food. F/M ratio and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration {{has a big}} influence to filament microorganism growth in activated sludge process. It because there are exaggerates growth which causes <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge.</b> High SVI value indicates <b>bulking</b> <b>sludge.</b> The aim of this research are to know the influences of F/M ratio and DO concentration to microorganism’s filament growth and COD removal in activated sludge process. This research is using reactors which consist of 5 liters volume aeration tank and 2, 5 liters volume clarifier tank. Waste product which is used is 534, 24 mg/l. COD concentration artificial glucose waste water product. The independent variable of this research are F/M ratio(g COD/g MLSS. day) : (0, 10 - 0, 24), (0, 24 - 0, 38), (0, 38 - 0, 52), (0, 52 - 0, 66), (0, 66 - 0, 80) and DO concentration (mg/L) : (0, 5 - 1), (1 - 1, 5), (1, 5 - 2), (2 - 2, 5), (2, 5 - 3). According result of this research, the best SVI’s value is 47, 83 mL/g which happened at DO concentration (2, 5 - 3) mg/L and F/M ratio (0, 38 - 0, 52) g COD/g MLSS. day. High SVI value in low F/M ratio, possibility caused by microorganism filament present. High SVI value caused effluent COD concentration decrease which caused reducing COD efficiency in activated sludge system.
