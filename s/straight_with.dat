5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly <b>straight,</b> <b>with</b> three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E
5|$|Haryanto held a three-second {{advantage}} over Visoiu who had worn his tyres, {{and he was}} unable to maintain the pace. Matsushita overtook Visoiu as a result. Vandoorne was overtaken Visoiu on the pit lane <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of DRS {{at the start of the}} 16th lap. Vandoorne began to push hard and lapped one second faster than his teammate Matsushita. He moved in front of Matsushita for second place after starting lap 18, providing him with an opportunity to attempt to catch Haryanto during the remainder of the event. Haryanto responded and pulled away from Vandoorne. His teammate Matsushita struggled with pace and was passed by Rossi for third place. Berthon recovered from his poor start and moved ahead of Rossi, with the assistance of DRS, at the start of the final lap. Haryanto crossed the start/finish line after 23 laps to win his first GP2 Series race in his 70th attempt. Vandoorne finished second, ahead of third-placed Berthon. Rossi secured fourth, with Leal fifth. Matsushita, Visoiu, and Negrão rounded out the points-scoring positions. King, Pic, Stanaway, Markelov, de Jong, and Sirotkin filled the next five positions, while Lynn, Nato, Evans, Amberg, Stöckinger, Marciello, Sørensen, and Gasly were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

5|$|King was {{overtaken}} by Markelov {{on the same}} lap. Marciello overtook Matsushita at the third corner to retake the lead on lap six. Armand crashed into the turn one barriers on the same lap, resulting in the safety car's second appearance. Most drivers elected to make their mandatory pit stops during the safety car period. Marciello remained ahead of Matsushita and maintained the lead when the safety car drove into the pit lane shortly afterwards. Marciello fended off a challenge by Matsushita to retain first position. Pic squeezed Markelov towards the turn five barrier on the ninth lap and both drivers damaged their cars, causing Markelov to retire. Pic drove on for a short distance before retiring because of the damage resulting from the collision. The safety car was sent onto the track for the third time. Marciello maintained his lead at the restart, while Matsushita ran wide at the first turn, allowing Jeffri to pass him for second place. Matsushita dropped to fifth position. Rowland passed both drivers by taking the inside line. Marciello {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Having run in clean air, Giovinazzi had moved into third place by the 12th lap, but moved into second two laps later when he overtook Rowland on the start/finish <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> DRS assistance.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks. Nowitzki {{appeared}} {{in just three}} of the Mavericks' first 13 {{games of the season}} due to illness and a strained left Achilles tendon. He returned for the 14th game of the season, but with a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Mavericks fell to a 2–12 record – their worst start since going 1–23 in 1993–94. He appeared in one more before sitting out 14 <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> further Achilles tendon issues, this time on his right foot. In his return game on December 23, Nowitzki scored 17 first-half points (playing only 15 minutes before sitting out the second half) in a 90–88 win over the Clippers. On February 7, 2017 against Portland, Nowitzki moved into 10th place all-time in field goals with 10,517. Also, his two blocked shots against the Trail Blazers gave him 1,200 for this career, the 55th player in NBA history to reach that figure. On March 7, 2017, in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 regular-season points. He also became the first international player to reach the milestone and one of only three to score all 30,000-plus with one team—the others being Karl Malone (Utah) and Kobe Bryant (Lakers).|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{returned}} to green flag conditions on lap 26, de Silvestro held the lead ahead of Franchitti, Hunter-Reay and Kanaan with Tagliani in fifth position. De Silvestro {{kept the lead}} for a further two laps, with Hunter-Reay's Andretti Autosport car moving ahead of Franchitti on lap 27, repeating his move on Tagliani on the defending series champion. Not long after, Hunter-Reay moved ahead of de Silvestro as the pair were under braking for turn five. Hunter-Reay nearly lost control of his car as his car bottomed out on the <b>straight,</b> <b>with</b> lifted the car slightly airborne. Franchitti further demoted the young Swiss driver to third, moving ahead on lap 29. Behind them, Hideki Mutoh hit Vitor Meira which saw his retirement from the race, and Wheldon hit the back of Tagliani which sent him into Kanaan, resulting in the retirement of the Canadian driver. Rain started falling once again, more heavily than before {{and much of the}} field pitted to change from dry-weather tyres to wet-weather ones. Alex Lloyd aquaplaned into the wall in the second Dale Coyne car, bringing out the caution for the third time, and with rain falling relentlessly, series officials brought out the red flag to allow the weather conditions to pass. After a 36-minute red flag delay, cars returned to the circuit with slicks being the choice of tyre for the track, despite a few wet patches remaining on the circuit. Some cars gambled on wets thinking that the circuit would not dry quickly enough for their tyres to drop off compared to the slicks.|$|E

25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the hoof {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{defines a}} plane angle as the {{inclination}} to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> respect to each other. According to Proclus an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.|$|E
25|$|In Livy's {{history of}} Rome, the first Etruscan king of Rome built raised, wooden {{perimeter}} seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine <b>straight,</b> <b>with</b> an awning {{against the sun}} and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track. Otherwise, the Circus was probably still {{little more than a}} trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (metae), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.|$|E

25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> the leg and the arch of the foot was {{forcibly}} broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|E
25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump as they need it for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids. An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and <b>straight,</b> <b>with</b> the hindgut being longer and coiled. Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. In insects, the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle, however species that have a different diet require adaptations to meet these new demands.|$|E
25|$|LU {{finished}} the 2009–10 {{season with the}} best record in program history, over previous record set the 2007–08 season. Lindenwood finished with an overall record of 43 wins, 2 losses, and 2 ties, including a loss and a tie against NCAA DIII teams. The Lady Lions went 12–0 in the CCWHA and stormed through the CCWHA playoffs, only allowing 2 goals in four playoff games. The team won the fourth ACHA Women's Division I National Championship and third <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> a 2–0 shutout win over Michigan State University. In addition to the third straight national championship for the Lady Lions, the men's program also won its second straight ACHA Men's Division I National Championship, marking the first time a school has repeated as back-to-back hockey champions in men's and women's at any collegiate level. The university showcased its hockey tradition also winning the 2010 NCRHA Division I Collegiate Roller Hockey National Championships.|$|E

25|$|Now six, Sunline {{returned}} {{in the new}} season with a close second to Piavonic in the Manikato Stakes, won the Memsie Stakes second-up, {{for the second year}} in a row, and won the Turnbull Stakes at her fourth run back. In the third and fifth runs of her campaign, however, she was beaten by the West Australian newcomer Northerly - in the Feehan Stakes and the Cox Plate (where a third victory would have equalled the record set by Kingston Town from 1980 to 1982). In both races, Sunline led to the home turn, but Northerly surged to the front in the straight. The result of the Feehan Stakes was close but clear-cut, while the Cox Plate featured three controversial protests: Sunline (second) against first (Northerly), and third (Viscount) against first and second. The protests arose from heavy contact between the three horses in the <b>straight,</b> <b>with</b> Northerly on the outside, Sunline closest to the rails, and Viscount in between. All three protests were eventually dismissed on twin grounds that stewards were unable to determine which rider(s) was at fault or satisfy themselves that the interference had affected the result.|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E
25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second timber bridge, with a concrete pier, exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a timber trestle bridge at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more timber trestle bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a single span timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is <b>straight</b> <b>with</b> a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E
