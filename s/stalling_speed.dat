5|$|On 23 July, Vikrant sailed off to Cochin {{in company}} with the Western Fleet. En route, before {{reaching}} Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After {{the completion of the}} radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for Madras, escorted by Brahmaputra and Beas. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an Alizé without compromising the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to <b>stalling</b> <b>speed.</b> Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.|$|E
25|$|Fitted with {{retractable}} auxiliary {{wing flaps}} enabling a wing loading of around 12.5lb per square foot, the Messenger featured triple fins and rudders {{in order to}} maintain sufficient controllability down to the exceptionally low <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 25mph.|$|E
25|$|The Bi-mono {{was subject}} to further testing by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down from October 1941. The A found that the maximum speed of the biplane {{configuration}} was slower than the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of the monoplane configuration. Its landing characteristics were likened to a kangaroo.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explains}} {{the problems of}} low speed operations. It aims at <b>stall</b> <b>speed,</b> calculating the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> and factors affecting the <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b> One chapter is about stall warning and safety devices. Another chapter deals with influence of the low speed operations at airplane {{and the way to}} piloting it...|$|R
30|$|It {{is evident}} that the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> with upward {{directed}} thrust {{is lower than the}} <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> in a traditional airplane, higher when thrust is directed downward.|$|R
50|$|A {{load factor}} greater than 1 {{will cause the}} <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> to {{increase}} by a factor equal to the square root of the load factor. For example, if the load factor is 2, the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> will increase by about 40%.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length {{leading edge slats}} and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} angle of incidence, pivoting at the front spar and actuated by an electrically driven jackscrew attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{cleared the}} F4U for carrier {{operations}} {{well before the}} U.S. Navy and showed that the Corsair Mk II could be operated with reasonable success even from escort carriers. It was not without problems; one was excessive wear of the arrester wires, due both to {{the weight of the}} Corsair and the understandable tendency of the pilots to stay well above the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed.</b> A total of 2,012 Corsairs were supplied to the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of RAF trials, despite the Merlin engine proving to be problematic, having {{suffered}} numerous failures and necessitating several changes, enthusiastic reports were produced in the aircraft and its performance figures. The trials had observed the aircraft to possess a maximum level speed of 315 MPH {{at an altitude of}} 16,200ft, a time-to-climb to an altitude of 15,000ft from takeoff of 5.7 minutes, and a <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 57 MPH (only marginally higher than the Gladiator biplane), the last achieved using its flaps.|$|E
50|$|The An-2 indeed has no <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> {{quoted in}} the {{operating}} handbook. Pilots of the An-2 say one can fly the aircraft in full control at 30 mph (as a contrast, a modern Cessna four-seater light aircraft has a <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> of around 50 mph). This slow <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> {{makes it possible for}} the aircraft to fly backwards (if the aircraft is pointed into a headwind of, say, 35 mi/h km/h, it will travel backwards at 5 mi/h km/h whilst under full control).|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} has a <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> of 15 mph.|$|R
50|$|The Prowler's design goals {{included}} maximum {{cruise speed}} {{and to achieve}} this a wing of small area was selected. This results in an ultralight with a cruise speed of 57 mph, {{at the expense of}} a <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> of 28 mph, the fastest <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> permitted by FAR 103 category rules.|$|R
25|$|The B.S.1 {{was first}} flown by Geoffrey de Havilland early in 1913, demonstrating {{excellent}} performance, {{with a maximum}} speed of 91.7mph (147.6km/h), a <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 51mph (82km/h) and a rate of climb of 900ft/min (4.6m/s), despite the engine only delivering about 82hp (61kW) instead of the promised 100hp. De Havilland was {{not satisfied with the}} control afforded by the small rudder and designed a larger replacement, but on 27 March 1913, before the new rudder could be installed, he crashed the B.S.1, breaking his jaw and badly damaging the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the request for proposals, the Navy received designs from Stearman Aircraft, Chance Vought, and the Naval Aircraft Factory. The Stearman Model 85, given the designation XOSS-1, was a conventional two-seat biplane, with the pilot and observer seated in tandem in a fully enclosed cockpit. The aircraft could be operated with either float or wheeled landing gear, with the former being of the single center-float type, and the latter being a conventional taildragger undercarriage. The XOSS-1 had the unusual feature of being fitted with full-span flaps on the upper wing to reduce <b>stalling</b> <b>speed.</b> It was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engine.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350 first flew on 2 February 1931, piloted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It {{turned out}} that the 350 had come out more than 30% overweight, an excess of about a tonne. Consequently the useful load was reduced from the design {{estimate}} of 1,000kg (2,205lbs) to about 350kg (772lbs), making the 350 quite unfit for purpose. In view of that, it hardly mattered that flight tests showed that some of the performance estimates were optimistic: maximum speed was 5% less and the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> higher. Since the aircraft was government funded and its property, Saint-Exupéry flew it to Villacoublay early in 1933. Its career thereafter is not recorded.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} a fluid coupling is its <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> {{is defined as the}} highest speed at which the pump can turn when the output turbine is locked and maximum input power is applied. Under stall conditions all of the engine's power would be dissipated in the fluid coupling as heat, possibly leading to damage.|$|R

25|$|Droops {{function}} with other high-lift devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed.</b> On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
25|$|G-ADDR, {{the fifth}} Scion II, was {{retained}} by Shorts as an experimental testbed aircraft, {{and it was}} on this aircraft (temporarily designated M.3) that a scale wooden model of the slender wings (with Gouge flaps) for the later Empire boats was tested, the first flight in this configuration being conducted by Lankester Parker on 6 August 1935. With these flaps fitted it was tested at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which found that the Gouge flap decreased distance to take-off and <b>stalling</b> <b>speed,</b> among other improvements. Further work with standard wings was carried out; one flight from Rochester Airport, with experimental full-span flaps incorporating retractable spoilers instead of ailerons, was made on 22 July 1936; this idea proved unworkable, Lankester Parker having to draw on his considerable experience to coax the aircraft around on a single circuit before landing safely. The standard wing was refitted and the aircraft continued with Shorts in this configuration until it was impressed into military service in 1940, an operational usage experienced by 14 of the 22 Scion/Scion II aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{departure}} from Scapa, the Admiralty decided that Furious should carry out Operation Bellows, to reinforce Malta (known informally as a Club Run) with Spitfires {{at the same}} time as Operation Pedestal. The departure of Furious was delayed by technical difficulties caused by the flight deck, that sloped upwards to a point amidships. A Spitfire made a practice take-off, with wooden wedges in the flaps to ensure a [...] and Furious steaming at , into a [...] wind. The Spitfire was thrown into the air by the rise on the flight deck, bounced onto the forward slope, fell off the front near <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> and narrowly avoided ditching. An immediate request was made to the Air Ministry for Constant-speed propellers and two days later, a Spitfire with the new propeller took off easily, leaving 38 aircraft still on board to be flown to Malta. In company with , she joined Nelson and the convoy three days before the start of Operation Pedestal.|$|E

50|$|Devices to {{warn the}} pilot when the aircraft's speed is {{decreasing}} close to the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> include <b>stall</b> warning horns (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings. Most stalls {{are a result of}} the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. <b>Stall</b> <b>speed</b> is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the <b>stall</b> <b>speed,</b> not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.|$|R
2500|$|The Mosquito had a low <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of [...] with {{undercarriage}} and flaps raised. When {{both were}} lowered, the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> decreased to [...] Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was [...] Warning of the stall {{was given by}} buffeting and would occur [...] before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.|$|E
2500|$|In general {{aviation}} aircraft, {{the most commonly}} used and most safety-critical airspeeds are displayed as color-coded arcs and lines located on the face of an aircraft's airspeed indicator. [...] The lower ends of the green arc and the white arc are the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> with wing flaps retracted, and <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> with wing flaps fully extended, respectively. [...] These are the stalling speeds for the aircraft at its maximum weight. [...] The yellow range is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air, and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement, and the red line is the VNE, the never exceed speed.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1938 the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{published}} two {{requests for}} proposal for twin-engined and single-engined fighters. For the single-engined fighter the Navy requested the maximum obtainable speed, and a <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> not higher than [...] A range of [...] was specified. The fighter {{had to carry}} four guns, or three with increased ammunition. Provision {{had to be made}} for anti-aircraft bombs to be carried in the wing. These small bombs would, according to thinking in the 1930s, be dropped on enemy aircraft formations.|$|E

2500|$|With its low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane layout, retractable, wide-set conventional {{landing gear}} and enclosed cockpit, the Zero {{was one of the}} most modern carrier based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low wing loading. This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of well below [...] This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with servo tabs on the ailerons after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above [...] [...] They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers.|$|E
2500|$|Variable {{incidence}} {{allowed the}} fuselage {{to be kept}} at the optimum angle for good visibility whilst maintaining lift – particularly useful for a carrier-borne aircraft and with tail-wheel undercarriage. [...] The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the flap setting was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. [...] The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded – a remarkable technical achievement {{in view of the}} small increase in structural weight involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity. It would have been very challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings. It was primarily of wooden construction, in common with the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber since, when it was being built, there was a danger of light alloy being in short supply. [...] The Exe was cancelled in 1938, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin was substituted in the design.|$|E
2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the <b>stalling</b> <b>speed</b> by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E

50|$|A {{leading edge}} slot is a fixed {{aerodynamic}} {{feature of the}} wing of some aircraft to reduce the <b>stall</b> <b>speed</b> and promote good low-speed handling qualities.

In this manner they allow flight at higher angles of attack and thus reduce the <b>stall</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
