50|$|Over recent decades, {{fresh fruit}} also emerged as {{regional}} export item, when the Copiapó and Huasco valleys joined Chile’s fruit-growing boom. They enjoy a comparative advantage because, {{thanks to the}} sunny climate, fruit ripens earlier than {{in the rest of}} the country and reaches northern hemisphere markets first.Grapes are the main crop and, on a smaller scale, olives, tomatoes, peppers, onions, broad beans, citrus fruits, nectarines, apricots, oregano, and flowers.The region’s organic wealth, its clear waters and sheltered bays, together with its entrepreneurial experience, favor the development of aquaculture. Species produced include the northern scallop, Japanese and Chilean oysters, abalone, turbot, algae, and different varieties of mussels.

40|$|Abstract The {{fractionation}} of {{serine protease}} inhibitor (SPI) from <b>fish</b> <b>roe</b> extracts {{was carried out}} using polyethylene glycol- 4000 (PEG 4000) precipitation. The protease inhibitory activity of extracts and PEG fractions from Alaska pollock (AP), bastard halibut (BH), skipjack tuna (ST), and yellowfin tuna (YT) roes were determined against target proteases. All of the roe extracts showed inhibitory activity toward bromelain (BR), chymotrypsin (CH), trypsin (TR), papain-EDTA (PED), and alcalase (AL) as target proteases. PEG fractions, which have positive inhibitory activity and high recovery (%), were the PEG 1 fraction (0 – 5  %, w/v) against cysteine proteases (BR and PA) and the PEG 4 fraction (20 – 40  %, w/v) against serine proteases (CH and TR). The strongest specific inhibitory activity toward CH and TR of PEG 4 fractions was AP (9278 and 1170  U/mg) followed by ST (6687 and 2064  U/mg), YT (3951 and 1536  U/mg), and BH (538 and 98  U/mg). The inhibitory activity of serine protease in extracts and PEG fractions from <b>fish</b> <b>roe</b> was stronger than that of cysteine protease toward common casein substrate. Therefore, SPI is mainly distributed in <b>fish</b> <b>roe</b> and PEG fractionation effectively isolated the SPI from <b>fish</b> <b>roes...</b>|$|R

The roe is separated by hand from the seaweed. The harvest is later sold in Dobo. In 2013 the selling price was 30 000 Rupiah per kilo.
