40|$|A {{prototype}} on-line bond {{inspection system}} for Al/Al-Sn/Al/steel strips is introduced to detect bond defects {{that occur in}} the cold roll bonding (CRB) process of strips. The transmitting and receiving ElectroMagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) probes inspect 100 % material volume whilst the strip is processed continuously. The inspection signals are processed in real-time and are stored for post-processing. Serial production strips with good bond as well as with defects along the bond line were inspected for rigorous testing of the prototype machine. The inspection results were statistically analysed to determine an alarm threshold for serial inspection. The most important results are that the guided waves are sensitive enough for practical non-destructive testing (NDT) to detect all bond defects with only 0. 5 % false alarm rate, which nowadays can only be detected with a destructive peel-off test. The detection of all kinds of bond defects would lead to unreasonable levels of scrap due to false alarms. The application of this prototype EMAT inspection system to an industrial <b>strip</b> <b>processing</b> line shows that on-line detection of significant defects in CRBed Al/AlSn/Al/steel strips in a harsh serial production environment is possible.

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium has a {{hexagonal}} close-packed crystal structure {{which makes it}} more difficult to deform than aluminum. Conventional strip production usually requires several process steps to reach the final strip thickness. Strip casting can reduce some of the process steps and make <b>strip</b> <b>processing</b> simpler and easier, especially for alloys with poor deformability. The twin-roll casting process can directly obtain strips with thickness less than one or two millimeters. In this paper, the metallurgical characteristics of the twin-roll strip casting process were analyzed and discussed. A laboratory scale vertical twin roll caster in prepared AZ 31 magnesium alloy strips, with 1. 0 to 2. 0 mm thick and 150 mm wide. Process stability in the thin strip casting process of the alloy has been studied, the casting temperature (superheat) was proven to be a key factor influencing process stability and casting strip quality. The as-cast microstructure of the alloy was analyzed and evaluated by optical microscopy, which showed that the as-cast microstructure was composed of developed dendrites when the superheat was high, and of a rosebush-like structure when the superheat was low. When the casting temperature was close to the liquid phase temperature，the as-cast microstructure became global or grainy, and the grain size of the cast strip was very small. This remarkably improved the deformability of the as-cast strip...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{airborne}} {{remote sensing}} applications show a tendency from {{an interpretation of}} single image strips to an evaluation of extended image maps for further usage in data fusion and GIS applications. Most of the problems during the mosaicking process are caused by geometric ortho-rectification errors, radiation variations across the single image strips and between adjacent image strips. The proposed procedure for generating ortho-rectified image maps consists of the following three steps. Within an image strip radiometric normalization is performed using an image-based empirical radiometric correction method, which accounts for sensor viewing angle effects. Individual strips are then ortho-rectified applying the direct georeferencing approach by using the onboard IGI CCNS/AEROcontrol-IIb system for the GPS/IMU integration and a digital elevation model.

40|$|In 2009, {{statistics}} {{showed that}} {{five percent of}} Malaysians has been diagnosed with brain tumours with glioma being the most common type. Radiologist commonly used MRI image sequences to detect glioma clinically by examining the abnormalities on T 1 -Weighted, T 2 -Weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images. However, when the tumour cannot be detected visually, they will inject a contrast agent of gadolinium to enhance the image modality. However, this process delays acquisition of results at a higher cost and imposes side effects to the patients. Therefore, this thesis proposes utilizing spectral texture features of the MRI images in detecting the tumour in all three sequences of Tl, T 2 -Weighted and FLAIR images. There are four phases involved in this research which are data collection, preprocessing (i. e. skull <b>stripping),</b> <b>processing</b> (i. e. texture feature extraction and segmentation) and post-processing (i. e. test and evaluation). For data collection, a total of 126 MRI images of adults ranging from 18 to 60 years old are obtained from Hospital Sungai Buloh and Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang in Selangor. Ninety MRI image sequences of Tl-Weighted, T 2 -Weighted and FLAIR are used for skull-stripping experiments and results showed that mathematical morphology method outperformed region growing at an accuracy rate of 96 %. A new double thresholding algorithm and a fully automated multiple seed points selection algorithm that works on all three MRI image sequences are also proposed. For texture feature extraction, we tested three features that are inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), texture energy and transformed IFFT. Experiments conducted on 64 MRI images, of all sequences showed that texture energy is the best texture feature {{to be used in}} glioma segmentation. Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm is then used to segment texture energy features from 126 MRI brain images of all sequences. Results are then qualitatively evaluated by an expert radiologist and it showed that the glioma brain tumour is been detected. Therefore, texture energy features and Fuzzy C-Means clustering method are identified as promising methods of glioma brain tumour detection at an accuracy rate of 76 %, 86 % and 79 % is detected as an abnormal of Tl- Weighted, T 2 -Weighted and FLAIR images.

Four different chemistries were investigated, starting from a conventional DP 600 chemistry of 0. 06 wt pct C- 1. 9 wt pct Mn- 0. 16 wt pct Mo and subsequently varying Nb and Mo additions. For all investigated steels, ultrafine ferrite (UFF) {{with a grain}} size of 1 to 2 μm can be obtained when a sufficient amount of deformation (e. g., a true strain of 0. 6 or above in axisymmetric compression) is applied to an austenite microstructure with a grain size {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 μm at 25 °C to 50 °C above the austenite-to-ferrite transformation start temperature (Ar 3) characteristic for the given cooling condition.

40|$|Cotton gins have a readily {{available}} supply of biomass {{that is a}} by-product of cotton ginning. A 40 bph - cotton gin <b>processing</b> <b>stripped</b> cotton must manage 2, 600 to 20, 000 tonnes of cotton gin trash (CGT) annually. CGT contains approximately 16. 3 MJ/kg (7000 Btu/lb.). CGT {{has the potential to}} serve as a renewable energy source. Gasification of biomasses such as CGT can offer processing facilities the opportunity to transform their waste biomass into electricity. The gasification of CGT yields 80 % synthesis gas (syngas) and 20 % biochar. The concentration of biochar in the syngas needs to be reduced prior to the direct fueling of an internal combustion engine driving a generator for electricity production. It was estimated that direct fueling of an internal combustion engine with syngas to drive the generator to produce electricity would cost $ 1 M per megawatt (MW). In contrast, a 1 MW system that consists of a boiler and steam turbine would cost $ 2 M/MW. The current provisional patent for the TAMU fluidized bed gasification (FBG) unit uses a 1 D 2 D and 1 D 3 D cyclone for the removal of biochar. A cyclone test stand was designed and constructed to evaluate cyclone capture efficiencies of biochar. A statistical experiment design was used to evaluate cyclone performances for varying concentrations of biochar. A total of 24 tests for the 1 D 2 D and 36 tests for the 1 D 3 D cyclone were conducted at ambient conditions. Average collection efficiency for the 1 D 2 D cyclone was 96. 6 % and 96. 9 % for the 1 D 3 D cyclone. An analysis on the cyclone?s pressure drop was performed to compare the change in pressure drop from air only passing through the cyclone and when the cyclones are loaded with biochar. The average change in pressure drop for the 1 D 2 D cyclone was a decrease of 74 %, and the average change in pressure drop for the 1 D 3 D cyclone was a decrease of 36 %. An economic feasibility study was conducted to determine the price per kWh to produce electricity for a CGT fueled internal combustion engine power plant (ICPP) and a boiler and steam turbine power plant (SPP). The simulated cotton gin is a 40 bph rated facility operating for 2, 000 hours a season (200 % utilization) <b>processing</b> <b>stripped</b> cotton that yields approximately 180 kg/bale (400 lbs/bale) of CGT. Revenues consist of the electricity and natural gas expenses incurred during the ginning season, along with the extra electricity produced and sold back to the utility company at the whole price.

The ICPP has a NPV of $ 1, 480, 000, and the SPP has a NPV of -$ 160, 000, under the base assumptions. The sensitivity analysis resulted in the selling price of electricity as having the largest change on the NPV for both of the power plants. The average predicted purchase price of electricity is $ 0. 10 /kWh for the twenty year simulation.

40|$|SMOS is {{a mission}} of the European Space Agency (ESA) devoted to the {{monitoring}} of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity maps at global scale from L-band space borne radiometric observations. It {{will be the first}} attempt to apply to remote sensing of the Earth surface, the concept of Synthetic Aperture Imaging Radiometers (SAIR), initially developed for radio astronomy. The single payload of the mission is a Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) operating at 1. 415 GHz. Interferometer measurements, also called complex visibilities, are obtained by cross-correlating the signals collected by every pairs of antennae of a Y-shaped interferometric array. They are related to the radiometric brightness temperature of the observed scene by a spatial FOURIER-like integral. A regularized reconstruction process provides a band-limited solution to the corresponding inverse problem where the GIBBS oscillations caused by the truncation of the complex visibilities to the star-shaped frequency coverage are damped with an appropriate windowing function. The reconstructed brightness temperature map is obtained in the reference frame of the antenna. Up to now a single isotropic windowing function has been used in simulating this process; consequently this map exhibits a constant and isotropic angular resolution over the instrument field of view. However, owing to the geometry of the problem, these properties are no longer true for its projection onto the Earth's surface. Since the retrieval of physical quantities implies to combine several measurements for various incidence angles, the variations in shape and size of the weighting function at surface level (the "SMOS pixel") may result in significant errors when the SMOS pixel features strong heterogeneities. It has been suggested that this problem could be solved by the so called "strip adaptive" processing, i. e. using a specific windowing function for every location in the SMOS antenna frame of reference, in order to achieve a close to uniform pixel at surface level. In this paper, taking advantage of the band-limited solution to the reconstruction problem, various windowing functions are used in order to provide maps which exhibit to various extents a constant and isotropic spatial resolution at ground level. This contribution describes the properties of these windowing functions and how the corresponding multi-windows apodization (i. e. <b>strip</b> adaptive <b>processing)</b> is performed. To support the theory and to illustrate the performances of this imaging method, numerical simulations are presented within the frame of the SMOS project.

In 2013 {{it was reported that}} over thirty percent of solid waste in the United States was from packaging. One way to reduce the impact of packaging on the environment is to create a solution that is edible and sourced from a waste or secondary food product that is not currently being utilized. Food-contact packaging made from recycled materials must meet strict U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to be utilized as raw material for packaging. Fruit pomace is a candidate material since it may be cross-linked to increase strength and become the base for a multilayer packaging composite. This proof of concept study was designed to determine the ideal composition of fruit pomace and an effective cross-linking process. A pilot study of seven samples compared two different compositions and assessed a first attempt at cross-linking. Our studies showed that one of the compositions was stronger than the other based on tensile strength. This was true for both stress (MPa) and normalized stress (N). A second cross-linking process based on a patented method did not indicate any improvements in strength. The effect of aging was studied through the apple samples produced with a control procedure across multiple trials.

The distribution studies included the effect of equilibration time, aqueous phase acid concentration variation and T-DGA concentration variation.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Twin roll casting (TRC) offers a promising route for the economic production of Mg sheet, but unfortunately, it produces strip with coarse and non-uniform microstructures and severe centre line segregation. Recently, a novel magnesium strip casting process termed melt conditioned twin roll casting (MC-TRC) was developed that, compared with the conventional TRC process, emphasizes solidification control at the casting stage rather than hot rolling. This was achieved by melt conditioning under intensive forced convection prior to twin roll casting resulting in enhanced heterogeneous nucleation followed by equiaxed growth. In this study the development of TRC and MC-TRC processes and a microstructural comparison of the MC-TRC Mg-alloy strip with that of conventional TRC strip, have been investigated. Emphasis {{has been focused on}} the solidification behaviour of the intensively sheared liquid metal, and on the mechanisms for microstructural refinement and compositional uniformity in the MCTRC process. The results of the process development indicate that the MC-TRC process reduces considerably or eliminates defects such as the centre line segregation, voids and cracks at or near the strip surface that are always present in conventional TRC strip. The newly-designed homogenization treatment investigated for TRC and MC-TRC magnesium alloy strips was based on microstructural evolution obtained during heat treatment. The results of the MC-TRC strips showed a much faster recrystallization rate with finer recrystallized grains, which are due to more homogeneous and a finer grain size of the as-cast MC-TRC strips compared with the as-cast TRC <b>strips.</b> During down-stream <b>processing,</b> the effects of MC-TRC process on microstructural evolution of hot-rolled magnesium strips have been understood thoroughly by accurate control of the hot-rolling procedure during each step of strip thickness reduction.

40|$|Density {{increases}} in caustic-side solvent extraction (CSSX) solvent {{have been observed}} in separate experimental programs performed by different groups of researchers. Such changes indicate a change in chemical composition. Increased density adversely affects separation of solvent from denser aqueous solutions present in the CSSX process. Identification and control of factors affecting solvent density are essential for design and operation of the centrifugal contactors. The goals of this research were to identify the factors affecting solvent density (composition) and to develop correlations between easily measured solvent properties (density and viscosity) and the chemical composition of the solvent, which will permit real-time determination and adjustment of the solvent composition. In evaporation experiments, virgin solvent was subjected to evaporation under quiescent conditions at 25, 35, and 45 C with continuously flowing dry air passing {{over the surface of}} the solvent. Density and viscosity were measured periodically, and chemical analysis was performed on the solvent samples. Chemical interaction tests were completed to determine if any chemical reaction takes place over extended contact time that changes the composition and/or physical properties. Solvent and simulant, solvent and strip solution, and solvent and wash solution were contacted continuously in agitated flasks. They were periodically sampled and the density measured (viscosity was also measured on some samples) and then submitted to the Chemical Sciences Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the virgin solvent as the baseline. Chemical interaction tests showed that solvent densities and viscosities did not change appreciably during contact with simulant, strip, or wash solution. No effects on density and viscosity and no chemical changes in the solvent were noted within experimental limits. Evaporation test results showed that all solvents were evaporated to densities of greater than 0. 90 g/cm{sup 3 }. Viscosities increased from 3. 5 to > 6. 5 cP as the densities increased. NMR and HPLC data indicate that diluent loss is the primary reason for density increase and that the ratio of BOBCalixC 6 (referred to as calix) to Cs- 7 SB remained almost constant. Density and viscosity vary linearly with the loss of diluent and the increase in Cs- 7 SB concentration. Solvent viscosity and density are both sensitive indicators of the loss of diluent, especially when such loss is greater than 10 %. However, density is more reliable at low values for diluent loss. The ratio of Cs- 7 SB to calix appears relatively constant during evaporation to losses of more than 50 % of the diluent. A simple density model accurately predicts the composition of the solvent when density is known. Density and viscosity increases can affect the throughput in the centrifugal contactors and, at the extreme, can cause complete loss of flow. The distribution coefficient can also increase, especially in the strip stage, causing the loss of the ability to strip extracted cesium from the solvent. These effects can be addressed by internal changes to the contactor and by adding additional <b>stripping</b> stages in <b>processing.</b> However, these changes are extremely difficult under remote operation and maintenance restrictions...|$|R

From both former trials and the trials done during this project it is seen that a build-up of oxide leaves imprints with a depth of 20 to 150 µm. In order to confirm that the imprints can indeed be produced by loose oxides, two experiments were conducted. Loose oxide particles and bearing balls have been pressed into the steel surface with the result in both cases of imprints that can be compared to the ones obtained in the factory. In this work a new procedure has been developed to test the growth of the oxide layer as well as its adhesion to the steel surface. 1. To grow an oxide layer the Thermo Mechanical Testing Simulator is used. This device is normally used to test hot deformability of metals but its heating chamber can also simulating the run out table two step cooling cycle. Both cooling rates are varied between 30, 60 and 90 K=s keeping initial, intermediate and final temperatures equal to the factory values. 2. To test the adhesion of the oxide to the steel a tensile test is performed with the aid of the ARAMIS optical strain measuring system. Since the ARAMIS system follows optically the changes in the steel surface during straining the oxide layer is usually previously removed, because it will break first and interfere with the measurement. However this fact is used here to our advantage since the strain that is necessary to remove the layer can now be quantified. This loss in measurement data corresponds well to the initial loss of oxide from the sample. From the ARAMIS data it is seen that increasing the cooling rate of the first cooling step decreases the amount of strain required to break the oxide from the steel. The second cooling step does not have a pronounced effect on the adhesiveness. The microscopy analysis showed an unknown oxide layer at the steel/oxide interface. This layer is mainly iron oxide but contains an unusual amount of chromium. It is presently not known how the chromium is distributed in the oxide nor what its effects on the properties of the scale are. It is concluded that the imprints are caused by a build-up of loose oxide on the work rolls. The imprints can be prevented by not using the levelling and scale breaker work rolls. The adhesiveness of the oxide to the steel under deformation can be improved by reducing the cooling rate on the first cooling step. Using the Thermo Mechanical Test Simulator a controlled layer of oxide can be grown on steel samples. The adhesiveness of the oxide layer can then be tested by means of a tensile test while being recorded by ARAMIS. This set-up can be further improved to obtain a standardised oxide adherence testing method. Aerospace EngineeringAerospace Structures and Material...|$|R

(Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. 1. 1 Background: Acid {{mine water}} {{containing}} sulphate and {{high concentrations of}} dissolved heavy metals, including iron(II), can have pH values as low as 2. 5. Environmental pollution caused by such effluents are major contributors to the salinisation of receiving water, and may prove toxic to both fauna and flora. Acid, sulphate-rich solutions are produced bacteriologically from pyrite present in waste dumps from mining and metallurgical operations and from spent sulphuric acid used in chemical or metallurgical plants. The following large mine water treatment projects are currently receiving attention in South Africa on a national level: 1. Amanzi Water Project. The Amanzi project deals with the treatment of mine water (potentially 240 Ml/d) for the recovery of potable water and by-products (e. g. gypsum). Participating mines in the project are Randfontein Estates, First Wesgold, Durban Roodepoort Deep, Rand Leases, ERPM and Grootvlei. The pH of these waters varies fiom 2. 8 to 6. 0 and the sulphate concentrations h m 600 to 3 000 mg/l (SWaMP Steering Committee, 1998). 2. Olifants Forum. Polluted mine water, estimated at a volume of 130 Ml/d, is currently discharged to water courses on the Highveld. The mine water has a pH level between 2 and 4 and contains high sulphate concentrations (> 700 mg/l) (Van Zyl, et al., 2000). Unless neutralized, such water may not be discharged into water courses. Lime is generally used for neutralization. Neutralization costs could be reduced significantly should lime be replaced with limestone. The cost of limestone is currently R 130 /t compared to R 700 /t for lime. Furthermore, increasing pressure is being exerted by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to enforce sulphate removal from effluent. Extensive studies have already been {{carried out by the}} mining industry to evaluate possible sulphate removal technologies. The high cost of these technologies are considered a major obstacle. Therefore, efforts to develop a cost-effective treatment process for the recovery of re-usable water from sulphate-rich effluents, is of national importance. 1. 2 Objectives: The objectives of this investigation were to develop processes whereby acid and/or sulphate-rich water can be treated. The specific aims of the investigation were to: 1. Develop the integrated iron(II) -oxidation and limestone neutralization process where powdered limestone is used for the neutralization of iron(II) -rich acid water in a completely-mixed reactor (Chapters 3 and 4 and Patents 1 - 3). 2. Develop the biological sulphate removal process for treatment of sulphate-rich effluents (Chapters 5 and 6). 3. Develop the barium sulphide process for treatment of sulphate-rich effluents (Chapter 7). 4. Develop a water flow and chemical mass balance model to identify the most cost-effective treatment option for a water network (Chapter 8). 1. 3 Findings: The following innovative processes/models were developed for neutralization and sulphate removal from industrial effluents: 1. A limestone handling and dosing system. 2. A limestone neutralization and iron(II) -oxidation process for the removal of free acid, iron and aluminium. 3. A biological sulphate removal stage which includes biological sulphate reduction, H 2 S-stripping and aerobic treatment for the removal of residual organic material, and calcium carbonate precipitation. The barium process, which is similar to the biological sulphate removal process, can also be used for sulphate removal. 4. Modelling of a typical water network of a mining operation. 1. 3. 1 Limestone neutralization: In order to develop the limestone neutralization technology to the stage of full-scale implementation it was necessary to understand its limitations, study its kinetics, develop design criteria for full-scale plants and to protect the intellectual property through patents. 1. 3. 1. 1 The limestone neutralization process. Limestone was not used previously on a large scale for neutralization of iron(II) -rich acid water. The reasons were: 1. The pH of iron(II) -rich water could not be raised sufficiently with limestone to rapidly allow iron(II) to be oxidized to iron(II). Rapid oxidation of iron(II) occurs only at pH 7 and higher. This can however be achieved with lime, while limestone only raises the pH of iron(II) -rich water to pH 6. 2. The reactivity of limestone is too low to neutralize acid water completely within an acceptably short residence time when stoichiometric dosages are applied. 3. Iron(II) passivates limestone particles due to Fe(OH) 3 preferentially precipitating {{on the surface of the}} limestone particles, where the pH is the highest. 1. 3. 1. 2 Kinetics of limestone neutralization. Stumm and Lee (1961) investigated the rate equation for biological iron(II) -oxidation and determined that it is a function of the pH, iron(II) and oxygen concentrations. This rate equation was investigated for the case where limestone was used as the neutralization agent. Special attention was given to the effect of suspended solids concentration on the rate of iron(II) - oxidation. 1. 3. 1. 3 Full-scale implementation of limestone neutralization For the present investigation a demonstration plant was constructed and evaluated for iron(II) - Oxidation/limestone neutralization (Maree, et al., 2004). A plant with a capacity of 1 Ml/d was constructed at BCL, a nickel and copper mine in Botswana. Ore tailings leachate, with an acid concentration of 10 g/l (as CaC 03), was treated. Limestone, available at a cost of R 150 /t, was used for neutralization of the acid water. Previously, leachate with a high acid concentration was combined with less acidic streams before it was neutralized with lime. The result of this approach was that a large volume of product water was slightly over-saturated with respect to gypsum, resulting in scaling of pipelines and other equipment. The leachate was neutralized separately from the less acidic streams. The over-saturated fraction was first allowed to crystallize from solution in the fluidized-bed reactor before being combined with the other streams. The following patents were registered, following the investigation: 1. A patent on the integrated limestone and iron(II) -oxidation process. 2. A patent for a limestone handling and dosing system was registered where powdered precipitated CaC 03 was dumped onto a concrete slab, slurried to constant density with an automatic control, and used for neutralization of the acid water. 3. A patent on an integrated limestone and lime process for the treatment of acid and sulphate-rich effluents. This allows the following: - Stage 1 : The bulk of the acid is neutralized with limestone while C 02 is produced and stripped off by aeration. - Stage 2 : Lime is added to allow precipitation of magnesium and other metals as well as sulphate associated with these metals. - Stage 3 : The C 02 that is produced in Stage 1 is used to adjust the high pH of the water from Stage 2 to 8. 3. This allows CaC 03 precipitation. 1. 3. 2 Biological sulphate removal A biological process was developed whereby sulphate reduction to sulphide and sulphide oxidation to elemental sulphur occur in the same reactor. The following aspects were investigated: the reaction rate of biological sulphate reduction, the effect of various parameters on the reaction rate such as temperature, sulphide and sulphate concentrations and the identification of intermediate products formed. Pilot scale evaluation of the following stages of the biological sulphate removal process were evaluated: 1. Heating stage. Feed water to the anaerobic stage was first contacted directly with hot coal gas to raise the temperature of the water to 30 °C. 2. Anaerobic stage. A pilot plant with a capacity of 8 m³/h was operated, using ethanol or sugar as energy source. H 2 S-stripping and processing stage. A laboratory unit was operated to evaluate the suitability of the following reactor types for H 2 S-stripping and processing: Venturi device and a packed-bed reactor. 1. 3. 3 Integrated Bas process for sulphate removal Laboratory studies were carried out to demonstrate that the integrated Bas-process is technically and economically viable for sulphate removal. The Bas process consists of the following stages: 1. Thermal stage where barium sulphate is reduced to barium sulphide at 1 050 °C, using coal as the reductant. 2. Sulphate removal stage 3. Sulphide <b>stripping</b> and <b>processing</b> stage 4. Softening stage where limestone is precipitated. 1. 3. 4 Modeling The water network of a coal mine was audited and simulated by an interactive, steady state model to determine the optimum effluent treatment process configuration. The findings from this investigation were used to optimize the mine's water management strategy. Simulation of the interactions in the water network was used to show the following: (i) Powdered CaC 03 can be used as an alternative to lime for the neutralization of acid water at a cost saving. (ii) The amount of gypsum crystallization that occurred in the primary neutralization and coal processing plants. This information was needed to plan for sludge disposal. (iii) The benefits associated with separate treatment of the most polluted stream versus combined treatment of all streams during mine water treatment. By treating the higher polluted streams separate from the lesser polluted streams, higher salt removal efficiencies are achieved. (iv) The OSI (gypsum oversaturation index) value can be controlled effectively at 1 by treating the feed water to the coal processing, for sulphate removal. The capacity of the sulphate removal plant required was determined as well as the associated capital and running costs. 1. 4 Benefits The treatment approach outlined offers the following benefits: (i) The cheapest alkali, a by-product from the paper industry, can be used for neutralization of the acid and for the removal of the bulk of the sulphate concentration through gypsum crystallization. The more advanced biological process is then used only for removal of the remaining sulphate, to low concentrations. (ii) A robust biological process is used for sulphate removal to produce process water which is non-scaling and suitable for discharge into public streams. (iii) This is an integrated process as CO 2 produced during limestone-neutralization is used for H 2 S-stripping in the biological stage. The stripped H 2 S-gas is utilized in the limestone-neutralization stage for precipitation of iron as iron sulphide. Iron is also removed as inert Fe(OH) 3 together with gypsum in the limestone neutralization stage, after oxidation. Doctora...|$|R
