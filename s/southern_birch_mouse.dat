50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> is pronouncedly a steppe dweller. It makes a {{subterranean}} burrow in {{the summer}} and hibernates. It eats green plants and insects.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{characteristic of the}} <b>southern</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> is the dark stripe {{down the center of}} the back, which is bordered by two narrow bright stripes on both sides. From head to rump it measures from 56 to 72 mm, with a tail from 110 to 130% of the main body length. The background fur color is gray-brown.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> (Sicista subtilis) is {{a species}} of birch mouse in the family Dipodidae. It is found on the Balkan Peninsula, Ukraine, Romania, southern Russia and one isolated location in Hungary in the Borsodi Mezőség Protected Landscape Area. The Hungarian subspecies (S. subtilis trizona) is critically endangered and strictly protected. The first living specimen was captured after a 70-year-long hiatus in 2006.|$|E

50|$|The Caucasian <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> (Sicista caucasica) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Dipodidae, that is endemic to Russia.

50|$|The Tien Shan {{birch mouse}} grows to {{a length of}} about 70 mm with a tail length of about {{one and a half}} times its body length. The dorsal fur is a uniform yellowish-grey and there is no {{vertebral}} stripe as there is in the long-tailed birch mouse (Sicista caudata). The flanks are straw-coloured, the chin and throat are white and the underparts whitish-grey tinged with buff. The back of the skull is longer than that of the <b>southern</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> (Sicista subtilis).|$|E
5000|$|The {{main values}} of the {{preserve}} are ecosystems of forb-fescue-feather grass and fescue-feather grass, typical of virgin and secondary steppe. Here, Stipa capillata, Stipa lessingiana and rarely other feather grass species dominate. Among animals which occur here, over 40 species {{are listed in the}} Red Book of Ukraine. The steppe plays an important role for the preservation of many rare species of steppe birds. Also, the territory is important for the <b>southern</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse.</b> Its population in [...] "Tarutyns'kyj steppe" [...] landscape preserve {{is one of the last}} population which has been preserved in Ukraine.|$|E
5000|$|The area is {{characterized}} by meadow steppe, and predominantly pine (Pinus Sylvestris) forests with birch and aspen. Common shrubs are juniper, rose hips, hawthorne, and willow. Much of the steppe area has been affected by past plowing and grazing. Scientists have recorded 597 species of vascular plants, 36 of which are relic boreal species reflecting forest island nature of the area. [...] The park {{is well known for}} fish in its various lakes, commonly pike, roach, and carp. 363 species of vertebrates are known in the park: 224 birds, 51 mammals, 5 reptiles, 1 amphibian, and 19 species of fish. Almost half of the mammal species are rodents, with representatives from the steppes, desert and forest, such as the <b>southern</b> <b>birch</b> <b>mouse,</b> the steppe lemming, and the Jungar hamster. The presence of large numbers of rodents attracts predators, including fox, wolf, badger, stoats and weasels. Larger mammals include wild boar, elk, and a significant population of Siberian Roe Deer.|$|E

50|$|The {{ecology of}} the long-tailed <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> is little known. It hibernates {{for at least six}} months during the winter. It builds its nest, made of a woven ball of grass, in crevices or in bushes. Litters usually consist of four to six young.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{immersion}} freezing behavior of birch pollen, i. e. its ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules, was investigated at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). For that, washing water {{of two different}} birch pollen samples with different regional origin (Northern <b>birch</b> and <b>Southern</b> <b>birch)</b> were used. The immersion freezing of droplets generated from the pollen washing water was already observed at temperatures higher than &minus; 20 &deg;C, for both samples. Main differences between the Northern birch pollen and the <b>Southern</b> <b>birch</b> pollen were obvious in a temperature range, between &minus; 18 &deg;C and &minus; 24 &deg;C, where the ice fraction increased with decreasing temperature. There, the Northern birch pollen washing water featured two different slopes, with one being steeper and one being similar to {{the slope of the}} <b>Southern</b> <b>birch</b> pollen washing water. As we assume single INA macromolecules being the reason for the ice nucleation, we concluded that the Northern birch pollen are able to produce at least two different types of INA macromolecules. We were able to determine the heterogeneous nucleation rates for both INA macromolecule types and so could explain the ice nucleation behavior of both, the Southern and the Northern birch pollen washing water...|$|R

40|$|Up to now, the {{importance}} of pollen for atmospheric ice nucleation {{was considered to be}} minor, as they are too large to stay in the atmosphere for a long time. But as recent investigations have shown, not the pollen grains themselves are responsible for freezing, but easily suspendable macromolecules on their surfaces (Pummer et al., 2012). Due to the bursting of pollen grains these ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules could be numerous in the atmosphere. In the present study, the immersion freezing behavior of birch pollen, i. e. its ice nucleating active (INA) macro-molecules, was investigated at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS, Hartmann et al., 2011). For this, washing water of two different birch pollen samples with different origin (Northern <b>birch</b> and <b>Southern</b> <b>birch)</b> were used. Immersion freezing of droplets generated from the pollen washing water was observed at temperatures higher than- 20 ◦C for both samples. The main difference between the Northern and the <b>Southern</b> <b>birch</b> pollen was the temperature dependence of the immersion freezing process. Our results suggest that the ice nucleating potential of the <b>Southern</b> <b>birch</b> is controlled by a single type of INA macromolecule, while the Northern birch pollen seem to feature two distinctively different types of INA macromolecules. We determined the heterogeneous nucleation rates for both INA macromolecule types and thereby consistentl...|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> {{is largely}} herbivorous and feeds on buds, shoots, grass seeds and berries, {{but it also}} takes earthworms, insects and snails, often finding these under loose bark. It is a skilful climber and often clambers around in trees and shrubs, gripping the twigs and branches with its five-toed feet and using its prehensile tail for additional support.|$|R
5000|$|The long-tailed <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> {{has a wide}} range, {{at least}} some of which is in {{protected}} areas.

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>birch</b> <b>mouse</b> {{occurs in}} Scandinavia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Northern Asia.

There are isolated populations in Norway and Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Austria. Its natural habitat is coniferous forests, mixed deciduous woodland, marshy woodland and damp bushy grassland and it is sometimes found in cereal crops.|$|R
50|$|The seventh {{volume is}} devoted to the nine {{families}} of mouse-like rodents (Myomorpha), including the true <b>mice,</b> rats, <b>birch</b> <b>mice,</b> tree mice, jerboas, hamsters, and voles. In contrast to other systematics (e.g. Wilson/Reeder: Mammal Species of the World, 2005) the family Dipodidae was split into Dipodidae, Zapodidae and Sminthidae, a new name proposed for the former subfamily Sicistinae. The 62 colour plates are created by Toni Llobet. It covers the details to the taxonomy, range, habitat, reproduction, behaviour, and conservation status of 1,749 species from 345 genera and 9 families in one suborder. It includes a special chapter entitled Priorities for Conserving the World’s Rodents. Edited by Don E. Wilson, Thomas E. Lacher Jr, and Russell A. Mittermeier.|$|R
