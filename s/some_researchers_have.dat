5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. <b>Some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E

Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E

5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E
5|$|The three sonatas are {{cyclically}} interconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> {{hypothesized}} that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E
5|$|In South America, C.dirus {{specimens}} {{dated to}} the Late Pleistocene were found {{along the north}} and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an area that was inhabited by Canisgezi and Canis nehringi. One study found that C.dirus was the most evolutionarily derived Canis species in the New World, and compared to C.nehringi was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. For this reason, <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> proposed that C.dirus may have originated in South America. In 2009 a proposal was made that C.armbrusteri was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves. The following year, a study yielded evidence that led to the conclusion that C.dirus and C.nehringi were the same species and thus that C.dirus had migrated from North America into South America, making it a late participant in the Great American Interchange.|$|E
5|$|Now {{recognised}} as {{a member}} of the family Spinosauridae, Baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Apart from the type species (B. walkeri), <b>some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that Suchomimus tenerensis belongs in the same genus and that Suchosaurus cultridens is a senior synonym; subsequent authors have kept them separate. Baryonyx was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile Iguanodon. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx lived near water bodies, in areas where other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs have also been found.|$|E

5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes {{into and out of the}} Bering Sea. Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. <b>Some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. <b>Some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> argued that Smilodons brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E
5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. <b>Some</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E
