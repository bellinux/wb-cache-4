40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for the two-dimensional scanning of a surface {{by means of a}} light beam and a mirror (4) rotatable about two axes perpendicular to each other. One axis is an optical axis (A-A) along which a light beam emitted by a light source runs. The rotating movements of the mirror (4) are caused by two drive motors (1, 2), whereby the rotating movement of the mirror is transferred onto the optical axis (A-A) perpendicular to the <b>standing</b> <b>axis</b> (B-B) via a differential gear (5). The differential gear (5) has two intermeshing gear wheels (10, 11). The mirror (4) is arranged in a mirror holder (3) connected to a hollow shaft rotatable about the axis (B-B). One gear wheel (11) of the differential gear (5) is attached to the mirror (4) and the other gear wheel (10) is connected to the drive shaft (12) of the second drive motor (11). The gear wheel (10) intermeshes with the gear wheel (11) arranged on the mirror...|$|E
40|$|Almost all {{subsurface}} rocks used as {{foundations for}} {{various types of}} structures are stratified. Such heterogeneity may cause specific behaviour of the materials under strain. Differential equations describing the behaviour of such materials contain rapidly fluctuating coefficients, in view of this, solution of such equations is more time-consuming when using todayâ€™s computers. The method of asymptotic averaging leads to getting homogeneous medium under study to averaged equations with fixed factors. The present article is concerned with stratified soil mass consisting of pair-wise alternative isotropic elastic layers. In the results of elastic modules averaging, the present soil mass with horizontal rock stratification is simulated by homogeneous transversal-isotropic half-space with isotropy plane perpendicular to the <b>standing</b> <b>axis.</b> Half-space is loosened by a vertical alveole of circular cross-section, and virgin ground is under its own weight. For horizontal parting planes of layers, the following two types of surface conditions are set: ideal contact and backlash without cleavage. For homogeneous transversal-isotropic half-space received with a vertical alveole, the analytical solution of S. G. Lekhnitsky, well known in scientific papers, is used. The author gives expressions for stress components and displacements in soil mass for different marginal conditions on the alveole surface. Such research problems arise when constructing and maintaining buildings and when composite materials are used...|$|E

40|$|Some arthritic {{knees with}} varus {{deformity}} show excessive valgus angulation of the femoraijoint surface with proximal tibia vara. This causes a downward and medial inclination of the articular surfaces in the coronal plane. The patients we studied had a medial {{shift of the}} <b>standing</b> load-bearing <b>axis,</b> and arthritic changes mainly in the medial compartment. Some also had lateral tibial subluxation with twisting of the distal femur and proximal tibia in opposite directions. We assessed the articular geometry by precise radiographic analysis, and compared the results with those in normal volunteers {{and a group of}} osteoarthritic patients. The prevalence of this type of deformity in our osteoarthritic patients was 1 1. 5 %; its recognition allows the use of specific operative correction that may include double osteotomy or the precise orientation of prosthetic components. Stability of the knee depends upon long-bone alignment, articular surface geometry and the resistance to subluxa-tion provided by ligamentous and capsular structures. Instability may predispose to osteoarthritis (Cooke and Pichora 1985). Most authors agree that the ideal leg alignment when standing provides a load-bearing axi...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present work is {{dedicated}} to the free-surface oscillation of lateral cavities, i. e. horizontal cavities with free surface connected along one of their sides to a steady main flow. This oscillation phenomenon, named seiching, is studied experimentally, first for a square cavity and then for a rectangular one. Water surface oscillations are recorded and, for the square cavity, two standing waves of perpendicular axes appear to co-exist and are reconstructed individually using usual signal processing tools. Moreover, the corresponding oscillation frequencies appear to be well correlated with the peak frequencies of the velocity spectrum in the mixing layer. Finally, for the rectangular cavity, the <b>standing</b> wave of <b>axis</b> perpendicular to the mainstream axis disappears and an additional standing wave of streamwise axis appears...|$|R

40|$|Polyacetylene is a {{well-known}} conductive polymer and when doped its conductivity can be altered by up to 12 orders of magnitude. However, due to entropy effects a polyacetylene chain usually suffers from distortions and interchain couplings which lead to unpredictable changes in its conducting property. Encapsulating a polyacetylene chain into a carbon nanotube can resolve these issues. Furthermore, since the carbon nanotube itself possesses excellent electrical conductivity, {{the combination of the}} carbon nanotube and polyacetylene may give rise to a new material with superior transport behavior. In this paper, we model mathematically the molecular interaction between an acetylene molecule and a carbon nanotube in order to determine conditions at which configurations of the acetylene molecule are accepted into the carbon nanotube as well as its equilibrium configurations inside various sizes of carbon nanotubes. For special cases of the acetylene molecule lying on the tube <b>axis,</b> <b>standing</b> vertically with its center on the tube axis and staying far inside the tube, explicit analytical expressions for the interaction energy are obtained...|$|R

60|$|The boy waited patiently, {{listening}} {{with his}} ear to the ground, like an Indian, for the last rustle of fern and crackle of underbrush, and then emerged, stiff and cramped from his concealment. But he no longer thought of flight; curiosity and ambition burned in his small veins. He quickly climbed up the outcrop, picked up the fallen stone, {{and in spite of}} its weight lifted it to the prostrate tree. Here he paused, and from his coign of vantage looked and listened. The solitude was profound. Then mounting the tree and <b>standing</b> over its <b>axis</b> he tried to rock it as the others had. Alas! Johnny's heart was stout, his courage unlimited, his perception all-embracing, his ambition boundless; but his actual avoirdupois was only that of a boy of ten. The tree did not move. But Johnny had played see-saw before, and quietly moved towards its highest part. It slowly descended under the changed centre of gravity, and the root arose, disclosing the opening as before. Yet here the little hero paused. He waited with his eyes fixed on the opening, ready to fly on the sallying out of any one who had remained concealed. He then placed the stone where he had stood, leaped down, and ran to the opening.|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of bone cuts and the resultant alignment, using theMyKnee patient specific cutting blocks. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 132 patients undergoing primary TKR for osteoarthritis by one single surgeon. The operative time, the preoperative Hip-Knee-Ankle (HKA) axis based on the CT-scan, the postoperative HKA axisbased on long <b>axis</b> <b>standing</b> x-rays, the planned and the actual size of the femoral and the tibial components, and thenumber of the recuts which has been made intraoperative were measured. Results: The average preoperative HKA axis was 177. 50 (range 163. 50 to 1940), whereas the average postoperativeHKA axis was 179. 40 (range 177. 10 to 182. 70). No outliers were reported in the study (0 %). Intraoperatively, 4 femoralcomponents (3. 03 %), and 7 tibial components (5. 30 %) applied to the patients were different than the planned size. There was no need of recuts in any of our cases intraoperatively. Conclusion: The MyKnee system evaluated in this study was shown to be remarkable reliable in the coronal planealignment, and the prediction of the component size. However, further studies are needed to determine whether thereare any clinically important improvements in outcomes or patient satisfaction when using patient-specific cutting blocksfor TKA...|$|R

40|$|The {{stock market}} balance can be {{presented}} {{as a result of}} mutual effect of the supply and demand on the market. This creates high-frequency dynamics of prices for shares, what in turn leads to the appearance of the three-dimensional rotary trajectories of the market. The 3 -D space is a Cartesian product: prices, volumes, and time. In this space whirling vectors form rotary-spiral trajectories and, they in turn, determine in the appropriate time periods side surfaces of solids of revolution, which rotate as well. Perpendicular projections of rotary trajectories on planes with <b>standing</b> out time <b>axis</b> cause that economic rotary phenomena are depicted on the mentioned planes by means of flat zigzags. Double rotating of economic vectors resembles precession movement. This is the precession movement which guarantees oscillating-rotating vectors around the hypothetical line of economic balance. Economic vectors are always set in rotary motion mainly by stimulating the vectors of demand and supply. Dynamically changing volumes of the mentioned forces cause that permanent state of economic balance practically do not exist in market reality. In the modified by the authors cobwebbed model states of fragile balance are explained by means of precession and accompanying it nutation. The rotary movement occurs universally in our world. The effects of vortexes from the world of nature are extremely quickly reflected in changing in chaotic way forces of demand and supply which in turn are the main generators of economic vortexes. Then the relationship is unambiguous and can be expressed by a short general statement claiming that vortexes generate vortexe...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is the 6 th {{leading cause}} of Years Lost to Disability (YLD) at global level, {{accounting}} for 3 % of total global YLDs. Knee OA {{is the most common}} joint disorder, and in the Netherlands approximately 17 % of the population aged 45 years and over suffer from knee OA. It causes considerable pain and immobility, affects independence and psychosocial functioning, and in addition leads to financial losses. Many patients present with unicompartmental disease, and the medial compartment is almost 10 times more frequently involved than the lateral compartment. This thesis investigates both the non-operative and surgical treatment outcomes in active patients with symptomatic medial OA of the knee. The aim is to clarify indications for identified treatment modalities as controversy exists on how patient and/or intervention related factors affect the outcome of this disease. Furthermore, clearer indications will lead to better care, which may not only benefit the individual patient but also society as a whole because of expected savings in health care expenses and reduction of productivity losses. Patients with OA of the medial compartment often have varus malalignment; the mechanical axis and load bearing passes through the medial compartment. Some report that malalignment may even {{have an impact on the}} development and progression of knee OA. Although many consider whole leg radiographs in <b>standing</b> position (mechanical <b>axis</b> measurement) as the gold standard to determine knee alignment, in clinical practice, knee alignment is often assessed on shorter anterior-posterior knee radiographs (anatomic axis measurement) to cut expenses and cumbersome procedures. Significant correlation between mechanical and anatomic axis angles has been reported. Some suggest using anatomic axis measurement in research and clinical settings. In Chapter 2 we compare two different methods of anatomic axis assessment in a group of patients with known mechanical varus alignment, and determine whether or not anatomic axis measurement on standard short knee views can be used in clinical settings...|$|R
2500|$|A {{research}} by Patrice Foutakis {{tried to bring}} evidence on whether the ancient Greeks employed in their architecture the golden ratio, equal to the irrational number 1.61803..... For this purpose, the measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi and 58 grave stelae were examined, going from the fifth century BC until the second century AD. The result of this research {{points out that the}} golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the fifth century BC, and almost absent for the following six centuries. [...] Four rare examples of golden-section proportions were identified through this research in a tower, a tomb, a grave stele and in the Great Altar of Pergamon. On the two frontal parts of the frieze facing the observer {{standing in front of the}} monument, the height to length ratio is 2.29 m. to 5.17 m., that is 1:2.25, the ratio of the Parthenon. The city of Pergamon was on excellent terms with Athens, its kings venerated Attic art and offered gifts to the Parthenon, and both cities had the same goddess, Athena, as a protector. The temple of Athena Polias Nikephoros in Pergamon, a few meters away from the Great Altar, also had a copy of the chryselephantine statue of Athena made by Phidias for the Parthenon. The two columned constructions flanking the frontal staircase of the Great Altar have the shape of two Ionic temples. The proportions of each of these temples are: width of the stylobate 4.722 m. to length of the stylobate 7.66 m., ratio 1:1.62. Height with the entablature 2.93 m. to width of the stylobate 4.722 m., ratio 1:1.61. When the visitor came up to the top of the staircase and went through the portikon columns, he entered an interior court measuring, within the colonnade surrounding the court, 13.50 m. wide by 21.60 m. long, ratio 1:1.60. In other words, according to P.Foutakis, the artists of this Altar wanted the spectator <b>standing</b> on the <b>axis</b> in front of the staircase to see two Ionic temples following the golden ratio, and, coming through these temples, to enter a courtyard proportioned to the golden ratio. The well-known political and cultural antagonism between Pergamon and Alexandria, the city where Euclid was active and defined his geometrical proposition of the extreme and mean ratio, could have contributed to the rapid spread of this proposition to Pergamon, a city already open to new achievements in science, sculpture, architecture and politics.|$|R
