40|$|Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) is an {{established}} technique for {{the determination of}} the surface energy heterogeneity of various types of materials, including particulate and fibrous materials. However, variability in sample and column preparation may lead to low reproducibility of data. In this work, the influence of two aspects of chromatographic column preparation; the amount of <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> wool and the packing structure of mixtures of particulate materials, on IGC measurements were investigated using a combined experimental and modelling approach. In silico experiments were used to examine these factors for a range of materials with different surface energy. We report here, that the packing structure of particulate materials in the column does not significantly affect the measurements and the results. However, the contribution of the <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> wool needs to be corrected, particularly for materials of low surface area or low surface energy. This work demonstrates the importance of column preparation and the need for standardisation of packing protocols for robust experimental determination of surface energy heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|Spectra {{of single}} {{molecules}} of different rhodamine dyes deposited on a glass surface {{and on a}} methyl-terminated <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> surface were recorded by means of confocal fluorescence microscopy. The observation of an emission, blue shifted {{in comparison to the}} solution spectrum of these rhodamine dyes, is reported. It is suggested that this shorter wavelength emission is related to the contact ion pair formation of the single rhodamine dye molecule. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|International audienceA {{simple method}} {{combining}} magnetic field and microparticles {{has been designed}} for assembling, locating and grafting permanent microfilaments onto a <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> surface. Filaments orthogonal to a glass support are implemented by assembling magnetic carboxylatex particles under magnetic field. They exhibit an aspect ratio up to 14. Carboxyl moieties on beads and <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> are activated using the carbodiimide method. A further reaction with long chain diamines allows the formation of permanent filaments covalently anchored onto the glass support. Grafted microfilaments can withstand intense washing with detergent solutions under ultrasound. 500 mm diameter filament spots are formed using ferromagnetic tips connected to an electromagnet. After their formation, filaments can be actuated by an external magnetic field: their orientation is tunable in real time within a 2 pi solid angle. Filaments can be biofunctionalised in order to perform biomolecular recognition on the support. We show that nucleic acid probes immobilised onto these filaments hybridize with labelled oligonucleotide targets. Due to an increase of the specific surface, the fluorescence signal of targets is 3 -fold higher with filaments than with a planar glass support biofunctionalised with the same oligonucleotides. Our methodology thus provides {{an easy way to}} create filaments usable for both actuation and biodetection onto a planar support. We expect our strategy to be compatible with the formation of nanofilaments using nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Light curable dimethacrylate resin {{composites}} undergo {{free radical}} photopolymerisation {{in response to}} blue light (wavelength 450 - 500 nm) and may offer superior handling and setting characteristics for novel hard tissue repair materials. The current investigation aims to determine the optimum formulation of bisphenol-A glycidyl methacrylate and triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (bisGMA/TEGDMA) or urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) /TEGDMA resin mixtures {{and the effect of}} Bioglass incorporation on the rate of polymerisation (RP), degree of conversion (DC) and flexural strength (FS) of light-curable filled resin composites (FRCs). Experimental photoactive resins containing a range of bisGMA, UDMA and TEGDMA ratios and/or filled with non-silanised irregular or spherical 45 S 5 -Bioglass (50 μm; 5 - 40 wt%) and/or <b>silanised</b> silicate <b>glass</b> filler particulates (0. 7 μm; 50 - 70 wt%) were tested. RP and DC were analysed in real-time using nearinfrared spectroscopy. FS of resins and FRCs were determined using three-point flexural strength tests. UDMA/TEGDMA resins exhibited increased DC compared with bisGMA/TEGDMA resins (p 0. 05), whereas they increased DC of UDMA/TEGDMA resins (p< 0. 05). Addition of irregular shaped Bioglass particles increased the FS of UDMA/TEGDMA resins up to 20 wt% Bioglass (p< 0. 05). The flexibility and strength conferred by the urethane group in UDMA may result in enhanced physical and mechanical properties compared with conventional resins containing bulky (bisGMA) molecules. Addition of 45 S 5 -Bioglass with specific filler content, size and morphology resulted in enhanced mechanical and physical properties of UDMA/TEGDMA composites...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{microfabrication}} {{techniques were}} widely utilised for the spatial control of in vitro cell behaviour. A photo-immobilisation procedure was utilised to create micropatterned surfaces: four different stripe patterns (100, 50, 25 and 10 mm) of hyaluronan (Hyal) and its sulphated derivative (HyalS) on <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> substrate were obtained. The morphological {{analysis showed that}} the surface topography showed regular stripes of 100, 50, 25 and 10 mm wide and ranging from 300 nm up to 1 mm in thickness. They reproduced the exact photo-mask pattern: glass stripes alternating with polysaccharide ones. On the contrary, Hyal microstructures showed just a topographic pattern as the glass stripes appeared to be covered by {{a thin layer of}} the macromolecule by TOF-SIMS. Cell adhesion studies demonstrated that melanocytes adhered and oriented within the first 2 h of culture on HyalS microdomains and not on Hyal microstructures where they spread on glass substrate around the patterned area. Double photo-immobilised samples characterised by a 100 mm stripe pattern of Hyal or HyalS {{on the top of a}} continuous layer of the two polysaccharides were also created in order to investigate the effect of the topography on cell behaviour. The obtained results demonstrated that melanocytes adhered on HyalS stripes while on the Hyal micropatterned surfaces they spread on <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> substrate around the structured area, resulting in the exclusion of the topographic pattern...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{flexural}} {{strength and the}} elastic modulus of acrylic resins, Dencor, Duralay and Trim Plus II, were evaluated with and without the addition of <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> fibre. Materials and methods: To evaluate the {{flexural strength}} and elastic modulus, 60 test specimens were fabricated {{with the addition of}} 10 % ground <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> fibres for the experimental group, and 60 without the incorporation of fibres, for the control group, with 20 test specimens being made of each commercial brand of resin (Dencor, Duralay and Trim Plus II) for the control group and experimental group. After the test specimens had been completed, the flexural strength and elastic modulus tests were performed in a universal testing device, using the three-point bending test. For the specimens without fibres the One-Way Analysis of Variance and the complementary Tukey test were used, and for those with fibres it was not normal, so that the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was applied. Results: For the flexural strength test, there was no statistical difference (p > 0. 05) between each commercial brand of resin without fibres [Duralay 84. 32 (+/- 8. 54), Trim plus 85. 39 (+/- 6. 74), Dencor 96. 70 (+/- 6. 52) ] and with fibres (Duralay 87. 18, Trim plus 88. 33, Dencor 98. 10). However, for the elastic modulus, there was statistical difference (p > 0. 01) between each commercial brand of resin without fibres [Duralay 2380. 64 (+/- 168. 60), Trim plus 2740. 37 (+/- 311. 74), Dencor 2595. 42 (+/- 261. 22) ] and with fibres (Duralay 3750. 42, Trim plus 3188. 80, Dencor 3400. 75). Conclusion: The result showed that the incorporation of fibre did not interfere in the flexural strength values, but it increased the values for the elastic modulus...|$|E
40|$|An assay to {{estimate}} the amount of glucose oxidase immobilised as a monolayer onto a flat surface is reported. This method {{is based on the}} electrochemical detection of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor released by the immobilised enzyme in acid solutions. FAD concentration in the acid solution was measured by amperometry, using a flow injection analysis (FIA) system equipped with a wall-jet electrode, and with a sensitivity of (9. 2 +/- 2. 0) x 10 (- 2) nA/nM. By this method, the amount of glucose oxidase molecules present in a monolayer deposited on a <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> slide was easily detected, in which the detection limit is more than one order of magnitude lower than the maximum loading of the surface with an ordered monolayer of glucose oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Drying oils, {{especially}} linseed oil, {{have been}} used since the 15 th century as a painting medium. Hardening of linseed oil is a complex and little understood process involving autoxidation that has frequently led to the spontaneous ignition of rags doused with linseed oils. In the present study, low temperature oxidation of linseed oil and its active components, linoleic, linolenic and oleic acids in 50 mol% 0 ₂ has been investigated in a plug flow reactor, with and without an added cobalt catalyst. Glass wool, <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> wool and cotton wool have been impregnated with the drying oils and held in the flow reactor at an initial temperature between 60 and 100 °C. Online analysis of products has been performed by micro gas chromatography. Sampling gas analysis involved μGC, FTIR spectroscopy and GC-MS. Reaction has been monitored {{over a period of}} several hours. An induction period which depends on the substrate and the initial temperature has been observed prior to rapid increase in the evolution of products of oxidation including CO, C 0 ₂ and H₂ 0. The ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide becomes larger as the initial temperature increases suggesting distinct pathways for the evolution of CO and C 0 ₂. FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of aldehydes and carboxylic acids, with identification of these species confirmed by GC-MS. Light hydrocarbons, especially ethane and ethylene were quantified by the micro gas chromatography. Cobalt(II) nitrate catalysed the autoxidation reactions. In the absence of a catalyst, the oil samples were found to undergo a slower hardening process, probably associated with cross-linking or polymerisation together with partial fragmentation to form the observed low molecular weight products...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of the {{adhesive}} force {{is of great}} interest in {{a large number of}} applications, such as powder coating and processing of cohesive powders. Established measurement methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the centrifugal method are costly and time consuming. For engineering applications {{there is a need to}} develop a quick test method. The drop test method has been designed and developed for this purpose. In this test method particles that are adhered to a substrate are mounted on and are subjected to a tensile force by impacting the stub against a stopper ring by dropping it from a set height. From the balance of the detachment force and {{adhesive force}} for a critical particles size, above which particles are detached and below which they remain on the substrate, the interfacial specific energy is calculated. A model of adhesion is required to estimate the adhesive force between the particles and the surface, and in this work we use the JKR theory. The detachment force is estimated by Newton’s second law of motion, using an estimated particle mass, based on its size and density and calculated particle acceleration. A number of materials such as <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> beads, Avicel, α-lactose monohydrate and starch have been tested and the adhesive force and energy between the particle and the substrate surface have been quantified. Consistent values of the interface energy with a narrow error band are obtained, independent of the impact velocity. As the latter is varied, different particle sizes detach; nevertheless similar values of the interface energy are obtained, an indication that the technique is robust, as it is in fact based on microscopic observations of many particles. The trends of the results obtained with the drop test method are similar to those shown in studies by other researchers using established methods like the AFM and the centrifuge method...|$|E
40|$|Polymorphism in {{pharmaceutical}} drug crystals causes {{differences in}} their bioavailability, stability and processability. Hence, identifying different crystal polymorphs of an active ingredient {{during the early stages}} of drug development and controlling crystal polymorphism during the manufacturing process are important aspects of pharmaceutical crystallisation. Nucleation and growth of different polymorphs in a crystallising solution are regulated by a delicate balance between thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Crystal nucleation predominantly occurs via heterogeneous nucleation pathway as it is energetically favourable than homogeneous nucleation. Template-induced nucleation approach aims to utilise the advantage of heterogeneous nucleation to induce nucleation of specific crystal polymorphs through interfacial interactions between a preformed solid surface and solute molecules at the nucleation stage. In template-induced crystallisation, templates with specific surface properties that can act as heterogeneous nucleation sites are introduced in contact with the crystallising solution. Specific interactions between the template surface and solute molecules are known to influence nucleation and growth of crystal polymorphs. However, the effects of template surface chemistry and other operating conditions such as temperature and supersaturation on template-induced crystallisation is not clearly understood. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} probe the combined effects of surface chemistry, crystallisation temperature, supersaturation, and solvent on template-induced crystallisation experimentally and consequent development of a molecular modelling approach to study template-induced nucleation. This could help in establishing template-induced nucleation as a method to achieve preferential nucleation of crystal polymorphs and to support template chemistry as a novel parameter for polymorph screenings. Carbamazepine (CBZ) was selected as the model drug compound and <b>silanised</b> <b>glass</b> vials were chosen as the template surfaces. CBZ crystallisation from ethanol solutions on templates with cyano functional surface groups led to selective nucleation of metastable form II crystals while the control surfaces resulted in concomitant nucleation of both form II and stable form III crystals. On mercapto and fluoro templates, CBZ crystallised preferentially as form III polymorph. These variations in the polymorphic outcome with template chemistry, temperature and supersaturation were mapped on to template-induced polymorphic domain (TiPoD) plots. The analysis of TiPoD plots showed that the template-induced nucleation mechanism was prominent within a narrow range of supersaturation across the temperature range studied. The influence of solvents on template-induced nucleation of CBZ polymorphs was also investigated by constructing TiPoD plots in five different solvents. These studies revealed that the templates were less effective in altering polymorphic outcome in highly polar solvent in comparison with the less polar solvents. Interfacial interactions between the template surface and CBZ crystal polymorphs were calculated through molecular modelling. The simulation results suggest that those templates exhibiting favourable interaction energies with the dominant crystal facets of a specific polymorph preferentially induce nucleation of that crystal form.
