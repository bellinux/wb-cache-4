Large scale shipbuilding had begun in 1811, and after passing through various hands, in 1880 the first two iron ships were built at Blyth for the Russian Government.

50|$|<b>Ship</b> <b>dismantling</b> {{is another}} form of trans {{frontier}} waste that is shipped from country to country. Many ships are broken down into parts that can be recycled. Many parts of the ships are hazardous and can potentially pollute the areas that they are broken down in. The ship parts can contain asbestos, PCB's, and oil sludge. All of these components can be a potential health risk and harm the environment. Most ship scrapping industries are in developing countries where the laws (environmentally as well as occupationally) are not as strict as in developed countries. International Maritime Organization states that India is the leader in <b>ship</b> <b>dismantling,</b> followed by China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.The aircraft carrier Clemenceau was denied access to Indian waters because it contained asbestos.
