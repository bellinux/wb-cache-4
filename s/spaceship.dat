5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying <b>spaceship.</b> They concluded that this <b>spaceship</b> was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the <b>spaceship</b> and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E
