50|$|Plating is {{a surface}} {{covering}} {{in which a}} metal is deposited on a conductive <b>surface.</b> <b>Plating</b> has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Thin-film deposition has plated objects as small as an atom, therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology.|$|E

50|$|Before the Second World War, metal was the {{standard}} material used for <b>surface</b> <b>plates,</b> however, the war efforts of various countries put {{a strain on}} the availability of metal. A monument and metal shop owner (Wallace Herman) in Dayton, Ohio, along with his inventive employee Donald V. Porter, started using granite in place of metal for his <b>surface</b> <b>plates.</b> Today most <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> being made of quartz-bearing granite. The quartz content of these granite <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> increases the wear resistance of the plate as quartz is a harder stone. Black granite is dominantly used in machine bases, granite accessories, and custom applications for its superior stiffness, excellent vibration dampening, and improved machinability. Quartz-bearing granite (usually pink, white, or grey) is often made thicker than black granite to provide equal load-bearing capabilities of the types of material used for <b>surface</b> <b>plates</b> as it is not as stiff as black granite.|$|R

40|$|A {{gold plating}} {{process in the}} {{electronics}} industry can be classified as (i) all <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> or (ii) selective plating. Selective plating is more widely used than all <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> because it can save more gold used in the plating process and takes less plating time. In this research, the selective plating process called jet plating was studied. Factors that possibly affected the gold usage and plating voltage were also studied to reduce the production cost. These factors included (a) plating temperature, (b) crystal (inhibitor) amount, (c) distance between workpiece and anode, (d) plating current and (e) plating speed. A two-level Full Factorial design with center points was first performed to screen the factors. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was then employed to optimize the factors in jet plating. The amount of gold usage should be reduced to 0. 366 g / 10, 000 pieces, the plating speed should be increased to 4 m/min and the plating voltage should not exceed 8. 0 V. According to the analysis, the optimal settings should be as follows: the plating temperature at 55. 5 deg C, the crystal amount at 90 %, the distance at 0. 5 mm, the plating current at 2. 8 A, and the plating speed at 4. 5 m/min. This optimal setting led to gold usage of 0. 350 g / 10, 000 pieces and a plating voltage of 7. 16 V. Confirmation runs of 30 experiments at the optimal conditions were then performed. It {{was found that the}} gold usage and the plating voltage of the confirmation runs were not different from the optimized gold usage and plating voltage.

Eight strains which produced the highest and lowest amount of EPS (16 - 211 mg/l) were selected among 54 bacteria isolated from yogurt. Additionally, they were tested for resistance to bile salts (0. 15, 0. 3 %) and tolerance to low pH (2. 0 - 3. 0). After treatment with bile salts and acid, viable bacteria (log cfu ml- 1) were determined by <b>surface</b> <b>plating.</b> The high EPS producing strains (B 3, G 12, W 22) showed a significant (P< 0. 05) protective effect against low pH (pH 2. 0).

40|$|Objective(s) : In {{order to}} grow cells in a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) microenvironment, self-assembling peptides, such as PuraMatrix, have emerged with potential {{to mimic the}} extracellular matrix. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the influence of the self-assembling peptide on the morphology, survival, proliferation rate, migration potential, and differentiation of human meningioma stem-like cells (hMgSCs). Materials and Methods: The efficacy of a novel method for placing hMgSCs in PuraMatrix (the injection approach) was compared to the encapsulation and <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> methods. In addition, we designed a new method for measurement of migration distance in 3 D cultivation of hMgSCs in PuraMatrix. Results: Our results revealed that hMgSCs have the ability to form spheres in stem cell culture condition. These meningioma cells expressed GFAP, CD 133, vimentin, and nestin. Using the injection method, a higher proliferation rate of the hMgSCs was observed after seven days of culture. Furthermore, the novel migration assay was able to measure the migration of a single cell alone in 3 D environment. Conclusion: The results indicate the injection method as an efficient technique for culturing hMgSCs in PuraMatrix. Furthermore, the novel migration assay enables us to evaluate the migration of hMgSCs...|$|E

Hazards of healthy living: bottled water and salad vegetables as risk factors for Campylobacter infection. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 9 (10), 1219 – 1225] that mineral bottled water accidentally contaminated by Campylobacter jejuni would represent a risk factor for Campylobacter infection. Culturability of C. jejuni cells inoculated in low- and high-mineral bottled water during storage at 4 1 C in the dark was performed by <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> and modelled using theWeibull model. The loss of C. jejuni culturability observed in all conditions tested was shown to be dependent on strain, preculture condition and water composition. Following inoculation of C. jejuni, the rapid loss of culturability was not correlated to complete cell death as the passage into embryonated eggs enabled recovery of cells from the viable but non-culturable state. In conclusion, the sanitary risk associated with contaminated bottled water cannot be excluded although it is presumably low. Culture conditions, strain and water type must be taken into account in the evaluation of the risk factors as they influence significantly Campylobacter survival in water...|$|E

Maximum counts were assumed to be those on TSYA. In general, numbers detected were lower with the selective solid media and higher with the selective liquid media. Inhibitory effects, especially on selective solid media varied with the strains of E. coli. The lower detection on selective solid media was {{partly due to the}} stress induced in some cells by the temperature of the melted media used in the pour plate method. These cells apparently failed to repair and form colonies in the selective media. Improved detection on the selective solid media was achieved by using 1 % nonfat milk solids, 1 % peptone, or 1 % MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O in the dilution blanks.

The <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> materials studied include copper alloy, microetched copper, Ag, black oxide coating, Ni, Pd/Ni and Au/Ni plating. Special emphasis was placed on the effects of various stages in manufacturing processes, including post mold cure, thermal cycling, IR reflow and temperature and humidity storage, on the changes in interface adhesion. The interface bond strength was measured using the lead pull test. The lead frame surface was characterized using various techniques, such as;atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements, to correlate the measured interface bond strength with the surface characteristics of various natures. It was confirmed that dimples etched on the lead frame surface offered several mechanical anchoring mechanisms and much improved interface bond with moulding compound. The interface bond strength and the number of dimples exhibited roughly a linear relationship. The black oxide and Pd coated surfaces were shown to provide the strongest interface adhesion, with the highest wettability amongst various surface finishes studied. The measurement of contact angle is proven to be an efficient way of evaluating the metal surface quality for interface adhesion with polymer resin...|$|E

Environment optimised processes should replace wet chemistry by physical surface pre-treatment of metalising. Within this project alternatively pre-treated plastic parts have been electroplated and the technical feasibility for volume production has been tested. The following technologies have been used first for 2 dimensional test plaques and second for a MID (molded interconnect device) prototype, that integrates several automotive relevant switch features: ECR-plasma etching, Excimer UV etching, MOPECVD, PVD. With the exception of direct galvanoplating on TiN for all other versions a parameter set was developed to build up thicker copper layers with a good pealstrength. Besides the full <b>surface</b> <b>plating</b> for MIDs a selective and structured plating process is required. Instead of the conventional subtractive technique used in the PCB industry a fully additive process would give extra environmental advantages.

Linear responses were found by plotting detection times ob-tained from both conductivity and pH growth curves as a function of initial cell concentration in the range of 102 to 107 cfu/mL. The detection time was approximately 12 and 2 h for 102 and 107 cfu/mL of viable L. monocytogenes, respectively, using the conductivity growth curves, whereas it was approximately 1 h less using the pH growth curves. This dual detection system was used for evaluating the growth of acid-, temperature-, and salt-treated L. monocytogenes in the medium. Acid stress at pH 2 and 3 for 3 h causedapproximately 12 and 4 hdelay in the detection time on pH growth curves, while stress at pH 5 for 3 h did not cause a significant delay in detection time.
