40|$|M. Ed. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the management of <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> exemptions by <b>school</b> principals. Due to the current financial climate in South Africa, the responsibility for financing education is shifting increasingly from the government to the private sector and the parent community in particular. Consequently schools have to generate more funds to supplement state resources. These funds are administered and managed by school-based managers. Furthermore, this concept enhances the aspect of <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> management. The first chapter of this research provided a comprehensive orientation and background of the research problem. The aim of the research was presented and the method of research was discussed. In chapter two, the researcher concentrated on a focused literature study. The literature study explored the concept of the budget; legislation and policy on <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> exemptions, accountability and transparency of principals. The research design and qualitative methodology was the subject of discussion in chapter three. An interview as a research instrument was explained. Therefore, various aspects of an interview as a research instrument were discussed. Findings of this research, which emanated both from the literature review on <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> exemptions and empirical research, revealed that poverty and unemployment are the main cause of non-payment of <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> It was also revealed that parents are not aware of the <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> exemptions policy and that they do not apply for <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> exemptions. Another reason for non payment of <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> is the mismanagement of <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> The recommendations regarding addressing problems of non-payment of <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> in our country were provided...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine how}} local income {{distribution}} affects both a community’s {{ability to pay}} for schooling {{and the quality of}} that schooling, this research merges household and school census data from South Africa. Empirical results are twofold. First, while the median income and the average household income increase <b>school</b> <b>fees,</b> inequality inhousehold income (standard deviation) decreases <b>school</b> <b>fees,</b> which indicates that the lower tail of income distribution pulls down <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> Second, an increase in <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> significantly improves <b>school</b> quality, decreasing the learner-educator ratio and increasing the number of nonsubsidized educators. The result is consistent with (1) strategic behavior of the low-income group and (2) optimal <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> determination with incomplete interhousehold income transfers. Empirical results and simulations demonstrate the possibility that income and asset inequality may reduce the quality of public goods, decreasing human capital and income growth for the next generation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions by governing bodies in public schools in Gauteng. The granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemption is presenting a new challenge to school financial management for the School Governing Bodies. This challenge is that due to insufficient funding received by the schools from the Department of Education, the SGB must, under Section 36 of South African School Act, take all reasonable measures within its means to supplement the resources supplied by the State {{in order to improve}} the quality of education provided by the school to all learners at the school. The literature study revealed that an apparent disparity exists between the intended results of policy implementation and the actual implication thereof for public schools. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon the research design is qualitative. The aim of this research is to: Identify the requirements set by SASA for the granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions in public schools; Explore the management of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions by the SGB and SMT members in public schools as part of school financial management; Determine the implication of the granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions on the school budget; and Establish the guidelines to assist the SGB in the granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions in public schools. The following research methods were employed to gather the research data: Literature study, focus group interviews, individual focussed interviews and observation. Three major categories emerged from the data analysis, namely: Policy Related Issues, Capacity, Financial Implication and Financial Management. Subcategories emerged under these broad categories: Policy Related Issues School governing bodies appear to fail to interact timeously with legislation and policy, resulting in the status quo being perpetuated; Political organisations appear to interfere in matters of <b>school</b> <b>fees,</b> resulting in the school experiencing difficulties in implementing the policy; Capacity Financial and Human Resource capacity are two essential aspects required by the school governing bodies for managing school funds; Financial Implication Schools appear not to have a resolution as contemplated in Section 39 of South African School Act to charge <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> <b>School</b> <b>fee</b> exemption criteria appear to exacerbate the task of the SGB to draw up their budget, and hinder the collection of <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> Financial Management It appears that financial statements are not issued and the funds are not appropriately handled and managed by the SGB. The SGB appears not to keep financial records properly and is not accountable of some of the money received through fund raising. The study concludes with the summary and recommendations for the granting of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> exemptions by governing bodies in public schools...|$|R
