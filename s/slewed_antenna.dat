The {{purpose of this}} thesis is {{to contribute to the}} development of the next generation <b>slewing</b> <b>antennas</b> for spacecraft, ground or sea systems. Current <b>antenna</b> <b>slewing</b> systems may also benefit from the results. More specifically this thesis provides a new testbed for implementing slew maneuvers in a laboratory environment. The antenna slew testbed was built with in-house manufactured parts, 3 -D printed parts and commercial-off-the-shelf equipment. The approach for designing this testbed involved CAD analysis and rapid prototyping, the application of dynamic scaling and similitude concepts, and implementation of hardware and software to support experimentation of novel maneuver concepts. To illustrate this, a maneuver based on optimal control theory is implemented. The applicability of this testbed casts a wide net because of its scale size as compared to existing or future systems. Moreover, the testbed is designed in a modular form to allow a variety of different antenna systems to be represented for testing slews. These include ground, space, and shipboard antenna systems.

It {{is also possible that}} ATS-6 was a forerunner of the large ELINT satellites such as Mentor.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} meet the future {{requirements}} of the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS, (Plag and Pearlman 2009)) and reach 1 -mm accuracy for the station positions, the global geodetic VLBI network is currently being upgraded to the VLBI Geodetic Observing System (VGOS, (Behrend et al. (2008; Petrachenko et al. 2009)). New fast <b>slewing</b> <b>antennas</b> are being constructed and equipped with highly accurate broadband receiving systems. This will result in {{a significant increase in the}} quantity and quality of the VLBI observations, what should also result in higher precision of the results. However, it is not only sufficient to have good observations, the processing made in order to estimate the parameters of interest also needs to be optimized. For example, it is important that the correction models applied in the data analysis (e.g., for the solid Earth tides and ocean tidal, atmospheric and other geophysical loading, and tropospheric delays) are as accurate as possible. Furthermore, the method applied to do the parameter estimation is of high importance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operator}} <b>slews</b> the <b>antenna</b> {{toward a}} desired bearing, identifies a target echo at a desired range on the RHI display (RHI = range height indicator), then bisects the target with a cursor that is scaled {{to indicate the}} approximate altitude of the target. [...] Such systems often complement 2-dimensional radars which find distance and direction (search radar); thus using two 2-dimensional systems to obtain a 3-dimensional aerial picture. Height finding radars of the 1960s and 70s were distinguished by their antenna being tall, but narrow. As beam shape {{is a function of}} antenna shape, the height finder beam was flat and wide horizontally (i.e., not very good at determining bearing to the target), but very thin vertically, allowing accurate measurement of elevation angle, thus altitude.|$|R

40|$|Landsat 7 must be slewed {{so that it}} is {{pointing}} at a ground station in order for recorded science or telemetry data to be downlinked to earth. <b>Antenna</b> <b>slewing</b> on Landsat 7 has been shown to occasionally cause a slight vibration to the satellite, which in turn might aect the quality of the image taken by the scanning instrument if the scanner is in use during slewing. Consequently, it is preferable for the slewing activity not to overlap any scanning activity, although because the detrimental eect on image quality occurs only intermittently, this disjointness is best not expressed as a hard constraint. This {{is only one of the}} many real world problems that can be cast and, under certain assumptions, solved in our framework. Reasoning simultaneously with hard temporal constraints and preferences, as illustrated in the example just given, is crucial in many situations. However, in many temporal reasoning problems it is dicult or impossible to specify a local preference on durations. I...|$|R
40|$|The LQG controllers, {{designed}} for the NASA Deep Space Network antennas have small tracking errors and are resistant to wind disturbances. However, during <b>antenna</b> <b>slewing,</b> they induce limit cycling caused by the violation of the antenna rate and acceleration limits. This problem can be avoided by introduction of a command that does not exceed the limits. The command preprocessor {{presented in this paper}} generates a command that is equal to the original command if the latter does not exceed the limits, and varies with the maximal (or minimal) allowable rate and acceleration if the limits are met or exceeded. It is comparatively simple since it requires only knowledge of the command at the current and the previous time instants, while other known preprocessors require knowledge of the terminal state and the acquisition time. Thus, the presented preprocessor is more suitable for implementation. In this article analysis of the preprocessor is presented. Also the performances of the preprocessor itself, and of the antenna with the preprocessor is illustrated with typical antenna commands...|$|R
40|$|The second Control Of Flexible Structures Flight Experiment (COFS- 2) {{includes}} a long mast {{as in the}} first flight experiment, but with the Langley 15 -m hoop column antenna attached via a gimbal system {{to the top of}} the mast. The mast is to be mounted in the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The servo-driven gimbal system could be used to point the antenna relative to the mast. The dynamic interaction of the Shuttle Orbiter/COFS- 2 system with the Orbiter on-orbit Flight Control System (FCS) and the gimbal pointing control system has been studied using analysis and simulation. The Orbiter pointing requirements have been assessed for their impact on allowable free drift time for COFS experiments. Three fixed antenna configurations were investigated. Also simulated was Orbiter attitude control behavior with active vernier jets during <b>antenna</b> <b>slewing.</b> The effect of experiment mast dampers was included. Control system stability and performance and loads on various portions of the COFS- 2 structure were investigated. The study indicates possible undesirable interaction between the Orbiter FCS and the flexible, articulated COFS- 2 mast/antenna system, even when restricted to vernier reaction jets...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{goal of this}} thesis was to build an experimental test rig for demonstrations on flexible space systems control. Specifically, an air-bearing test bed incorporated a two-degree of freedom (2 DOF) rigid robotic arm and an appendage with flexible joints to test the effects of movement of the robotic arm on the appendage. The two-link, 2 DOF rigid robotic arm {{can be used to}} simulate a moving space antenna or other movable appendages. Optimal trajectories of the two-link arm to simulate a conventional <b>antenna</b> <b>slewing</b> maneuver were investigated, to illustrate the type of flexible motion that may be produced in the laboratory. An iterative process was used to refine the test bed design and the experimental workflow. Three concepts incorporated various strategies to design a robust flexible link. Inertia measurement units (IMU), a central processor for data analysis, power distribution, and robotics software, are all integrated as part of the test bed design. A single link arm with a torsional, helical spring at the base was finalized to investigate the effects of coupling due to movement of the rigid two-link arm. The torsional spring allowed the vibrating arm to displace sufficiently to have a high signal-to-noise ratio compared to earlier concepts in which IMU noise dominated the response. The test bed was designed to accommodate further testing that may require increased loading due to, for example, the incorporation of reaction wheels or additional instrumentation.

40|$|Fast {{switching}} phase calibration has {{not been}} investigated for the ALMA telescope since ALMA has been dened as 64 12 m antennas. Furthermore, the logic chain which picked the optimal calibrator in past investigations was approximate. In order {{to better understand the}} requirements which are placed on the current ALMA design by fast switching, we have rewritten the fast switching simulation code in AIPS++, including a more complete optimization with fewer assumptions, using updated sensitivity, <b>antenna</b> <b>slewing,</b> and atmospheric information. We nd that when the observing frequency is matched to the phase stability (ie, high frequency observations are always carried out during the most phase stable consitions), the Chajnantor site is good enough to permit fast switching observations of the expected frequency range (ie 30 to 950 GHz) to succeed with high eciency. Typical observing eciencies, including both time lost to the phase calibration cycle and decorrelation losses, range between 0. 80 and 0. 90 for sources above 45 deg elevation angles. The observing eciency decays very gently at lower elevation angles, with a typical eciency of 0. 70 at 20 deg elevation. The extra sensitivity provided by 64 12 m antennas does not help as much as might be expected with fast switching because the time spent integrating on the calibrator is very small compared to the entire cycle and is a moderately small portion of the calibration phase of the cycle. The 1. 5 s delay due to changing frequencies is pretty well matched to the slew times for typical objects. The slew proles provided by Vertex are sucient. The residual phase errors resulting from fast switching will cause baseline-dependent decorrelation. Some minor algorithmic work should proceed on xing this decorrela [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a NASA {{spacecraft}} {{designed to}} study the Sun. It was launched on February 11, 2010 into a geosynchronous orbit, and uses a suite of attitude sensors and actuators to finely point the spacecraft at the Sun. SDO has three science instruments: the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE). SDO uses two High Gain Antennas (HGAs) to send science data to a dedicated ground station in White Sands, New Mexico. In {{order to meet the}} science data capture budget, the HGAs must be able to transmit data to the ground for a very large percentage of the time. Each HGA is a dual-axis antenna driven by stepper motors. Both antennas transmit data at all times, but only a single antenna is required {{in order to meet the}} transmission rate requirement. For portions of the year, one antenna or the other has an unobstructed view of the White Sands ground station. During other periods, however, the view from both antennas to the Earth is blocked for different portions of the day. During these times of blockage, the two HGAs take turns pointing to White Sands, with the other antenna pointing out to space. The HGAs handover White Sands transmission responsibilities to the unblocked antenna. There are two handover seasons per year, each lasting about 72 days, where the antennas hand off control every twelve hours. The non-tracking <b>antenna</b> <b>slews</b> back to the ground station by following a ground commanded trajectory and arrives approximately 5 minutes before the formerly tracking <b>antenna</b> <b>slews</b> away to point out into space. The SDO Attitude Control System (ACS) runs at 5 Hz, and the HGA Gimbal Control Electronics (GCE) run at 200 Hz. There are 40 opportunities for the gimbals to step each ACS cycle, with a hardware limitation of no more than one step every three GCE cycles. The ACS calculates the desired gimbal motion for tracking the ground station or for slewing, and sends the command to the GCE at 5 Hz. This command contains the number of gimbals steps for that ACS cycle, the direction of motion, the spacing of the steps, and the delay before taking the first step. The AIA and HMI instruments are sensitive to spacecraft jitter. Pre-flight analysis showed that jitter from the motion of the HGAs was a cause of concern. Three jitter mitigation techniques were developed to overcome the effects of jitter from different sources. The first method is the random step delay, which avoids gimbal steps hitting a cadence on a jitter-critical mode by pseudo-randomly delaying the first gimbal step in an ACS cycle. The second method of jitter mitigation is stagger stepping, which forbids the two antennas from taking steps during the same ACS cycle in order to avoid constructively adding jitter from two antennas. The third method is the inclusion of an instrument No Step Request (NSR), which allows the instruments to request a stoppage in gimbal stepping during the times when they are taking images. During the commissioning phase of the mission, a jitter test was performed onboard the spacecraft. Various sources of jitter, such as the reaction wheels, the High Gain Antenna motors, and the motion of the instrument filter wheels, were examined to determine the level of their effect on the instruments. During the HGA portion of the test, the jitter amplitudes from the single step of a gimbal were examined, as well as the amplitudes due to the execution of various gimbal rates. These jitter levels are compared with the gimbal jitter allocations for each instrument. Additionally, the jitter test provided insight into a readback delay that exists with the GCE. Pre-flight analysis suggested that gimbal steps scheduled to occur during the later portion of an ACS cycle would not be read during that cycle, resulting in a delay in the telemetered current gimbal position. Flight data from the jitter test confirmed this expectation. Analysis is presentehat shows the readback delay does not have a negative impact on gimbal control. The decision was made to consider implementing two of the jitter mitigation techniques on board the spacecraft: stagger stepping and the NSR. Flight data from two sets of handovers, one set without jitter mitigation and the other with mitigation enabled, were examined. The trajectory of the predicted handover was compared with the measured trajectory for the two cases, showing that tracking was not negatively impacted with the addition of the jitter mitigation techniques. Additionally, the individual gimbal steps were examined, and it was confirmed that the stagger stepping and NSRs worked as designed. An Image Quality Test was performed to determine the amount of cumulative jitter from the reaction wheels, HGAs, and instruments during various combinations of typical operations. In this paper, the flight results are examined from a test where the HGAs are following the path of a nominal handover with stagger stepping on and HMI NSRs enabled. In this case, the reaction wheels are moving at low speed and the instruments are taking pictures in their standard sequence. The flight data shows the level of jitter that the instruments see when their shutters are open. The HGA-induced jitter is well within the jitter requirement when the stagger step and NSR mitigation options are enabled. The SDO HGA pointing algorithm was designed to achieve nominal antenna pointing at the ground station, perform slews during handover season, and provide three HGA-induced jitter mitigation options without compromising pointing objectives. During the commissioning phase, flight data sets were collected to verify the HGA pointing algorithm and demonstrate its jitter mitigation capabilities...|$|R
