40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in microbial lipase production due to its great potential for industrial applications such as food additives, industrial reagents and <b>stain</b> <b>removers,</b> {{as well as for}} medical applications. Specially for medical applications a high degree of purity is required, which is accomplished with high resolution chromatographic techniques. Affinity chromatography is considered a very high resolution chromatographic technique. In this work the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of the adsorption of lipase from Geotrichum sp on biospecific resin were determined. The resin was prepared using EAH sepharose 4 B gel (Pharmacia), made to react with oleic acid as the specific ligand. The lipase was produced in a five-liter fermenter, with both complex and synthetic media. Fermentation conditions were a temperature of 30 °C, an aeration of 1 VVM and an agitation of 400 rpm. Maximum lipase activity was around 28 U/ml after 10 hours of fermentation for the complex medium. The kinetic model and parameters were determined by dynamic fitting to experimental results using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterized}} trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine alkaline proteases from cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, {{for their}} probable potential application as additives in various bio-formulations. Purification {{was achieved by}} using hydroxylapatite, DEAE sephadex and CM sephadex columns, which resulted in increased enzyme activity by 13. 76 - and 14. 05 -fold for trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. Michaelis–Menten constants (Km) for substrates of trypsin and chymotrypsin, BApNA and SAAPFpNA, {{were found to be}} 1. 25 and 0. 085 mM, correspondingly. Fluorescent zymogram analysis indicated the presence of five trypsin bands with molecular masses of ∼ 21, 25, 38, 40, and 66 kDa and two chymotrypsin bands with molecular masses of ∼ 29 and 34 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH was 10. 0 and optimum temperature was 50 °C for proteolytic activity for the purified proteases. The proteases were inhibited by synthetic inhibitors such as PMSF, aprotonin, leupeptin, pefabloc, and antipain. TLCK and TPCK inhibited about 94 and 90 % of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity, respectively, while EDTA, EGTA, E 64, pepstatin, idoacetamide, and bestatin did not affect the enzymes. The purified enzymes exhibited high stability and compatibility with metal ions; oxidizing, reducing, and bleaching agents; organic solvents; and commercial detergents. Short life cycles, voracious feeding behavior, and production of multiple forms of proteases in the midgut with rapid catalytic activity and chemostability can serve H. armigera as an excellent alternative source of industrially important proteases for use as additives in <b>stain</b> <b>removers,</b> detergents, and other bio-formulations.

40|$|Color is {{the main}} {{attraction}} of any fabric. No matter how excellent its constitution, if unsuitably colored it {{is bound to be}} a failure as a commercial fabric. Manufacture and use of synthetic dyes for fabric dyeing has therefore become a massive industry today. In fact the art of applying color to fabric has been known to mankind since 3500 BC. WH Perkins in 1856 discovered the use of synthetic dyes. Synthetic dyes have provided a wide range of colorfast, bright hues. However their toxic nature has become a cause of grave concern to environmentalists. Use of synthetic dyes has an adverse effect on all forms of life. Presence of sulphur, naphthol, vat dyes, nitrates, acetic acid, soaps, enzymes chromium compounds and heavy metals like copper, arsenic, lead, cad- mium, mercury, nickel, and cobalt and certain auxiliary chemicals all collectively make the textile effluent highly toxic. Other harmful chemicals present in the water may be formaldehyde based dye fixing agents, chlorinated <b>stain</b> <b>removers,</b> hydro carbon based softeners, non bio degradable dyeing chemicals. These organic materials react with many disinfectants especially chlorine and form by products (DBP’S) that are often carcinogenic and therefore undesirable. Many of these show allergic reactions. The colloidal matter present along with colors and oily scum increases the turbidity, gives the water a bad appearance and foul smell and prevents the penetration of sunlight necessary for the process of photosynthesis. This in turn interferes with the Oxygen transfer mechanism at air water interface which in turn interferes with marine life and self purification process of water. This effluent if allowed to flow in the fields’ clogs the pores of the soil resulting in loss of soil productivity. If allowed to flow in drains and rivers it effects the quality of drinking water in hand pumps making it unfit for human consumption. It is important to remove these pollutants from the waste waters before their final disposal...|$|R

50|$|VANISH is {{the global}} <b>stain</b> <b>remover</b> market {{leader in the}} Fabric {{treatment}} category, which is sold in more than 60 countries across the globe. VANISH started as a stain removing bar laundry product produced about 1983 by a small Scottish company called Projectina Co Ltd established by Robert G Macfarlane in Skelmorlie, Scotland. The brand was soon acquired by Ecolab in 1986 and became a Benckiser brand in 1987 when the latter acquired Ecolab’s consumer goods operations. Benckiser N.V. merged with Reckitt & Colman PLC in 1999 to form Reckitt Benckiser PLC. The VANISH name is now applied {{to a wide range}} of stain removing products across a broad range of textile materials, now including curtains and carpets. The RB Group of companies (RB Group) has several subsidiary entities worldwide, such as RB N.V. based in the Netherlands, the entity that holds the trademarks for the VANISH brand.|$|E
40|$|Background Almost all {{reports of}} {{respiratory}} {{health effects of}} hydrofluoric acid are derived from industrial settings and usually involved massive and conspicuous exposures. In the present report we describe a case of adult-onset asthma immediately following use of a household rust <b>stain</b> <b>remover</b> that contained an 8 – 9 % aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF). Methods This is a case-report. A literature search of hydrogen fluoride, and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) was performed. Results A previously healthy 26 -year-old woman developed asthma immediately following inhalation exposure to hydrofluoric acid from a household cleaner, consistent with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. The circumstances of exposure and possible mechanism of disease are discussed. Conclusions It is likely that this patient's use of the rust <b>stain</b> <b>remover</b> resulted in inhalation exposure to hydrofluoric acid well above any applicable standard, and hence constituted a ‘high level’ irritant exposure capable of inducing reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. In our opinion, {{the presence of this}} concentration hydrofluoric acid in a consumer product may be unduly hazardous. Am. J. Ind. Med. 44 : 321 – 324, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the knowledge of the cleaning companies in case of mercury spills at home. METHOD: Thirty-two cleaning companies were interviewed by a telephone survey. Two standard questions were asked to an authorized people of the company. &# 8220;A manometer is broken on the carpet. The mercury in the manometer is all spilled on the wall to wall carpet in the living room. We want our carpet to be cleaned. Could you do it? How can be the carpet cleaned? Have you ever cleaned a carpet on which mercury was spilled?&# 8221; It is stated that mercury spillage has happened just a very short time ago and nothing have been done after that. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the 32 companies work in Istanbul, 37. 5 % in Ankara and 22. 5 % in Izmir. Three companies from Ankara, five from Istanbul, one from Izmir stated that they have encountered with mercury spillage before. Three of the companies who have stated that the have not encountered with mercury spillage before, asked &# 8220;What is mercury?&# 8221; and one of them asked whether &# 8220;Mercury is a communicable disease, isn&# 8217;t it?&# 8221;. Twenty-two of the interviewed cleaning companies stated that they could clean the carpet with <b>stain</b> <b>remover</b> and three of them offered vacuuming, one washing the carpet with carpet shampoo, one person cleaning the stain by wiping with alcohol/ethyl alcohol. Five of the companies stated that they could not clean the stain and one of them he has advised throwing the carpet away. CONCLUSION: In many developing countries there is no responsible association or institution for mercury spills. Such simple surveys may be very important in determining training and gaps concerning public health problems. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2010; 9 (6. 000) : 557 - 562...|$|E
