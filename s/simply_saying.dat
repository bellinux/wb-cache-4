However, although he had died intestate Skepper had left a ‘soldier’s will’ and his estate was administered on 18 January 1948, with the administration document <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> that he had died ‘on war service’. His whole estate was valued at £38,035 18s 2d (a huge sum for that time) and his mother then informed the London School of Economics that he had said that in the event of his death, at least part of this should be used for the furtherance of sociology at the School. A bequest of £20,000 (currently worth approximately £500,000-£700,000) was made via a deed of trust, for ‘Sociological Research at the School’ by the establishment of The Charles Skepper House for Sociological Research with a Research Fellowship and Studentships. Sadly little apparently came of the intended Research Fellowship and Studentships, although the Charles Skepper House project was originally a large facility at LSE’s campus on John Adam Street just south of the Strand {{there is no longer any}} physical trace of any such facility at LSE and Skepper’s name has virtually disappeared.|$|E

500|$|Bede {{does not}} mention {{the cause of the}} battle, <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> that it {{occurred}} in the ninth year of Ecgfrith's reign. [...] He is more informative on the outcome. Ælfwine, the young subking of Deira, was killed; Ælfwine was brother to Osthryth and Ecgfrith, and was well liked in both Mercia and Northumbria since Æthelred's marriage to Osthryth. [...] According to Bede, his death threatened to cause further strife between the two kingdoms, but Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened:Theodore, the beloved of God, enlisting God's help, smothered the flames of this awful peril by his wholesome advice. [...] As a result, peace was restored between the kings and peoples, and in lieu of further bloodshed the customary compensation was paid to King Ecgfrith for his brother's death.|$|E

Wishing to discover what else John knew and prevent any further visions from occurring, Olivia insists on returning to Walter’s sensory deprivation tank. Inside the tank, Olivia sees a memory of John in a restaurant. Despite Walter's vehement protest that it is impossible, Olivia is convinced that John Scott saw her. Afterward, she sees John meeting with Mark and two other unidentified men. After Mark and another man leave, John kills the other man. Olivia believes the group were looking to sell the compound as a street drug, and she's able {{to track down the}} other man, George Morales (Yul Vazquez). Once apprehended, he denies killing Mark and demands immunity and protection from Massive Dynamic, who he believes was responsible for Mark's death as well as other recent fringe events. Olivia confronts Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) about her suspicions, but George is murdered before he can be of further help to them. Later that night, Olivia gets another email from John Scott <b>simply</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I SAW YOU. IN THE RESTAURANT." ...|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, of The Observer, {{considered}} the novel [...] "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson's [...] "sex, snobbery and sadism" [...] complaint. They highlighted the [...] "sinister... cult of luxury {{for its own}} sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel {{was a sign of}} moral decay; rather, [...] "we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." [...] This reviewer also conceded that while [...] "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century. Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that [...] "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices [...] "vulgar foibles" [...] which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, [...] "Bond's luxury meals are <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies." ...|$|E

The movement's name has phonetic origins, stemming from the exclamation of [...] "Yeah Yeah" [...] in typical fashion during rock and roll music. After translating the song, Haglund claimed that {{the theme of the}} song is about [...] "[...] [...]openly declaring and displaying one's love, coming out from 'the bushes' where 'lovers glide stealthily' and feeling love 'everywhere'". The Huffington Post summarized the song more <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> that it made the statement [...] "about how kissing is fun". Slate noted that yé-yé singers were often [...] "teenage girls who exuded a faux-innocent sexuality", which played on Megan Draper's [...] "youthful sex appeal and the generation gap between Megan and Don".

New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly.

2500|$|Most {{research}} on memory and aging {{has focused on}} how older adults perform worse at a particular memory task. [...] However, researchers have also discovered that <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> that older adults {{are doing the same}} thing, only less of it, is not always accurate. [...] In some cases, older adults seem to be using different strategies than younger adults. [...] For example, brain imaging studies have revealed that older adults are more likely to use both hemispheres when completing memory tasks than younger adults. In addition, older adults sometimes show a positivity effect when remembering information, which seems to be a result of the increased focus on regulating emotion seen with age. For instance, eye tracking reveals that older adults showed preferential looking toward happy faces and away from sad faces.|$|E

2500|$|Nilsen {{was adamant}} he was {{uncertain}} {{as to why}} he had killed, <b>simply</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I'm hoping you will tell me that" [...] when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' arms around him as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E
