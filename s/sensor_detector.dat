40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{methodology}} to determine the Spectral Response Function (FRE) of electrooptical sensors. In this process, the FRE can be obtained identifying the sensors sensibility to a flux of monochromatic light. To test the procedure a non-operational airborne sensor, the Thermal Infrared Imaging System (SISIMI), has been used in laboratory. This sensor is composed basically by an optical unity with: four faces rotating prism, a set of mirrors and a telescope, and a thermal infrared detector. The experimental arrangement included a Globar, as a source of thermal infrared radiation, a monochromator, a chopper, a lock-in amplifier and an oscilloscope. The procedure to determine the FRE consisted in changing gradually the wavelength of the projected beam, in the range of 4 to 15 µm, with the modulated beam. Initially, the FRE of the detector of the SISIMI was obtained comparing its response with another detector, witch has a well known FRE. Afterwards, due to its complexity, the FRE of some components of the optical system was characterized. Finally, the relative FRE of the sensor SISIMI was determined making the convolution and a normalization of the FREs of the <b>sensor</b> <b>detector</b> and of part of the optical system. The result represents, essentially, the spectral response of the <b>sensor</b> <b>detector.</b> Pages: 7639 - 764...|$|E

Along with radiometric calibration, geometric characterization and calibration of Sensor Data Records (SDRs) are crucial to the VIIRS Environmental Data Record (EDR) algorithms and products which are used in numerical weather prediction (NWP). The instrument geometric performance includes: 1) <b>sensor</b> (<b>detector)</b> spatial response, parameterized by the dynamic field of view (DFOV) in the scan direction and instantaneous FOV (IFOV) in the track direction, modulation transfer function (MTF) for the 17 moderate resolution bands (M-bands), and horizontal spatial resolution (HSR) for the five imagery bands (I-bands); 2) matrices of band-to-band co-registration (BBR) from the corresponding detectors in all band pairs; and 3) pointing knowledge and stability characteristics that includes scan plane tilt, scan rate and scan start position variations, and thermally induced variations in pointing with respect to orbital position.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{both the}} development of a unique adaptive optics system and the applica- tion of high resolution observations to astrophysics. The first part describes the development, validation and implementation of the wavefront <b>sensor</b> <b>detector</b> and computer of the laser guide star adaptive optics system for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), Argos. The second part demonstrates the important role of secular evolution in the black hole growth of narrow-line Seyfert Type 1 galaxies by studying their bulges and comparing it to more typical Seyfert type 1 galaxies, and by studying the inner regions of one NLS 1, NGC 1365. Argos is the laser guided ground-layer adaptive optics system for the LBT. It aims to provide a factor 2 - 3 improvement in resolution over a wide field of view of 4 × 4 arcminutes 2, and is intended for Luci, the near-infrared imager, longslit, and multi-object spectrograph. As such {{it will be the first}} wide-field Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics facility dedicated for science operation. This instrument is a joint project of European and American institutes lead by the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik. Part I provides a detailed analysis of the wavefront <b>sensor</b> <b>detector</b> and the wavefront computer, the nerve center of the Argos wavefront sensing capability. In order to perform its wide-field correction, Argos uses three laser guide stars to sample the atmospheric tur- bulence. The residual wavefront error of these three guide stars is measured by the wavefront sensing system that creates three Shack-Hartmann patterns on a single pnCCD camera, i. e. a total of 525 spots each allowed to move in its 8 × 8 pixels region. In the framework of this thesis, I develop in collaboration with the company pnSensor this state-of-the-art cam- era implementing a pnCCD. My contribution covers all aspects of the system : integrating the entire control electronics, developing the camera control software, and performing exten- sive tests of the camera housing, the pnCCD, and the acquisition electronics at the various stages of the project. In particular, I also carry out an extensive test campaign and support {{the development of}} new power supplies by the MPE electronics department to tackle the pnCCD characteristic noise. In that frame, I perform several noise analyses, from optical setups to closed-loop adaptive optics simulations. The final excellent characteristics of the camera are demonstrated. With its 1 kHz framerate, 3. 5 e− readout noise, and its compact, low-maintenance housing, the integrated system fully answers the Argos requirements. In parallel to the detector work, I define the required architecture of the Argos wavefront com- puter at the center of the wavefront sensing. This DSP-based computer processes the detector images, computes the LGS local wavefront gradients, and collects the measurements of the natural guide star tip-tilt sensor and of a possible third wavefront sensor. The latter wave- front sensor can probe higher layer turbulence with either a natural or a future Sodium laser guide star. I support its development by Microgate, develop the initial configuration tools, debug its different hardware interfaces and demonstrate its real-time functionality. As part of this thesis, I pave the way for the wavefront sensor system integration by pre- liminarily integrating the wavefront <b>sensor</b> <b>detector,</b> the gating system, and the wavefront computer. The units are now fully integrated into the wavefront sensor and are undergoing system tests before being assembled at LBT. In Part II, I study the co-evolution of central super-massive black holes and their host galaxies. I focus on narrow-line Seyfert type 1 galaxies (NLS 1), revealing the major role played by secular evolution in driving the black hole growth in those galaxies. I extensively review the literature for signs of present day secular processes. I then use high-resolution HST archive images to study the bulge properties in a sample of NLS 1 s and compare them to more typical Seyfert type 1 galaxies. By doing so I show the importance of secular processes in NLS 1 s and discuss how this can be understood in a cosmological context of galaxy evolution. Building on this work, I analyze the inner hundreds of parsecs region of NGC 1365, a nearby NLS 1 s, with data from the adaptive optics integral field spectrometer SINFONI at VLT. I study the different phases of the interstellar medium and find that a large fraction of the stellar population consists of young stars of less than 10 Myr. This reveals, together with the stellar and gas kinematics and the broader context found in the literature, the major role of secular processes in this galaxy, displaying an unperturbed alignment from large scales down to the central black hole. Those same secular processes may be responsible for the gas settling in a nuclear ring, currently preventing more gas from being accreted while the gas reservoir is replenished, and explain the relatively low luminosity of the AGN and the faintness of the molecular gas...|$|E
40|$|A {{steerable}} low-noise {{source of}} illumination is described for shadow-sensors having a displacement sensitivity of ∼ 100 pm (rms) /√Hz, at 500 Hz, over a measuring span {{of at least}} ± 0. 5 mm. These sensors were designed to detect lateral "Violin-Mode" resonances in the highly tensioned fused-silica suspension fibres of the test-masses/mirrors for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory gravitational wave detectors. The shadow sensors—one intended {{for each of the}} four fibres in a suspension—comprised a source of Near InfraRed (NIR) radiation (emitter) and a differential shadow-displacement <b>sensor</b> (<b>detector),</b> these bracketing the fibre under test. The suspension fibres themselves were approximately 600 mm long by 0. 4 mm in diameter, and when illuminated from the side, they cast narrow, vertical, shadows onto their respective detectors—these being located at an effective distance of 50 fibre diameters behind the axes of the fibres themselves. The emitter described here was designed to compensate for a significant degree of mechanical drift or creep over time in the mean position of its suspension fibre. This was achieved by employing five adjacent columns of 8 × miniature NIR LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes, λ = 890 nm), with one column being activated at a time. When used in conjunction with a "reverse Galilean" telescope, the LED sources allowed the collimated beam from the emitter to be steered azimuthally in fine angular increments (0. 65 ◦), causing the fibre's shadow to move laterally, in a step-wise manner, across the plane of its facing detector. Each step in shadow position was approximately 0. 23 mm in size, and this allowed the fibre's shadow to be re-centred, so as to bridge once again both elements of its photodiode detector—even if the fibre was off-centred by as much as ± 0. 5 mm. Re-centring allowed Violin-Mode vibrations of the fibre to be sensed once again as differential AC photocurrents, these flowing in anti-phase in the two elements of the "split-photodiode" detector.

40|$|The Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) {{instrument}} onboard the Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite {{was launched}} on 28 October 2011. The VIIRS has 5 imagery spectral bands (I-bands), 16 moderate resolution spectral bands (M-bands) and a panchromatic day/night band (DNB). Performance of the VIIRS spatial response and band-to-band co-registration (BBR) was measured through intensive pre-launch tests. These measurements {{were made in}} the non-aggregated zones near the start (or end) of scan for the I-bands and M-bands and for a limited number of aggregation modes for the DNB in order to test requirement compliance. This paper presents results based on a recently re-processed pre-launch test data. <b>Sensor</b> (<b>detector)</b> spatial impulse responses in the scan direction are parameterized in terms of ground dynamic field of view (GDFOV), horizontal spatial resolution (HSR), modulation transfer function (MTF), ensquared energy (EE) and integrated out-of-pixel (IOOP) spatial response. Results are presented for the non-aggregation, 2 -sample and 3 -sample aggregation zones for the I-bands and M-bands, and for a limited number of aggregation modes for the DNB. On-orbit GDFOVs measured for the 5 I-bands in the scan direction using a straight bridge are also presented. Band-to-band co-registration (BBR) is quantified using the prelaunch measured band-to-band offsets. These offsets may be expressed as fractions of horizontal sampling intervals (HSIs), detector spatial response parameters GDFOV or HSR. BBR bases on HSIs in the non-aggregation, 2 -sample and 3 -sample aggregation zones are presented. BBR matrices based on scan direction GDFOV and HSR are compared to the BBR matrix based on HSI in the non-aggregation zone. We demonstrate that BBR based on GDFOV is a better representation of footprint overlap and so this definition should be used in BBR requirement specifications.

40|$|NASA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and {{upcoming}} cosmology science missions carry instruments {{with multiple}} focal planes populated with many large <b>sensor</b> <b>detector</b> arrays. These sensors are passively cooled to low temperatures for low-level light (L 3) and near-infrared (NIR) signal detection, and the sensor readout electronics circuitry must perform at extremely low noise levels to enable new required science measurements. Because {{we are at}} the technological edge of enhanced performance for sensors and readout electronics circuitry, as determined by thermal noise level at given temperature in analog domain, we must find new ways of further compensating for the noise in the signal digital domain. To facilitate this new approach, state-of-the-art sensors are augmented at their array hardware boundaries by non-illuminated reference pixels, which can be used to reduce noise attributed to sensors. There are a few proposed methodologies of processing in the digital domain the information carried by reference pixels, as employed by the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope Projects. These methods involve using spatial and temporal statistical parameters derived from boundary reference pixel information to enhance the active (non-reference) pixel signals. To make a step beyond this heritage methodology, we apply the NASA-developed technology known as the Hilbert- Huang Transform Data Processing System (HHT-DPS) for reference pixel information processing and its utilization in reconfigurable hardware on-board a spaceflight instrument or post-processing on the ground. The methodology examines signal processing for a 2 -D domain, in which high-variance components of the thermal noise are carried by both active and reference pixels, similar to that in processing of low-voltage differential signals and subtraction of a single analog reference pixel from all active pixels on the sensor. Heritage methods using the aforementioned statistical parameters in the digital domain (such as statistical averaging of the reference pixels themselves) zeroes out the high-variance components, and the counterpart components in the active pixels remain uncorrected. This paper describes how the new methodology was demonstrated through analysis of fast-varying noise components using the Hilbert-Huang Transform Data Processing System tool (HHT-DPS) developed at NASA and the high-level programming language MATLAB (Trademark of MathWorks Inc.), as well as alternative methods for correcting for the high-variance noise component, using an HgCdTe sensor data.
