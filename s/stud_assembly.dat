40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{moisture}} intrusion and fungal {{attack on the}} maximum load capacity of nailed assemblies was investigated using one white- and one brown-rot fungus against four material combinations over a 35 -wk period. Wetting significantly reduced the maximum load capacity of all four material combinations, whereas wetting and autoclaving only affected the oriented strandboard (OSB) sheathing/spruce <b>stud</b> <b>assembly.</b> The white-rot fungus (Trametes versicolor) had no {{significant effect on the}} maximum load, whereas the brown-rot fungus (Gloeophyllum trabeum) produced significant load reductions on shear connector assemblies with OSB sheathing. Results indicate that moisture remains the dominant initial factor in the performance when water intrudes into wall assemblies...|$|E
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb <b>stud</b> <b>assembly</b> tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to reduce seismic damage to partition walls and other finishes in light-frame residential buildings, twenty full-scale gypsum-sheathed walls, built with wood and cold-formed steel framing members, were tested. The experiments investigated the effects of enhanced, inexpensive construction procedures with the objective to increase the racking strength and stiffness of partition-type shear walls, lessening seismic deformations. The stiffness, strength, and damage progression of the specimens with varying wall length, openings, orthogonal wall returns, tie-down and anchoring configurations, and interior and exterior sheathings are reported in this thesis. Iterative tests of specific interior wall geometries determined the optimal construction techniques required to reduce deformations and improve life-cycle performance. The main improvement to these specimens over typical construction {{was the use of}} construction adhesive and mechanical fasteners to attach the sheathing to the framing. Additional enhancements included mid-height blocking, improved corner <b>stud</b> <b>assemblies,</b> properly sized tie downs at the ends of wall segments, and bent straps on the exterior of planar wood-framed walls. The stiffness, strength, and residual capacity of specimens with orthogonal walls increased as compared to specimens with in-plane-only shear walls. Civil Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assemblies.</b> The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the wall assemblies were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assemblies.</b> Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented.

50|$|The Motorized Shelf - The contestants must {{install a}} {{shelving}} unit that raises and lowers using an electrical motor. Key to passing is locating the ceiling joists, which Matt finds easily with small drill holes with a screw (instead of a drill bit) {{after failing to}} find the joists with a <b>stud</b> finder. <b>Assembly</b> quickly follows, and he passes easily. The others, in finding the joists, make much larger holes: Angela and Simon with drywall saws, Deen and Cory with sledgehammers. Because {{of the cost of}} repairing the plastered ceiling, the rest fail even if their shelves function. Deen, however, also fails as he decides to cut his mounting bracket, voiding the unit's warranty. Simon fails due to running out of time.|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of performance-based codes and fire safety design options, the need for {{validated}} fire resistance models becomes essential. In this paper, a one-dimensional heat transfer model is presented. The model predicts the temperature distribution across steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assemblies</b> with either glass or rock fibre insulation in the wall cavity. A number of assumptions were made to reduce {{the complexity of the}} model. A comparison between temperature predictions and measured temperatures at different surfaces across loaded and unloaded assemblies is presented. Comparison between the predicted and measured fire resistance for non-loadbearing assemblies is also presented. The model predicts the temperature for the stud flanges on the exposed and unexposed sides that are necessary for predicting the fire resistance of loadbearing wall assemblies. Limitations of the model and future improvements are identified. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of 2 full-scale fire resistance tests conducted on load-bearing gypsum board protected, wood <b>stud</b> shear wall <b>assemblies.</b> The wall assembly had an asymmetrical installation (1 x 2) with a layer of gypsum board on both exposed and unexposed sides and a shear membrane as a base layer on the unexposed side of the wood stud frame. The gypsum board used was 12. 7 mm thick Type X and the shear membranes used were of 12. 7 mm and 8. 5 mm thick plywood. The insulation used were of cellulose and glass fibre type. These two tests were conducted to determine the effect of insulation and of shear membrane thickness on the fire resistance of gypsum board protected, wood <b>stud</b> shear wall <b>assemblies.</b> A discussion of these results in relation to other similar tests that were conducted previously, are presented in the paper. i WOOD STUD SHEAR WALLS V.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of 10 full-scale fire resistance tests conducted at the National Fire Laboratory on load-bearing gypsum board protected, wood <b>stud</b> shear wall <b>assemblies</b> with and without resilient channels on the fire-exposed side. The two assembly arrangements studied were: symmetrical installation 1 x 1 (one layer of gypsum board on each of the exposed and unexposed sides) and asymmetrical installation of the shear membrane (one layer of gypsum board on both the exposed and unexposed sides and a shear wall membrane as a base layer alternating between the exposed (2 x 1) and unexposed sides (1 x 2)) on a wood stud frame. The gypsum board was 12. 7 mm thick Type X. The insulations used were glass and rock fibres. The shear membranes used were plywood and oriented strand board (OSB). Tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} the placement of the shear membrane on the exposed/unexposed face, type of shear membrane, insulation type, load intensity and resilient channel installations on the fire resistance of gypsum board protected, wood <b>stud</b> shear wall <b>assemblies.</b> Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire tests, are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Based on Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) requirements, project {{specific}} blast loads {{are determined}} {{for the design}} of a new airport traffic control tower. These blast loads must be resisted by exterior wall panels on the control tower, protecting building occupants from intentional explosives attack scenarios. Such blast resistant walls are typically constructed of thick reinforced concrete panels or composite steel plate and rolled sections, as conventional building cladding systems have relatively low blast resistance. While these more robust design approaches are valid, the additional cladding mass they represent will significantly increase the base shear and overturning demand in seismic zones. This paper investigates the use of a light structural system comprised of a steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assembly</b> partially embedded in a thin layer of concrete to obtain composite action. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are also included to increase the blast resistance and aid in keeping the panel weight to a minimum. Two full-scale composite steel stud walls are designed, constructed, and tested dynamically in the BakerRisk shock tube. The stud walls consist of back-to-back 150 mm deep, 14 gauge (1. 8 mm thick), cold-formed steel studs spaced at 610 mm on center. Both specimens have a 50 mm thick normal weight concrete layer, reinforced with welded wire mesh that is welded to the stu...|$|R
40|$|Currently, ASHRAE has {{determined}} the zone method and modified zone method are appropriate calculation methods for materials {{with a high}} difference in conductivity, such as cold-formed steel (CFS) walls. Because there is currently no standard U-Factor calculation method for CFS walls, designers and code officials alike tend to resort to the zone method. However, the zone method is restricted to larger span assemblies because the zone factor coefficient is 2. 0. This tends to overestimate the amount of surface area influenced by CFS. The modified zone method is restricted to C-shaped <b>stud,</b> clear wall <b>assemblies</b> with framing factors between 9 and 15 %. The objective of the research is to narrow the gap of knowledge by re-examining the modified zone method in order to more accurately determine R-Values and U-Factors for CFS wall assemblies with whole wall framing factor percentages of 22 % and above...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We explore, in this paper, {{the demands}} and {{behavior}} on fasteners supplying sheathing-based bracing of gravity loaded cold-formed <b>studs</b> and wall <b>assemblies.</b> The studies {{are carried out}} by shell finite element (FE) models, which are compared to analytical solutions and previously completed laboratory tests conducted by the authors. The connection between the sheathing and the stud {{should be able to}} develop enough resistance to restrain global buckling of the studs; therefore, special attention has to be given to the demands on these connections for design. Local buckling and stress concentrations may damage some connections and redistribution of forces should be ensured. Classical practice for determining fastener demand - i. e., the 2 % rule - may be deficient. An analytical method developed for determining fastener demand is compared to the FE models presented in this paper; the analytical method results in a reasonable prediction of the fastener forces in wall studs...|$|R
