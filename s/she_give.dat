When he finds out that Mrs. Norval has told Lola to sleep in the maid's chambers, he demands that <b>she</b> <b>give</b> Lola a proper furnished room. While other characters wish to keep Lola for purely financial reasons, Dr. Norval and Julian's motivations are more altruistic. Dr. Norval refuses to accept the half of Lola's immense fortune that her mother had insisted. Instead, he only takes six percent of Lola's inheritance. He and his son Julian are the only characters who do not reflect the self-deception, greed and hypocrisy that the novel criticizes as the American national character.|$|E

25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that <b>she</b> <b>give</b> up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{was earning}} a {{substantial}} amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from Parc Monceau. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater impresario named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that <b>she</b> <b>give</b> private performances {{in the homes of}} wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie. When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of Phédre on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, Le Misantrhope and Les Précieuses.|$|E

In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, sporting a black bodysuit with yellow gloves, boots and a bat-symbol along with a blue cape and cowl (similar to Batman's), Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists <b>she</b> <b>give</b> up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.|$|E

She also commended her [...] "stunning vocals". Likewise, Chad Grischow of the website IGN wrote that the song gives Beyoncé's vocals room to shine with [...] "some beautifully soft verses and [...] belted hook". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] a fantastic and dramatic song. Similarly, Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua wrote, [...] "There's a great melodramatic kick to this song, which comes across like a quiet storm slow jam spiced up with modern drum programming. 'I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you' is an unusually self-pitying lyric for Beyoncé, but she sells it well regardless." [...] Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism for the song, writing: ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1891, the Prince was implicated {{as having}} been {{involved}} with a former Gaiety Theatre chorus girl, Lydia Miller (stage name Lydia Manton), who committed suicide by drinking carbolic acid. Although she was the nominal mistress of Lord Charles Montagu, who gave evidence at the inquest, it was alleged that he was merely a cover for the Prince who had requested <b>she</b> <b>give</b> up her theatrical career on his behalf, and that the authorities sought to suppress the case by making the inquest private and refusing access to the depositions. Similarly to the Cleveland Street scandal only overseas newspapers printed Albert Victor's name, but regional British newspapers did quote the radical London newspaper The Star which published: [...] "It is a fact so well known that the blind denials of it given in some quarters are childishly futile. Lydia Manton was the petite amie of a certain young prince, and that, too, quite recently." [...] It was labelled [...] "a scandal of the first magnitude... on the lips of every clubman", and compared to the Tranby Croft affair, in which his father was called to give evidence at a trial for slander.|$|E

500|$|Suspicious of the {{identity}} of the unknown woman based on the carpoolers' general description, Walter Jones called Sharon Kinne and asked if she had seen or spoken to his wife. Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her late Friday evening and insisted <b>she</b> <b>give</b> him more details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key to her throat threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he had been the one to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{stated that}} he had been asked to develop a new female {{character}} in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she {{had nothing to do with}} a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show." [...] Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season. Barbara Gordon and alter ego Batgirl debuted in Detective Comics #359, [...] "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl" [...] (1967). In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career.

500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death without seeming to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't <b>she</b> <b>give</b> long, piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel? Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E

2500|$|The Kübler-Ross model, {{commonly}} known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book, On Death and Dying. Kubler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving. [...] Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill and it was not until much later in her career did <b>she</b> <b>give</b> into the notion that it could be applied to those grieving. [...] She once remarked that it's hard to deny that a loved one has died, but easier to deny that you, in fact, are terminally ill. [...] The popular but largely untested theory describes in five distinct stages how people deal with grief and tragedy. Such events might include being diagnosed with a terminal illness or enduring a catastrophic loss.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the post-war}} years, Flagstad was also {{responsible}} for {{the world premiere of}} Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs. Strauss had written the pieces during his exile in Switzerland following the war (like Flagstad, he had been vilified as a collaborator with the Nazis). He intended them to be premiered by Flagstad, though not because he had her voice in mind. (The songs are better suited to the lyic soprano voice he idealised throughout his life, as exemplified by Elisabeth Schumann and ultimately his wife Pauline de Ahna. Strauss, moreover, had heard praise for Flagstad over the years, but had not heard her sing in person since casting her as the soprano soloist in the 1933 Bayreuth Festival performance of the Beethoven Choral Symphony.) It was, rather, out of sympathy for her difficulties. He sent Flagstad a letter, accompanied by a collection of his own works which he desired her to consider adding to her repertoire, and requested that <b>she</b> <b>give</b> the premiere - together with [...] "a first-class conductor and ensemble" [...] - of these four new orchestral lieder, at that point still in the publication process.|$|E
