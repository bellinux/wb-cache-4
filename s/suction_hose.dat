25|$|A notable {{exception}} to this trend are the inshore diamond diving operations {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, where hookah is still the standard equipment for diamondiferous gravel extraction in the hostile conditions of the surf zone, where the water temperature is usually around 8 to 10°C, visibility is usually low, and surge is often strong. Divers work shifts of about two hours with a crowbar and a <b>suction</b> <b>hose,</b> are heavily weighted to stay in place while working, and the standard method of ascent is to ditch the weighted harness and regulator and make a free swimming ascent. The next diver will free dive down the airline, fit the regulator and wriggle into the harness before continuing with the job. Until the South African abalone fishery was closed, hookah was the only mode of diving permitted for harvesting wild abalone, and several aspects of this practice were in direct contravention of the diving regulations at the time. Abalone divers were not allowed to have a standby diver on the boat.|$|E

500|$|Large {{quantities}} of methane clathrate {{exist on the}} seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around [...] and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometers (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese, and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for nickel was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources. In suitable locations, diamonds are gathered from the seafloor using <b>suction</b> <b>hoses</b> to bring gravel ashore. In deeper waters, mobile seafloor crawlers are used and the deposits are pumped to a vessel above. In Namibia, more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land.|$|R
50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the <b>suction</b> <b>hoses.</b> A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7-8 kg/m². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Biofilms in {{dental unit}} waterlines (DUWLs), <b>suction</b> <b>hoses,</b> and {{fittings}} are a potentially {{significant source of}} cross-contamination posing significant health risk as these may {{come into contact with}} patients during treatment. The purpose of this in vitro study was to identify the spectrum of bacterial flora colonizing the DUWLs and to detect pathogenic microorganisms present in such an environmental niche. Materials and Methods: Thirty DUWL samples were collected from in use dental units selected randomly from various clinical departments. Samples were collected from the following devices; 3 -in- 1 syringe waterline, section of waterline tubing supplying the 3 -in- 1 syringe, and the air rotor water. The samples were subjected to bacteriological analysis, and all bacterial isolates were tested for their ability to form biofilms. Results: A descriptive analysis of the results obtained was carried out, and it was observed that 7 out of 30 (23. 3 %) samples collected from DUWL were supplying water of unsatisfactory quality with species of low-pathogenicity bacteria isolated present in significant numbers; four of ten (40 %) water supply lines contained bacterial biofilms; and the species with greatest capability to form biofilms were Enterobacter species (spp.). In addition, the results were also subjected to Chi-square test which revealed no statistical difference between the species and the location of collection of samples. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it is concluded that DUWLs are not totally free of contamination. Microbial biofilms are a significant source of cross-contamination and cross-infection in the dental clinic environment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDecontaminating {{dental chair}} unit (DCU) suction systems in a convenient, safe and {{effective}} manner is problematic. This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU suction system residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated Suction Tube Cleaning System (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU suction systems effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume <b>suction</b> <b>hoses.</b> Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU suction systems reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire suction system. ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU suction systems and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU suction systems become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction handpieces cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources. The automated STCS DCU suction disinfection system used with single component handpieces provides an effective solution...|$|R
500|$|When {{being used}} in a {{drafting}} operation from a pool, portable water tank, or other uncovered water source, the length of hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> farthest from the pump is usually attached to a strainer, to keep foreign objects in the water from being pulled into and damaging the pump. [...] If used in a pond, stream, or other body of water, an appropriate flotation device must be used to keep the strainer below the surface and above the bottom, so that neither mud nor air are sucked into the fire engine's pump. [...] When drafting from a solid-bottomed tank or pool, a strainer can safely rest on the bottom without suctioning mud into the fire engine's pump.|$|E
2500|$|Early pumpers used cisterns as {{a source}} of water. Water was later put into wooden pipes under the streets and a [...] "fire plug" [...] was pulled out of the top of the pipe when a <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> was to be inserted. Later systems {{incorporated}} pressurized fire hydrants, where the pressure was increased when a fire alarm was sounded. This was found to be harmful to the system and unreliable. Today's valved hydrant systems are kept under pressure at all times, although additional pressure may be added when needed. Pressurized hydrants eliminate much of the work in obtaining water for pumping through the engine and into the attack hoses. Many rural fire engines still rely upon cisterns or other sources for drafting water into the pumps.Steam pumper came in to use in the 1850s.|$|E

The amount of manpower and skill necessary for firefighting prompted Benjamin Franklin to found an organized fire company in 1737. Thomas Lote built the first fire engine made in America in 1743. These earliest engines are called hand tubs because they are manually (hand) powered and the water was supplied by a bucket brigade dumping it into a tub (cistern) where the pump had a permanent intake pipe. An important advancement around 1822 was the invention of an engine which could draft water from a water source. This rendered the bucket brigade obsolete. In 1822, a Philadelphia-based manufacturing company called Sellers and Pennock made a model called [...] "The Hydraulion". It {{is said to be}} the first suction engine.
