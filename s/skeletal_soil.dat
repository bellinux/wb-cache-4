50|$|This eremophila occurs {{from central}} Queensland south to near Yowah and Thylungra, usually growing in Acacia {{woodland}} in <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> in rocky places or along watercourses.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, the {{mountains}} {{of the west and}} southwest are made up mainly of Precambrian and Ordovician quartzites, sedimentaries and conglomerates. They occur as a series of elongated ridges in a north-south arrangement. These rocks provide very nutrient poor <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> and the main nutrient resource is accumulated through from degrading vegetation in humus and shallow peats.|$|E
50|$|Where a <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> layer has {{developed}} on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, patches of grassland occur, with species characteristic of base-rich soils, such as quaking grass, Briza media, and limestone bedstraw, Galium sterneri. On shallow slopes, this {{gives way to}} a neutral grassland characterised by false oat-grass, Arrhenatherum elatius, and Yorkshire fog, Holcus lanatus. Above the quarry, this is replaced by acid grassland, in which wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, is dominant.|$|E

5000|$|Smooth Island {{was formed}} about 7700 {{years ago when}} sea levels rose {{at the start of}} the Holocene. [...] The island’s geology {{consists}} of a ‘granite base and thin calcarenite mantle’ which is ‘likely to be fragmented into jagged rocks and shingles, with a sandy, <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> filling depressions’ in areas that are ‘beyond the reach of storm waves‘. [...] The island’s steep sides drop into water of depth equal or greater than 20 m.|$|E
50|$|Pioneering fauna will colonize an area {{only after}} flora and fungi have {{inhabited}} the area. Soil fauna, ranging from microscopic protists to larger invertebrates, {{have a role}} in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Bacteria and fungi are the most important groups in the breakdown of organic detritus left by primary producing plants such as <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil,</b> moss and algae. Soil invertebrates enhance fungal activity by breaking down detritus. As soil develops, earthworms and ants alter soil characteristics. Worm burrows aerate soil and ant hills alter sediment particle size dispersal, altering soil character profoundly.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{lies on the}} {{northern}} edge of the archipelago, the island is particularly exposed to high winds and salt spray. Consequently, the thin <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> is covered in wind-blown maritime heath made up principally of western gorse (Ulex gallii), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). English stonecrop (Sedum anglicum), bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) can be found growing among the heath and gorse. On the deeper soils, bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) dominates, with bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum). Along the western coast of the island is a small area of maritime grassland with the usual Isles of Scilly species of red fescue (Festuca rubra), thrift (Armeria maritima), common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis), buck’s-horn plantain (Plantago coronopus) and sea beet (Beta maritima). In April 2001 the first confirmed Scillonian record (since 1967) of the RDB gilt-edged lichen (Pseudocyphellaria aurata) was found on White Island. A widespread and frequent species in the tropics, often found in Macaronesia but rare on mainland Europe, this is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority species and is protected under schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.|$|E

40|$|Ecological and ecophysiological {{investigations}} {{carried out}} at the ultramafic outcrop near Meikle Kilrannoch, Angus, Scotland are reported. The outcrop is botanically famous for its rare plant species, particularly the endemic Cerastium fontanum ssp. scoticum and the nationally rare Lychnis alnina. The studies were made on the main outcrop (called MK 1) which is dome shaped, and on a much smaller low-lying area (called MK 1. 5) about 300 m from it. The overall aim of the studies {{was to investigate the}} relationship between the soil physico-chemical environment and species distribution on the open areas of the ultramafic site and to experimentally test for causality; and to offer an explanation for the open character of the vegetation on the skeletal soils. Variograms which were constructed for soil properties and vegetation data to investigate soil micro-spatial variation and vegetation pattern showed differing levels of spatial dependence, always indicating high intrinsic variability. The cause of this high variability was probably cryoturbation for the soil and morphological characters for plants. The gradient analyses (Principal Components Analysis and its canonical form, Redundancy Analysis) used to study soil - vegetation correlations suggested that A ostis vinealis, Cerastium fontanum ssp. scoticum and Lychnis alpina were most abundant in areas up-slope with lower concentrations of soil magnesium; Cochlearia pyrenaica ssp. alpina and Festuca rubra were associated with bigger stone sizes, and the latter occurred in wetter areas with higher of ions. A comparative solution culture experiment based on the local soil chemistry was used to study the growth responses to magnesium and nickel of Cerastium fontanum ss. scoticum, Cochlearia pyrenaica ssp. al ina and Festuca rubra. The results for Festuca and Cerastium were in agreement with the findings of the gradient analysis: Festuca was indifferent to both magnesium and nickel and Cerastium was susceptible to high magnesium; the reduction of dry weight by nickel in the Cochlearia conflicted with its suggested association with high soil nickel in the gradient analysis. The impacts on the photosynthetic systems of three Cochlearia species of different concentrations of iron and nickel were identifiable only in the non-ultramafic C. pyrenaica where the addition of nickel decreased photosynthesis but the effect could be ameliorated by the addition of high concentrations of iron. The open character of the <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> at the MK 1 site was discussed in terms of 'carrying capacity'. Vegetation development was suggested to be controlled at least partly by large stones covering the soil surface. Further factors such as space fragmentation, possible plant-to-plant interactions, and low density of flowering individuals and restricted seed dispersal were also considered. To test if major nutrients were limiting plant growth, major nutrients (NPK) were applied to the MK 1. 5 <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil.</b> The significantly higher X's and recruitment and change in life history traits (larger rosette sizes, earlier maturing and higher seed production) in the fertilised populations of C. pyrenaica ssp. alpina resulted in a significantly higher plant cover in the fertilised quadrats. The better growth of plants in the fertilised quadrats was reflected in their lower total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in May and their higher TNC in August. The present series of investigations found that magnesium and nickel toxicity had an effect on the intra-site distribution of the ultramafic species and also confirmed earlier reports on the importance of magnesium and nickel toxicity in ultsamafic exclusion. Large stones and low soil phosphorus concentration are proposed as limiting factors for the development of closed vegetation on the <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> areas of the sites...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{soils are}} not {{suitable}} for agriculture, and often are allocated to marginal uses such as cherry orchards for timber production. These require some agricultural practices (irrigation, soil tillage or weed control) which {{can contribute to the}} development of a hardpan. Compacted layers can adversely affect timber production, so subsoiling works are required. This study examined the effect of six years of tillage on hardpan formation in a <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> by means of mechanical impedance measurements with a dynamic penetrometer cone (dynamic cone test), a method that is quick and easy to use, but can suffer from interference by stones. Mechanical impedances along the soil profile were measured in four plots differing in tillage (with or without) and drip irrigation (with or without) treatments. Exploratory data analysis together with statistical inference techniques related to linear general models were applied. The presence of a transitional layer on top of the hardpan is suggested in the non-tilled plot and soil depth that can be explored easily by roots has increased by 20 cm.

40|$|In Thailand, stony {{soils are}} mainly located in {{hillside}} areas. Even {{though they have}} physical limitations for agricultural use and {{they are exposed to}} a risk for soil erosion, they continue to be used for crop production. A good understanding of the hydraulic characteristics of soils containing an important fraction of rock fragments is crucial for soil and water management in these areas. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of different rock fragment contents on effective hydraulic properties of <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil</b> with a clay content lower than 35 % using measurements of the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity. A tension infiltrometer was used to determine the field hydraulic conductivity at four pressure heads (h) of 0, − 30, − 60 and − 120 mm. Soil water retention was determined on a pressure plate between − 33 and − 1500 kPa. Finally, the Hydrus- 1 D was used to predict soil moisture dynamics using the obtained effective hydraulic parameters. The results show a decreasing water retention capacity with increasing rock fragment content. The saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with increasing stone contents from 0 to 20 %, but then increased for increasing stone content. Contradicting behavior can be observed using field and lab measurements, clearly exposing the need for a better understanding of the functioning of stony soils. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Desertification {{is one of}} the world’s most {{alarming}} {{process of}} environmental degradation not as a natural problem of advancing deserts, but a phenomenon of land degradation due to loss of land’s biological productivity, caused by human induced factors and climate change. It affects one third of the earth’s surface and over a billion people. Moreover, it has potentially devasting consequences in terms of social and economic costs. The pilot project at the behest of Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of India has been taken up by the Space Applications Centre. Ratlam district of Madhya Pradesh has been included in 10 districts selected for pilot study in the country. Ratlam district is situated in the extreme western part of Madhya Pradesh. It is a part of Malwa Plateau and making boundary with Rajasthan state also. It is being affected by the desertification process of nature extending from Rajasthan side, as observed during the last few decades. Mass scale cattle grazing, lowering of ground water table, non-availability of surface water, scanty rainfall, <b>skeletal</b> <b>soil,</b> loss of vegetation cover etc., are some the major problems of the district. Due to these problems the area is being converted into the desert alarmingly. Maps depicting landuse/landcover, process of degradation and severity of degradation of Ratlam district have been prepared on 1 : 50, 000 scale using IRS- 1 C/ 1 D LISS III data for Rabi and Kharif seasons pertaining to normal monsoon/rainfall seasons. Analysis of results for Ratlam district reveals that about 50, 780 ha. area of land with scrub was affected by degradation process such as vegetation degradation (46, 800 ha.), water erosion (398 ha.). Out of total geographical area 23, 850 ha. of forest area was affected by vegetation degradation. Total barren/rocky area affected was about 4, 230 ha out of it 140 ha. was affected by water erosion.
