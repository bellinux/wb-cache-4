It {{is a good example}} of the multiple viewpoints seen in Giambologna's work; the <b>spiralling</b> <b>movement</b> of the bodies means that there is no main view. The dramatic pose is based on a composition by Michelangelo, who was in his late seventies when Giambologna met him in Rome. The group was carved from just one block of marble, supported by only five narrow points. Although the marble is weathered from three centuries outdoors, it still shows Giambologna's sensitive carving.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} robot-deployment {{algorithm}} that overcomes unpredicted obstacles and employs full-coverage deployment with a minimal number of sensor nodes. Without the location information, node placement and <b>spiral</b> <b>movement</b> policies are {{proposed for the}} robot to deploy sensors efficiently to achieve power conservation and full coverage, while an obstacle surrounding movement policy is proposed to reduce the impacts of an obstacle upon deployment. Simulation results reveal that the proposed robot-deployment algorithm outperforms most ex-isting robot-deployment mechanisms in power conservation and obstacle resistance and therefore achieves a better deployment performance.

For the first type of oscillations, we suggest an explanation based on a relaxation between two convective modes mediated by a <b>spiraling</b> <b>movement.</b> For sufficiently higher values of ΔT, the system goes to a temporal chaotic state, then loses its spatial coherence, an essential feature of the two previous regimes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{principles}} {{for the development}} of retailing and the urban centre structure. The main conclusion is that a projection of the trend of recent years could hardly be expected {{in spite of the fact}} that this is what most forecasts for retailing and centres are based upon. What is more likely to happen is a development in the form of a <b>spiral</b> <b>movement</b> which consequently makes it necessary to try other forecasting methods and other forms of mathematical models, different from the traditional ones. Such improved methods provide the basis also for an improved planning technique which in turn not only gives a split-second picture of the future situation, but also indicates how this situation is reached through extensive use of stage-planning. ...|$|R
40|$|Registration of {{aerial image}} with {{airborne}} LiDAR data {{is a key}} to feature extraction. A registration model based on Pl&# 252;cker line is proposed. The relative position and attitude relationship between the conjugate lines in LiDAR and image is determined based on Pl&# 252;cker linear equation, which describes line transformation in space, then coplanarity condition equation is established. Finally, coordinate transformation between image point and corresponding LiDAR point is achieved by the <b>spiral</b> <b>movement</b> of Pl&# 252;cker lines in the image. The registration model of Pl&# 252;cker linear coplanarity condition equation is simple, and jointly describes the rotation and translation to avoid coupling error between them, so the accuracy is approved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reject or to confirm the {{hypothesis}} that the influence of the water addition rate on the size and size distribution of pellets is caused by insufficient spreading of the added water at higher water addition rates. To overcome insufficient spreading of the added water, the agitation in the rotary processor is intensified by improving the <b>spiral,</b> rope-like <b>movement</b> by means of two baffles and a permanent PTFE coating, and by installing a chopper. Improvement of the <b>spiral,</b> rope-like <b>movement</b> moderates the influence of the water addition rate on the pellet size. The chopper has no significant influence on pellet size, pellet size distribution, or percentage of agglomerates for the pellets, which are investigated in this study. Furthermore, the implementation of the technical modifications does not influence the dissolution characteristics of the pellets directly. It is therefore concluded that the water added is well spread over the mass by ensuring an optimal <b>spiral,</b> rope-like <b>movement,</b> so that incorporation of a chopper is superfluous. The remaining influence of the water addition rate on the pellet size can most probably be explained by differences in processing time, resulting in different volumes of air capable of extracting water from the powder mass. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|He {{travelled}} to Parma (staying from 1669 to 1673), {{where he}} worked in quadratura frescoes.

During this time he may have exchanged ideas with Giovanni Battista Gaulli and Andrea Carlone, both of whom informed his style of work as evidenced by certain qualities adopted after his return to Genoa, such as graceful elongations and vertical <b>spiral</b> <b>movements</b> of the figures, which in turn suggests additional influence by the sculptors Filippo Parodi and Bernardo Schiaffino.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an unique method for rendering complex shapes as fuzzy or diffuse objects inside virtual environments. It uses surface geometry that is {{converted into a}} voxel-like grid to specify {{the appearance of the}} shape. A particle system displays the outline of the object at runtime. Particles are allowed to move freely inside the voxel-grid but obtain certain attributes from the voxels they currently reside in. Those attributes assign color, size, textures, transparency to the particles, as well as forces that influence the movement of the particles. Force effects include linear and <b>spiral</b> <b>movements,</b> gravitational points, and helix-shaped motion of particles. Through this, complex movement of the particles inside the voxel-space can be created at interactive rates, while still maintaining the approximate form of the original surface geometry...|$|R
