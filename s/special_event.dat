5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a <b>special</b> <b>event</b> might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, {{the party}} held a fundraiser which {{featured}} erotic art meant to illustrate political themes and a performance piece involving couples having sex behind a screen, erotic poetry, and body painting. After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a <b>special</b> <b>event</b> liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review. Both a provincial court and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.|$|E

40|$|Tutkielman päätavoitteena on kuvata ohjelmapalveluiden tilaa case-alueella. Ohjelmapalveluiden tilaa on käsitelty viidestä eri näkökulmasta: Alueellisessa näkökulmassa on haluttu saada tietoon todelliset syyt, miksi asiakas, eli turisti tulee juuri case-alueelle. Ohjelmapalveluryhmä –näkökulmassa on tarkasteltu, millaisia ohjelmapalveluita case–alueella käytetään. Asiakasyhteys –näkökulmassa on määritelty asiakaskunnat, jotka näitä ohjelmapalveluja käyttävät. Tyytyväisyys tarjontaan ja kehitystarpeet –näkökulmassa on tuotu esille ohjelmapalvelujen kehitystarpeita sekä tyytyväisyyttä ohjelmapalveluiden tarjontaan. Yhteistyön kehittämisnäkökulmassa on haettu vastauksia ohjelmapalveluyrittäjän sekä palvelun ostajan yhteistyötoimintaan ja sen kehittämiseen. Tutkielmassa on käytetty kvalitatiivista eli laadullista tutkimusta. Tutkimusmetodiltaan työ on case-tutkimus. Tutkimusmenetelmänä käytettiin henkilökohtaisia haastatteluja. Todellinen tarve tietää alueen ohjelmapalveluiden tilasta sekä halu kehittää case-alueen ohjelmapalveluja antoi sysäyksen tälle tutkielmalle. Alueella toimii erilaisia ohjelmapalveluiden tarjoajia, jotka haluavat kasvattaa asiakasmääriään ja kehittää yhteistyötä välittäjäyritysten kanssa. Matkailun kehittyminen ja kova kilpailu pakottaa ohjelmapalveluyritykset muuntautumaan monipuolisiksi tarjoajiksi, jossa epäonnistumiseen ei ole varaa. Tutkielman tuloksina saatiin aikaan uusia kehittämisideoita. Kehittämisideat kohdistuivat mm. tarjontaan, palveluun, hinnoitteluun, ja yhteistyöhön. ***** The main {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{case study}} {{is to examine the}} state of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> services in the case area. The state of the services is examined from five different perspectives. The first (regional) perspective determines the true reasons, why the tourist comes to the case area. The second (<b>special</b> <b>events)</b> perspective examines what kind of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> are arranged in the case area. The third (customer-oriented) perspective defines the tourists, who use these services. The fourth perspective (customer satisfaction and development targets) introduces some development targets and examines the satisfaction with the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> services offered. The fifth (co-operative) perspective examines the co-operation between the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> entrepreneur and the consumer and proposes some improvements. The data of the study was collected by interviews. This study was triggered by the need to examine the state of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> and to develop the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> services in the case area. There are different <b>special</b> <b>events</b> providers in the case area, who want to expand their clientele and improve the co-operation with the suppliers.

In September 2007, the company organized a unification tournament where all of the champions and first contenders participated. Over {{the course of the}} tournament, he won the GPCW Super-X Monster Championship and IWC World Heavyweight Championship, and on the tournament's finale, he became the first wrestler to win the AAA Mega Championship. While working in Mexico, Cosme signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he debuted as Judas Mesias on September 13, 2007. In March 2008 his association with TNA came to an end and he focused most of his time on AAA. In 2010 Cosme debuted for Puerto Rican World Wrestling Council, where he won the Universal Heavyweight Championship. He also wrestles in Lucha Underground under the ring name Mil Muertes.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and <b>special</b> <b>event</b> standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{broadcast of the}} concert, titled Madonna: The MDNA Tour, aired on Epix in the United States on June 22, 2013. The concert premiered at 8 p.m. EST on Epix's TV network and online at EpixHD.com and on Epix apps. On June 18, the concert special had a world premiere screening at The Paris Theater, in New York City, with Madonna attending the event {{in a press conference}} with the media, celebrities, and fans. A contest was released just for US residents, who had the chance to win two invitations for the <b>special</b> <b>event.</b> The singer wore a black tuxedo and a top hat to the premiere, the ensemble being a tribute to actress Marlene Dietrich and her similar attire in the 1930 film, Morocco. During the Q, Madonna recalled how difficult it was to sometimes perform on the tour, but she and her troupe nevertheless did it. At the end of the session, she showed a trailer from her secretprojectrevolution film with photographer Steven Klein; the one-minute clip featured her background dancers and showed the singer being dragged on the floor. Other shots included Madonna wielding a gun, her dancers in underwear, and religious iconography.|$|E

5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being forced to do demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing snow from parking lots with a shovel and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a <b>special</b> <b>event</b> presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud with The Big Show after a spot where Show refused an offer to work in an enforcer role for Carlito. This feud involved Carlito tricking Show into eating a poisoned apple, and Matt Morgan becoming Carlito's enforcer. This feud ended with Carlito defeating Show at Judgment Day.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Special</b> <b>events</b> {{are common}} {{community-based}} strategies for health promotion. This paper presents findings from a systemati c literature review {{on the impact}} of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> to promote breast, cervical or colorectal cancer education and screening. Methods. Articles in English that focused on <b>special</b> <b>events</b> involving breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer conducted in the U. S. and published between January 1990 and December 2011 were identified from seven databases: Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstract, Cochrane Libraries, and EconLit. Study inclusion and data extraction were independently validated by two researchers. Results: Of the 20 articles selected for screening out of 1, 409, ten articles on <b>special</b> <b>events</b> reported outcome data. Five types of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> were found: health fairs, parties, cultural <b>events,</b> <b>special</b> days, and plays. Many focused on breast cancer only, or in combination with other cancers. Reach ranged from 50 - 1732 participants. All <b>special</b> <b>events</b> used at least one evidence-based strategy suggested by the Community Guide to Preventive Services, such as small media, one-on-one education, and reducing structural barriers. For cancer screening as an outcome of the events, mammography screening rates ranged from 4. 8 % to 88 %, Pap testing was 3. 9 %, and clinical breast exams ranged from 9. 1 % to 100 %. For colorectal screening, FOBT ranged from 29. 4 % to 76 %, and sigmoidoscopy was 100 % at one event. Outcome measures included intentions to get screened, scheduled appointments, uptake of clinical exams, and participation in cancer screening. Conclusions: <b>Special</b> <b>events</b> found in the review varied and used evidence-based strategies. Screening data suggest that some <b>special</b> <b>events</b> can lead to increases in cancer screening, especially if they provide onsite screening services. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that <b>special</b> <b>events</b> are effective in increasing cancer screening. The heterogeneity of populations served, event activities, outcome variables assessed, and the reliance on self-report to measure screening limit conclusions. This study highlights the need for further research to determine the effectiveness of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> to increase cancer screening. © 2014 Escoffery et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
