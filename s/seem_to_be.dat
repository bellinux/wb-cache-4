30|$|In {{the group}} of {{adolescents}} without binge eating, trait anxiety <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> perfectionism (t =  2.63; p = . 01; β = . 60) and interoceptive awareness (t =  2.86; p = . 007; β = . 58). In this group, the neuroticism <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more relevant <b>to</b> perfectionism (t =  3.16; p = . 003; β = . 59), interpersonal distrust (t = − 2.17; p = . 04; β = . 37) and social insecurity (t =  2.56; p = . 01; β = . 47), while the extraversion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negatively related only to interpersonal distrust (t = − 2.21; p = . 03; β = . 34).

Dandelions <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime {{and what happens to}} him later <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion.

If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E
