40|$|Recently {{developed}} forward slotted airfoils {{were applied}} to a UH- 60 A helicopter, and the performance has been estimated. Baseline SC 1095 and SC 1094 R 8 airfoil characteristics were modified based on CFD calculations of an A 3 c <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil</b> to incorporate aerodynamic characteristics of a high-lifting airfoil. The <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil</b> increases maximum thrust of the UH- 60 A helicopter by up to 25 %, but a significant penalty is observed at CTI 9 less than 0. 11. This penalty results from higher drag than the baseline airfoil at low angles of attack. A drag reduction at high Mach numbers is necessary to fully exploit the airfoil capability in the rotorcraft application. Preliminary comparison of the <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil</b> with the wide chord blade shows that the <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil</b> has limited advantages over the wide chord blade...|$|E

The model, representing attached flow, defines viscous pressure distributions, lift, moments, and local boundary-layer properties on each element of an arbitrarily arranged <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil.</b> The final viscous solution is obtained by an iterative technique for successively combining an inviscid solution with boundary-layer displacement thicknesses. Ordinary boundary-layers include laminar, transition, and turbulent types.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of wind-tunnel tests of several airfoils of low aspect ratio. The airfoils included three circular Clark Y airfoils with different amounts of dihedral, two Clark Y <b>airfoils</b> with <b>slots</b> in their portions, and three flat-plate airfoils. Lift, drag, and pitching-moment characteristics of the <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoils</b> with <b>slots</b> open and closed; pitching moment characteristics of one of the <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoils</b> with <b>slots</b> open and closed; and lift characteristics of the flat-plate airfoils are included. The results reveal a definite improvement of lift, drag, and pitching-moment characteristics with increase in dihedral of the circular Clark Y wing. Lift characteristics near the stall were found to depend markedly on the shape of the extreme tip but were not greatly affected by slots through the after portion of the airfoils. Changes in plan form of the flat-plate airfoils gave erroneous indications of the effect to be expected from changes in plan form of an airfoil of Clark Y section. The minimum drag characteristics of the circular Clark Y airfoils were found to be substantially the same as for a Clark Y airfoil of conventional aspect ratio...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of a family of}} two-dimensional airfoils was conducted in the Merrill Wind Tunnel at California Institute of Technology, to determine experimentally the effect of camber on an airfoil that stalls at the nose, and to compare the results with a simplified thin airfoil theory, which requires that flow conditions at the nose be similar. The nine percent thick models had cambers of zero, three, and six percent, and a fourth model with six percent camber had a rear slot at about 70 percent chord. Tests conducted at Reynolds Numbers of 640, 000 and 840, 000 showed that the addition of camber to a nose-stalling airfoil tended to make it a trailing-edge staller or partially so, but that by use of the slot, the stall was shifted back to the nose.

40|$|Recently NAL {{has taken}} {{initiative}} {{to design and}} develop a 70 -seater Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) which is suitable for Indian conditions and can operate with minimum airport infrastructure requirements. An efficient high lift system {{is one of the}} key technical requirements to achieve the goals set for RTA. JUMBO 2 D, a multi-block structured viscous code, has been used to make preliminary analysis of the proposed high lift system for the RTA. The configuration consists of three elements, namely, the main airfoil with nose droop, a vane and a flap. The proposed high lift configuration of RTA has already been analyzed in detail for both take-off and landing conditions with and without nose-droop. The gaps between different elements of double <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil</b> play a major role in determining the effectiveness of this high lift system.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new domain connectivity module developed to support Chimera-based interfacing of different CFD solvers for performing time-dependent, adaptive, and moving body calculations of external aerodynamic flows. The {{capabilities of the}} domain connectivity module are provide {{a powerful tool for}} CFD analysis of morphing vehicles. The domain connectivity module coordinates the data transfer between different solvers applied {{in different parts of the}} computational domain â€” body fitted structured or unstructured to capture viscous near-wall effects, and Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement to capture effects away from the wall. The CFD solvers and the domain connectivity module are executed within a Python-based computational infrastructure. The domain connectivity module is fully parallel and performs all its operations (identification of holes and fringe points, donor cell searches and data interpolation) on the partitioned grid data. In addition, the connectivity procedures are completely automated using the implicit hole-cutting methodology such that no user intervention or explicit hole-map specification is necessary. The capabilities and performance of the package are presented for several test problems, including flow over a NACA 0015 wing, AGARD A 2 <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoil,</b> hover simulation of scaled V- 22 rotor, and a dynamic simulation of UH- 60 A rotor in forward flight.

40|$|A low speed, low noise, {{single stage}} fan was {{designed}} and tested. Design pressure ratio was 1. 5 at a rotor tip speed of 1000 ft/sec. No inlet guide vane was used, the rotor stator was spaced {{and the number of}} rotor and stator airfoils was selected for low noise. Tests were conducted with uniform and distorted inlet flows. Stall margin of the initial design was too low for practical application. <b>Airfoil</b> <b>slots</b> and boundary layer and endwall devices did not improve stall margin sufficiently. A redesigned stator with reduced loadings increased stall margin, giving a fan efficiency of 0. 883, 15 % stall margin, and a 1. 474 pressure radio at a specific flow of 41. 7 lb/sec sq ft. Casing treatment over rotor tips improved stall margin with distorted inlet flow; vortex generators did not. Blade passing frequency noise increased with rotor relative Mach number. No supersonic fan noise was measured below 105 % of design speed. <b>Slotting</b> <b>airfoils,</b> casing treatments, and a reduction of the ratio (number-stators/number-rotors) from (2 n + 16) to (2 n + 2) had no significant effects on noise...|$|R

40|$|Data for rotors using {{unconventional}} airfoils are {{of interest}} to permit an evaluation of this technology's capability to meet the U. S. Army's need for increased helicopter mission effectiveness and improved safety and survivability. Thus, an experimental investigation was conducted in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) to evaluate the effect of using <b>slotted</b> <b>airfoils</b> in the rotor blade tip region (85 to 100 percent radius) on rotor aerodynamic performance and loads. Four rotor configurations were tested in forward flight at advance ratios from 0. 15 to 0. 45 and in hover in-ground effect. The hover tip Mach number was 0. 627, which is representative of a design point of 4000 -ft geometric altitude and a temperature of 95 F. The baseline rotor configuration had a conventional single-element airfoil in the tip region. A second rotor configuration had a forward-slotted airfoil with a - 6 deg slat, a third configuration had a forward-slotted airfoil with a - 10 slat, and a fourth configuration had an aft-slotted airfoil with a 3 deg flap (trailing edge down).

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation to determine the effect of boundary layer control on the lift and drag of an airfoil. Boundary layer control was accomplished by means of a backward-opening slot in the upper surface of the hollow airfoil. Air was caused to flow through this slot by a pressure which was maintained inside the airfoil by a blower. Various slot locations, slot openings, and wing pressures were used. The tests were conducted in the 5 -foot atmospheric wind tunnel of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. Under the test conditions, the maximum lift coefficient was increased about 96 per cent for one slot arrangement, and the minimum drag coefficient was decreased about 27 per cent for another, both being compared with the results obtained with the unslotted airfoil. It is believed from this investigation that the above effects may be increased by the use of larger slot openings, better slot locations, multiple <b>slots,</b> improved <b>airfoil</b> profiles, and trailing edge flaps...|$|R

Tests were made on a U. S. A. 27 airfoil section with various slot shapes and combinations, and at various amounts of pressure or suction on the slots. The lift of airfoils can be increased by removing or by accelerating the boundary layer. Removing the boundary layer by suction is more economical than to accelerate it by jet action. Gauze-covered suction slots apparently give the best results.

40|$|Flow {{characteristics}} {{in the vicinity}} of the trailing edge of a single-slotted airfoil flap are presented and analyzed. The experimental arrangement consisted of a NACA 4412 airfoil equipped with a NACA 4415 flap whose angle of deflection was 21. 8 deg. The flow remained attached over the model surfaces except {{in the vicinity of}} the flap trailing edge where a small region of boundary-layer separation extended over the aft 7 percent of flap chord. The flow was complicated by the presence of a strong, initially inviscid jet emanating from the <b>slot</b> between <b>airfoil</b> and flap, and a gradual merging of the main airfoil wake and flap suction-side boundary layer. Downstream of the flap, the airfoil and flap wakes fully merged to form an asymmetrical curved wake. The airfoil configuration was tested at an angle of attack of 8. 2 deg, at a Mach number of 0. 09, and a chord based Reynolds number of 1. 8 x 10 to the 6 th power in the Ames Research Center 7 - by 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel. Surface pressure measurements were made on the airfoil and flap and on the wind tunnel roof and floor. It was estimated that the wall interference increased the C sub L by 7 percent and decreased the C sub M by 4. 5 percent.

40|$|We {{present results}} of direct {{numerical}} simulations of a synthetic jet (SJ) based separation control of flow past a NACA- 0018 (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) airfoil, at 10 Â° {{angle of attack}} and Reynolds number 104 based on the airfoil chord length C and uniform inflow velocity U 0. The actuator of the SJ is modeled as a spanwise <b>slot</b> on the <b>airfoil</b> leeward surface and is placed just upstream of the leading edge separation position of the uncontrolled flow. The momentum coefficient of the SJ is chosen at a small value 2. 13 Ã— 10 âˆ’ 4 normalized by that of the inflow. Three forcing frequencies are chosen for the present investigation: the low frequency (LF) F + = feC/U 0 = 0. 5, the medium frequency (MF) F + = 1. 0, and the high frequency (HF) F + = 4. 0. We quantify the effects of forcing frequency for each case on the separation control and related vortex dynamics patterns. The simulations are performed using an energy conservative fourth-order parallel code. Numerical results reveal that the geometric variation introduced by the actuator has negligible effects on the mean flow field and the leading edge separation pattern; thus, the separation control effects are attributed to the SJ. The aerodynamic performances of the airfoil, characterized by lift and lift-to-drag ratio, are improved for all controlled cases, with the F + = 1. 0 case being the optimal one. The flow in the shear layer close to the actuator is locked to the jet, while in the wake this lock-in is maintained for the MF case but suppressed by the increasing turbulent fluctuations in the LF and HF cases. The vortex evolution downstream of the actuator presents two modes depending on the frequency: the vortex fragmentation and merging mode in the LF case where the vortex formed due to the SJ breaks up into several vortices and the latter merge as convecting downstream; the discrete vortices mode in the HF case where discrete vortices form and convect downstream without any fragmentation and merging. In the MF case, the vortex dynamics is at a transition state between the two modes. The low frequency actuation has the highest momentum rate during the blowing phase and substantially affects the flow upstream of the actuator and triggers early transition to turbulence. In the LF case, the transverse velocity has a 1 %U 0 pulsation at the position 18 %C upstream of the actuator...|$|R
