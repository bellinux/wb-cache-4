A hasty meal was provided by Nanon, and a basket so stored as to obviate the need of entering a village, on that day at least, to purchase provisions; Eustacie's money and jewels again formed the nucleus of the bundle of clothes and spare swaddling-banks of her babe; her peasant dress was carefully arranged--a stout <b>striped</b> <b>cloth</b> skit and black bodice, the latter covered by a scarlet Chollet kerchief. The winged white cap entirely hid her hair; a gray cloak with a hood could either fold round her and her child or be strapped on her shoulders. Her sabots were hung on her shoulder, for she had learnt to go barefoot, and walked much more lightly thus; and her little bundle was slung on a staff on the back of Maitre Gardon, who in his great peasant's hat and coat looked so like a picture of St. Joseph, that Eustacie, as the light of the rising sun fell on his white beard and hair, was reminded of the Flight into Egypt, and came close to him, saying shyly, 'Our Blessed Lady will bless and feel for my baby.

60|$|Meanwhile an {{extensive}} traffic in valuable furs was commenced with the natives, {{who were more}} than satisfied with the scraps of bright cloth, beads, and other trifling ornaments they received in exchange for them. Some of the natives wanted to purchase weapons with their furs, but Karlsefin would not allow this. At first the Norsemen gave their cloth and other wares in exchange with liberal hand, cutting the bright <b>cloth</b> into <b>stripes</b> {{of three or four}} inches in breadth; but they soon found that at this rate their supplies would become exhausted too early in the year. They therefore reduced their prices, and began to give <b>stripes</b> of <b>cloth</b> only two inches in width, and at last reduced the measure to one inch, for furs that had previously fetched four. But the unsophisticated natives were quite content with the change, and appeared to enjoy nothing so much as to twist these <b>stripes</b> of <b>cloth</b> into their long black hair.|$|R

Mostly, Kurdish turbans consist of a length of <b>striped</b> <b>cloth</b> known as kolāḡī which is wound around a conical hat; the tassels that border the kolāḡī are allowed to hang down over the face.

50|$|June 1984 {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the Lancia Prisma diesel, the marque's first modern diesel-engined passenger car. The diesel was imperative, as {{more than a third of}} Italian sales in the Prisma's class were of diesel-powered cars. Its naturally aspirated 1929 cc SOHC four-cylinder had an iron block, aluminium head and indirect injection; it put out 65 PS. The engine had been developed by Fiat, and was also installed in the Fiat Regata DS—although the Fiat lacked some of Lancia's NVH-improving solutions. The diesel engine was light, only weighing 11 kg more than the 1.6-liter petrol unit. All Diesel Prismas sported a sightly domed hood, needed to clear the taller engine. Some updates were introduced with the diesel, including optional hydraulic power steering, redesigned seats, new <b>striped</b> <b>cloth</b> upholstery and a four-spoke steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|Keling are cloths {{traditionally}} woven in stripes of red, yellow, {{dark blue}} or black from hand spun cotton dyed with natural dyes {{obtained from the}} roots of the sunti for the reds, and the fruit of the kunti for the yellows. In earlier times most of the women of Nusa Penida wore keling underskirts described by Claire Holt in the 1930s. She described multicolored <b>striped</b> <b>cloth</b> worn under the dark blue upper kain {{in such a way that}} only a small part showed. The name is thought by some to be derived from the Balinese word keling which refers to Indian merchant. The roots may be related to an older legend concerning the primal ancestors of the village Tenganan, the king Kaung and his wife Keling. This is supported by the observation that the cloths are traditionally worn by women.|$|E
