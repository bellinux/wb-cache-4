5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water <b>shorted</b> out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Bickford {{was born}} in Kentucky but raised in West Virginia. He began his {{professional}} career in 1939 and, after serving in World War II, made the majors in 1949.

However his career was soon <b>shorted</b> by multiple arm injuries, and he was out of baseball by 1955. After working an assortment of jobs, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1960 and died after a three-month illness.|$|E

5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that <b>shorted</b> across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|Such {{an order}} ignored {{the fact that}} the Belgian Army could not {{withdraw}} to the Yser, and there was little chance of any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for the Belgian withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk to the east and south, while the La Bassée Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically <b>shorted</b> the Belgian Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of Ostend while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles.|$|E

The number of stocks being <b>shorted</b> on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of 130/30 type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its broker-dealer member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.|$|E

25|$|So-called self-resetting fuses use a {{thermoplastic}} conductive element {{known as}} a Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (or PPTC) thermistor that impedes the circuit during an overcurrent condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC thermistor is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to low resistance. These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a <b>shorted</b> mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the short seller profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position closes out at a loss if the price of a <b>shorted</b> instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the {{eruption}} of the massive China stock frauds on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy trading halts that froze the values of <b>shorted</b> stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings {{at least until the}} halts were lifted.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies {{began to}} {{shift away from}} severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and {{simplified}} depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally <b>shorted</b> in favor of Europeans.|$|E
