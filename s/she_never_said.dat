25|$|Both sides {{brought on}} many witnesses, {{including}} several historians. A notable {{witness for the}} defence was Haia Greenberg (aged 29), a local nurse who survived the Proskurov pogroms (now, Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine) and testified about the carnage. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that Petliura personally participated in the event, but rather some other soldiers who did {{said that they were}} directed by Petliura. Several former Ukrainian officers testified for the prosecution, including Red Cross representative who witnessed Semesenko's report to Petliura.|$|E
500|$|Gabrielle Union, a {{rape victim}} {{and one of the}} main stars of The Birth of a Nation, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "As {{important}} and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly. On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date’s consent? It’s very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> “no,” silence certainly does not equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst." [...] Sources suggest that Parker and Celestin's accuser was either unconscious or extremely drunk when Parker invited Celestin to have sex with her (Parker was already actively engaged in a sex act with her at the time).|$|E
2500|$|In November 1997, {{the press}} {{revealed}} that after 13 years playing Kathy, Gillian Taylforth had {{opted not to}} renew her contract when it expired in March 1998. Taylforth commented, [...] "I love EastEnders, it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want {{a bit of a}} change. I want {{to spend more time with}} my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely." [...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks." [...] However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set. Barbara Windsor, who plays Kathy's mother-in-law Peggy Mitchell, said: [...] "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress and a very good friend." [...] Steve McFadden, who plays Kathy's estranged husband Phil Mitchell, said: [...] "I can't believe it. I've been with her all day and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a thing." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{that might}} have been my vanity. <b>She</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> cared for me {{although}} she had looked it.|$|R
5000|$|... "She {{knew that}} she didn't have the {{training}} or experience as an interrogator. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> once <b>said,</b> 'I can't do it.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't say a word. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> has <b>said</b> a word. As far as {{that goes}} <b>she</b> might <b>never</b> have heard {{anything}} about the marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must ask}} that of Rose herself. My story made her my friend; but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} {{for or against}} my disguise." ...|$|E
60|$|And Geraldine {{perceived}} from Lady Rotherwood's ceremonious politeness {{that she}} did not like it at all, though <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so even to Lady Merrifield.|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't turn {{up at the}} Cafe that day, however, at all, and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word until closing time, {{when she}} asked me to walk part of the way home with her.|$|E
60|$|And {{then for}} the first time I remembered that <b>she</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about the matter since I had met her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] cried Du Guesclin, {{with his}} eyes {{flashing}} in triumph, [...] "you hear her, Sir Nigel?--and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>said</b> word which was not sooth." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robin {{realizes that}} she {{is in love with}} Ted but cannot bring herself to say it, as <b>she</b> has <b>never</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I love you" [...] to a man before.|$|R
6000|$|NICHOLLS (confusedly). I'll do my best, Doctor. (As if he couldn't yet {{believe his}} ears--shuddering!) Good heavens! <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about--being so ill. She's had a cold. But, Doctor--do {{you think this}} {{sanatorium}} will----? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How delightfully {{confidential}} {{she must}} have been!--but I assure you, sir, that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{that sort of thing}} to me. There were things she liked and things she did not like, but she showed no signs of rebellion." ...|$|E
60|$|Harry spoke lightly, and Jeanne with a {{great effort}} {{recovered}} her composure; and after that, although the trial and danger of the king were nightly discussed and lamented, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word as to any possibility of the catastrophe being averted.|$|E
60|$|It was enough. The dancer's {{response}} told passionately, without words, what <b>she</b> <b>never</b> {{could have}} <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{presence}} of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy. How could she {{go on with}} {{what she was saying}} in Maggie's presence? for she was saying something that <b>she</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said,</b> all these years, to Maggie herself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{to herself}} {{at any time}} that if Sir Lionel did propose she would accept him. <b>She</b> had <b>never</b> {{questioned}} herself as to the probability of such an event. That she would have accepted him a fortnight ago, {{there can be no}} doubt; but what was she to do now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They've got {{my address}} {{and there are}} the directories," [...] he continued. [...] "The funny part of it is, too, that I heard from Mrs. Bundercombe a week or so ago, and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about any of them coming over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, little Fun See? How droll {{it seems}} {{to think of him}} grown up and married to Annabel of all people! <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word about him, but this {{accounts}} for her admiring my pretty Chinese things and being so interested in Canton." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> he had grown, but {{she told}} him he looked tall; and though the tea was a marvellous display it was never an {{obtrusive}} tea, it wasn't poked at a fellow; a various plenty flowed well within reach of one's arm, like an agreeable accompaniment to their conversation.|$|E
60|$|A distressed {{expression}} marked poor Hetty's {{reception of}} this news, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>never</b> a word.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>never</b> {{anything}} to that, but continued gazing {{at me with}} the same white face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see now why <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wrote,' <b>said</b> Violet, {{with some}} shame, and yet {{glad to have}} it {{accounted}} for. 'But she will be sure to help me, and {{tell me how to}} behave. She will want {{them to be able to}} bear me for his sake.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the vestry {{she turned}} away as we signed, and I verily believe she was crying, though to this day I can't say why she should have cried, and she was near crying too when she {{squeezed}} my hand at parting--and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word or looked at me, but just squeezed my hand....|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{spent an}} hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word to anyone; {{she did not even}} write in her diary about it; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims. In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross {{committee}} meeting and was severely businesslike.|$|E
60|$|Nurse Gooch was a masterful, {{trustworthy}} woman, and {{was laid}} under injunctions not to indulge Master Edward. She {{certainly did not}} err in that respect, though she attended faithfully to my material welfare; but woe to me if I {{gave way to a}} little moaning; and what I felt still harder, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> 'good boy' if I contrived to abstain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That, I {{will answer}} for, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> did,' <b>said</b> Felix. 'When I saw the {{exquisite}} delight it afforded, {{not only to}} this Lance but to Captain Audley, to fill the boat with slimy, flapping, uncomfortable dying fishes, I felt that I was never made for a gentleman.|$|R
25|$|The third series aired from 14 October to 25 November 2006.

60|$|He waited, as if {{he would}} have been glad that she said something. But <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>never</b> a word.|$|R
60|$|Dora was so mortified that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word {{till they}} were let {{out in a}} room at the Parker House. Here she admired everything, and read all the evening in a volume of Emerson's Poems from the bag, for Mr. Mt. Vernon Beacon was a Boston man, and never went {{anywhere}} without a wise book or two in his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been a relief to Leslie. But <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything. From the day of her {{marriage}} she was just what she is now--cold and proud, and keeping everyone but me at a distance. I won't BE kept at a distance, believe ME! I've just stuck to Leslie as close as I knew how in spite of everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. Yes; {{but even}} my coxcombry pleased. Well, I {{found that when}} I had touched a woman's imagination, she {{would allow me to}} persuade myself that she loved me; but when my suit was granted <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I am happy: my love is satisfied": she always said, first, [...] "At last, the {{barriers}} are down," [...] and second, [...] "When will you come again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{often told}} Julia," [...] said Aunt Kate emphatically, [...] "that {{she was simply}} thrown away in that choir. But <b>she</b> <b>never</b> would be <b>said</b> by me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will not}} care for you one bit--I know <b>she</b> <b>never</b> will!" [...] <b>said</b> the poor child in a sobbing whisper. She had lost all control of herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "She knocks you, and nips you, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> hurts," [...] <b>said</b> Paul, {{when the}} last corn had gone. [...] "Now, Miriam," [...] said Maurice, [...] "you come an 'ave a go." ...|$|R
