40|$|International audienceSuper-resolution image zooming is {{possible}} when the image has some geometric regularity. Directional interpolation algorithms {{are used in}} industry, with ad-hoc regularity measurements. Sparse signal decompositions in dictionaries of curvelets or bandlets find indirectly the directions of regularity by optimizing the sparsity. However, super-resolution interpolations in such dictionaries do not outperform cubic <b>spline</b> <b>interpolations.</b> It is necessary to further constraint the sparse representation, which is done through projections over structured vector spaces. A space matching pursuit algorithm is introduced to compute image decompositions over spaces of bandlets, from which a super-resolution image zooming is derived.

The channel estimation based on comb type pilot arrangement is studied through different algorithms for both estimating channel at pilot frequencies and interpolating the channel.

Time-domain interpolation is obtained by passing to time domain through IDFT, zero padding {{and going back to}} frequency domain through DFT.

We have also implemented decision feedback equalizer for all sub-channels followed by periodic block-type pilots.
