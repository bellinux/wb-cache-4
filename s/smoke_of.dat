5|$|Hill censer: The hill censer, {{a vessel}} used for burning incense, {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill censer acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be the waves of the East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} censer releases the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> the incense.|$|E
5|$|When the Royal Scots {{had entered}} the eastern section of the El Arish Redoubt during {{the second phase of}} the attack, the western half was still held by Ottoman defenders. These defences became the {{objectives}} of the attacks by the 161st and 163rd Brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, supported by four tanksincluding the two which had passed through the El Arish redoubt. On the right of the 163rd Brigade's advance, the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment moved towards the Ottoman trenches following a creeping barrage to attack and over–run the western El Arish trenches during hand–to–hand fighting when the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment suffered light casualties. Although they had captured the third line, part of this captured territory had to be abandoned because it was exposed to hostile fire, so they consolidated their position along the second line. Half of the 1/8th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment attacked Burj Trench while the other half attacked Triangle Trench, although it was not their objective. This caused some confusion, and the 1/4th and 1/5th Battalions, The Norfolk Regiment lost direction in the dust and <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> the cloudy, hazy night. As a result, only small numbers reached Gibraltar and Crested Rock, from where they were quickly forced to withdraw.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we build}} the {{relational}} models between the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier {{and the flow}} of gas, the depth and mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value, respectively. These models {{are based on the}} analysis of gas flow in narrow space <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier which is combined with the classic Hydraulic Jump model in the field of mechanics. For different initial conditions of gas, we simulate the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier height on flue gas flow via the fire dynamics simulation software FDS. The results show that: the air entrainment and the depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value are decreasing constantly while the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer is raising during the increasing of the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier. Thus, when it gets the zero value, the air entrainment and the depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value will get the maximum and the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer will get the minimum. And when the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier greater than or equal the value of z_ 0, the value of air entrainment will be zero...|$|R

25|$|A common belief among users is {{that the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> a hookah (waterpipe, narghile) is {{significantly}} less dangerous than that from cigarettes. The water moisture induced by the hookah makes the smoke less irritating and may give {{a false sense of}} security and reduce concerns about true health effects. Doctors at institutions including the Mayo Clinic have stated that use of hookah can be as detrimental to a person's health as smoking cigarettes, and a study by the World Health Organization also confirmed these findings.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{one year}} after the initial destruction, the {{community}} sponsored Jaffna Public Library Week and collected thousands of books. Repairs on parts of the building were in progress when the Black July pogrom-induced civil conflict began in 1983. By 1984, the library was fully renovated; however, the library was damaged by bullets and bombs. The military forces were stationed in the Dutch fort and the rebels positioned themselves inside the library creating a no man's land as the fighting intensified. In 1985, after an attack on a nearby police station by Tamil rebels, soldiers entered the partially restored building and set off bombs that shredded thousands of books yet again. The library was abandoned with its shell and bullet-pocked walls, blackened with the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> burnt books.|$|E
25|$|The {{footbridge}} to {{the south}} of the station is also noteworthy and is Grade II-listed in its own right. The railway line bisected Kew, {{but it was not until}} 1912 that the bridge was provided to allow residents to cross the tracks safely. It is a rare surviving example of a reinforced concrete structure built using a pioneering technique devised by the French engineer François Hennebique. The bridge has a narrow deck and very high walls, originally designed to protect its users' clothing from the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> steam trains passing underneath. It also has protrusions on either side of the deck to deflect smoke away from the bridge structure. It was restored in 2004 with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, in a project led by The Kew Society. In July 2017, concerns were expressed about the structural safety of the bridge.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Built as the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad before {{acquisition}} by the Maine Central Railroad (MEC), {{the line}} initially provided transportation for summer visitors to grand Victorian hotels, including the Bay of Naples Inn in Naples (reached by connection with Sebago Lake steamboats), the Crawford House in Crawford Notch, and the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods. Cool, clean air at Sebago Lake and the White Mountains provided a refreshing {{escape from the}} heat, humidity and <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> 19th-century cities. Autumn foliage and winter skiing extended the tourist season. The Flying Yankee train-set operated as the Mountaineer from Boston to Crawford Notch via Intervale Junction during World War II, but passenger service {{had been reduced to}} a single daily round-trip between Portland and St. Johnsbury by the 1930s. The train between Portland and St. Johnsbury usually consisted of a RPO-express car, a baggage car and a single coach after the 1920s; and substitution of a stainless steel combination for the coach and baggage car reduced the train to two cars {{for the last several years}} before the end of passenger service in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the crash}} on Stanley Hill {{approximately}} 150 yards inside the southeast boundary of Fort McClellan, the survivors exited the airplane as a fire developed. Survivor Sgt. Dennis Lachut of Fort Lewis, Washington, limped {{three miles from}} the crash site through steep, wooded terrain and {{was taken to a}} nearby residence by the driver of a passing pickup truck. The Anniston airport manager was notified by GP Express that the plane did not arrive and could not be reached approximately 11 minutes after the scheduled arrival time; however, this information was not shared with local search and rescue authorities. A search was not started until Sgt. Lachut directed rescuers toward the crash site around noon. Rescuers arrived on foot about 2:15 p.m. and evacuated the remaining survivors by four-wheel-drive vehicle to Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center in Anniston. Heavy rains at the time made travel difficult, obscured visibility, and also quickly knocked down the post-accident fire, the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> which may have alerted authorities to the crash and approximate location more quickly.|$|E

50|$|Polymers are a {{significant}} source <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Higher degree <b>of</b> cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.|$|R
40|$|<b>Smoke</b> {{contamination}} <b>of</b> balconies {{due to a}} channelled spill plume at a {{lower level}} in an atrium might occur during a fire and could affect occupant safety during an evacuation. Previous experimental work has investigated the extent <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination, and this work describes a numerical modelling comparison of the experiments using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) computational fluid dynamics programme. Temperature, severity and height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination are selected as the key parameters for comparison. The predictions of severity and height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination are generally similar to the experimental results using a ‘most severe point assessment <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination’ assessment method. Although predicted temperatures are slightly lower than experimental values, FDS temperature slice files can be used at the most severe smoke contaminated point using a 10 ?°C temperature rise. This 10 ?°C threshold matches the criterion proposed in the previous experimental research. On {{the basis of the}} comparisons for the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination, the simulation results generally match a previously proposed equation for the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination above a balcony spill plume...|$|R
25|$|On 21 March 1813, Devon took {{eight men}} and his 12-year-old brother, Midshipman Frederick Devon, in Brev Dragerens gig. William Dunbar, Master of Blazer, took 11 men in Blazers cutter. Together the two boats went up river {{in search of}} a {{privateer}} reported to be in the area. Off the Danish port of Brunsbuttel they sighted two boats, one of which hailed them, ran up Danish colours and opened fire, fortunately {{over the heads of the}} British. Devon boarded the gunboat in the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> her second broadside, and possibly the explosion of some cartridges on her deck, and captured her. Blazers cutter came up and together the British sailors succeeded in imprisoning the Danish crew below deck. The gunboat turned out to be the Jonge-Troutman. She was under the command of Lieutenant Lutkin, had a crew of 25 men and carried two 18-pounders and three 12-pounders. Dunbar and the cutter then turned their attention to the second gunboat, the Liebe, and captured her too. She was under the command of Lieutenant Writt and had the same establishment as the Jonge-Troutman. The British suffered no casualties and the Danes suffered two wounded.|$|E
25|$|Mist and cloud made air {{observation}} difficult {{on the morning}} of 16 August, until a wind began later in the day, although this blew the <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> battle over the German lines, obscuring German troop movements. Corps squadrons were expected to provide artillery co-operation, contact and counter-attack patrols but low cloud, mist and smoke that morning resulted in most German counter-attack formations moving unnoticed. Flash-spotting of German artillery was much more successful and many more flares were lit by the infantry, when called for by the crews of contact aeroplanes. Army squadrons, Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and French aircraft flew over the lines and attacked German aerodromes, troops and transport as far as the weather allowed. V Brigade tried to co-ordinate air operations over the battlefield with the infantry attack. Two De Havilland D.H.5 aircraft per division were provided, to engage any German strongpoints interfering with the infantry attack on the final objective. Two small formations of fighters were to fly low patrols, {{on the far side of}} the final objective of the Fifth Army, from the beginning of the attack for six hours, to break up German attempts to counter-attack and to stop equivalent German contact-patrols.|$|E
25|$|Guns and the cavalry. The {{introduction}} of guns saw {{a rise in}} the quantities and role of infantry within the savannah empires. Firepower gave the gun-armed footman growing influence, not only as far as bullets delivered, {{but the fact that the}} noise and <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> muskets could frighten horses in the enemy camp, creating a tactical advantage; this happened when Asante gunmen confronted the horsemen of Gonja in the 17th century. The success of the gun-armed Moroccans in the 16th century also illustrates the growing impact of firearms. As gun quality and volume increased, the cavalry became more at risk, and eventually even some horsemen began to acquire firearms. The gunpowder era thus saw mixed forces in action throughout the savannah empires. If infantry were operating with mounted formations, the musketeers were generally used to open a battle, and soften up opposing defences for thundering cavalry charges. Traditional weapons still remained strong in many areas however, both in terms of archers and bowmen, and cavalry. Early musket-man formations relied on relatively slow-loading, inaccurate weapons, and could be defeated by fast-moving horsemen. This happened in 1767 when Tuareg cavalry defeated an army of Timbuktu that deployed Moroccan musketeers. The old weapons thus remained relevant for some time after the coming of guns, on into the 19th century.|$|E
