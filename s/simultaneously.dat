5|$|In the Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, {{children}} are shown cards {{and asked to}} sort them based on two different dimensions (e.g. by color, such as yellow and blue, and object type, such as animals and food) <b>simultaneously</b> into four piles within a matrix (e.g. yellow animals, yellow foods, blue animals and blue foods). This task {{appears to be more}} difficult as research has shown that seven-year-old children were incapable of sorting cards based on the two dimensions <b>simultaneously.</b> These children focused on the two dimensions separately, whereas at the age of eleven, children were capable of sorting cards based on these two dimensions <b>simultaneously.</b> This demonstrates an increase in cognitive flexibility between the ages of seven and eleven.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to <b>simultaneously</b> consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card <b>simultaneously.</b> Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives <b>simultaneously</b> within any given situation.|$|E
