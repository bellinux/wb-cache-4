30|$|Needle {{fungi in}} {{conifers}} have been extensively studied {{to explore their}} diversity, but environmental factors influencing the composition of fungal communities in Pinus radiata D.Don needles have received little attention. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the influence of the environment as defined by rainfall, elevation and temperature on the composition of fungal communities in pine needles at an age prior to that at which <b>spring</b> <b>needle</b> cast (SNC) is generally observed. Elucidating the entire fungal community in the needles is a first step towards understanding the cause of the disease.|$|E
30|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>needle</b> cast (SNC) in Tasmania {{appears in}} pine {{plantations}} at canopy closure (age 6 – 7  years) and is manifested by the rapid browning of 1 -year-old needles {{followed by the}} heavy casting of needles. <b>Spring</b> <b>needle</b> cast is {{not considered to be}} a classic needle blight disease caused by a primary fungal pathogen (Podger & Wardlaw 1990); instead, it is thought to be due to a suite of endophytic fungi that are triggered into secondary pathogenic activity by an environmental stress. In their study of 53 stands selected for climatic analysis, Podger and Wardlaw (1990) found that 23 of the sites were visually assessed as having SNC, and that these stands were restricted to a mean annual rainfall range of 1200 – 2000  mm and mean annual temperature range of 8 – 11.5  °C. Podger and Wardlaw (1990) putatively associated Cyclaneusma minus, Lophodermium pinastri and Strasseria geniculata with the disease in Tasmania, but there were many areas with severe SNC where Podger and Wardlaw (1990) found no fungal fruiting bodies of these species on attached needles, dead or alive. However, these three species of fungi were ubiquitous on fallen needles at sites both affected and unaffected by SNC. More recently, fungal communities were surveyed in a P. radiata family trial established in 1999 in Oonah, Tasmania. The trial was assessed at 8  years of age in 2007 using DNA extraction from needles, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fungal-specific primers and sequencing to detect the presence of fungal species (Prihatini et al. 2015 a). Trees with contrasting levels of SNC disease severity were found to have significantly different needle fungal communities. The four fungi, L. pinastri, C. minus, S. geniculata and Dothistroma septosporum, previously reported as common pathogens or endophytes in P. radiata in Tasmania implicated in causing SNC (Podger 1984; Podger and Wardlaw 1990) were also identified in the Prihatini et al. (2015 a) study. Of these, only L. pinastri was correlated with high levels of disease. Several species of Teratosphaeriaceae were also detected. Teratosphaeriaceae sp. 23 was detected in almost all of the needle samples and was presumed to be endophytic as it was associated with needles from healthy trees as well as those affected by SNC. In contrast, Teratosphaeriaceae sp. 3 was detected most frequently in needles from severely diseased trees and not at all in needles from trees with < 5  % disease. An overview of the fungal species detected in these two studies (Prihatini et al. 2015 b) highlighted the discrepancy between fungal associates of P. radiata detected by PCR and sequencing and those detected by isolation.|$|E
40|$|Pinus radiata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} species of forestry plantation worldwide and many pests and diseases have followed the expansion of this species around the globe. Tasmanian P. radiata plantations suffer from a needle cast disease referred to as <b>spring</b> <b>needle</b> cast (SNC) which has similar symptoms to Cyclaneusma needle cast, a serious disease in New Zealand. Stands with moderate or severe SNC can be expected to suffer potential losses in clear-fall volume. The aetiology of SNC is poorly understood and has long been a point of debate between Tasmania and New Zealand foresters with the New Zealanders attributing SNC to Cyclaneusma minus. Tasmanian research in the 90 s proposed that SNC is caused by one or a suite of fungi that are triggered by an unknown environmental stress. Three species of fungi have been putatively associated with SNC, i. e. Lophodermium pinastri, Strasseria geniculata and C. minus. Understanding endophyte diversity is crucial for determining their role in forest health. Endophytes are increasingly recognized for having a role in plant-pathogen interactions leading to disease. In particular, they may play an important role in determining the presence of a disease such as SNC, which does not appear to have a single pathogenic causal agent and which may be associated with environmental stress. The main objective of this study was therefore to identify needle fungal communities which are associated with both healthy and SNC-affected trees in P. radiata plantations in Tasmania. Needle fungi have been extensively studied in conifers but rarely in P. radiata...|$|E

To clarify the energy dissipation mechanisms, we examined energy transfer and dissipation dynamics in needles of the evergreen plant Taxus cuspidata by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. In summer and autumn, the energy transfer processes {{were similar to}} those reported in other higher plants. However, in winter needles, fluorescence lifetimes became shorter not only in PSII but also in PSI, indicating energy dissipation in winter needles. In addition, almost the same fluorescence spectra were obtained with different excitation wavelengths. In contrast, the fluorescence spectrum showed a large difference due to excitation wavelength in <b>spring</b> <b>needles.</b> The fluorescence spectrum of <b>spring</b> <b>needles</b> in 550 -nm excitation showed similar spectra to that of winter needles, however, red-chlorophyll fluorescence was not observed in chlorophyll excitation.

40|$|The {{need for}} this thesis comes from the timely {{objective}} to minimize emissions and maximize efficiency in combustion engines. The latest trend in the marine industry is to utilize dual fuel engines as the power source for vessels, allowing the engine to be run on both diesel and gas. In the gas mode, the gas is ignited by injecting {{a small amount of}} diesel, in a so-called pilot injection, into the combustion chamber. The pilot injection event, and the fuel injector creating it, is the topic of this thesis. To be able to understand the operation of a fuel injector, mechanic, hydraulic and electromagnetic theory is presented. Next, fuel injector operation is descripted. Then, a simulation model of the fuel injector is built and verified. Sensitivity analyses are made for both the pilot injection and the full injection event, for the purpose of understanding which parameters affect the injector outputs. Finally, both the pilot injection and the full injection event are optimized in order to reach the emission and efficiency targets. The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the most important parameters affecting the injector performance are the inlet, outlet and filling orifices. Naturally, also the number of nozzle holes and the hole diameters play a crucial role, a smaller flow area resulting in a faster pilot injection but less injected quantity in a full injection. The pressure step and the <b>needle</b> <b>spring</b> have a lesser impact. The geometry of the needle tip is also important but hard to model accurately.

The contribution of this thesis is the development of the model of the UNSW HEUI injector, which can be used to investigate possible modifications of the injector for its use in dual-fuel injection systems. The developed models include electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems present in the injectors. They are based on Kirchhoff??s laws, on the mass and momentum conservation equations and on the equilibrium of forces. The models were implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK graphical software environment, which provides a high degree of flexibility and allows simulation of both linear and nonlinear elements. The models were used to perform sensitivity analysis of both injectors. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the temperature of the solenoid coil is one of the critical parameters affecting the timing and the quantity of the fuel injection of both injectors. Additional critical parameters were found to be the dimensions of the piston of the CRI, the stiffness of the <b>needle</b> <b>spring</b> of the HEUI and the dimensions of the intensifier of the HEUI. The models also revealed that in the case of pilot injections the speed of the solenoid is the major limiting factor of the performance. The developed models provide better understanding of the issues and limitations of the injectors. They give detailed insight into their working principles. The investigations of the models permit making quantitative analysis of the timing of the HEUI solenoid and to evaluate the proposed change of the direction of the pressure acting on the HEUI solenoid plunger...|$|R
