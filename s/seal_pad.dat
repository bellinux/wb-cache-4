40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of high pressure seals have considered adiabatic flow with friction but neglected effects of seal rotation. Most {{of this work}} analyzed a one-dimensional flow field. This works well to calculate stiffness and leakage of full circular seals, either face seals or annular ring seals. However, it cannot provide accurate results for a rectangular <b>seal</b> <b>pad</b> with its strongly two-dimensional flow field and its reliance on hydrodynamic forces to maintain a full fluid film. On the other hand, solutions of Reynolds lubrication equation have been obtained for the two-dimensional flow in a <b>seal</b> <b>pad.</b> But these solutions do not account for choking which occurs at high seal pressure ratios, nor do they consider the pressure loss that occurs in the entrance region of the flow field. The aim of the present work is {{to build on the}} Reynolds equation solution by use of an approximate choked flow analysis. This will account for the pressure losses in the flow entrance region, ensure that fluid velocities remain subsonic, and enable fluid inertial effects within the pad film to be accounted for. Results show that, in general, fluid inertia acts to decrease pad film load capacity and leakage, and increase film stiffness...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of herringbone-grooved journal bearings {{has been applied}} to the case of a seal disc running under a finger <b>seal</b> <b>pad.</b> The inward pumping action of herringbone grooves on the disc generates load capacity and stiffness to maintain a fluid film and prevent contact of the pad and disc. This mechanism does not depend on a converging film under the pad, such as analyzed in previous works. Analysis shows that significant stiffness and load capacity can be supplied by herringbone grooves. In order for the grooves to be effective, the seal pressure drop must be taken outside of the grooved portion of the rotor, but this may be acceptable in order to gain freedom from maintaining a precise film convergence...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{significant}} efforts {{have been made to}} introduce film riding sealing technology on large industrial or aerospace gas turbines. The main challenge comes from the high surface speeds and high temperatures, which lead to large thermal distortions. One approach to tackle the effect of thermally induced distortion is to design a seal to operate at a large film to limit the viscous heat generation. To design a <b>seal</b> <b>pad</b> that maximizes force at relatively high film heights, it is important to select the seal groove type that looks the most promising to deliver this characteristic. Several groove types have been assessed as part of this study. The most promising groove type is the Rayleigh step, which gives the strongest level of combined hydrostatic and hydrodynamic load support while also being easier to tessellate on individual seal segments. The results generated using a uniform grid Reynolds equation method show reasonable agreement with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. This provides confidence in the validity of the method, approach, and results...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurements of}} power loss and leakage in a hybrid brush seal (HBS) for increasing pressure differentials {{and over a}} range of rotor speeds. The test HBS, Haynes- 25 bristle pack [~ 850 bristles/cm] and 45 o lay angle, is 166. 4 mm in diameter and integrates 20 -arcuate pads connected with thin EDM-webs to the seal casing. The measured drag power at low rotor speeds (< 11 m/s at 1, 300 rpm) decreases as the pressure differential across the seal increases. At a fixed rotor speed, a significant drop in drag torque (and drag power) ensues as the supply pressure increases, thus demonstrating a gas film separates the rotor from the <b>seal</b> <b>pads.</b> A constant operating temperature (~ 24 oC) at the rotor/seal interface during tests with shaft rotation also indicates the absence of intermittent contact between the <b>seal</b> <b>pads</b> and rotor. Flow rate measurements at room temperature (25 oC) show an improved sealing ability with a leakage reduction of about 36 %, when compared to a 1 st generation shoedbrush seal. The HBS predicted effective clearance (~ 50 ?m) is {{a small fraction of}} that in an equivalent one-tooth labyrinth seal. Identified HBS direct stiffness coefficients decrease (~ 15 %) as function of rotor speed for an increasing supply pressure condition (Pr = 1. 7 and 2. 4). The identified cross-coupled stiffness is at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the direct stiffness coefficient. The cross-coupled mass is negligible for all tested rotor speeds and supply pressures. The HBS energy dissipation mechanism is characterized in terms of a loss factor (?) and dry friction coefficient (?). The direct HBS viscous damping coefficient is strongly dependent on the excitation frequency, while showing minimal dependence on rotor speed or supply pressure. The HBS novel configuration incorporates pads contacting on assembly the shaft; and which under rotor spinning; lift off due to the generation of a hydrodynamic pressure. Experimental results obtained show that hybrid brush seals (HBS) are a viable alternative to overcoming the major drawbacks of labyrinth seals; namely excessive leakage and potential for rotordynamic instability. Additionally, during operation a gas film in HBS eliminates rotor and bristle wear, as well as thermal distortions; which are commonly known limitations of conventional brush seals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Three {{dimensional}} solid-fluid interaction {{numerical analysis}} models {{of both the}} finger <b>seal</b> with herringbone-grooved <b>pad</b> and the finger seal with herringbone-grooved rotor were established in order to study the performance of hydrodynamic finger seal. The models investigated fluid radial under pad force and fluid leakage {{as a function of}} both the rotor speed and the high- to low-pressure differential. It was shown that the finger seal with herringbone-grooved structure in pad or in rotor could bring lift force under the finger pad so as to keep the finger seal in non-contacting status. For the two types of finger seal, their load carrying ability and fluid leakage varying with the pressure differential were almost same. In the same velocity of rotor surface, the load carrying capacity of the finger seal with herringbone- grooved rotor was greater and the leakage was less than that of the finger <b>seal</b> with herringbone-grooved <b>pad</b> respectively. With the conditions of rotor structure allowing, it is suggested to select the finger seal with herringbone-grooved rotor first for designing the hydrodynamic finger seal with herringbone-grooved structure...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development of}} microfluidic valves {{to be used in}} capillary flow microfluidic device as a platform for nucleic acid detection. The valve used the principle of electrowetting and was able to be actuated at low voltage. The valve consisted of two silver electrodes which were encountered in series within a microfluidic channel. The second electrode was modified with a hydrophobic monolayer resulting in a cessation of capillary flow. A potential of 4 V resulted in a 70 Â° reduction in water contact angle within ten seconds which allowed capillary flow to continue. The final device represented a microfluidic valve for capillary flow microfluidics realized on PMMA substrate. In addition to the valve designed for timed fluid delivery, our PMMA microfluidic chip also consists of self-priming microfluidics with <b>sealed</b> conjugate <b>pads</b> of reagent delivery and an absorbent pad for additional fluid draw. We have developed a single-step surface modification method which allows strong capillary flow within a <b>sealed</b> microchannel.

Magnetic beads were released when sample entered the chamber and hybridized with the complex. The complex was immobilized over a magnet in the capture zone while a luminol co-reactant stream containing H 2 O 2 was merged with the channel. A photomultiplier tube was used to quantify the chemiluminescence signal. This new format of biosensor will not only allow for pumpless automatically reagent delivery, but also smaller and more sensitive detection, as well as commercial-scale manufacturing and low materials cost, and it would be an ideal device for fast diagnostic in resource-limited settings...|$|R

2500|$|A band mask is a {{heavy duty}} {{full-face}} mask {{with many of the}} characteristics of a lightweight demand helmet. In structure it is the front section of a lightweight helmet from above the faceplate to below the demand valve and exhaust ports, including the bailout block and communications connections on the sides. This rigid frame is attached to a neoprene hood by a metal clamping band, hence the name. It is provided with a <b>padded</b> <b>sealing</b> surface around the frame edge which is held firmly against the diver's face by a rubber [...] "spider", a multiple strap arrangement with a pad behind the diver's head, and usually five straps which hook onto pins on the band. The straps have several holes so the tension can be adjusted to get a comfortable seal. A band mask is heavier than other full face masks, but lighter than a helmet, and can be donned more quickly than a helmet. They are often used by the standby diver for this reason.|$|R
5000|$|Greenleaf expanded, {{upgraded}} and retooled the Conn plant, {{and converted}} {{the company from}} a mail-order business to one operated through retail dealers. By 1917 the assembly-line work force had increased to 550 employees who were turning out about 2500 instruments a month using a new hydraulic expansion process which Greenleaf introduced to the plant. In 1917 Conn introduced the Pan American brand for its second-line instruments. Conn founded the subsidiary Pan American Band Instrument Company in 1919 and later that year moved production of second-line instruments to the old Angledile factory. By 1930 the Pan American company was fully absorbed by Conn, but the Pan American brand for Conn's second-line instruments remained in use until 1955. By 1920 Conn was producing a complete line of saxophones. In this area they had stiff competition from other big saxophone makers such as Buescher and Martin. Around 1917 Conn introduced drawn tone holes (after a patent by W.S. Haynes in 1914) eliminating the necessity of soft-soldering tone hole platforms onto {{the bodies of the}} instruments. Around 1920 Conn introduced rolled tone hole rims, a feature that enhanced the <b>seal</b> of the <b>pads</b> and extended pad life. Rolled tone holes remained a feature of Conn saxophones until 1947.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{by others}} and internal investigations at Philip Morris International (PMI) {{have shown that}} the standard trapping and extraction procedure used for conventional cigarettes, defined in the International Standard ISO 4387 (Cigarettes [...] Determination of total and nicotine-free dry particulate matter using a routine analytical smoking machine), is not suitable for high-water content aerosols. Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of the Cambridge filter pad holder to remove the filter pad as well as during the manual handling of the filter pad, and because the commercially available filter pad holder, which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water. This results in inaccurate values for the water content, and erroneous and overestimated values for Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter (NFDPM). A modified 44 mm Cambridge filter pad holder and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting the loaded filter pad while kept in the Cambridge filter pad holder which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically <b>sealed</b> Cambridge filter <b>pad</b> holder by means of an in situ extractor. The in situ methodology showed a significantly more complete water recovery, resulting in more accurate NFDPM values for high-water content aerosols compared to the standard ISO methodology. The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/âtarâ values. This would be for example the case if there were a need to print âtarâ yields on packs or compare yields to ceilings. Failure to use the in situ extraction methodology will result in erroneous and overestimated NFDPM/âtarâ values...|$|R
