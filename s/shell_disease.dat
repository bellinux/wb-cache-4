50|$|Cutaneous {{dyskeratosis}} (CD) is a <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> {{of unknown}} origin and has unknown implications on desert tortoise populations. Observationally, it is typified by shell lesions on the scutes. Areas infected with CD appear discolored, dry, rough and flakey, with peeling, pitting, and chipping through multiple cornified layers. Lesions are usually first {{located on the}} plastron (underside) of the tortoises, although lesions on the carapace (upper side) and fore limbs are not uncommon. In advanced cases, exposed areas become infected with bacteria, fungi, and exposed tissue and bone may become necrotic. CD was evident as early as 1979 and was initially identified on the Chuckwalla Bench Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Riverside County, California. Currently, the means of transmission are unknown, although hypotheses include autoimmune diseases, exposure to toxic chemicals (possibly from mines, or air pollution), or a deficiency disease (possibly resulting from tortoises consuming low-quality invasive plant species instead of high-nutrient native plants).|$|E

We amplified 18 S rRNA gene sequences from eukaryotic communities in ESD lesions and separated them for sequencing using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

Aside from G. disjuncta, the other eukaryotes were only sporadically detected and were, therefore, likely opportunistic. However, G. disjuncta is a known bacterivorous nematode; thus, it, too, is likely opportunistic because high numbers of bacteria are known to exist in ESD lesions.

40|$|Tail fan {{necrosis}} (TFN) is {{a disease}} that affects southern rock lobsters during live-holding. The damage to affected tail fan uropods {{is seen as a}} major constraint {{in the development of a}} live-holding industry. A previous study has demonstrated that various Vibrio species are associated with diseased tissue (May, 2002. B. Sc. Honours Thesis, University of Adelaide). However, that study was restricted to an examination of TFN lesions that formed 8 weeks post infection for lobsters held under optimal growth conditions. Although damage to tail fan tissue by instruments contaminated by organisms isolated from TFN affected tissue was shown to result in formation of TFN-like lesions, the microbial community of lesions associated with TFN over time in terms of both the cultivable and non-cultivable communities was not identified. The extent of damage to tail fan tissue by bacteria and the response of lobster immune cells to infection was also not determined. Furthermore, the presence of potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. within the diseased tissue was identified as a potential public health risk, particularly in food preparation facilities where live lobsters are handled. The work described in this thesis specifically examined the development and effect of TFN on the overall health of affected lobsters, as well a confirmation that the Vibrio spp. involved in establishment of TFN may represent a public health risk. To answer these questions, a larger infection trial was set up. Uropod tissue of groups of lobsters were intentionally damaged with sterile instruments or instruments contaminated with a Vibrio spp. isolated from a TFN lesion. The lobsters were maintained in controlled environment aquaria and uropod tissue samples taken and subjected to microbiological, microscopic and molecular analysis. Microscopic analysis of developing lesions demonstrated that several morphologically different bacterial cell types colonise the surface of TFN lesions. Bacteria involved in infection are essentially restricted to the surface of the lesions, but where significant damage to the uropod tissue occurs, these bacteria may invade the damaged tissue and penetrate deeper underlying tissue. Infection of tail fan tissue results in inflammation and concomitant loss of internal structure of the carapace and deposition of fibrous material within the soft tissue underlying the chitinous exoskeleton. In cases of severe inflammation, a central core develops within the fibrous tissue consisting of a number of cell types, including hyaline cells, granulocytes and fibrocytes. However, there was no evidence of deep bacterial invasion into the underlying inflamed tissue. Viable counts and identification of the bacteria associated with the diseased tissue demonstrated that the bacterial population of TFN lesions is dominated by Vibrio species. Whilst there was no significant increase (P < 0. 05) in the total viable bacterial counts associated with the diseased tissue compared with healthy tail fan tissue, Vibrio species were isolated more frequently from tissue samples from uropods subjected to simultaneous damage and infection. 8 % of bacterial isolates recovered from lesions were identified as V. vulnificus and 27 % of isolates were identified as V. parahemolyticus. Isolates of V. vulnificus displayed colony morphology consistent with pathogenic strains. Similarly, all isolates of V. parahaemolyticus were tdh negative, but 41 % were trh positive. The majority of these species were able to express cytolysins capable of lysing CHO cells. This data indicated that vibrios responsible for establishment of TFN may have potential to cause human infections and therefore lobsters with TFN lesions should be regarded as a potential health risk to consumers. The majority of isolates of Vibrio spp. recovered from infected tissue expressed extracellular lipase and/or chitinase, and this indicated that these enzymes may enable Vibrio spp. to induce TFN in damaged tail fan tissue. The predominance of Vibrio spp. associated with lesions was confirmed by analysis of amplicons representative of genes encoding 16 S rRNA prepared from lesion tissue DNA extracts. This was achieved by sequencing randomly selected clones of amplicons and by use of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis to separate amplicons according to nucleotide sequence diversity. Unlike other crustacean <b>shell</b> <b>diseases,</b> TFN does not induce changes in serum protein levels, lead to significant bacteraemia or changes in the circulating haemocyte population. Furthermore, TFN has apparently little effect on the overall health of affected lobsters. This observation may explain the lack of mortality associated with this disease. Only a non-specific activation of lobster phenoloxidase in response to TFN was observed and only limited activation of phagocytosis of Vibrio spp. in vitro could be demonstrated. This data suggested that the lobster immune system is unable to respond to infection and may explain why the bacteria are able to induce persistent infection resulting in formation of TFN lesions. Nevertheless, localised melanisation surrounding the wound site induced by carapace degradation products is able to restrict bacterial invasion into the haemolymph. The impact of TFN on appearance and consumer acceptance is dependent on the extent of damage caused by TFN. Minor lesions are resolved during moulting, whereas more severe lesions are maintained across more than one moult cycle. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Applications of {{nanotechnology}} in medicine, {{also known}} as nanomedicine, is a rapidly growing field as it holds great potential {{in the development of}} novel therapeutics toward treatment of various <b>diseases.</b> <b>Shell</b> crosslinked knedel-like nanoparticles (SCKs) that are self assembled from amphiphilic block copolymers into polymeric micelles followed by crosslinking selectively throughout the shell domain have been investigated as theranostic agents for the delivery of nucleic acids and incorporation of imaging probes. The main focus of this dissertation is to design and develop unique multifunctional bio-synthetic hybrid nanoparticles that can carry agents for radiolabeling, moieties for inducing stealth properties to minimize protein adsorption in vivo, ligands for site-specific targeting, therapeutic payloads, and are optimized for efficient delivery of cargoes intracellularly and to the target sites toward constructing novel nanoscopic objects for therapy and diagnosis. Alteration of polymeric building blocks of the nanoparticles provides opportunities for precise control over the sizes, shapes, compositions, structures and properties of the nanoparticles. To ensure ideal performance of nanoparticles as theranostic agents, it is critical to ensure high intracellular bioavailability of the therapeutic payload conjugated to nanoparticles. Special efforts were made by employing well-defined multi-step polymerization and polymer modification reactions that involved conjugation of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to chain terminus of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain grafts such that they were presented at the outermost surface of SCKs. Additionally, chemical modification reactions were performed on the polymer backbone to integrate positive charges onto the shell of the nanoparticles to afford cationic SCKs (cSCKs) for facilitating cellular entry and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids. Covalent conjugation of F 3, a tumor homing peptide, post-assembly of the nanoparticles enhanced cellular uptake and knockdown of nucleolin (a shuttling protein overexpressed at the sites of angiogenesis) and thus inhibiting tumor cell growth. Furthermore, these polymer precursors of the cSCKs were modified with partial to full incorporation of histamines to facilitate their endosomal escape for efficient delivery into the cytosol. The cSCKs were further templated onto high aspect ratio anionic cylinders to form hierarchically-assembled nanostructures that bring together individual components with unique functions, such as one carrying a therapeutic payload and the other with sites for radiolabeling. These higher order nanoobjects enhance circulation in vivo, have capabilities to package nucleic acids electrostatically and contain sites for radiolabeling, providing an overall advantage over the individual components, which could each facilitate only {{one or the other of}} the combined functions. Hierarchically-assembled nanostructures were investigated for their cellular uptake, transfection behavior and radiolabeling efficiency, as the next generation of theranostic agents...|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecorded <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> in the Portunid mud crab Scylla serrata from Gladstone Harbour, Port Curtis, Queensland, was investigated. The shell lesions called 'rust spots' appeared as orange coloured {{areas on the}} dorsal carapace, which in severe cases would ulcerate to expose underlying soft tissues. Through the examination of over 3000 mud crabs the disease prevalence in Port Curtis compared {{to a number of}} other locations in Queensland, was determined. Although the prevalence varied over the three successive sampling periods, the average prevalence (14. 3 %) in Gladstone Harbour was higher than the normal background prevalence of 5 % reported for <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> in other crustacean populations. The lesion pathology of rust spot lesions was determined to be unique compared to the described pathology of other shell diseases, where there is an external erosion of the shell primarily due to pathogenic organisms. In non-perforated rust spot lesions, however, the external shell layers remain intact, with the lesions being restricted to the endocuticle layer and adjacent muscle attachments. As this layer is fonned in the postmoult period, it is likely the lesions are due to a defect in the manufacturing of this layer rather than one of pathogenic degeneration. The histopathology was supported by observations of diseased mud crabs held over a moulting period, in which lesions were also observed to form in the postmoult phase. Although chitinoclastic bacteria are considered to be the primary causative agents of <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> in other crustaceans, {{there was no evidence of}} an infectious or parasitic agent being associated with the internal organs or carapace lesions of the diseased mud crabs examined. Furthermore, water and inoculation transmission experiments failed to reproduce the disease in juvenile mud crabs, sand crabs (Portunus pelagicus) or prawns (Penaeus japonicus). Although the nature of transmission experiments is that failure to reproduce the disease does not necessarily mean definitively a noninfectious cause, in combination with the pathology results they suggest that the cause of rust spot shell lesions is likely to be non-infectious. Haemolympl 1. assays were undertaken in an endeavour to measure the health status of diseased mud crabs. Results indicated elevated biochemical factors (two immune factors; antibacterial and phenoloxidase and one cellular enzyme; glutamate dehydrogenase) in both diseased and non-diseased crabs from Gladstone compared to the crabs from Ayr, a non-impacted site where no <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> had been recorded. Levels in the diseased group of crabs were, however, depressed in comparison to their non-diseased cohorts from the same location, indicating a possible suppression of immune responses in diseased crabs. As <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> had been associated with polluted environments, the metal analyses of diseased and non-diseased mud crab tissues from Gladstone were also compared with those from Ayr. Copper and zinc were elevated in mud crab hepatopancreas from Gladstone compared to Ayr in two consecutive years. Mean copper concentrations of Gladstone crabs were two to three times greater than for mud crabs sampled from other locations in Queensland. Total metal burdens were also elevated in the Gladstone mud crabs, with a high variation in the diseased mud crabs suggesting that this group may be unable to regulate metal levels. As copper and other metals have been demonstrated to cause inhibition of calcium uptake in other crustaceans, copper exposure experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that copper could cause rust spot shell lesions by inhibiting calcium uptake in the developing postmoult cuticle. The experiment confirmed that calcium uptake into the carapace of softshelled juvenile, mud crabs was inhibited by sublethal copper exposure. The copper exposure experiments supported the pathology findings that rust spot shell lesions are likely to be caused by a defect in the manufacturing process of the endocuticle. The source of elevated copper accumulations in mud crabs, whether water or sediment borne or dietary was investigated. Water and sediments collected from mud crab burrows and analysed for metals determined that very low concentrations of metals exist in the burrows. A comparison was made between the diets of Gladstone mud crabs and those from Ayr to determine whether diet could be implicated as a source of elevated copper in the Gladstone mud crabs. Stable isotope analyses (carbon and nitrogen) of mud crab muscle was undertaken as an alternative to gut content analysis to determine the dietary sources of carbon and trophic position of crabs from the two areas. Although Gladstone and Ayr crabs had a similar trophic position the disparate delta carbon results suggests the diets of the crabs are different with a correlation established between delta carbon and copper concentration in the tissues. It is possible that diet may be a source of copper in Gladstone mud crabs through biomagnification along the food chain. Although results are preliminary, research into this poorly defined area of ecosystem health in Port Curtis should be continued...|$|E
40|$|Epizootic <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> (ESD) is an {{emerging}} form of <b>shell</b> <b>disease</b> of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) {{that has had}} {{detrimental effects on the}} fishery in southern New England. Three bacteria commonly isolated from lesions of wild lobsters with ESD—a novel Aquimarina sp. (A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4), a novel Rhodobacteraceae species (‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1) and a Pseudoalteromonas sp. (Pseudoalteromonas ‘gracilis’ ISA 7. 3) —were applied directly to normal and abraded juvenile lobster carapaces, and then monitored for persistence over time and for the development of shell-disease lesions at 3 different temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C). Without abrasion of the carapace, no lesions developed in the exposures. After abrasion and exposure with a pure culture of A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4, lesions developed at all 3 temperature and A. ‘homaria’ was detected in the lesions of all animals tested. Surprisingly, ‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1 also colonized these lesions. A coexposure with all 3 bacteria also demonstrated lesion development and the persistence of A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4 and ‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1. The bacterium P. ‘gracilis’ ISA 7. 3 was not able to persist in any of the challenged lesions. Abraded areas of the cuticle with no bacteria added directly were also colonized by A. ‘homaria’ and ‘Thalassobius’ sp., and moderate lesions developed; however, the directly exposed lesions were significantly more severe (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The bacterium A. ‘homaria’, but not ‘Thalassobius’ sp., was detected in spontaneous lesions that developed independent of any abrasion and/or bacterial exposures. A novel bacterium, ‘Candidatus Kopriimonas aquarianus’ was also detected in spontaneous lesions. This study shows that 2 bacteria isolated from ESD lesions of wild lobsters are able to persist in and act together as important components of lesion development on abraded surfaces of American lobsters. This indicates that they are likely major contributors to lesion development in the ESD polymicrobial infection and may represent significant pathogens of the American lobster...|$|E
