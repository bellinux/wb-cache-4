40|$|To {{improve the}} {{reproduction}} of audio <b>signals,</b> the <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> of a selected audio frequency range (1) of an audio signal are concentrated in a narrower audio frequency range (II). This is achieved by detecting first <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> in the first audio frequency range (I), generating second <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> in the second audio frequency range (II), and controlling the amplitude of the second <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> {{in response to the}} amplitude of the first <b>signal</b> <b>components.</b> As a result, dedicated transducers may be used which are particularly efficient in the narrower frequency range.

30|$|The time-frequency {{distributions}} {{have been}} used to characterize the time-varying spectral content of nonstationary signals [12 – 16]. As the most commonly used, the Wigner distribution can provide an ideal representation for linear frequency-modulated monocomponent signals [12, 15]. For multicomponents signals, the S-method, that is, a cross-terms-free Wigner distribution, can be used [16]. The S-method can be also used to separate the <b>signal</b> <b>components.</b> Note that the <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> separation could be of interest in many applications. In particular, in watermarking it allows creating the watermark that is shaped by using an arbitrary combination of the <b>signal</b> <b>components.</b> The eigenvalues-based S-method decomposition is applied to separate the <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> [17, 18].|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the {{gravitational}} and electromagnetic {{waves in the}} analog domain are detected, sampled and stored for further analysis. The signals can be sampled in both time and frequency domains. The <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> is measured at both intervals of time and space. Ex, time-domain sampling refers to measuring a <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> at several instances of time. Similarly, spatial-sampling refers to measuring the signal at different locations in space.|$|E

The multipath <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> of a received signal include not only the <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> reflected from the human body but also the <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> reflected from other background objects. Each radar uses its unique pseudo-random code, and thus, the signal transmitted from each radar is assumed to have no interference with the signals received at other radars. When measuring received signals, each radar adopts an average for the transmission of 4, 096 pulses, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal, and samples were taken every 0.2 s.|$|R

When, however, feeding of the complete detected <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> would result in a clipping situation, then only a part of the detected <b>signal</b> <b>components</b> is fed into the second channel as a real center channel and the remainder is located in the first and third channels as a phantom center channel...|$|R

It broadcast in three HD Radio digital audio channels along with its pre-existing analog signal.

50|$|The {{sound is}} thus {{recorded}} {{at a higher}} overall level on the tape relative to the tape's overall noise level, requiring the tape formulation to preserve this specially recorded signal without distortion. On playback, the opposite process is applied (deemphasis), based on the relative <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> above 1 kHz. Thus as {{this portion of the}} signal decreases in amplitude, the higher frequencies are progressively more sharply attenuated, which also filters out the constant background noise on the tape when and where it would be most noticeable.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "suppressed carrier" [...] {{comes about}} because the carrier <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> is suppressed—it {{does not appear}} in the output signal. This is {{apparent}} when the spectrum of the output signal is viewed. In the picture shown below we see four peaks, the two peaks below 5000 Hz are the lower sideband (LSB) and the two peaks above 5000 Hz are the upper sideband (USB), but there is no peak at the 5000 Hz mark, which is the frequency of the suppressed carrier.|$|E

In the simplest case, this is a ferrite bead, it includes the coaxial inner and outer conductor and acts as a common-mode choke. At the same time, a ferrite bead has a transformer effect, so that a useful signal is confirmed as differential-mode. To increase the inductance compared to the unwanted common mode <b>signal</b> <b>component,</b> the cable can also be repeatedly passed through or wound around the bead.|$|E
5000|$|... one way {{to reduce}} the effect of stray IR {{generated}} within the system is to move from working with DC signals to a narrow frequency band where the amplitude of the stray emissions is smaller. This can be done, for instance, by modulating the source light entering the system with an optical chopper, and isolating the detected source <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> from the detected stray component with a Lock in amplifier synchronized to the chopper frequency. However, this approach is still limited by the dynamic range of the detector. That is, the stray component must not be so great that it saturates the detector.|$|E
5000|$|SFDR {{is defined}} as the ratio of the RMS value of the carrier wave (maximum <b>signal</b> <b>component)</b> at the input of the ADC or output of DAC to the RMS value of the next largest noise or {{harmonic}} distortion component (which is referred to as a “spurious” or a “spur”) at its output. SFDR is usually measured in dBc (i.e. with respect to the carrier signal amplitude) or in dBFS (i.e. with respect to the ADC's full-scale range). Depending on the test condition, SFDR is observed within a pre-defined frequency window or from DC up to Nyquist frequency of the converter (ADC or DAC) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the radiation depends on the height above the ground plane or power plane (at RF, one {{is as good as}} the other) and the length of the conductor in relation to the wavelength of the <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> (fundamental frequency, harmonic or transient such as overshoot, undershoot or ringing). At lower frequencies, such as 133 MHz, radiation is almost exclusively via I/O cables; RF noise gets onto the power planes and is coupled to the line drivers via the VCC and GND pins. The RF is then coupled to the cable through the line driver as common-mode noise. Since the noise is common-mode, shielding has very little effect, even with differential pairs. The RF energy is capacitively coupled from the signal pair to the shield and the shield itself does the radiating. One cure for this is to use a braid-breaker or choke to reduce the common-mode signal.|$|E

"One" [...] is {{represented}} by a DC bias on the transmission line (conventionally positive), while [...] "zero" [...] {{is represented}} by the absence of bias - the line at 0 volts or grounded. For this reason it is also known as [...] "on-off keying". In clock language, a [...] "one" [...] transitions to or remains at a biased level on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit, while [...] "zero" [...] transitions to or remains at no bias on the trailing clock edge of the previous bit. Among the disadvantages of unipolar NRZ is that it allows for long series without change, which makes synchronization difficult, although this is not unique to the unipolar case. One solution is to not send bytes without transitions. More critically, and unique to unipolar NRZ, are issues related to the presence of a transmitted DC level - the power spectrum of the transmitted signal does not approach zero at zero frequency. This leads to two significant problems: first, the transmitted DC power leads to higher power losses than other encodings, and second, the presence of a DC <b>signal</b> <b>component</b> requires that the transmission line be DC-coupled.|$|E
