"Often, in {{far less}} {{agitating}} scenes, had our still Friend shrunk forcibly together; and shrouded up his tremors and flutterings, of what sort soever, {{in a safe}} cover of Silence, and perhaps of seeming Stolidity. How was it, then, that here, when trembling {{to the core of}} his heart, he did not sink into swoons, but rose into strength, into fearlessness and clearness? It was his guiding Genius (Damon) that inspired him; he must go forth and meet his Destiny. Show thyself now, whispered it, or be forever hid. Thus <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> when your anxiety becomes transcendental, that the soul first feels herself able to transcend it; that she rises above it, in fiery victory; and borne on new-found wings of victory, moves so calmly, even because so rapidly, so irresistibly. Always must the Wanderer remember, with a certain satisfaction and surprise, how in this case he sat not silent but struck adroitly into the stream of conversation; which thenceforth, to speak with an apparent not a real vanity, he may say that he continued to lead. Surely, in those hours, a certain inspiration was imparted him, such inspiration as is still possible in our late era. The self-secluded unfolds himself in noble thoughts, in free, glowing words; his soul is as one sea of light, the peculiar home of Truth and Intellect; wherein also Fantasy bodies forth form after form, radiant with all prismatic hues." ...|$|E

Tectonically, the field is located between the Makran mountains in the south, a range formed by Paleocene flysch and older ophiolites, and the Lut block in the north which is a crustal block of Paleozoic-Mesozoic age that is buried beneath more recent sedimentary and volcanic rocks. To the south lies also the Jaz Murian depression. The field is in the Central Iranian volcanic belt, a mountain range with summits exceeding 4000 m of altitude. In this belt, volcanic activity commenced during the Cretaceous as submarine volcanism. A peak of activity occurred during the Eocene, afterwards andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes were formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. This volcanism may be associated either with a crustal weakness zone or subduction along the Zagros. Iran has two other volcanic belts, one associated with the Alborz and another at the Lut. Tectonic processes in Iran are ultimately dependent on the northward movement of the Arabic plate {{with respect to the}} Eurasian plate.|$|E

50|$|The Philippine flying lemur is {{arboreal}} and nocturnal {{and usually}} resides in {{primary and secondary}} forests. However, some wander into coconut, banana, and rubber plantations as deforestation for farming and industry is an increasingly prevalent problem. The colugo sleeps in hollow trees or clings onto branches in dense foliage during daytime. When they engage in this hanging behavior from branches, they keep their heads upright, unlike bats. On the ground, colugos are slow and clumsy, and not able to stand erect, so they rarely leave the canopy level of the forest where they glide {{from tree to tree}} to get to food or their nests which are also high in the trees. In the trees, though, colugos are quite effective climbers, though they are slow; they move in a series of lingering hops as they use their claws to move up the tree trunk. Foraging only at night, colugos on average forage for 9.4 minutes about 12 times per night. They typically leave their nests at dusk to begin their foraging activity. When foraging, returning to the nest, or just moving around, the Philippine flying lemur uses its patagium to glide from tree to tree. The patagium is also used for cloaking the colugo when it is clinging to a tree trunk or branch, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> seen curled up in a ball, using its patagium again as a cloaking mechanism among palm fronds often in coconut plantations. Colugos maintain height in the trees to avoid predators that may live in lower levels, but they are still susceptible to other predators that can reach these higher levels of the canopy and predatory birds that can attack from above. They live alone, but several may be seen in the same tree where they maintain their distance from one another and are very territorial of their personal areas. Though they are not social mammals, they do engage in a unique semisocial behavior where colugos living in the same relative area or tree follow each other's gliding paths through the trees in search of food. This may be a defense mechanism where, as a population, the safest route possible is determined and shared as a sort of cooperative mechanism for increased survival rates. The only time colugos actually live socially is after a mother has given birth; then she will care for and live with her offspring until they are weaned; at that point, the offspring is on its own. The average lifespan of the Philippine flying lemur is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Nowadays {{the plot}} of a rural Khmer house is {{situated}} between the main street, to the front, and the rice fields at the back. In a busy thoroughfare, {{there is often a}} small shop, which consists of a simple wooden shelter beside the street, where all kinds of goods are sold. A party political sign may be displayed outside the house on the street side. A water channel separates the site from the street; here buffalo refresh themselves, and lotus plants are able to grow. With increasing urbanisation, this channel serves to drain excess water from the ground when seasonal rainfall causes flooding. Generally a well, which provides drinking water, can be found on one side {{at the front of the}} house. A Buddha shrine welcomes visitors. The bare ground in front of the house serves as the main working area for any major task requiring plenty of space: rice is spread here to dry (<b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> spread on the warm asphalt of the road); rice threshing takes place here, and milling, as well as all kinds of repair work.The house itself is situated on the highest part of the site. It is essential that the main working area on the ground level is not flooded during the monsoon rains. Banana trees and coconut palms grow beside and mainly behind the house. Vegetables may also be cultivated. Vegetation around the house helps to shelter the house from the intense sunshine, as well as forming a break against powerful winds or storms.Depending on the amount of space available, a clay house for rice storage is situated at the back or to the side of the house. If pigs are kept, their sty will also be in this area. The back of the house is used as a private space: toilet pits are dug here for example; garbage is also deposited here. The area at the back of the house is often used to store palm leaves, and all types of material that are not being used for the time being; there is less activity here than at the front of the house.When children marry, or other relatives move into the household, further separate buildings are built beside the main house. To begin with, when money or building material is scarce, additional family members often live in a temporary [...] on the ground beside or behind the main building. A new building is erected as soon as circumstances permit. Due to lack of money or shortage of building materials such buildings are generally smaller than the main house.All settlements are arranged in a similar fashion, in a linear pattern along a road. In more densely populated villages, which lack direct access to the rice fields and are cut off from main roads, dwellings remain independent from each other, separated by a garden with banana trees, coconut palms and a vegetable plot. In these circumstances the rice fields are situated outside the village.|$|E
