40|$|Background: Obtaining deeper <b>sections</b> or <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} for small skin biopsies. Much of the available literature {{highlights the importance of}} <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> in neoplastic diseases of skin. However, the routine dermatopathology practice in developing countries shows a predominant burden of nonneoplastic diseases, and the utility of <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> in this context has not been much reported. Objective: The study was aimed to evaluate the utility of prospective <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> in routine dermatopathology practice. Materials and Methods: The present study comprising 200 consecutive skin biopsies was carried out in a prospective manner. Three slides were prepared in each case: Slide 0 was prepared from the ribbon of tissue obtained from untrimmed block, <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> 1 and 2 were obtained at 50 μm and 100 μm depth, respectively. The diagnosis was rendered on slide 0 and subsequently reviewed after examining <b>step</b> <b>section</b> 1 and 2. Results: Of the 200 cases, additional findings on <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> were found in 18 cases (9 %) which led to change in diagnosis in 10 (5 %) cases. <b>Step</b> <b>section</b> 1 led to correct diagnosis in 6 cases (3 %). <b>Step</b> <b>section</b> 2 led to correct diagnosis in 10 cases (5 %); however, this was statistically not significant (P ≥ 0. 065) when comparing to <b>step</b> <b>section</b> 1. Additional findings which led to diagnosis was most commonly found in the cases of borderline tuberculoid leprosy (5 out of 10 cases) followed by bullous disorders. Conclusion: We therefore believe that <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> improve the diagnostic accuracy in skin biopsies and they are, especially useful in suspected cases of Hansen's disease. There is no statistical advantage of <b>step</b> <b>section</b> 2 versus <b>step</b> <b>section</b> 1; although, <b>step</b> <b>section</b> 2 had shown to include all the additional findings which led to a change in diagnosis...|$|R

The study aimed {{to examine the}} use of prospective <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> of small skin biopsies {{and its effect on}} histopathological diagnosis and turnaround time. Materials and Methods: This was a hospital based cross-sectional study at Department of Pathology and Department of Dermatology, BPKIHS from June 2011 - June 2012. Diagnoses /comment on three levels of prospectively taken 3 mm biopsies were compared with those of 5 mm biopsies taken from the same/similar lesion from 100 patients. Additional sections from 5 mm biopsies were taken retrospectively. Percentage, proportion, mean, standard deviation, diagnostic sensitivity, kappa statistics and paired sample t- test were used as statistical tools. Results: Of 100 cases, 80 were diagnosed using 5 mm biopsies while 73 were diagnosed using 3 mm biopsies. On additional <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> of 3 mm biopsies, 3 more cases were diagnosed. When compared with 5 mm biopsies, the sensitivity of the 3 mm biopsy rose from 90 % to 93. 8 % after additional sections while the measure of agreement rose from 0. 751 to 0. 826. Mean turnaround time for prospectively sectioned 3 mm biopsies was 2. 56 days and that of retrospectively sectioned 5 mm biopsies was 4. 64 days with their difference being statistically significant.

The accuracy of this segmentation has a major influence on the performances of the global system. But this is a very difficult task. First of all, lip shape can undergo strong deformations during a speech sequence.

40|$|Some regionalist {{movements}} in the OECD-world have experienced a revival parallel to globalization {{since the end of}} the 1980 s. When the strength of regionalist movements is measured by popular support for regionalist goals, expressed in votes for regionalist parties and surveys on different constitutional options, and also by the support regionalist objectives receive from relevant collective actors in the political and social spheres, for instance business organizations and unions, then it can be stated clearly that {{movements in}} Northern Italy, in Catalonia, in Scotland and Wales, and in Québec gained momentum simultaneously with the globalization thrust. In order to find out whether this correlation between globalization and regionalism is due to a causal relationship we proceed in three <b>steps.</b> <b>Section</b> 1 identifies causal pathways through which globalization may stimulate the rise of regional movements. Against this background we formulate in Section 2 more specific hypotheses about the rise of regionalist {{movements in the}} age of globalization. Although these hypotheses seem to have some explanatory power about this "new regionalism", the movements in Scotland and in Québec are identified in section 3 as two cases which do not fit easily into the scheme.

Research methodology has been paid great attention in this dissertation. Three areas are covered in the section: model-building philosophies discusses various frames to approach modelling; the contrast and comparison of correlation and cointegration in terms of methodology; and the concrete modelling method adopted in this dissertation. In the following modelling <b>steps</b> <b>section,</b> both models are discussed in details for testing lead-lag effect and cointegration relationship.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the diagnostic {{accuracy of the}} sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and to investigate whether <b>step</b> <b>sectioning</b> and immunohistochemistry of sentinel lymph nodes increase the sensitivity for detection of metastases. Patients and Methods: Between July 1996 and July 1999, 59 patients with primary vulvar cancer were entered onto a two-center prospective study. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node procedure with the combined technique (preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with technetium- 99 m-labeled nanocolloid and intraoperative blue dye). Radical excision of the primary tumor with uni- or bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy was performed subsequently. Sentinel lymph nodes and lymphadenectomy specimens were sent for histopathologic examination separately, Sentinel lymph nodes, negative {{at the time of}} routine pathologic examination, were re-examined with <b>step</b> <b>sectioning</b> and immunohistochemistry. Results: In 59 patients, 107 inguinofemoral lymphadenectomies were performed (11 unilateral and 48 bilateral). All sentinel lymph nodes, as observed on preoperative lymphoscintigram, were identified successfully intraoperatively. Routine histopathologic examination showed lymph node metastases in 27 groins, all of which were detected by the sentinel lymph node procedure, The negative predictive value for a negative sentinel lymph node was 100 % (97. 5 % confidence interval [CI], 95 % to 100 %), <b>Step</b> <b>sectioning</b> and immunohistochemistry showed four additional metastases in 102 sentinel lymph nodes (4 %; 95 % CI, 1 % to 9 %) that were negative at the time of routine histopathologic examination, Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node procedure with the combined technique is highly accurate in predicting the inguinofemoral lymph node status in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer. future trials should focus on the safe clinical implementation of the sentinel lymph node procedure in these patients, <b>Step</b> <b>sectioning</b> and immunohistochemistry slightly increase the sensitivity of detecting metastases in sentinel lymph nodes and should be included in these trials.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a Bayesian analysis {{of such a}} model. The main contribution of our paper is that different features of the data [...] such as the spectral density of the stationary term, the regression parameters, unknown frequencies and missing observations [...] are combined in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and estimated simultaneously. A Bayesian test to detect the presence of deterministic components in the data is also constructed. Applications of our methods to simulated and real data suggest that they perform well. We place a smoothness prior, {{similar to that in}} Wahba (1980), on the logarithm of the spectral density. To make the estimation of the spectral density computationally tractable, Whittle's (1957) approximation to the Gaussian likelihood is used. This results in a nonparametric regression problem with the logarithm of the periodogram as the dependent variable, the logarithm of the spectral density as the unknown regression curve, and observation errors having log chi-squared distributions. By approximating the logarithm of a chi-squared distribution as a mixture of normals, the approximate log likelihood together with the prior for the spectral density can be expressed as a state space model with errors that are mixtures of normals. The computation is carried out efficiently by Markov chain Monte Carlo using the sampling approach in Carter and Kohn (1994). To make the paper easier to read the full model is introduced in a number of <b>steps.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 shows how to estimate the spectral density of a stationary process in the absence of deterministic components.

40|$|Abstract: Successful {{prosecution}} in the mining industry (south Gauteng) Abstract The Mining Industry Occupational Health and Safety Hub (MOSH) hub, Mine Health and Safety Council (MHSC) has numerous safety interventions (zero harm inter alia) {{in partnership with}} the mining houses. Despite those safety interventions there has been {{a significant increase in the}} number of mine injuries over the past two years. The Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) is the legislation that the mining sector should comply with in order to prevent accidents that may lead to fatalities. In the case of a fatality the MHSA (Section 60) states that â€™the Chief Inspector of Mines must instruct an Inspector to conduct an investigation into any accident that resulted to the death of any personâ€™. This is followed by the application of Section 65, which instructs the Chief Inspector of Mines to direct an Inspector to conduct an inquiry into any accident or incident at a mine that results in the death of any person. Section 72 (1) (b) follows, which specifies that at the conclusion of the inquiry the person presiding must prepare a written report of the findings, recommendations, and any remedial <b>steps.</b> <b>Section</b> 72 (3) then states that the Chief Inspector of Mines may submit a copy of the report to the appropriate Attorney-General (MHSA, 1996). The process alluded to above is a result of the decision made by the 1995 Leon Commission. The Commission recommended against the reintroduction of the Mining Court. It further concluded that â€™its recommendations concerning the inspectorate, the introduction of a legal section therein, as well as a stronger regulation with regards to actual inquiries, should be sufficient to serve a purpose of a mining courtâ€™. This study investigates the impacts that the abovementioned recommendations have on prosecution as a compliance enforcement tool. Prosecution, though contentious, it is part of the Mine Health and Safetyâ€™s preventative and punitive system. This study focuses on the mines in southern Gauteng Province, and stresses that mine fatalities may have adverse impacts on all mining stakeholders, especially families...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recommendations for {{intraoperative}} {{and postoperative}} breast sentinel lymph node (SLN) processing differ widely. Micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITC) {{have recently been}} proposed as prognostically and therapeutically relevant. We compared 3 SLN protocols with regard to intraoperative and postoperative diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLN in cohort I (270 patients) were intraoperatively assessed by stereomicroscopy. Intraoperative frozen section (IFS) was used only in stereomicroscopically suspicious SLN. In cohort II (197 patients), all SLN were examined with only 1 IFS. Final SLN workup in cohorts I and II consisted of complete <b>step</b> <b>sectioning</b> with immunohistochemistry. In cohort III (268 patients) 2 or more IFS were performed followed by 3 <b>step</b> <b>sections</b> and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: pN 1 stages were significantly higher in cohorts I and II (33. 3 % and 34. 0 % respectively) than in cohort III (24. 6 %). Intraoperative false negativity {{for the detection of}} metastases (pN 1) ranged from 54. 4 % (cohort I) and 35. 8 % (cohort II) to 21. 2 % (cohort III). In contrast, ITC were detected significantly more frequently in cohort I (9. 3 %) and cohort II (14. 7 %) than in cohort III (1. 9 %). CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of SLN metastases and ITC in cohort I/II compared to cohort III suggest that IFS may result in tissue loss thus increasing the risk of missing metastases. Sparse IFS but complete postoperative SLN workup with <b>step</b> <b>sectioning</b> and immunohistochemistry provides more accurate information regarding minimal disease in SLN, but often results in delayed axillary lymph node dissection.
