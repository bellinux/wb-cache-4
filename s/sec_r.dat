40|$|The Cape Photographic Durchmusterung (CPD, Gill and Kapleyn 1895 - 1900) is a {{photographic}} survey of southern {{stars in the}} declination range - 18 to - 90 degrees. This volume covers the declination range - 53 through - 89 degrees. Positions are given for the 1875 equinox. The summary of the positional uncertainties quoted in the third volume of the published catalog gives +/- 0. 28 <b>sec</b> (<b>R.</b> A.), + 0. 044 arcmin (Dec.) for zones - 18 to - 57 degrees, + 0. 157 sec + 0. 0764 /cos(delta) <b>sec</b> (<b>R.</b> A.), +/- 0. 056 arcmin (Dec.) for zones - 58 to - 85 degrees, + 0. 157 sec + 0. 0353 /cos(delta) <b>sec</b> (<b>R.</b> A.), +/- 0. 0127 arcmin (Dec.) for the polar plate where, as explained {{in the introduction to}} the third volume, many positions were derived from rectangular coordinates (these are positions reported to 0. 1 <b>sec</b> (<b>R.</b> A.) and 0. 001 arcmin (Dec.) in the - 86 to - 89 degree zones in the catalog). The probable error of {{a photographic}} magnitude, as determined by combining results for different magnitudes and weighting proportionately according to the numbers of stars in each class of magnitude, is given as + 0. 055 mag. From an analysis of the faint magnitude limits on the plates discussed in the third volume introduction, the catalog as a whole can be considered complete to photographic magnitude 9. 2, but it is stated that it will be found practically complete, in or near the Milky Way, to magnitude 9. 5...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} CT perfusion (CTp) protocol modifications on quantitative perfusion parameters, radiation dose and data processing time. CTp datasets of 30 patients (21 M: 9 F) with rectal (n = 24) or retroperitoneal (n = 6) tumours were studied. Standard CTp protocol included 50 sec cine-phase (0. 5 sec/rotation) and delayed-phase after 70 ml contrast bolus at 5 - 7 ml/sec. CTp-data was sub-sampled to generate modified datasets (n = 105) with cine-phase(n = 15) alone, varying cine-phase duration (20 - 40 sec, n = 45) and varying temporal sampling-interval (1 - 3 sec, n = 45). The estimated CTp parameters (BF,BV,MTT&PS) and radiation dose of standard CTp served as reference for comparison. CTp with 50 sec cine-phase showed moderate to high correlation with standard CTp for BF&MTT (r = 0. 96 & 0. 85) and low correlation for BV (0. 75, p = 0. 04). Limiting cine-phase duration to 30 sec demonstrated comparable results for BF&MTT, while considerable variation in CTp values existed at 20 sec. There was moderate-to-high correlation of CTp parameters with sampling interval of 1 & 2 <b>sec</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 83 - 0. 97, p > 0. 05), while at 3 sec only BF showed high correlation (r = 0. 96, p = 0. 05). Increasing sampling interval (47 - 60 %) and reducing cine-phase duration substantially reduced dose(30. 8 - 65 %) which paralleled reduced data processing time (3 - 10 min). Limiting CTp cine-phase to 30 sec results in comparable BF&MTT values and increasing cine-phase sampling interval to 2 sec provides good correlation for all CTp parameters with substantial dose reduction and improved computational efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of GSK- 3 �� inhibitors {{compared}} with PRE and POS in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Isolated hearts were submitted to the following protocols: IC: 45 min global ischemia (GI) and 1 -hour reperfusion (R); PRE: a cycle of 5 min GI and 10 minutes of R prior to 45 min GI; POS: three cycles of 30 sec GI/ 30 <b>sec</b> <b>R</b> at the start of R. Other hearts received lithium chloride (LiCl) or indirubin- 3 �� -monoxime, 5 -iodo-(IMI) as GSK- 3 �� inhibitors. All interventions reduced the infarct size observed in IC group. The expressions of P-GSK- 3 �� and P-Akt decreased in IC and were restored after PRE, POS, and GSK- 3 �� inhibitors treatments. An increase of cytosolic MnSOD activity and lipid peroxidation and a decrease of GSH content observed in IC hearts were attenuated in PRE, POS, and LiCl or IMI treatments. An increase of P-GSK- 3 ��/VDAC physical association and a partial recovery of mitochondrial permeability were also detected after interventions. These data show that, in SHR hearts, GSK- 3 �� inhibitors mimic the cardioprotection afforded by PRE and POS and suggest that a decrease in mitochondrial permeability mediated by P-GSK- 3 ��/VDAC interaction is a crucial event.

40|$|COMPARISON OF SHOD VS NONSHOD ON BALANCE AND POSTURAL SWAY IN OLDER ADULTS A. K. Vyakhk, W. Repovich, FACSM, and E. Messina. Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA Among older adults, falls are {{the leading}} cause of death due to injury and hospitalization. With age, {{cutaneous}} sensation in the foot sole diminishes, contributing to balance impairment. Discovering an effective method for retraining the mechanoreceptors of the feet will possibly increase balance control. Training the different physiological systems involved in balance maintenance is important for decreasing fall risks. PURPOSE: To investigate whether a balance training intervention involving barefoot training (BT) yields better static and dynamic balance, and postural sway values than a group wearing shoes (WS). METHODS: Twelve older adults (65 - 92 years) were randomly assigned into a BT or WS group. Both groups participated in 50 -minute exercise sessions three days a week for six weeks. The sessions included strength, balance, and stretching exercises based on the Stay Active and Independent for Life program. All participants completed a functional reach test (FRT), single-leg stance (SLS), timed up and go (TUG), 30 second chair stand (CS), and postural sway analysis with eyes open (SEO) and eyes closed (SEC). RESULTS: A 2 x 6 ANOVA found no significant difference between the two groups for the FRT, SLS, TUG, CS, SEO, or SEC tests. Pearson correlations were run to identify relationships between variables. As would be expected there was a positive significant correlation between the static balance measures of SLS and FRT (r =. 634, p = 0. 27), as well as SEO and SEC in the postural sway test (r =. 780, p =. 003). There were negative significant correlations between the chair stand and TUG (r = -. 848, p =. 000), and <b>SEC</b> (<b>r</b> = -. 577, p =. 050). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in static and dynamic balance and postural sway between the two groups, but leg strength had an impact on dynamic balance and postural sway with visual input. Future research should consider a larger sample size and a longer intervention...|$|E
