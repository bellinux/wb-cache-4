[...] "It's a big problem, and {{from the number of}} cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're {{in the middle of an}} active investigation into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Payne, a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country". It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom [...] "are using criminals to buy steroids" [...] which he claims to be a top risk factor for police corruption.|$|E

[...] "There is a huge demand for fish and seafood, such as prawn and shrimp.

[...] Tourists also find that there is no huge communication gap, because at least one member in a family, if not all, can converse in English.|$|E

40|$|Freedom, liberty, and {{autonomy}} were the initial ideals heralded by cyberspace’s {{first generation of}} thinkers, writers and citizens, by those who helped forge the Internet and the early technological and intellectual foundations of “cyberspace. ” These ideas were, <b>says</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Lessig, the “founding values of the Net” and inspired {{an entire generation of}} scholarship focused on preserving the free and libertarian nature of the Internet’s culture and architecture. But what has anyone to say about equality? Few, if any, scholars today focus on equality as a similar Internet “founding value” that ought to be preserved—if it indeed ever existed—or promote it as something to strive for online, or in virtual worlds and communities. This Article aims to change this. Returning to some of the foundational texts of cyberspace, this Article argues that equality ought to be understood as a “founding value of the Net” as much as liberty and freedom, and thus should be promoted and, where it exists, preserved. It then offers an in-depth account of the different forms of inequality in cyberspace, drawing, in particular, on challenges of online communities and virtual worlds and then considers measures to fight these inequities. It also argues that many challenges should be left to autonomous online communities to deal with themselves...|$|E

40|$|Dr Frank E Lawrence {{has spent}} a {{lifetime}} helping rural people in his native Jamaica to understand more about sustainable community development. And Spore has been his constant companion, he says, as he goes about his task of helping communities with agroforestry, small animal rearing, value added food processing, bee-keeping, rain water harvesting and alternative energy projects. Spore {{is one of the}} most useful sources for providing information in helping and motivating small-scale producers, <b>says</b> Dr <b>Lawrence,</b> who is a minister of religion, an organic farmer and President of the Northern Jamaica Conservation Association (NJCA), an NGO which focuses on designing environmentally sustainable projects with income generating potential. Due to information and ideas received from Spore, our community won the coveted 2005 Michael Manley Award for Community Self-Reliance and Sustainable Development. In recognition of Dr Lawrence s work, the Jamaican government also singled him out for a personal award the Badge of Honour Award for Meritorius Service in the field of Sustainable Community Development. Sturge Town, the community which won the award, is one of Jamaica s oldest villages, set in a hilly, remote area. Its small-scale farmers rely on livestock rearing and the cultivation of vegetables, root crops, fruit, lumber and spices for a living. Lack of water and good roads hamper development, <b>says</b> Dr <b>Lawrence,</b> who believes local farmers need to be more involved in planning and decision-making. But all these problems can be helped by continuous motivation and creating greater awareness regarding self-reliance and sustainable development. Once he has finished reading Spore, Dr Lawrence passes on copies and articles to other people. He particularly enjoyed the In Brief item on Turning back to Traditional Trees in Spore 117, and the feature on Covering the Soil to Make it More Fertile in Spore 112. We found that very useful in reviving the practice of mulching in our organic farming approach, he comments. Doctor Frank E.
