50|$|Fodder: Not {{widely used}} as fodder, but in India 1-year-old {{plantations}} are browsed by cattle. Apiculture: The flowers {{are a source}} of pollen for honey production. Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite <b>semi-chemical</b> pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Douglas-fir {{wood chips}} from Oregon were pulped with kraft green liquor to produce <b>semi-chemical</b> pulps with {{properties}} {{suitable for the}} manufacture of corrugating medium. The effects of five cooking variables were studied, chemical charge, chip size, bark content of chips, pulping temperature, and liquor sulfidity. The combinations of levels of these five independent variables were chosen according to an incomplete block design, which allowed a maximum amount of statistical information to be obtained from only 30 individual cooks. Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the waste liquor, pH of the waste liquor, the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness. Chemical charge {{is the most important}} single variable affecting pulp yield, tensile strength, and Concora strength, whereas the sulfidity does not affect the pulp yield but does affect the tensile and Concora strengths. Cooking temperature, bark content, and chip size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties. Green liquor pulps have distinctly darker colors than neutral sulfite pulps from the same wood species, and the former pulp forms denser sheets than the latter. Generally speaking, green liquor <b>semi-chemical</b> Douglas-fir pulps are equivalent to or slightly lower in quality than other commercial <b>semi-chemical</b> pulps in Concora strength, but equal or slightly superior to them in tensile and bursting strengths.

The conventional process is unable to partly dissolve the lignin and ex/ractives effectively, and consequently produces EOPB pulp with undesirable results, i. e. low screened yield, poor qualities, and longer defiberation and fibrillation duration. As one way to cope with it, the EOPB prior to the soda anthraquinone (AQ) <b>semi-chemical</b> pulping should be pretreated by biodelignification. In this regard, the EOPB chips were biodelignified through the inoculation of the raw materials with the Cipanas-strainfungi (CPSOI) as much as 5 -and 10 -percent (oven dry weight), and further incubated for I 0 -and 20 -days. Afterwards, the fungi-treatedchips were semi-chemically pulped using the soda-AQ process into newsprint pulp after they are cooked in an electrically heated digester. After the cooking, the EOPB chips were defiberized in a Hollander beater, stone-refined, and then fibrillated in a Niagara beater into ultimately the EOPB pulp with the degree offreeness at 300 CSF. The handsheet was further prepared from the EOPB pulp with the basis weight 45 - 50 gram per m 3. This experiment was mainly aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of biodelignification using Cipanas-strain fungi on the chemical components, processing properties, and qualities of the resulting EOPB pulp for newsprint. The chemical analysis revealed that the inoculation of the EOPB chips with 10 -percent of CPSO I isolat followed by 20 -day incubation period brought about the decreases in lignin and extractive contents by 6. 32 -and- 2. 61 -percent, respectively. Besides such biodelignification also induces the increase in pulp yield (by maximally 3. 98 percent), and the decreases in kappa number and energy consumption (by 11. 19 and 17. 56 percent, respectively).

Later, GL pretreatment of wood chip for bioethanol production was developed and reported that enzymatic saccharification of wood chip pretreated with GL is much more efficient than that pretreated with kraft cooking when compared at the same lignin content [5, 6]. Because lots of kraft pulp mills have recently been closed, it has become attractive to repurpose the mills into bioethanol plants [5, 6]. It is the special advantage in this repurposing that the mills already have equipments sufficient and proper as bioethanol plants [5, 6].

The hydrochar samples produced were analyzed by ultimate, thermogravimetric (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses to determine physicochemical properties that are important for utilization as a fuel. The residual process liquids were also analyzed {{to better understand the}} effect of HTC process conditions on their properties. It was determined that the optimum conditions for producing a solid fuel was at a reaction temperature of 250 °C, in the presence of acetic acid at pH 3. The maximum energy content (HHV) of the hydrochar produced from red liquor at this condition was 29. 87 MJ/kg, and its ash content was 1. 12 wt. %.

Experimental tensile creep-recovery tests of 300 g/m 2 kraftliner (used for the facing of corrugated boards) and 150 g/m 2 <b>semi-chemical</b> testliner (used for the fluting) at 50, 70 and 90 %RH were made by a special designed tensile creep tester. Compression creep-recovery tests at 50 %RH was made using a compression creep tester developed at STFI. For the short-term loading case, the experimental global buckling and postbuckling deformation performance of a corrugated board panel {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the performance predicted by FE-calculation. The calculated local buckling load was however almost 2. 5 times higher than the experimentally observed local buckling load in the panel. This discrepancy between the experimental and calculated local buckling load was most probably due to development of global buckling before local buckling of the panel. For the long-term loading case, the Schapery equation was found to give a good representation of the creep behavior of the facing and fluting material and enabled reasonably accurate predictions of the creep behavior of corrugated board. The Schapery representation for paper was implemented in the finite element codes Ansys and Abaqus. In Ansys, the Schapery representation was described by using stress-strain isochrounes and failure of the material was considered by using a Tsai-Wu failure criterion based on a time independent failure strain in the CD and MD at each layer. This model with isochrounes and a material failure criterion was found to be suitable for calculating failure load for a given time to failure. In the calculations made by the finite element code Abaqus no simplification was made of the Schapery representation and no material failure criterion was used. This model is more accurate than the model with isochrounes stress-strain curves {{in the sense that the}} influence of stress redistribution on the creep is considered. The model is therefore suitable to study the creep strains of a corrugated board structure as function of time, both the in-plane strains and pre-failure out-of-plane displacements. The creep buckling analysis was verified by tests. It was found that the experimental out-of-plane displacement of the mid-node of a panel under compression load was in good agreement with the calculated out-of-plane displacement...|$|E
