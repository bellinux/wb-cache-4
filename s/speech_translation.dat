50|$|When many {{countries}} begin {{to research and}} develop <b>speech</b> <b>translation,</b> {{it will be necessary}} to standardize interfaces and data formats to ensure that the systems are mutually compatible. International joint research is being fostered by <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> consortiums (e.g. the C-STAR international consortium for joint research of <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> and A-STAR for the Asia-Pacific region). They were founded as “international joint-research organizations to design formats of bilingual corpora that are essential to advance the research and development of this technology (...) and to standardize interfaces and data formats to connect <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> module internationally”.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Waibel {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of C-STAR, an {{international}} consortium for <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> research, and served as its chairman from 1998-2000. His team developed the JANUS [...] <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> system, the first American and European <b>Speech</b> <b>Translation</b> system, and more recently the first real-time simultaneous <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> system for lectures. His lab has also developed a number of multimodal systems including perceptual Meeting Rooms, Meeting Recognizers, Meeting Browsers and multimodal dialog systems for humanoid robots. Waibel directed the CHIL program [...] (FP-6 Integrated Project on multimodality) in Europe and NSF-ITR project STR-DUST (the first domain independent <b>speech</b> <b>translation</b> project) in the U.S. He is project coordinator of the IP EU-BRIDGE, funded by the EC and started on February 1, 2012. In the areas of speech, <b>speech</b> <b>translation,</b> and multimodal interfaces Dr. Waibel holds several patents and has founded and co-founded several successful commercial ventures.

50|$|The {{quality of}} {{commercial}} offerings {{is a common}} complaint. Localization is also a common complaint among supporters of scanlations. Commercial releases often have titles, names, puns, and cultural references changed to make more sense to their target audience. The act of horizontally 'flipping' the pages of commercial releases has also received criticism from fans of manga. The reason for this change is that manga panels are arranged from right to left, while the panels in Western comics are arranged from left to right. However, due to large-scale fan complaints that this 'flipping' has changed the finished product from the original (e.g. A flipped manga image will keep the <b>speech</b> <b>translations</b> legible, while any graphics such as the wording on clothes or buildings will be reversed and confusing), this practice has largely diminished.|$|R
