5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males <b>sing</b> <b>songs</b> at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males <b>sing</b> <b>songs</b> in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
