25|$|By 1895, steel had {{replaced}} cast iron as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability {{allowed it to}} be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections. The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a <b>shear</b> <b>wall,</b> the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.|$|E

The Port Authority has stated: [...] "Its structure is designed around a strong, redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected {{by a combination of}} welding and bolting.

500|$|The 58-story Trump Tower is [...] high, {{making it}} the 64th tallest {{building}} in New York City. The tower, designed by Der Scutt of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, is a reinforced concrete <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> core structure and, {{at the time of}} its completion, was the tallest structure of its type in the city. The 28-sided structure, with a stepped facade, was intended to give the tower more window exposure. A concrete hat-truss at the top of the building, similar to one used in the Trump World Tower, ties exterior columns with the concrete core. This hat-truss increases the effective dimensions of the core to that of the building which allows the building to resist the overturning of lateral forces such as those caused by wind, minor earthquakes, and other impacts perpendicular to the building's height.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Shear {{walls are}} used {{in most of the}} tall {{buildings}} for carrying the lateral load. When openings for doors or windows are necessary to be existed in the <b>shear</b> <b>walls,</b> a special type of the <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> is used called "coupled <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> " which in some cases is stiffened by specific beams and so, called "stiffened coupled shear walls". In this paper, a mathematical method for geometrically nonlinear analysis of the stiffened coupled <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> has been presented. Then, a suitable formulation for determining the critical load of the stiffened coupled <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under gravity force has been proposed. The governing differential equations for equilibrium and deformation of the stiffened coupled <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> have been obtained by setting up the equilibrium equations and the moment-curvature relationships for each wall. Because of the complexity of the differential equation, the energy method has been adopted for approximate solution of the equations.

2500|$|Some older {{low-cost}} {{structures are}} elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This {{is seen in}} conditions of damp soil, [...] especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel {{at the corners of}} the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> between pylons.|$|E
2500|$|With each major {{earthquake}} comes {{new understanding}} {{of the way in}} which buildings respond to them. Advances in the technology associated with testing systems, design and seismic modeling software, structural connections, structural forms, and seismic force resisting systems have accelerated dramatically since Northridge. There is an array of building forms and systems that are no longer legal to build. [...] An example is the previously popular [...] "soft-story" [...] multifamily apartments. These buildings typically look like a three-story box on a narrow lot, where the upper two floors overhang the lower floor and are supported on pipe columns so cars can be parked underneath. Because the ground level is soft relative to the upper floors, the upper portion can sway and fall onto the carport below. Today, no wood floors are allowed to extend more than an additional 15% beyond the <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> or other lateral-load resisting element of the floor below. This typically results in overhangs not exceeding three or four feet, compared to the 20 to 40 feet that were previously built. If an architect still wants this type of design, the structural engineer may specify that the previously used pipe column design be replaced with a laterally stiff steel [...] "moment frame". This can also mitigate the problem of the soft-story structure by stiffening the soft ground floor.|$|E

Two <b>shear</b> <b>walls,</b> with identical dimensions, were designed in accordance with the Canadian Standard Association A 23. 3 - 04, except that a greater amount of confinement was provided in boundary elements. One specimen used normal-strength concrete, and the other used high-strength concrete. A number of confinement analytical models were selected to predict the behaviour of each specimen. The test data of two moderately confined <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> (Liu 2004) was used to compare the responses of ductile <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> at different levels of confinement. These predictions and comparisons with the test results are presented and discussed in terms of load-carrying capacities, ductility, moment-curvature responses and energy dissipation. The test results indicate that the increased confinement of the boundary elements significantly enhanced the displacement ductility without appreciable change in load-carrying capacity. In addition, the beneficial effects of increased confinement were more pronounced in the normal-strength concrete <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> than in the high-strength concrete <b>shear</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach to}} simulate the behaviour of timber <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> under both static and dynamic loading is proposed. Because the behaviour of timber <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> hinges on the behaviour of the nail connections, the force-displacement behaviour of sheathing-to-framing nail connections are first determined and then used to define the hysteretic properties of finite elements representing these connections. The model nails are subsequently implemented into model walls. The model walls are verified using experimental results for both monotonic and cyclic loading. It is demonstrated that the complex hysteretic behaviour of timber <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> can be reasonably represented using model <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> in which nonlinear material failure is concentrated only at the sheathing-to-framing nail connections...|$|R

50|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> is stiffer in its {{principal}} axis {{than it is}} in the other axis.

Under this combined loading condition, a <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> develops compatible axial, shear, torsional and flexural strains, resulting in a complicated internal stress distribution. In this way, loads are transferred vertically to the building’s foundation. Therefore, there are four critical failure mechanisms; as shown in Figure 1.
