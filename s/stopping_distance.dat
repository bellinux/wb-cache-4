VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed.

25|$|Prior to each {{leaf fall}} season many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion training for their newly qualified drivers.

Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full Service brake under normal adhesion conditions.

25|$|Automatic Train Operation {{controls}} trains so that, between stations, {{they will}} move {{at the speed}} specified by the automatic train protection and automatic train supervision sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can control whether the train operates in automatic mode or manual mode. From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The automatic train protection system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded {{track circuit}} technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E

Includes bibliographical references. <b>Stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> is an important parameter used in the design of a roadway's horizontal and vertical alignment. Many of the parameters used in the current <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> equation were developed in the 1950 s and may not accurately reflect the driver and vehicle population currently on the transportation network. An accident causation study was conducted to determine if roadways with limited <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> present a safety hazard for the transportation network. Rural two-lane and multilane roadways with limited sight distance crest vertical curves were identified in three states, and accident narratives for the most recent three to five years were obtained for the selected roadways. After analyzing the accident narratives, it was determined that only 18 of the 439 accident narratives evaluated had limited <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance,</b> during the daytime or nighttime, as a possible contributing factor. Ten of the 18 accidents with limited <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor were caused by a vehicle striking another vehicle. There has been a concern that roadways with limited <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> present a significant problem for the older driver as well as large trucks. The percentage of older drivers on the selected two-lane and multilane study sites with limited <b>stopping</b> sight <b>distance</b> was similar to the percentage of older drivers in all accidents, reported by the National Safety Council. Only 30 of the accident narratives evaluated were large truck accidents.

2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|E
