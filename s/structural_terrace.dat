50|$|In geomorphology, a <b>structural</b> <b>terrace</b> is {{a terrace}} {{created by the}} {{differential}} erosion of flat-lying or nearly flat-lying layered strata. The terrace results from preferential stripping by erosion of a layer of softer strata from an underlying layer of harder strata. The preferential removal of softer material exposes the flat surface of the underlying harder layer creating the tread of a <b>structural</b> <b>terrace.</b> Structural terraces are commonly paired and not always associated with river valleys.|$|E
50|$|In {{the top of}} the Hill, {{the walls}} tracing an eagle in flight like another Inca structures. It has three {{defensive}} walls and two sectors with housings. Abundant ceramics and stone cups have been found. To 100 m of the first wall they realized works of recognition in the strength, that alone them esplanade, that apparently served as field of cultures. Evidence is that this construction was effected by the Incas, due to the work of the stone in blocks, the dimension of the enclosures and the <b>structural</b> <b>terrace</b> shapes of some sectors. Integral forms a part with Laguna de Tagua Tagua, since it does not have south wall, which was covered by the lagoon.|$|E
40|$|The Kellerville Quadrangle {{is located}} in eastern Adams, western Brown, and {{northern}} Pike Counties, Illinois. It oc-curs a few {{miles east of the}} crest of the north-south trending Mississippi River Arch. Regional dips average 8 feet per mile to the east (Howard 1961), but local flexures have pro-duced structures which often obscure this regional dip. The most prominent structural feature in the region is the Fishhook Anticline (Meents 1958, Howard 1961), which is about 8 miles long and trends east-southeast. It is located south of the Kellerville Quadrangle on the adjacent Fishhook Quadrangle. An irregular <b>structural</b> <b>terrace</b> occurs on the northeast flank of the Fishhook Anticline in the Kellerville Quadrangle. This terrace is about 250 feet lower than the crest of the anticline and trends in the same east-southeast direction through the central and southeastern portion of the Quadrangle. There is some closure on this terrace (see economic geology below) with oil accumulation in {{what is known as the}} Kellerville and Siloam pools (Meents 1958, Howard 1961). The remainder of the quadrangle (roughly the north half) is structurally lower and generally flat com-pared to the <b>structural</b> <b>terrace</b> at the Kellerville and Siloam pools.

La Mesa Residence integrates {{a series of small}} courts with their adjacent spaces: library, dining, study, and living. At the Colorado Center, Burton brought to life an office complex by enhancing and rethinking its context. At the East Fork Residence, at an elevation of seven thousand feet, Burton anchored the house to <b>structural</b> <b>terraces</b> planted with flowering crab apple trees and created veils of native trees through which to view the house. In São Paulo, she created multiple refuges for office workers and the public. In all of this work, the intention was to create layers of discovery and experience. Referring to Burton’s work on Hesperides in Montecito, Donna Dorian writes, “That the house and garden have made such a brilliant transition into the new millennium {{has much to do with}} the prodigious talent of Santa Monica landscape architect Pamela Burton.” ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} gravity {{interpretation}} method for esti-mating {{the relief of}} an arbitrary interface separating two homogeneous media. The upper medium is discretized into rectangular, juxtaposed prisms whose thicknesses represent the depths to the interface and are the param-eters to be estimated from the gravity anomaly. The den-sity contrast of each prism {{is assumed to be}} constant and known. To stabilize the inversion, we introduce two kinds of constraints on the depths. The first one requires prox-imity between the observed and computed depths at iso-lated points such as those obtained from boreholes (ab-solute equality constraint). The second one requires that groups of depths approximately follow an established linear relationship among the depths (relative equality constraint). Both kinds of constraints are imposed in the least-squares sense. We illustrate the method performance by applying it to a synthetic anomaly produced by a simulated basement relief consisting of four narrow and adjacent structural lows. Only two structural lows produced isolated gravity lows. Nonetheless, the whole basement topography was successfully reconstructed with an average error of 4 % of the maximum relief amplitude. In this example, the rela-tive constraints established that the thicknesses of adja-cent prisms should be {{as close as possible to}} each other (overall relief smoothness). As absolute constraints we used point information about the basement depth at five points. In addition to the overall relief smoothness, other relevant geologic information, such as localized relief smoothness, occurring at <b>structural</b> <b>terraces,</b> for exam-ple, can be incorporated by assigning different weights to the relative equality constraints. The method was applied to the gravity anomaly of Recôncavo Basin, Brazil, leading to a sharper definition of the basement features relative to previous gravity in-terpretations of this area...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 23 test holes has been drilled across Bradley, Calhoun, Ouachita, {{and part of}} Nevada Counties in southcentral Arkansas to {{determine}} the geology of the shallow water-bearing deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age. The correlation of the lithologic and electric logs of the test holes and available electric and drillers 2 ̆ 7 logs of oil-test wells indicates that: (1) the transition zone in {{the upper part of}} the Midway group may be about 85 feet thick in Nevada and Ouachita Counties; (2) the contact between the Wilcox and Claiborne groups is about 12 miles northwest of the location shown on the geologic map of Arkansas, and the Wilcox group is probably not present at the surface anywhere in Ouachita County; (3) a <b>structural</b> <b>terrace</b> extends from near the boundary between Ouachita and Calhoun Counties into western Calhoun County and (4) the Jackson group may extend in the subsurface as far west as Calhoun County and may be considerably thicker in Bradley County than has been previously supposed. The deposits of Eocene age in the report area are composed mainly of sand, silt, and clay that were deposited near the shoreline of the Mississippi trough. The presence of lignite, glauconite, and marine microfossils suggests that the formations of this age were deposited under both subaerial and submarine conditions. The deposits of Quaternary age consist of coarse terrace sand and gravel and alluvium that generally is composed of finer sand, silt, and clay...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the main geomorphological characteristics of Small meanders of the Don, namely: heterogeneity of geomorphological structure, two-level Don Ridge, consisting of upper plateau, {{the most striking}} parts of which are “Crowns” and the lower plateau, which in turn splits into 2 - 3 <b>structural</b> – denudation <b>terrace.</b> The ravines and gullies of the lower plateau have in their upper parts the traces of erosion processes, and in the lower parts are mainly residue accumulation, resulting in the mouth they have an appreciable asymmetry of slopes and a flat bottom. The formation of ravines contributes to low-strength rocks composing the surface, and as summer thunderstorms and spring snowmelt, forming the turbulent flow, small number of forests. Modern wide Don Valley is 15 - 20 km wide and terraced, it reflects the change of epochs of increased erosion and the prevalence of accumulation. There are three river terraces. In addition, the article analyses the possibilities and recommendations for monitoring and optimization of erosion processes. These activities primarily include: systematic observation of {{the appearance of the}} first erosion zones and their immediate elimination; planning regulation of the flow of melt, rain and storm water and the implementation of these plans, measures to regulate the intensity of wind from different directions. It was found that the primary method of monitoring erosion processes – bookmark on typical parts erosion of the process network of ground reference points. According to the results of the conducted research was compiled scheme growing ravines in this area. The results can be used for optimization of the processes of nature in a Small bend of the Don river...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the lead-free, environmentally-friendly multiferroic material, BiFeO 3 (BFO), {{has once again}} {{received}} tremendous attention from researchers, {{not only for its}} fundamental properties, but also for its potential applications such as novel devices that can be written by an electric field and read by a magnetic field. However, {{one of the most important}} limitations for applications is the high leakage current in pure materials. Doping has proved to be an effective way to reduce the leakage current caused by the electron hopping between Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +. In this work, a series of Nd 3 + and Ti 4 + co-doped BFO compositions have been studied using a combination of atomic resolution imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy in STEM, especially concentrating on nanostructures within the Bi 0. 85 Nd 0. 15 Fe 0. 9 Ti 0. 1 O 3 composition, as nanostructures can play an important role in the properties of a crystal. Two types of novel defects – Nd-rich nanorod precipitates and Ti-cored anti-phase boundaries (APBs) are revealed for the first time. The 3 D structures of these defects were fully reconstructed and verified by multislice frozen phonon image simulations. The very formation of these defects was shown to be caused by the excess doping of Ti into the material and their impact upon the matrix is discussed. The nanorods consist of 8 atom columns with two Nd columns in the very center forming the Nd oxide. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the structures of the nanorod and its surrounding perovskites are rather unusual. The Nd in the core is seven coordinated by oxygen while the coordination of B site Fe 3 + at its surroundings are just five-coordinated by oxygen due to the strain between the nanorod and the surrounding perovskite. The APB is nonstoichiometric and can be treated as being constructed from two main <b>structural</b> units - <b>terraces</b> and steps. Within the terraces, Ti 4 + occupy the centre of the terrace with Ti/Fe alternately occupying either side of the terrace. As for the step, this is constructed from iron oxide alone with a structure similar to -Fe 2 O 3, and Ti is completely absent. Quantitative analysis of the structure shows the APB is negatively charged and this results in electric fields around the APBs that induce a local phase transformation from an antiferroelectric phase to a locally polarised phase in the perovskite matrix. Based on this thorough investigation of these defects, a new ionic compensation mechanism was proposed for reducing the conductivity of BiFeO 3 without the complications of introducing non-stoichiometric nanoscale defects...|$|R
