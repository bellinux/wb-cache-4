40|$|Most of the world's poor live in {{developing}} markets and face unmet needs in core {{areas such as}} education, health, energy, sanitation and financial services. This offers businesses a vast opportunity for growth as these economies emerge from low-income to middle-income status. <b>Social</b> <b>businesses</b> in particular address a social need while generating profits typically reinvested into the business itself, but there is limited understanding of the ways through which <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> achieve scale. This paper investigates how <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> can scale up. First, we define scaling up as “increasing the number of customers or members of a business as well as expanding its offer and maximising its revenues until it reaches millions of people. ” Second, using three in-depth case studies of <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> that successfully scaled up according to these definitions, BRAC, Aravind and Amul, we identify scaling up strategies for <b>social</b> <b>businesses.</b> We identified market penetration, market development, product development and diversification as key strategies {{at different stages of}} business maturity. We find that there are two ways of increasing income generated that are linked to these four strategies: increasing revenue per stream and diversifying revenue streams. Our findings give insight to companies aiming to pursue <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> and adds to the sparse literature on scaling up <b>social</b> <b>businesses.</b> A fruitful future research avenue would be to investigate the best sequence for applying these scaling strategies across companies and sectors over time...|$|R

In his work Pragmatism, he wrote that [...] "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the <b>social</b> <b>business</b> of punishment and praise" [...] regardless of metaphysical theories. He did believe that indeterminism is important as a [...] "doctrine of relief" [...] – it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines meliorism – the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.|$|E

40|$|Helping People Living in Poverty? Understanding Factors Motivating Social Entrepreneurship Abstract Increasingly, {{engineering}} educators look {{to increase}} the social relevance of engineering design activities. The emergence of <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> has sparked interest in creating programs that teach engineers about <b>social</b> entrepreneurship. <b>Social</b> <b>businesses</b> are viable business ventures where <b>businesses</b> adopt a <b>social</b> mission. Some strategists view <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> as ways to capture market share in countries that have a large emerging consumer class, such as India and Brazil. These strategists speak of finding “the fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid” and target consumers earning less than 4 USD/day. Other strategists view <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> as direct pathways for poverty alleviation. These strategists contend that businesses focused on meeting people’s needs can create a world without poverty. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to ask how engineering education programs teaching social entrepreneurship construct definitions of social entrepreneurship to motivate students. This paper asks the following questions: 1) What do engineering educators define social entrepreneurship? 2) How do emerging <b>social</b> <b>businesses</b> explain the organization’s motivations? 3) How have these definitions and motivations shifted over time?This paper uses multimodal discourse analysis to explore how different business strategies affect engineering education programs teaching social entrepreneurship. Multimodal discourse analysis allows researchers to connect rhetoric used in problem-definition to the real-world business activities of organizations. The researcher selected two distinct engineering education programs teaching social entrepreneurship in the United States to highlight as case studies. Both programs have existed for more than five years, making it possible to explore how discourse within the program has shifted over time. The results of this research can inform student recruitment, program design, and potential organizational partnerships. Preliminary results indicate that engineering programs began by emphasizing high-volume products geared towards meeting basic needs. Later, engineering programs teaching social entrepreneurship began to emphasize capturing market share in emerging consumer markets. Although data analysis is continuing, these engineering programs do not appear to require students to think deeply about the nature of poverty itself...|$|R

60|$|To {{the present}} Editor, 'Hero-worship,' {{as he has}} {{elsewhere}} named it, means much more than an elected Parliament, or stated Aristocracy, of the Wisest; for in his dialect it is the summary, ultimate essence, and supreme practical perfection of all manner of 'worship,' and true worthships and noblenesses whatsoever. Such blessed Parliament and, were it once in perfection, blessed Aristocracy of the Wisest, god-honoured and man-honoured, he does look for, more and more perfected,--as the topmost blessed practical apex of a whole world reformed from sham-worship, informed anew with worship, with truth and blessedness! He thinks that Hero-worship, done differently in every different epoch of the world, is the soul of all <b>social</b> <b>business</b> among men; that the doing of it well, or the doing of it ill, measures accurately what degree of well-being or of ill-being {{there is in the}} world's affairs. He thinks that we, on the whole, do our Hero-worship worse than any Nation in this world ever did it before: that the Burns an Exciseman, the Byron a Literary Lion, are intrinsically, all things considered, a baser and falser phenomenon than the Odin a God, the Mahomet a Prophet of God. It is this Editor's clear opinion, accordingly, that we must learn to do our Hero-worship better; that to do it better and better, means the awakening of the Nation's soul from its asphyxia, and the return of blessed life to us,--Heaven's blessed life, not Mammon's galvanic accursed one. To resuscitate the Asphyxied, apparently now moribund and in the last agony if not resuscitated: such and no other seems the consummation.|$|E
