5|$|After {{the release}} of Quantum of <b>Solace</b> <b>in</b> 2008, {{producer}} Barbara Broccoli commented that Skyfall, untitled at the time, may continue {{the plot of the}} Quantum organisation, introduced in Casino Royale and continued in Quantum of Solace. Ultimately, Skyfall was a stand-alone film.|$|E
5|$|As a Jew, Kyle often defends {{and shows}} {{pride in his}} {{religion}} and ancestry. He is nevertheless lonely in this regard, particularly around Christmas time, though he takes <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> anticipating the annual appearance of Mr. Hankey, an anthropomorphic piece of feces who emerges from the sewer to spread Christmas cheer.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Grace's (Debra Messing) job forces {{her to work}} overtime, {{which leads}} to Will (Eric McCormack) feeling neglected. As a result, he seeks <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> {{the company of a}} new neighbor, Val (Shannon). Meanwhile, Jack (Sean Hayes) is annoyed that he has to perform {{community}} service for assaulting a meter maid.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Crawley had tended that {{otherwise}} friendless bedside. She {{went out of}} the world strengthened by such words and comfort as he could give her. For many years his was the only kindness she ever knew; the only friendship that <b>solaced</b> <b>in</b> any way that feeble, lonely soul. Her heart was dead long before her body. She had sold it to become Sir Pitt Crawley's wife. Mothers and daughters are making the same bargain every day in Vanity Fair.|$|R
5|$|Narendra's father's {{sudden death}} in 1884 left the family bankrupt; {{creditors}} began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once {{a son of}} a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.|$|E
5|$|In June 1886, Holmes {{received}} an honorary degree from Yale University Law School. His wife {{of more than}} forty years, who had struggled with an illness that had kept her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and a fear that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> writing. He published Over the Teacups, {{the last of his}} table-talk books, in 1891.|$|E

5|$|Mendes was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film {{after the release of}} Quantum of <b>Solace</b> <b>in</b> 2008. Development was suspended when MGM encountered financial troubles and did not resume until December 2010; during this time, Mendes remained attached to the project as a consultant. The original screenwriter, Peter Morgan, left the project during the suspension. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became {{the final version of the}} script. Filming began in November 2011 and primarily took place in the United Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{from what}} would today be {{described}} as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials {{because he did not}} want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the Walther P99 as Bond's pistol. It replaced the Walther PPK that the character had carried in every Eon Bond film since Dr. No in 1962, {{with the exception of}} Moonraker in which Bond was not seen with a pistol. Walther wanted to debut its new firearm in a Bond film, which had been one of its most visible endorsers. Previously the P5 was introduced in Octopussy. Bond would use the P99 until Daniel Craig reverted to the PPK as 007 in Quantum of <b>Solace</b> <b>in</b> 2008.|$|E

In those days he was very miserable. It was only now that he knew how thoroughly he loved this woman--now that she was so utterly beyond his reach. Weak and wavering as he was in many things, he was not weak enough to abandon himself altogether to unavailing sorrow. He knew that work alone could preserve him from sinking--hard, constant, unflinching work, that one great cure for all our sorrow, that only means of adapting ourselves to God's providences.|$|R

5|$|Goldsman's draft, dated June 21, 2002, had Bruce Wayne {{going through}} a mental {{breakdown}} after his five-year retirement from crime fighting. Dick Grayson, Alfred Pennyworth and Commissioner Gordon are all dead, but Bruce finds some <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> his fianc√©e, Elizabeth Miller. Meanwhile, Clark Kent is struggling because of a recent divorce from Lois Lane. Clark and Bruce are close friends, and Clark is Bruce's best man. After the Joker kills Elizabeth on their honeymoon, Bruce swears revenge, while Clark tries to hold him back. Bruce blames Clark for her death, and the two go against one another. Ultimately, Lex Luthor is revealed to have masterminded the entire plot to get Batman and Superman to destroy each other. The two decide to team up and stop Luthor. Christian Bale, who would play the character in Christopher Nolan's Batman film trilogy, was simultaneously approached to portray Batman for Darren Aronofsky's , while Josh Hartnett was offered the role of Superman.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found <b>solace</b> <b>in</b> sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{vision of}} an {{independent}} India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs {{made their way to}} their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide <b>solace.</b> <b>In</b> the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, {{one of the}} 707s transported 300 Australian Army {{personnel}} in two flights to Namibia {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No.33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation <b>Solace</b> <b>in</b> 1993.|$|E
5|$|In January‚ÄìFebruary 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian {{and other}} foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) {{at the beginning of}} 1981. No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors. In February 1987, the unit again joined No.36 Squadron, along with No.33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No.86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos.36 and 37Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War. No.37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation <b>Solace</b> <b>in</b> January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No.486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 maintenance functions to Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000, under Operation Warden. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the Bali bombings in October 2002.|$|E
