5|$|Thus, when Harun {{asked for}} negotiations, Irene {{dispatched}} {{a delegation of}} three of her most senior officials: the Domestic Anthony, the magistros Peter, and Staurakios himself. Confident of their military position, they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived in the Arab camp, they were made prisoners. Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.|$|E

25|$|Design of a {{balanced}} scorecard is about the identification of {{a small number of}} financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} {{requirement for the}} system was to provide additional information to optical instruments, accurate bearing measurements were not required. However, the system did need some {{way to ensure that}} the target being ranged was the one being tracked optically, and not another nearby target. For this role, the system used two receiver antennas mounted about one wavelength apart, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were pointed directly at the target the received signals would cancel out and produce a null on the display. This was sent to a second display, who's operator attempted to keep the antennas pointed at the target.|$|E

He responded, “So much the better, we'll fight in the shade”. Today, Dienekes's phrase is the motto of the Greek 20th Armored Division.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities. According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, {{as well as through}} planning ahead for future economic goals. Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, {{as well as by the}} business sector and market economy of a given society. For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> reach adolescence, they can begin working.|$|E
25|$|Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide {{on the afternoon}} of 30 April. On the following day of 1 May 1945, Magda and Joseph Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide. Author James P. O'Donnell concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmised that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell recorded, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated {{at the time of the}} deaths to have played a reliable role.|$|E
25|$|From within Naples' Poggioreale prison Cutolo {{built a new}} organisation: the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO). He {{began by}} befriending young inmates {{unfamiliar}} with jail, giving {{them a sense of}} identity and worth, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were released they would send Cutolo ‘flowers’ (i.e. money), which enabled him to increase his network. He helped poorer prisoners by buying food for them from the jail store, or arranging for food to be sent in from outside. In such ways Cutolo created many ‘debts’ or ‘rain cheques’ which he would cash at the opportune moment. As his following grew, he also began to exercise a monopoly of violence within a number of prisons, thus increasing his power. By the early seventies, Cutolo had become so powerful {{that he was able to}} decide which of his followers would be moved to which jails, use a prison governor's telephone to make calls anywhere in the world, and allegedly even slap the prison governor on one occasion for daring to search his cell. Another key bond Cutolo created was regular payments to the families of NCO members sent to prison, thereby guaranteeing the allegiance of both prisoners and their families.|$|E

500|$|Like Avicenna, Magnus {{also used}} the word virga for the clitoris, but {{employed}} it for {{the male and female}} genitals; despite his efforts to give equal ground to the clitoris, the cycle of suppression and rediscovery of the organ continued, and a 16th-century justification for clitoridectomy appears to have been confused by hermaphroditism and the imprecision created by the word nymphae substituted for the word clitoris. Nymphotomia was a medical operation to excise an unusually large clitoris, but what was considered [...] "unusually large" [...] was often a matter of perception. The procedure was routinely performed on Egyptian women, due to physicians such as Jacques Daléchamps who believed that this version of the clitoris was [...] "an unusual feature that occurred in almost all Egyptian women [...] some of ours, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> find themselves in the company of other women, or their clothes rub them while they walk or their husbands wish to approach them, it erects like a male penis and indeed they use it to play with other women, as their husbands would do...

2500|$|These {{replacement}} algorithms are [...] "lossy", as {{more than}} one sequence is translated to the same code point. This means {{that it would not}} be possible to reliably convert back to the original encoding, therefore losing information. Reserving 128 code points (such as U+DC80–U+DCFF) to indicate errors, and defining the UTF-8 encoding of these points as invalid so they convert to 3 errors, would seem to make conversion lossless. But this runs into practical difficulties: the converted text cannot be modified such that errors are arranged so they convert back into valid UTF-8, which means if the conversion is UTF-16, it cannot also be used to store arbitrary invalid UTF-16, which is usually needed on the same systems that need invalid UTF-8. U+DC80–U+DCFF are reserved for UTF-16 surrogates, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are used for UTF-8 in this way, and the string is converted to UTF-16 this can lead to bugs or the string being rejected.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first part}} was {{to send a}} large number of {{communist}} cadres to the rural area (eventually totaled over 12,000) to mobilizing the local populace. [...] Once the local population was rallied to the communist side, the nationalist agents hidden among the local population became increasingly difficult to survive, and the intelligence source of bandits was severed. [...] In addition, bandits’ secret base in remote locations hidden in the forest and mountains were revealed by the local populace, thus cutting off bandits’ supply. [...] The second part was to increase political pressure against the bandits by continuously launching psychological / propaganda / political assaults on the bandits, pressuring them into surrender. [...] The military part was mainly involved in concentrating force to fight bandits, targeting the largest bands of bandits first, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were exterminated, it would send shockwaves to smaller bands of bandits. [...] Construction of fortifications was a must to protect the communist controlled area. [...] Mobile strike force was also a must in pursuing the bandits, and cavalries, troops riding in vehicles and trains were assigned this task. [...] Land reformed had played a very important role in the eventual communist victory because when the tenant peasants obtained their own land, their support for the communists strengthened.|$|E
2500|$|To {{close the}} trap on the Fourth Army, the Auckland Mounted Rifles sent a {{squadron}} overnight on 25 September {{to destroy the}} railway line north of Amman. The rest of the division set out at 06:00 to attack Amman {{for a second time}} with the 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades leading and the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve. Chaytor, being well aware of the terrain, ordered the division to move slowly and to wait for infantry support before attacking if they encountered a strong position. The New Zealand Brigade encountered around two hundred men and artillery on a ridge position north-west of Amman. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade moving along the Ain es Sir-Amman road were slowed down by several machine-gun posts, which they over-ran and captured 130 prisoners, three artillery pieces, and four machine-guns. At 11:00, a British aircraft dropped a note for Chaytor reporting that the defenders were leaving their trenches. Chaytor ordered a mounted charge by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, but they were stopped by the terrain and machine-gun fire. For the next two hours, the brigades gradually fought their way closer to Amman. The break through came when the 7th Light Horse Regiment reached within [...] of the Turkish trenches; they fixed bayonets and charged, capturing 113 prisoners and seven machine-guns. The New Zealand Brigade from the north-west had advanced close enough, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> crossed the Wadi Amman they charged and captured the old citadel and the Amman rail station. Within Amman, the division captured 2,360 prisoners, six artillery pieces and several machine-guns.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 17th century {{and during the}} 18th century, popular {{resistance}} to public execution and torture became more widespread both in Europe and in the United States. Particularly under the Bloody Code, with few sentencing alternatives, imposition {{of the death penalty}} for petty crimes, such as theft, was proving increasingly unpopular with the public; many jurors were refusing to convict defendants of petty crimes when they knew the defendants would be sentenced to death. Rulers began looking for means to punish and control their subjects in a way that did not cause people to associate them with spectacles of tyrannical and sadistic violence. They developed systems of mass incarceration, often with hard labor, as a solution. The prison reform movement that arose at this time was heavily influenced by two somewhat contradictory philosophies. The first was based in Enlightenment ideas of utilitarianism and rationalism, and suggested that prisons should simply be used as a more effective substitute for public corporal punishments such as whipping, hanging, etc. This theory, referred to as deterrence, claims that the primary purpose of prisons is to be so harsh and terrifying that they deter people from committing crimes out of fear of going to prison. The second theory, which saw prisons as a form of rehabilitation or moral reform, was based on religious ideas that equated crime with sin, and saw prisons as a place to instruct prisoners in Christian morality, obedience and proper behavior. These later reformers believed that prisons could be constructed as humane institutions of moral instruction, and that prisoners' behavior could be [...] "corrected" [...] <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were released, they would be model members of society.|$|E

Water on cobblestone pavements froze. Hoses froze to the ground. Newspaper trucks were appropriated as ambulances. Smoldering bodies, living and dead, were hosed in icy water. Some victims had breathed fumes <b>so</b> hot <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> inhaled cold air, as one firefighter put it, they dropped like stones.|$|R
5000|$|Modern Petri dishes usually feature rings and/or slots {{on their}} lids and bases <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> stacked, <b>they</b> are {{less prone to}} sliding off one another. Multiple dishes can also be {{incorporated}} into one plastic container to create a [...] "multi-well plate". While glass Petri dishes may be reused after sterilization (via an autoclave or one hour's dry-heating in a hot-air oven at 160 °C, for example), plastic Petri dishes are often disposed of after experiments where cultures might contaminate each other.|$|R
30|$|As noted previously, {{partitioning}} and iterating comprise mental {{actions that}} can be composed with one another and, more specifically, form inverses of one another <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> composed, <b>they</b> undo one another. Thus, they form a simple group-like structure, called splitting (Steffe 2002; Wilkins and Norton 2011). The organization of partitioning and iterating as inverse elements within this structure is what enables students to reverse their reasoning when working with the MSPF (producing the whole from a given proper fraction as previously described; Hackenberg 2010).|$|R
