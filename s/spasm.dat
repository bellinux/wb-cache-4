5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal <b>spasm</b> is a <b>spasm</b> of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E

40|$|Infantile <b>spasms</b> {{constitute}} both {{a distinctive}} seizure type and an age-specific epilepsy syndrome {{that have been}} extensively described for over a century. Stan-dardization of the classification of infantile <b>spasms</b> has evolved, culminating in recent recommendations for separately recognizing and distinguishing the seizure type (<b>spasms</b> or epileptic <b>spasms)</b> and the epilepsy syndrome of infantile <b>spasms</b> (West syndrome). More-detailed descriptions of the clinical and electrographic features of epileptic <b>spasms</b> and hypsarrhythmia have emerged. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have revealed clues about pathophysiology and increased the etiologic yield of the diagnostic evaluation of pa-tients with infantile <b>spasms.</b> Adrenocorticotrophic hor-mone remains the treatment of choice for many neu-rologists.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was first employed to treat infantile <b>spasms</b> in 1958, {{and since then}} it has been tried in prospective and retrospective studies for infantile <b>spasms.</b> Oral corticosteroids were also used in a few studies for infantile <b>spasms.</b> Variable success in cessation of infantile <b>spasms</b> and normalization of electroencephalograms was demonstrated. However, frequent significant adverse effects are associated with ACTH and oral corticosteroids. Vigabatrin has been used since the 1990 s, and shown {{to be successful in}} resolution of infantile <b>spasms,</b> especially for infantile <b>spasms</b> associated with tuberous sclerosis. It is associated with visual field constriction, which is often asymptomatic and requires perimetric visual field study to identify. When ACTH, oral corticosteroids, and vigabatrin fail to induce cessation of infantile <b>spasms,</b> other alternative treatments include valproic acid, nitrazepam, pyridoxine, topiramate, zonisamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, felbamate, ganaxolone, liposteroid, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, intravenous immunoglobulin and a ketogenic diet. Rarely, infantile <b>spasms</b> in association with biotinidase deficiency, phenylketonuria, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures are successfully treated with biotin, a low phenylalanine diet, and pyridoxine, respectively.

5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the <b>spasm</b> of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention.

In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

40|$|It is very {{important}} for parents and health care providers to recognize infantile <b>spasms,</b> an age-specific seizure type often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).

Onset of infantile <b>spasms</b> peaks between four and six months of age, although these seizures can begin anytime {{in the first two years}} and, rarely, even later in the first decade (when these seizures are referred to as juvenile <b>spasms).</b> Infantile <b>spasms</b> are often initially mistaken for other conditions. However, prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infantile <b>spasms</b> are critical. Soon after the <b>spasms</b> begin, children may stop making developmental progress or even lose skills they had previously acquired.

40|$|Epileptic <b>spasms</b> are epileptic {{seizures}} {{with sudden}} flexion/extension {{or of the}} mixed flexion and extension type, mainly involving the proximal and truncal muscles, that are normally longer than myoclonic seizures but shorter than tonic seizures, and last for about 1 second. For diagnostics of epileptic <b>spasms,</b> {{it is necessary that}} they are combined with ictal and interictal epileptiform patterns on electroencephalography (EEG).  The first detailed clinical description of seizures of the infantile <b>spasms</b> type was provided by English pediatrician W. J. West in 1841.  The term of infantile <b>spasms</b> is limited with age and means epileptic <b>spasms</b> that occur to children in early infancy, usually up to 1 y. o.

Infantile <b>spasms</b> are a type of epileptic seizures and West syndrome is a form of epilepsy that is usually manifested through hypsarrhythmia on the EEG and mental retardation, apart from infantile <b>spasms.</b>  Epileptic <b>spasms</b> is the term broader than infantile <b>spasms.</b> Committee of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) recommends exactly the “epileptic spasms” term, as this type of seizures is not a prerogative of the West syndrome and can be observed in children older than 1 y. o. and even in adults.  The authors provided a detailed review of modern references devoted to epileptic <b>spasms</b> including the history of the issue, determination of the term, and position of epileptic <b>spasms</b> in modern classification systems, approaches to diagnostics including differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While> 200 {{types of}} etiologies {{have been shown}} to be {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of infantile <b>spasms,</b> the pathophysiology of infantile <b>spasms</b> remains largely elusive. Pre-natal stress and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction were shown to be involved in the development of infantile <b>spasms.</b> To test the genetic association between the CRHR 1 gene, which encodes the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor, and infantile <b>spasms,</b> five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRHR 1 gene were genotyped in a sample set of 128 cases with infantile <b>spasms</b> and 131 healthy controls. Correlation analysis was performed on the genotyped data. Under the assumption of the domi-nant model, the selected five SNPs, rs 4458044, rs 171440, rs 17689966, rs 28364026 and rs 242948, showed no association with the risk of infantile <b>spasms</b> and the effectiveness of adre-nocorticotropic hormone treatment. In addition, subsequent haplotype analysis suggested none of them was associated with infantile <b>spasms.</b> In conclusion, the experimental results of the present study suggested no association between the CRHR 1 gene and infantile <b>spasms</b> in a Chinese population...|$|R

40|$|Malformations of {{cortical}} development (MCDs) {{can cause}} medically intractable epilepsies and cognitive disabilities in children.

In prenatally MAM-exposed rats and the controls, <b>spasms</b> were triggered by single (6 [*]mg/kg on postnatal day 12 (P 12) or 10 [*]mg/kg on P 13 or 15 [*]mg/kg on P 15) or multiple doses (P 12, P 13, and P 15) of NMDA. In prenatally MAM-exposed rats with single NMDA-provoked <b>spasms</b> at P 15, we obtain the intracranial electroencephalography and examine the pretreatment response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or vigabatrin. Rat pups prenatally exposed to MAM exhibited a significantly greater number of <b>spasms</b> in response to single and multiple postnatal NMDA doses than vehicle-exposed controls.
