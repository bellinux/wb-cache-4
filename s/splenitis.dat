40|$|<b>Splenitis</b> is uncommonly {{reported}} in dogs. Herein, the authors describe its prevalence, clinical findings and outcomes, histologic patterns, and causes. Splenic samples of dogs diagnosed with <b>splenitis</b> between 2005 and 2013 were collected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Gram, green-Gram, Giemsa, periodic acid-Schiff, and Ziehl-Neelsen. Samples were processed for {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to detect bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (Leishmania infantum, Hepatozoon canis). Thirty-three of 660 splenic samples (5 %) had <b>splenitis.</b> Clinical findings and outcomes were available in 19 dogs (58 %); 49 % had weakness, 33 % had fever, and 84 % survived. The most frequent inflammatory patterns included purulent <b>splenitis</b> (27 %), pyogranulomatous <b>splenitis</b> (24 %), and neutrophilic perisplenitis (15 %). One dog had a putative diagnosis of primary splenitis; in 8 dogs, microorganisms were identified histologically or by PCR in the spleen without obvious comorbidities. Twenty-four dogs (73 %) had concurrent diseases; a permissive {{role in the development}} of <b>splenitis</b> was suspected in 21 of these cases. Histologic examination identified the cause of <b>splenitis</b> in 10 dogs. Bacteria were identified by PCR in 23 cases, but the bacteria were confirmed histologically in only 6 of these. Leishmania was detected with PCR in 6 dogs. Leishmania was identified in 1 dog and H. canis in another histologically, but both were PCR negative. Fungi were identified in 8 spleens by PCR and in 1 by histology. This study suggests that <b>splenitis</b> is uncommon in dogs and is frequently associated with systemic diseases. Prognosis is favorable in most cases. Identification of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa in the spleens of affected dogs with PCR should be interpreted cautiously, because the findings are not confirmed histologically in many cases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} findings {{and treatment of}} a heifer with suppurative <b>splenitis.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Clinical report. ANIMALS: A 30 -month-old heifer. METHODS: Splenectomy in the standing calf after local anesthesia and 13 th rib resection. RESULTS: The heifer had an uneventful recovery but was culled because of septic tarsitis 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy is a useful treatment for cattle with traumatic <b>splenitis</b> if diagnosed early. Partial splenectomy may have prevented the late complication of septic tarsitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Suppurative <b>splenitis</b> is usually a complication of hardware disease and has a grave prognosis unless splenectomy is carried out...|$|E

40|$|Aim: A {{detailed}} {{post mortem}} examination {{was conducted on}} the animal to know the cause of the death. Materials and Methods: Detailed post-mortem examination was carried out. The Impression smears from the affected organs was taken and subjected to Gram's staining technique for preliminary identification of the micro-organism. The suspected tissues were processed for histological investigation by formalin fixation and paraffin embedding technique as explained by Luna. Results: Hardware diseases in cattle are a common feature in developing countries where organized farming is still not an adopted practice of management. During post mortem examination, a case of foreign body penetration induced <b>splenitis</b> was encountered. A large irregular abscess cavity was found with greenish liquefactive material found wherever the foreign body had penetrated. Multiple focal abscesses were found in the parenchyma along with congestion and edema. The histopathological investigation revealed inflammation with neutrophilic liquefactive debris, mild fibrosis, vascular sclerosis, focal lymphocytolysis and numerous chains of regular sized bacilli in the parenchyma, determined to be Bacillus spp. Trauma due to foreign body is rare in spleen due to its anatomical location.

40|$|Previously bis(5 -amidino- 2 -benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) was {{identified}} as a strong inhibitor of the multisystem inflammatory disease induced in Lewis rats by injection of streptococcus group A cell wall-derived peptidoglycan polysaccharide (PG-APS). A BABIM derivative, trans-bis(5 -amidino- 2 -benzimidazolyl) ethene (BBE), has attracted attention because of striking qualitative and quantitative differences in its activities when compared with the parent compound. BBE could control destructive tibial osteitis and necrotizing granulomatous <b>splenitis</b> and hepatitis, regardless if given in a preventive or curative mode. The compound had little effect on synovitis, however. BABIM, on the other hand, was active against synovitis and osteitis, but not against splenic granuloma formation. To be effective, it needed to be applied in a preventive mode. BBE caused a characteristic enlargement of PG-APS-laden splenic and hepatic macrophages suggesting that those cells represent targets of the inhibitor.

The strains {{were derived from}} Belgian and French commercially raised broilers with pneumonia. Both genotype B and D strains induced conjunctivitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, airsacculitis, <b>splenitis,</b> hepatitis, nephritis, and enteritis in sequentially (days 2 to 34 post infection) euthanized chickens. Inflammation of the ovaries was only observed in genotype D infected chickens. Overall, the genotype D strain caused more severe gross and histopathological lesions and mortality (54. 5 %) early upon infection. The genotype D strain seemed to replicate faster as severity of the lesions increased more quickly.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{tularemia}} in a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) diagnosed by determination of the isolate's 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence. Pathological examination of the animal revealed a multifocal acute necrotizing hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, <b>splenitis,</b> and lymphangitis of the mandibular, retropharyngeal, and cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, multiple foci of acute necrosis {{were found in the}} epithelium of the jejunum and the interstitium of the lung. Bacteriological investigations revealed a septicemia. The isolated infectious agent was uncommon, not routinely diagnosed in our laboratory and therefore difficult to identify by conventional tools in a reasonable time and effort. thus, we decided to perform a genetic analysis based on the 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Thereby, an infection with Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, was unambiguously diagnosed. This shows the great advantage 16 S rRNA gene sequencing has as a general identification approach for unusual or rare isolates...|$|E

40|$|The lesions and {{etiologic}} agents {{associated with}} 13 outbreaks of respiratory disease in commercial chickens were investigated. Adenoviruses were isolated from tracheal and lung tissues of affected chickens in all 13 outbreaks. Escherichia coli was {{isolated from the}} lung of an occasional bird. The tracheal specimens were consistently negative for Bordetella avium, but E. coli and occasionally Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. There was also serological evidence in one outbreak, and pathological evidence in another, of a concurrent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection of chickens affected with the disease. Gross and microscopic alterations in the tracheas and lungs of affected chickens were similar in all outbreaks and consisted of catarrhal tracheitis and occasionally multifocal pneumonia with mononuclear cell infiltrates. Hepatitis and <b>splenitis</b> with heterophil infiltrates occasionally were seen in birds with coliform septicemia.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{pathology}} and the distribution pattern of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in internal organs of chickens from a field case using immunohistochemical staining. Materials and Methods: 10 groups of broiler, layer, and domestic chicken were collected from necropsy room Division of Pathology, Bogor Agricultural University. These chickens were originated from West Java and collected based on pathologist diagnosis as suspect of Newcastle disease (ND). They were subsequently confirmed positive of ND with real-time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The respiratory, circulatory, digestive, lymphoreticular and central nervous systems were collected for histopathology examination.

40|$|Brucellosis {{has been}} {{documented}} in domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) but published literature is limited despite {{the importance of this}} species in tropical agricultural systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the virulence of Brucella abortus isolates recovered from cattle and water buffalo. Nineteen strains of B. abortus from cattle and domestic water buffalo in Trinidad were intraperitoneally inoculated into BALB/c mice. Spleens were cultured for B. abortus and histopathological severity scores were calculated based on lymphoid depletion, lymphoid necrosis, <b>splenitis,</b> and macrophage accumulation. A general linear model approach was used to estimate the effect of isolate source (cattle versus water buffalo) on virulence. Isolates of water buffalo origin were significantly less virulent in the mouse model based on recovered B. abortus from splenic tissues, spleen/weight ratio, and lymphoid necrosis but not overall histopathological severity scores. Further investigation of isolates recovered from water buffalo might provide the key to the development of procedures for brucellosis control in tropical environments.

40|$|A {{model of}} acute {{schistosomiasis}} {{of the mouse}} was used to observe whether curative treatment would be followed by an enhancement of the hepatic and splenic lesions, {{as a consequence of}} the massive destruction of worms and eggs within the portal system. Mice infected with 50 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni were treated with both oxamniquine and praziquantel on the 50 th day of infection and submitted to a sequential histologic examination from the 2 nd to the 45 th day after treatment. Although severe focal lesions due to dead and disintegranting worms were present in the livers of the treated animals, no aggravation of the general changes (reative hepatitis and <b>splenitis,</b> or periovular granulomas) was seen in comparison with a control non-treated group. Of 50 animals treated during the acute phase of schistosomiasis only one died espontaneously, while 16 ou of 30 infected controls died before the end of the experiment. The present investigation indicates that curative treatment during the acute phase of schistosomiasis does not enhance previous lesions at first and results in progressive disappearance of the lesions starting six days following chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|A novel virus, {{designated}} Cygnet River virus (CyRV), {{was isolated}} in embryonated eggs from Muscovy ducks in South Australia. CyRV morphologically resembles arenaviruses; however, sequencing identifi ed CyRV as an orthomyxovirus. The high mortality rate among ducks co-infected with salmonellae suggests that CyRV may be pathogenic, either {{alone or in}} concert with other infections. In May 2010, an outbreak of disease at a duck farm at Cygnet River on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, Australia, occurred in 4 -month-old Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschate). The ducks had been incorrectly fed during a week-long absence of the owner from the farm. The ducks were lethargic and had diarrhea, and the mortality rate among infected ducks was high. Of 150 ducks, 128 died in a 3 -day period. Despite treatment with tetracycline, only 5 of the remaining 22 ducks survived. The Study After disease was discovered among Muscovy ducks {{on a farm in}} South Australia, 5 ducks with signs of infection were submitted for investigation to Gribbles Veterinary Pathology (Glenside, SA, Australia); 2 ducks died during transit.

Lesions involved lymph nodes, lungs, liver and spleen. Histopathological examination showed multifocal to coalescent, granulomatous and necrotizing <b>splenitis,</b> hepatitis, pneumonia and lymphadenitis. The presence of acid-fast bacilli in some cases revealed {{that it was a}} mycobacteriosis. Bacteriological analysis was performed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the aetiological agent (to rule out it was from the M. tuberculosis complex mycobacteria, which includes species causing human and animal tuberculosis). The identification of culture isolates by PCR confirmed the growth of M. avium complex. Further sequencing analysis determined it was M. avium. subsp. avium. The most likely source of the outbreak was considered to be the feed which shared the five farms, which might have been contaminated with M. avium subsp. avium (common pathogen in poultry and other birds).

40|$|Abstract. Tularemia is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infectious zoonosis, transmissible by inoculation, ingestion, or inhalation of the infectious agent Francisella tularensis. The disease is perpetuated by infected rodents, blood-sucking arthropods, and by contaminated water. Therefore, nonhuman primates housed outdoors {{may be at risk}} for exposure. An epizootic of F. tularensis occurred in an indoor/ outdoor-housed group of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at the German Primate Center. Tularemia was diagnosed in 18 out of 35 animals within a period of 2 years. Six animals died with unspecific clinical symptoms; 12 animals developed seroconversion and were still alive. Pathologic findings were similar in all monkeys that died and resembled the clinical picture of the human disease, including an ulceroglandular syndrome with local lymphadenopathy, gingivostomatitis, and systemic spread, with manifestations such as subacute necrotizing hepatitis, granulomatous <b>splenitis,</b> and pneumonia. Tularemia was diagnosed by culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and ELISA techniques. This is the largest outbreak in nonhuman primates and the first report of tularemia in cynomolgus monkeys. An overview of the recent literature about tularemia in nonhuman primates is given.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{establish}} an experimental model of acute schistosomiasis, sequential histological changes were investigated in the skin, lung, liver and spleen of mice infected with 30 or 100 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni according to four sets of experiments: single infection, repeated infections, unisexual infection and infection in mice born from infected mothers. Animals were killed every other day from exposure up to 50 days after infection. Only mild, isolated, focal inflammatory changes were found before the appearance of mature eggs in the liver, even when repeated infections were made. Severe changes of reactive hepatitis and <b>splenitis</b> appeared suddenly when the first mature eggs were deposited, around the 37 th to 42 nd day after infection. The mature eggs induced lytic and coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes around them which was soon followed by dense infiltration of eosinophils. So, mature egg-induced lesions appeared as the major factors in the pathogenesis of acute schistosomiasis in mice. Mice born from infected mothers were apparently able to rapidly modulate the egg-lesions, forming early fibrotic granulomas. The murine model of acute schistosomiasis appeared adequate {{for the study of}} pathology and pathogenesis of acute schistosomiasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological findings of two canary flocks (Serinus canaria) experiencing mortalities due to infections with Salmonella typhimurium are described.

Flock 2 was an unrelated aviary flock of 40 canaries with high nestling and fledgling mortality. The main clinical feature in affected birds was rapid onset of depression, fluffed plumage and polyuria. Gross abnormalities detected at necropsy in acutely affected canaries which died in good body condition were a moderate to markedly enlarged reddish-purple spleen, congested intestinal tract and mild to moderately swollen liver. The most consistent finding in more chronically affected birds in moderate body condition was marked splenomegaly and diffusely slightly tanned hepatomegaly. Cytological examinations of liver and splenic impression smears demonstrated abundant Gram negative bacilli free and within macrophages. Histological examination demonstrated acute to chronic granulomatous <b>splenitis</b> and hepatitis in all birds examined. A severe necrotising heterophilic cloacitis was also demonstrated in one female bird.

IgM-ELISA detected antibodies for T. gondii starting at day 3 PI {{until the end of}} the experiment (102 days PI). Of the 209 naturally infected sera tested, from many zoos of State of Sao Paulo, 64. 59 and 67. 94 % were positive in the IgG-IFA test and IgG-ELISA respectively.

40|$|Fischer 344 rats {{were given}} the {{attenuated}} live vaccine strain of Francisella tularensis by small-particle aerosol, intranasal instillation, or intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. All of the vaccinated rats developed subclinical infection by 3 days after exposure, which cleared by day 28. Temporal patterns and concentrations of the live vaccine strain organism within the hosts were dependent on the route of vaccination. Pathological alterations were limited to minimal lung lesions in aerosol-vaccinated rats and mild <b>splenitis</b> in intraperitoneally vaccinated rats. Agglutinins to live vaccine strain were detected in the serum of each vaccinated animal and in the bronchoalveolar wash fluids of 66 % of the aerosol-vaccinated rats. Agglutinin activity of the vaccinated rats was associated predominantly with the immunoglobulin M class. Regardless of the route of vaccine administration, all vaccinated rats survived an aerosol challenge of 5. 3 log 10 cells of virulent F. tularensis, whereas all nonvaccinated rats died. Systemic infection did not occur in the vaccinated rats. Pulmonary infection was not prevented in the vaccinated rats after aerosol challenge, but proliferation of the virulent F. tularensis organisms in the lungs was significantly lower (analysis of variance, P less or equal to 0. 01) than that which occurred in the control animals.

40|$|Susceptibility and {{lethality}} {{studies of}} inhalational tularaemia were undertaken using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) {{to determine its}} suitability as a non-human primate model. Pairs of marmosets were exposed to varying challenge doses of Francisella tularensis by the airborne route and monitored for up to 14 days postchallenge (p. c.). Lethal infection was achieved following a retained dose of less than 10 bacterial colony-forming units (CFU). However, precise LD 50 determination was not possible. The model was characterized using a target challenge dose of approximately 100 CFU. Increased core body temperature was the first indicator of disease, at approximately 2. 5 days p. c. Overt clinical signs were first observed 12 – 18 h after the temperature increase. Significantly decreased activity was observed after approximately 3 days. All animals succumbed to infection between 4. 5 and 7 days p. c. At postmortem examination, gross pathology {{was evident in the}} liver, spleen and lungs of all animals and high bacterial numbers were detected in all the organs assessed. Bacteraemia was demonstrated in all animals postmortem. Histopathological observations included severe suppurative bronchopneumonia, severe multifocal pyogranulomatous hepatitis, <b>splenitis</b> and lymphadenitis. Tularaemia disease progression in the common marmoset therefore appears to be consistent with the disease seen in humans and other animal models.

40|$|SUMMARY: Circovirus are viral {{agents that}} cause disease in avian species. The main {{clinical}} {{symptoms of the}} disease are immunosuppression and, in young birds feather disorders. In neonates, the disease is known as "black spot " and characterized by abdo-minal enlargement, hepatobiliar congestion and failure to thrive. Also, it was observed in adult infected birds with other symptoms and clinical signs, such as enteritis, sinusitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchopneumonia, myocarditis, nephritis, <b>splenitis,</b> dyspnea, anorexia, depression leading to high mortality. In April 2008, 317 saffron finch were apprehended during an illegal commercialization and were forwarded to the Wild Animals Recovery Center of the Tiete Ecological Park. Subsequently, 101 (31. 66 %) died and 20 of these were selected {{and sent to the}} Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, Biological Institute of São Paulo, Brazil to investigate possible etiological agents. After necropsy of these animals fragments of lung, liver and small intestine were processed using negative staining and resin embedding techniques. On the transmission electron microscopy, the negative staining technique allowed observation in 20 (100 %) samples of liver suspension, a great number of particles with morphology similar to the circovirus, spherical, non-enveloped, isometric, characterized as "complete " and "empty ", measuring between 17 and 20 nm in diameter. By the resin embedding technique, oval or rounded viral intracytoplasmatic inclusion bodies, containing viral particles disposed in paracrystalline arrays or loose arrangements were observed in ultrathin sections on the 20 (100 %) samples of liver suspension. This is the first report on the presence of circovirus i...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} genetic {{diversity}} of avian hepatitis E virus strains, we characterized the near-complete genome of a strain detected in 2010 in Hungary, uncovering moderate genome sequence similarity with reference strains. Public health implications related to consumption of eggs or meat contaminated by avian hepatitis E virus, or to poultry handling, require thorough investigation. Avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV) is a causative agent of big liver and spleen disease (BLSD) in chickens (1), which manifests itself, {{as its name}} indicates, by hepatosplenomegaly. The etiologic association has been demonstrated worldwide, including Australia, North America, Asia, and Europe (2, 3). In Hungary, BLSD was observed during the 1980 s, but association of the disease with hepatosplenomegaly was not made in Hungary until 2008 (4, 5). Ivanics et al. (5) reported outbreaks of aHEV infection and increased deaths of chickens caused by hepatitis and <b>splenitis</b> and reduced egg production in chicken flocks in Hungary. Tissue samples from chickens collected during 2010 were positive for aHEV by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (6, 7). Paired samples indicated seroconversion upon inoculation as measured by serologic assay, strongly suggesting an etiologic association between BLSD and aHEV infection in the affected chicken flocks (5). The aHEV {{is characterized by a}} small, nonenveloped virion and a 6. 6 -kb, capped, poly-A tailed single-stranded RNA genome. The genome encodes 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 is a polyprotein encoding putative functional domains of methyltransferase, papain-like cystein protease, helicase, and RNA polymerase. The capsid protein is encoded by ORF 2; ORF 3 encodes a multifunctional cytoskeleton-associated protein linked to viral morphogenesis and pathogenesis (1) ...|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasmosis is a {{major cause}} of {{foodborne}} disease, congenital complication and morbidity. There is an urgent need for safe and effective therapies to encounter congenital and persisting toxoplasmosis. The hypothesis was: Combination Diclazuril plus Atovaquone to exert a novel therapeutic synergy to prevent toxoplasmosis syndromes. Methods. Pregnant dams were treated with Diclazuril and Atovaquone monotherapy or combination therapy and infected intraperitoneally with Toxoplasma tachyzoites (600). Results. Infected dams developed severe toxoplasmosis associated syndrome with increases in the abdominal adiposity surrounding uteri, gansterointestinal and other internal organs and excessive weight gain. Numerous organisms along with infiltration of inflammatory cells were detected scattered into adipose tissues. Combination therapy (p< 0. 01) {{and to a lesser extent}} Diclazuril (p< 0. 05) protected dams from inflammatory fat and excess weight gains. This was consistent with pancreatitis development in infected dams (versus normal p< 0. 05) with infiltration of inflammatory cells, degeneration and necrosis of pancreatic cells followed by the degeneration and loss of islets. Combination and monotherapy protected dams from these inflammatory and pathological aspects of pancreatitis. Infected dams exhibited severe colitis, and colonic tissues significantly shortened in length. Brush border epithelial cells were replaced with infiltration of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and microabscess formations into cryptic microstructures. Combination therapy synergistically preserved colonic structure and normalized pathological damages (p< 0. 001) and to a lesser degree Diclazuril monotherapy protected dams from colitis (p< 0. 05) and gastrointestinal toxoplasmosis. Other complications included severe <b>splenitis</b> (p< 0. 001) and hepatitis (p< 0. 001) which were normalized with combination therapy. Conclusions. Combination Diclazuril plus Atovaquone was safe and with a novel therapeutic synergis...|$|E
