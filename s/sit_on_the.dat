5|$|In early drafts, the elephant's name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was {{apparently}} after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eggs for the bird, {{who was very}} reluctant.|$|E
5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

5|$|Clarke held a big {{advantage}} in the campaign as he {{was supported by the}} Métis who had been looking for someone to locally represent them in the Legislature since the territory was formed in 1870. Clarke had also built his popularity and name recognition as a prominent fur trader. On election day Clarke carried the district winning a solid victory. He defeated Moore winning nearly 64% of popular vote. His resounding win would make him the first elected member to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territories council.|$|E

He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a {{move away from the}} English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.|$|E

5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps of the Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Armenian throne, but his nomination {{had to be}} approved by the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and would be the first of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E

5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters.

5|$|To {{recognize}} the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench.

The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E
