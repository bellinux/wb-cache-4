5|$|Almost {{forty years}} after the {{construction}} of Bletchley railway station, the 1884/5 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>shows</b> Bletchley as still just a small village around the C of E church at Bletchley Park, and a hamlet near the Methodist chapel and Shoulder of Mutton public house at the junction of Shenley Road/Newton Road with Buckingham Road. (These districts are known today as Old Bletchley and Far Bletchley). The major settlement of the time is Fenny Stratford.|$|E
5|$|The African {{art museum}} took a {{scholarly}} direction {{over the next}} twenty years, with less social programming. It collected traditional and contemporary works of historical importance. Exhibitions include works both internal and borrowed, and have ranged from solo artist to broad, <b>survey</b> <b>shows.</b> The museum hosts two to three temporary exhibitions and ten special events annually. Reviewers criticized the National Mall building's architecture, particularly its lack of natural light. The museum is scheduled for remodeling {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's upcoming South Mall project.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

25|$|Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987, all {{territorial}} sea and land of New Zealand is declared a nuclear free zone. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships {{are prohibited from}} entering the country's territorial waters. Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons {{in the country is}} outlawed. Despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal, nor does it make radioactive medical treatments produced in overseas reactors illegal. A 2008 <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source.|$|E
25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Data {{from the}} General Social <b>Survey</b> <b>shows</b> that the {{percentage}} of Americans reporting predominately same-sex partners remained stable between 1991 and 2010. In contrast, the percentage who reported ever having a same-sex partner increased, especially among women. By contrast, the National Survey of Family Growth has found an increase in the share {{of men and women who}} self-report a bisexual orientation in their 2011–2013 study compared to previous surveys. Likewise, in the Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, whose data was collected in 2012 and 2013, researchers noticed significant growth in the share of women who report bisexual orientation and attraction, and the share of men who report exclusive homosexual attraction, compared to the results of the First Australian Study of Health and Relationships, executed in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Investigations {{carried out}} by the defense team of the Master of the Vessel and Louis Cruise Lines, after a lawsuit had been filed against them, have {{included}} a new hydrographic survey of the area of the accident in Santorini. This survey was {{carried out by}} Akti Engineering, and discovered discrepancies between the actual mapping of the sea area and the official charts used by the Sea Diamond (and all other vessels) {{at the time of the}} accident. The detailed survey claimed that the reef, which the Sea Diamond struck, is in fact lying at 131 meters (429 feet) from shore and not at a distance of 57 meters (187 feet) as is incorrectly marked on the nautical chart. The official chart also shows the depth of the water at the area of impact varying from 18–22 meters, whilst the recent <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> that it is only 5 meters.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion in}} EU {{countries}} generally opposes Turkish membership, though {{with varying degrees}} of intensity. The Eurobarometer September–October 2006 <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier March–May 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as sovereign state and is de facto not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%). Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.|$|E
500|$|Caroline Street, {{along with}} Margaret, William, Thomas, and Emma streets, were named for {{siblings}} of John Whitehead, who—in 1819—became stranded on Key West after a shipwreck and {{took note of}} the island's strategic geography. Whitehead's brother, William, surveyed the city of Key West in 1829. The original map from William Whitehead's <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> the northwestern corner of the island, bounded by present-day Angela Street, designated as [...] "town plot". This plot was {{the only part of}} the island which had a grid-like pattern of streets: five running southwest to northeast, including the path of Caroline Street, at least a dozen oriented from southeast to northwest, and Front Street, which borders the extreme northwestern coast of the island. Therefore, Caroline was cleared by 1829 at the latest, making it among the oldest streets in either the city or the island of Key West. When it received its name, however, is unclear.|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} of late Iron Age and Roman settlement at Inns Court and Filwood Park, which lie within Knowle West. In 1086, the area that is now Knowle West was assessed by the Domesday survey as part of Knowle in the hundred of Hartcliffe. The <b>survey</b> <b>shows</b> Knowle as being under the lordship of Eadnoth the Constable who had 30 holdings in Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire before the Norman conquest. After the conquest, Knowle {{became part of the}} holdings of Osbern Giffard, who was lord, or tenant in chief, of holdings throughout Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset. The Domesday Book shows Knowle as having eleven households, three ploughlands, one cob (small horse), eight cattle, twenty five pigs, a meadow of , pasture of [...] and a woodland area of [...] by [...] For taxation purposes, the whole was assessed at two geld units. Filwood Park, {{in the southern part of}} the area was part of the parish of Whitchurch until incorporated into Bristol in 1930. In Anglo-Saxon times Filwood Chase was part of the royal hunting estate known as Kingswood Forest, which encompassed a large area around Bristol.|$|E
500|$|By 1911, the {{population}} of the combined parishes was 5,166 but the balance between them had changed: in that year, the name of the local council (Urban District) changed from Fenny Stratford UD to Bletchley UD. The 1926 Ordnance <b>Survey</b> <b>shows</b> the settlements beginning to merge, with large private houses along the Bletchley Road between them. In 1933, the newly founded Bletchley Gazette began a campaign for a [...] "Bigger, Better, Brighter, Bletchley". As the nation emerged from World War II, Bletchley Council renewed its desire to expand from its 1951 population of 10,919. By mid-1952, the Council was able to agree terms with five London Boroughs to accept people and businesses from bombed-out sites in London. This trend continued through the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the GLC-funded Lakes Estate in Water Eaton parish, even as Milton Keynes was being founded. Industrial development kept pace, with former London businesses relocating to new industrial estates in Mount Farm and Denbigh – Marshall Amplification being the most notable. With compulsory purchase, Bletchley Road (now renamed Queensway after a royal visit in 1966) became the new high street with wide pavements where front gardens once lay. Houses near the railway end were replaced by shops but those nearer Fenny Stratford became banks and professional premises. At the 1971 Census, {{the population}} of the Bletchley Urban District was 30,642.|$|E
