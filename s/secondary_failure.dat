50|$|A {{combination}} therapy of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs {{appears to be}} most beneficial in diabetic patients who still have residual insulin secretory capacity.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a {{distributed approach}} for monitoring and diagnosing {{the execution of}} a plan where concurrent actions are performed {{by a team of}} cooperating agents. The notions of plan diagnosis and agent diagnosis are introduced to model primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>failures</b> and the root causes of the primary failures respectively. The paper addresses the problem of diagnosing multi-agent plans when the partial observability of the status of the system does not allow to univocally determine the outcome of all the actions executed so far. In particular, we presents a methodology where the detection of the outcome of target actions activates a diagnostic process, aimed at estimating the outcome of other actions previously executed and at detecting, if any, primary failures. Such diagnostic inferences are then propagated to the other agents for determining the <b>secondary</b> <b>failures.</b> In the monitoring and diagnostic steps, the system makes use of a relational model of the actions for capturing both the nominal and the abnormal result of their execution...|$|R

50|$|The final Atlas E test from CCAS was Missile 40E on February 13, 1962. With OSTF-1 back in operation, Missile 66E {{launched}} on March 1. Shortly after liftoff, a thrust section fire {{started in the}} vicinity of the fuel fill/drain valve. It continued until approximately T+50 seconds and then disappeared, but apparently resulted in damage to the thrust section, as the helium control gas leaked and resulted in vernier engine shutdown as well as no booster jettison. After BECO, the sustainer engine was left dragging the dead weight of the booster section. This combined with the loss of roll control from vernier shutdown caused the missile to tumble and finally break up at T+295 seconds. The exact reason for the thrust section fire was not determined. In addition, an erroneous signal from a pad umbilical threw open the LOX boil-off valve at liftoff, causing a gradual decay in tank pressure during ascent, although this was a <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> that did not contribute to the eventual loss of the missile.|$|E

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of measles in 1985 - 86 {{in a community}} where measles vaccine trials had been carried out from 1974 - 76 allowed {{the assessment of the}} role of <b>secondary</b> vaccine <b>failures</b> in previously immunized children. A total of 188 children from the vaccine trial were followed. Of these, 175 seroconverted initially while 13 (6 per cent) required re-immunization (primary failure). A total of 13 cases of measles, eight of which were laboratory and/or physician-confirmed, were reported in this cohort. Of these, nine cases occurred in the 175 subjects who had hemagglutination inhibition test (HI) and neutralizing antibody responses following the initial immunization. These nine cases represent <b>secondary</b> vaccine <b>failures.</b> An additional four cases occurred in the 13 subjects with primary vaccine failure. We conclude that <b>secondary</b> vaccine <b>failures</b> occur and that while primary failures account for most cases, <b>secondary</b> vaccine <b>failures</b> contribute to the occurrence of measles cases in an epidemic.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{sought to}} {{document}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> rate of metformin monotherapy in a clinical practice setting and to explore factors that predict therapeutic failure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We studied 1, 799 type 2 diabetic patients who, between 2004 and 2006, lowered their A 1 C to � 7 % after initiating metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic drug. We examined all A 1 C values recorded through 31 December 2008 (2 – 5 years of follow-up), defining <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> as a subsequent A 1 C � 7. 5 % or the addition or substitution of another anti-hyperglycemic agent. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the probability of <b>secondary</b> <b>failure.</b> RESULTS — Of the 1, 799 patients studied, 42 % (n � 748) experienced secondary failure; the mean failure rate was 17 % per year. However, patients who initiated metformin within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis failed at an age-and A 1 C-adjusted rate of 12. 2 % (10. 5 – 14. 4 %) per year, and patients who initiated while A 1 C was � 7 % failed at an adjusted rate of 12. 3 % per year. An interaction term between duration of diagnosed diabetes and A 1 C was not significant. Age, duration, and A 1 C at initiation were the only factors that predicted <b>secondary</b> <b>failure.</b> CONCLUSIONS — Although metformin failure may occur more rapidly in clinical practic...|$|E

However, the risk of recurrence in CHB patients who develop HCC despite NUC treatment remains unclear. 167 consecutive CHB patients receiving curative resection for HCC with NUC therapy after surgery were retrospectively enrolled. Thirty-eight patients who developed HCC despite NUC therapy for more than 1 year were defined as <b>secondary</b> prevention <b>failure.</b> The other 129 patients started NUC therapy after surgery. Factors associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The 5 -year RFS and OS rates were 44. 7 % and 77. 3 %, respectively. Sex, BMI, BCLC stage, AFP levels and cirrhosis status were the independent predictors of RFS, while microvascular invasion was the independent predictor of OS. The RFS was comparable between patients with and without NUC secondary prevention. In the subgroup analysis, the RFS was significantly worse in cirrhotic patients with <b>secondary</b> prevention <b>failure</b> (hazard ratio = 2. 373, p = 0. 009). <b>Secondary</b> prevention <b>failure</b> did not have adverse impact on OS. Among 84 patients with recurrence, 58. 3 % of the cases remained in BCLC stage A, and 53. 6 % received a second curative treatment. Long-term NUC therapy may lead to a decline of non-invasive indices of hepatic fibrosis in HCC patients. In general, the risk of recurrence and survival are comparable between patients with and without <b>secondary</b> prevention <b>failure.</b> However, a higher risk of recurrence was observed in cirrhotic patients with <b>secondary</b> prevention <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE - The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether diabetic patients carrying the Arg(972) insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS- 1) variant are at increased risk for <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> to sulfonylurea. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 477 unrelated Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients were recruited according to the following criteria: onset of diabetes after age 35 years, absence of ketonuria at diagnosis, and anti-GAD(-) antibody. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. Patients with secondary sulfonylurea failure were defined as those requiring insulin due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose > 300 mg/dl) despite sulfonylurea-metformin combined therapy, appropriate diet, and absence of any conditions causing hyperglycemia. RESULTS - Of the total patients, 53 (11. 1 %) were heterozygous for the Arg(972) IRS- 1 variant, 1 (0. 2 %) was homozygous, and the remainder (88. 7 %) were homozygous for the wild-type allele. The genotype frequency of the Arg(972) IRS- 1 variant was 8. 7 % among diabetic patients well controlled with oral therapy and 16. 7 % among patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> to sulfonylurea (odds ratio 2. 1 [95 % Cl 1. 18 - 3. 70], P = 0. 01). Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, metabolic control, age at diagnosis, duration of diabetes, and Pro 12 Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 2 gene in a logistic regression analysis with <b>secondary</b> <b>failure</b> to sulfonylurea as a dependent variable did not change this association (2. 0 [1. 38 - 3. 86], P = 0. 038).

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{characterize}} temporal trends in hospitalizations with heart failure as a primary or <b>secondary</b> diagnosis. BackgroundHeart <b>failure</b> patients are frequently admitted for both heart failure and other causes. MethodsUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we evaluated trends in heart failure hospitalizations between 2001 and 2009. Hospitalizations were categorized as either primary or <b>secondary</b> heart <b>failure</b> hospitalizations based on the location of heart failure in the discharge diagnosis. National estimates were calculated using the sampling weights of the NIS. Age- and sex-standardized hospitalization rates were determined by dividing the number of hospitalizations by the U.

ResultsThe number of primary heart failure hospitalizations in the United States decreased from 1, 137, 944 in 2001 to 1, 086, 685 in 2009, whereas <b>secondary</b> heart <b>failure</b> hospitalizations increased from 2, 753, 793 to 3, 158, 179 over the same period. Age- and sex-adjusted rates of primary heart failure hospitalizations decreased steadily from 2001 to 2009, from 566 to 468 per 100, 000 people. Rates of <b>secondary</b> heart <b>failure</b> hospitalizations initially increased from 1, 370 to 1, 476 per 100, 000 people from 2001 to 2006, then decreased to 1, 359 per 100, 000 people in 2009. Common primary diagnoses for <b>secondary</b> heart <b>failure</b> hospitalizations included pulmonary disease, renal failure, and infections. ConclusionsAlthough primary heart failure hospitalizations declined, rates of hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of heart failure were stable in the past decade.
