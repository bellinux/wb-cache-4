5000|$|The {{inverted}} telephoto {{design was}} first {{employed in the}} 1930s by Taylor-Hobson for the early Technicolor [...] "3-strip" [...] cameras since the beam <b>splitter</b> <b>unit</b> behind the lens required significant space, so that a long back focal distance was essential. Also, wide-angle lenses for narrow-gauge movie cameras had to be of this type because of the shutter mechanism that had to fit in between.|$|E
5000|$|On February 18, 2008, an {{explosion}} occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas, owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees {{and has a}} capacity of [...] of oil a day. This event caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports stated that four workers were injured. In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports. According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred {{in the area around}} the propylene <b>splitter</b> <b>unit,</b> although the cause has not yet been determined. Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas, refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.|$|E
50|$|Presaging the {{disappearance}} of the second port on newer FireWire devices, some ADB devices lack a pass-through connector, making it impossible to daisy-chain more than one such device at a time without obscure <b>splitter</b> <b>units.</b> Keyboards, software dongles, graphics tablets, game pads and joysticks typically have pass-through connectors, while few mice or trackballs have them.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the process streams at an {{operating}} petroleum refinery showed that desalting water from the crude and <b>splitter</b> <b>units</b> had the highest concentrations of pollutants, and accounted for approximately one-third of the BOD and COD of the combined effluent. Combined effluent (234 ± 62 mg BOD/L, 510 ± 0 mg COD/L, and Microtox EC 50 4. 9 ± 0. 4 %) was treated using a laboratory-scale batch biological reactor. Ninety-three percent of BOD and 77 % of COD were removed over the first 24 hours of biological treatment. Acute (Microtox) toxic-ity was reduced in two discrete stages; the first coinciding with BOD and COD removal and the second stage occurring after BOD and COD had been removed. A final EC 50 value of 27. 8 % was achieved in batch tests. The two stages of toxicity removal correspond quantitatively to the toxicity removal observed during secondary and tertiary biological treatment at the petroleum refinery’s full-scale wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the field of non-destructive materials testing. It is based on the technical problem of providing a simple and transportable device for the simultaneous and non-destructive determination of several characteristics of surface-modified materials. The problem is solved by a process in which frequency ranges are cut out by frequency filters from the signal curve of two ultrasonic surface wave pulses excited by laser beams, their cross-correlation function is then calculated and from this the ultrasonic delay times and the ultrasonic speeds are measured and the characteristic to be measured is determined by known correlations. The problem is also solved by a device which comprises a pulse laser, a beam <b>splitter</b> <b>unit,</b> a probe, an ultrasonic surface wave receiver, a signal storage unit and a computer, whereby the beam <b>splitter</b> <b>unit</b> and the probe are linked by optical fibre, in the probe are two laser beam manipulation units comprising a transverse adjustment and rotat ing elements and spacers are arranged on the unit-under-test side of the probe...|$|E
40|$|Laser ranging to {{satellites}} (SLR) {{in earth}} orbit is an established technology used for geodesy, fundamental science and precise orbit determination. A combined active and passive optical measurement system using a single telescope mount is presented which performs precise ranging measurements of retro reflector equipped objects in {{low earth orbit}} (LEO). The German Aerospace Center (DLR) runs an observatory in Stuttgart where a system has been assembled completely from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The visible light directed to the tracking camera is used to perform angular measurements of objects under investigation. This is done astrometrically by comparing the apparent target position with cataloged star positions. First successful satellite laser ranging was demonstrated recently using an optical fiber directing laser pulses onto the astronomical mount. The transmitter operates at a wavelength of 1064 nm with a repetition rate of 3 kHz and pulse energy of 25 μJ. A motorized tip/tilt mount allows beam steering of the collimated beam with μrad accuracy. The returning photons reflected from the object in space are captured with the tracking telescope. A special low aberration beam <b>splitter</b> <b>unit</b> was designed to separate the infrared from visible light. This allows passive optical closed loop tracking and operation of a single photon detector for time of flight measurements at a single telescope simultaneously. The presented innovative design yields to a compact and cost effective but very precise ranging system which allows orbit determination. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|The {{ability to}} capture the {{unsteady}} dynamics of high speed compressible flows {{requires the use of}} ultra fast imaging diagnostics. Application of particulate based scattering techniques in high speed flows requires the use of high power, nanosecond duration, pulsed illumination sources such as Nd:YAG lasers in order to record high quality images. Furthermore, the temporal bandwidth of the measurements must be at least several hundreds of kHz while the spatial scale must be at least on the order of the large-scale structures present in the flow. High spatial and temporal bandwidth flow field measurements are not simultaneously available with high accuracy due to the combined constraints imposed by high sensitivity digital image sensors and limited pulse repetition rates of solid-state lasers, respectively. In this work we describe the development of a MHz repetition rate, high resolution, quantitative flow measurement system. The imaging system is comprised of a MHz repetition rate pulse-burst mode laser built in-house and a commercial MHz framing rate charged coupled device (CCD) camera. The laser is capable of producing a wide range of inter-pulse spacings (0. 5 to 20 µs) with individual pulse energies exceeding 75 mJ at 532 nm. The camera, having a single optical input, is comprised of an internal image <b>splitter</b> <b>unit</b> and four individual intensified, frame-straddling, 1280 x 1024 pixel, CCD camera modules. The combined laser and camera system provides imaging frame rates ranging from 2 MHz down to 50 kHz. Results from the application of the MHz rate imaging systems to obtain Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) data from a supersonic nozzle flow will be presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{synthesis}} problem of distributed wastewater networks using mathematical programming approach based on the superstructure optimization. We present a generalized superstructure and optimization model {{for the design of}} the distributed wastewater treatment networks. The superstructure includes <b>splitters,</b> treatment <b>units,</b> mixers, with all feasible interconnections including water recirculation. Based on the superstructure the optimization model is presented. The optimization model is given as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem where the objective function can be defined to minimize the total amount of wastewater treated in treatment operations or to minimize the total treatment costs. The NLP model is extended to a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem where binary variables are used for the selection of the wastewater treatment technologies. The bounds for all flowrates and concentrations in the wastewater network are specified as general equations. The proposed models are solved using the global optimization solvers (BARON and LINDOGlobal). The application of the proposed models is illustrated on the two wastewater network problems of different complexity. First one is formulated as the NLP and the second one as the MINLP. For the second one the parametric and structural optimization is performed at the same time where optimal flowrates, concentrations as well as optimal technologies for the wastewater treatment are selected. Using the proposed model both problems are solved to global optimality...|$|R
30|$|The {{viewing angle}} of {{integral}} imaging system {{is limited by}} the size of each elemental image and the distance between the lenslet and the EIA. In an integral imaging system, the lenslet array acts as a spatial beam <b>splitter.</b> Each lenslet <b>unit</b> is equivalent to a macro pixel so the lenslet unit is always not large. Most of the commercially available lenslet arrays are made of single-layer optical glass or optical plastic. They have no aberration correction capability and the monolayer lenslet array has a small viewing angle of about 30 degrees. To overcome the limitation of viewing angle, various methods have been proposed [5 – 10, 14, 15]. However, most of these algorithms have some limitations and their performances heavily depend on some specific conditions. The viewer tracking has a complex control system and modifying the configuration of the lens array can also extend the viewing angle, such as the fresnel lens array and negative index planoconcave lens array [18, 19]. Conventional fisheye lenses can map flat image onto wide field of view, but suppressing field curvature and their aberrations needs multi-layer components, and thus imposes harsh design tradeoffs.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the accuracy and reliability of collecting geospatial data by hybrid and conventional GPS apparatus in terms of selected forest locations at the SLP ML Krtiny. For this comparison, the chosen standard equipment was the Trimble GPS Pathfinder ProXH which processes signals only from the global satellite navigation system NAVSTAR GPS and the hybrid receiver Pathfinder ProXRT receiver, which is able to receive GPS signals and the signals of the global navigation satellite system GLONASS. For this purpose, a self-testing kit was designed consisting of a Trimble Tornado dual-frequency antenna, which was the connected to the GNSS receivers via a signal <b>splitter</b> <b>unit.</b> The advantage of this system is that both GNSS devices receive signals from a common antenna, ensuring that observational conditions are completely identical. Data collection was carried out at three sites with different terrain and forest conditions and on the spot with the best observational conditions (roof LDF). Observations were made for a period of one hour at each location. The processed results revealed that the GLONASS system used in conjunction with the GPS system delivered less accurate results than expected. In only one instance did the hybrid system deliver accurate data; this was when observational conditions were particularly poor, due to forest conditions and terrain. In this case the GLONASS plus GPS system benefited from a continuous satellite signal, whereas the GPS system suffered from only intermittent satellite contact. After the application of post-processing correction through the virtual reference station network CZPOS the margin of error was generally reduced, resulting in a lower RMS for both receivers, but the higher number of satellite contacts with the hybrid system resulted in more accurate results only under especially poor environmental conditions...|$|E
