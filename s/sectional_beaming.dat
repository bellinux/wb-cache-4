This study aims to investigate the shear behavior of UHPFRC rectangular cross <b>sectional</b> <b>beams</b> with fiber volume fraction of 1.5  % considering a spacing of shear reinforcement. Shear tests for simply supported UHPFRC beams were performed. Test results showed that the steel fibers substantially improved of the shear resistance of the UHPFRC beams. Also, shear reinforcement had a synergetic effect on enhancement of ductility. Even though the spacing of shear reinforcement exceeds the spacing limit recommended by current design codes (ACI 318 - 14), shear strength of UHPFRC beam was noticeably greater than current design codes. Therefore, the spacing limit of 0.75 d can be allowed for UHPFRC beams.|$|R

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{strength of a}} reinforced concrete, metallic or timber beam can be increased by bonding a thin plate, made of steel or fiber-reinforced polymer, to its tension face. A main failure mode of such plated beams involves debonding of the plate end from the beam and such plate-end debonding depends strongly on the interfacial stresses between the beam and the plate. Consequently, many analytical solutions {{have been developed for}} the interfacial stresses of specific plated beam problems, with almost all of them being for simply supported plated straight beams of constant section subjected to simple loadings. The existing analytical solutions are therefore neither general enough nor simple enough for direct exploitation in assessing the risk of plate-end debonding failure. This paper corrects this deficiency by presenting a simple, accurate yet general solution for interfacial stresses. The solution is applicable to plated beams of all geometric (e. g., curved <b>beams),</b> <b>sectional</b> (e. g., tapered beams), loading (e. g., a linearly varying distributed load), and boundary conditions (e. g., continuous beams).

In these approximate expressions, only the sectional forces and properties of the plate end section are involved, which greatly facilitates their direct exploitation in predicting debonding failure.

This design method hierarchically decomposed the highly-coupled interdisciplinary rotor analysis into global and local levels. In the global level, aeroelastic response analysis and rotor trim are conduced based on multi-body dynamic models. In the local level, variational asymptotic <b>beam</b> <b>sectional</b> analysis methods are used for the equivalent one-dimensional beam properties. Compared with traditional design methodology, the proposed method is more efficient and accurate. Then, the proposed method is used to study three different design problems that have not been investigated before. The first is to add manufacturing constraints into design optimization. The introduction of manufacturing constraints complicates the optimization process. However, the design with manufacturing constraints benefits the manufacturing process and reduces the risk of violating major performance constraints. Next, a new design procedure for {{structural design}} against fatigue failure is proposed. This procedure combines the fatigue analysis with the optimization process. The durability or fatigue analysis employs a strength-based model. The design is subject to stiffness, frequency, and durability constraints.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamic analysis of flexible,non-linear multi-body beam systems. The focus is on problems where the strains within each elastic body (beam) remain small. Based on geometrically non-linear elasticity theory, the non-linear 3 -D beam problem splits into either a linear or non-linear 2 -D analysis of the beam cross-section and a non-linear 1 -D analysis along the beam reference line. The splitting of the three-dimensional beam problem into two- and one-dimensional parts, called dimensional reduction,results in a tremendous savings of computational effort relative to the cost of three-dimensional finite element analysis,the only alternative for realistic beams. The analysis of beam-like structures made of laminated composite materials requires a much more complicated methodology.

The actuator {{is a low}} complexity, active compliant mechanism obtained by coupling a modified star cross <b>sectional</b> configuration composite <b>beam</b> with a helicoidal bimorph piezoelectric actuator coiled around it. This novel actuator is a good candidate as a hinge tension-torsion bar actuator for a helicopter rotor blade flap or blade tip and mirror rotational positioning. In the wing tip case, the tip deflection angle is different only according to the aerodynamic moment depending on the hinge position of the actuator along the chord and applied voltage {{because there is no}} centrifugal force. For an active blade tip subject to incompressible flow and 2 D quasi steady airloads, its twist angle is related not only to aerodynamic moment and applied voltage but also to coupling terms, such as the trapeze effect and the tennis racquet effect. Results show the benefit of hinge position aft of the aerodynamic center, such that the blade tip response is amplified by airloads. Contrary to this effect, results also show that the centrifugal effects and inertial effect cause an amplitude reduction in the response. Summation of these effects determines the overall blade tip response. The results for a certain hinge position of Xh= 1. 5 % chord aft of the quarter chord point proves that the tip deflection target design range[- 2,+ 2] can be achieved for all pitch angle configurations chosen.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{composite}} beam models are constructed for efficient high-fidelity beam analysis based on the variational-asymptotic method (VAM). Without invoking any a priori kinematic assumptions, the original three-dimensional, geometrically nonlinear beam problem is rigorously split into a two-dimensional cross-sectional analysis and a one-dimensional global beam analysis, {{taking advantage of the}} geometric small parameter that is an inherent property of the structure. The thermal problem of composite beams is studied first. According to the quasisteady theory of thermoelasticity, two beam models are proposed: one for heat conduction analysis and the other for thermoelastic analysis. For heat conduction analysis, two different types of thermal loads are modeled: with and without prescribed temperatures over the crosssections. Then a thermoelastic beam model is constructed under the previously solved thermal field. This model is also extended for composite materials, which removed the restriction on temperature variations and added the dependence of material properties with respect to temperature based on Kovalenoko’s small-strain thermoelasticity theory. Next the VAM is applied to model the multiphysics behavior of beam structure. A multiphysics beam model is proposed to capture the piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, pyroelectric, pyromagnetic, and hygrothermal effects. For the zeroth-order approximation, the classical models are in the form of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. In the refined theory, generalized Timoshenko models have been developed, including two transverse shear strain measures. In order to avoid ill-conditioned matrices, a scaling method for multiphysics modeling is also presented. Three-dimensional field quantities are recovered from the one-dimensional variables obtained from the global beam analysis. A number of numerical examples of different beams are given to demonstrate the application and accuracy of the present theory. Excellent agreements between the results obtained by the current models and those obtained by three-dimensional finite element analysis, analytical solutions, and those available in the literature can be observed for all the cross-sectional variables.

KramerOf seismic steel {{lateral force}} {{resisting}} systems in practice today, the Moment Frame has most diverse connection types. Special Moment frames resist lateral loads through energy dissipation of the inelastic deformation {{of the beam}} members. The 1994 Northridge earthquake proved that the standard for welded beam-column connections were not sufficient to prevent damage to the connection {{or failure of the}} connection. Through numerous studies, new methods and standards for Special Moment Frame connections are presented in the Seismic Design Manual 2 nd Edition to promote energy dissipation away from the beam-column connection. A common type of SMF is the Reduce Beams Section (RBS). To encourage inelastic deformation away from the beam-column connection, the beam flange’s dimensions are reduced a distance away from the beam-column connection; making the member “weaker” at that specific location dictating where the plastic hinging will occur during a seismic event. The reduction is usually taken in a semi-circular pattern. Another type of SMF connection is the Kaiser Bolted Bracket® (KBB) which consists of brackets that stiffen the beam-column connection. KBB connections are similar to RBS connections as the stiffness is higher near the connection and lower away from the connection. Instead of reducing the <b>beam’s</b> <b>sectional</b> properties, KBB uses a bracket to stiffen the connection. The building used in this parametric study is a 4 -story office building.

Utilizing vortex theory to model induction, computationally efficient corrections are derived that are key in more accurately predicting performance for coned rotors. The theory is extended to include wake expansion, dynamic inflow, and yawed conditions, as well as considering centrifugal and radial-flow induced stall-delay. The theory is favourably validated against Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental results for both real and idealized rotors. BLADED TM was to be modified with the enhanced BEM method for dynamic analyses. To support these analyses, a <b>beam</b> <b>sectional</b> model and Finite Element Method (FEM) approach to the generalized centrifugally stiffened beam problem were implemented. Ultimately, the linear structural theory in current codes precluded accurate predictions at large flap angles. In lieu of a fully non-linear flexible-body simulation, a rigid-body dynamic model of the system was developed. The coupled aerodynamic and structural models were then used to analyse steady-state and dynamic operation, including optimal control schedules. Parametric optimization studies were {{used to examine the}} interplay between design variables for the coning rotor, relative to a reference conventional machine. Increased blade length, shape and airfoil choice were found to be tightly coupled, yielding energy gains of 10 - 30 % over conventional rotors. Airfoil choice and control mechanism were found critical to limiting torque and thrust. The fundamental non-linear open-loop dynamics were also examined, including flap and edgewise damping behaviour. Low-Frequency Noise (LFN) was computed with a properly implemented physics-based model, to quantify sensitivity to design and operational parameters. The current work is a preliminary, but critical step, in proving the worth of the coning rotor. Controlled design and an accurate flexible-body code will be required for full load-set simulations, to affect detailed component design and costing.

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials have broad, proven applications in many engineering systems ranging from sports equipment sectors to components {{on the space}} shuttle because of their lightweight characteristics and significantly high stiffness. Together with this merit of {{composite materials}} is the challenge of improving computational simulation process for composites analysis. Composite structures, particularly composite laminates, usually consist of many layers with different lay-up angles. The anisotropic and heterogeneous features render 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) computationally expensive {{in terms of the}} computational time and the computing power. ^ At the constituent level, composite materials are heterogeneous. But quite often one homogenizes each layer of composites, i. e. lamina, and uses the homogenized material properties as averaged (smeared) values of those constituent materials for analysis. This is an approach extensively used in design and analysis of composite laminates. Furthermore, many industries tempted to use smeared properties at the laminate level to further reduce the model of composite structures. At this scale, smeared properties are averaged material properties that are weighted by the layer thickness. Although this approach has the advantage of saving computational time and cost of modeling significantly, the prediction of the structural responses may not be accurate, particularly the pointwise stress distribution. Therefore, it is important to quantify the loss of accuracy when one uses smeared properties. In this paper, several different benchmark problems are carefully investigated in order to exemplify the effect of the smeared properties on the global behavior and pointwise stress distribution of the composite beam. ^ In the classical beam theory, both Newtonian method and variational method include several ad hoc assumptions to construct the model, however, these assumptions are avoided if one uses variational asymptotic method. VABS (Variational Asymptotical <b>Beam</b> <b>Sectional</b> Analysis) is a code implementing the theory of classical beam modeling based on the variational asymptotic method. We will also show in this thesis that using VABS with the same set of benchmark examples enables efficient and high fidelity analysis of composite beams by comparing to the detailed 3 D FEA using a commercial finite element software. ...|$|R
40|$|Beam has {{historically}} found its broad applications. Nowadays, many engineering constructions still rely on {{this type of}} structure which could be made of anisotropic and heterogeneous materials. These applications motivate the development of beam theory in which the impact of material nonlinearities and damage on the global constitutive behavior has been a focus in recent years. Reliable predictions of these nonlinear beam responses depend on not only {{the quality of the}} material description but also a comprehensively generalized multiscale methodology which fills the theoretical gaps between the scales in an efficient yet high-fidelity manner. The conventional beam modeling methodologies which are built upon ad hoc assumptions are in lack of such reliability in need. Therefore, the focus of this dissertation is to create a reliable yet efficient method and the corresponding tool for composite beam modeling. ^ A nonlinear beam theory is developed based on the Mechanics of Structure Genome (MSG) using the variational asymptotic method (VAM). The three-dimensional (3 D) nonlinear continuum problem is rigorously reduced to a one-dimensional (1 D) beam model and a two-dimensional (2 D) cross-sectional analysis featuring both geometric and material nonlinearities by exploiting the small geometric parameter which is an inherent geometric characteristic of the beam. The 2 D nonlinear cross-sectional analysis utilizes the 3 D material models to homogenize the beam cross-sectional constitutive responses considering the nonlinear elasticity and progressive damage. The results from such a homogenization are inputs as constitutive laws into the global nonlinear 1 D beam analysis. ^ The theoretical foundation is formulated without unnecessary kinematic assumptions. Curvilinear coordinates and vector calculus are utilized to build the 3 D deformation gradient tensor, of which the components are formulated in terms of cross-sectional coordinates, generalized beam strains, unknown warping functions, and the 3 D spatial gradients of these warping functions. Asymptotic analysis of the extended Hamiltonian 2 ̆ 7 s principle suggests dropping the terms of axial gradients of the warping functions. As a result, the solid mechanics problem resolved into a 3 D continuum is dimensionally reduced to a problem of solving the warping functions on a 2 D cross-sectional field by minimizing the information loss. ^ The present theory is implemented using the finite element method (FEM) in Variational Asymptotic <b>Beam</b> <b>Sectional</b> Analysis (VABS), a general-purpose cross-sectional analysis tool. An iterative method is applied to solve the finite warping field for the classical-type model {{in the form of the}} Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The deformation gradient tensor is directly used to enable the capability of dealing with finite deformation, various strain definitions, and several types of material constitutive laws regarding the nonlinear elasticity and progressive damage. ^ Analytical and numerical examples are given for various problems including the trapeze effect, Poynting effect, Brazier effect, extension-bending coupling effect, and free edge damage. By comparison with the predictions from 3 D finite element analyses (FEA), 2 D FEA based on plane stress assumptions, and experimental data, the structural and material responses are proven to be rigorously captured by the present theory and the computational cost is significantly reduced. Due to the semi-analytical feature of the code developed, the unrealistic numerical issues widely seen in the conventional FEA with strain softening material behaviors are prevented by VABS. In light of these intrinsic features, the nonlinear elastic and inelastic 3 D material models can be economically calibrated by data-matching the VABS predictions directly with the experimental measurements from slender coupons. Furthermore, the global behavior of slender composite structures in meters can also be effectively characterized by VABS without unnecessary loss of important information of its local laminae in micrometers. ...|$|R
