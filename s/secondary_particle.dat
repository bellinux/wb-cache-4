50|$|Neutron capture therapy {{might be}} {{considered}} a type of particle therapy, {{but it is not}} discussed here, as the damage it does to tumors is mostly from energetic ions produced by the secondary nuclear reaction after the neutrons in the external beam are absorbed into boron-10 (or occasionally some other nuclide), and not due primarily to the neutrons themselves. It is therefore a type of <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|Over the Pacific Ocean, several {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} evacuated Joes and crew {{members of the}} Flagg arrive {{at the location of}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> cannon. After exchanging fire with Cobra forces, Flint and Scarlett manage to create an opening, allowing Duke and Snake Eyes {{to gain access to the}} facility. Duke makes his way to the control center, and discovers that Cobra Commander ordered his men to aim the particle cannon at Washington, DC, then killed them, and locked himself inside a safe room within the control center. Unable to prevent the firing of the particle cannon, Duke elects to reprogram the targeting coordinates, causing the directed-energy weapon to fire on its own location. However, Cobra Commander's whereabouts remain unknown, as his safe room was later found empty, as documented by Duke in his final report. A post credits scene shows Storm Shadow's grave to be empty.|$|E
40|$|The factors {{influencing}} carbon ion therapy can be predicted from accurate {{knowledge about the}} production of <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> from the interaction of carbon ions in water/tissue-like materials, and subsequently {{the interaction of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> in the same materials. The <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> may have linear energy transfer (LET) values that potentially increase the relative biological effectiveness of the beam. Our primary objective in this study was to classify and quantify the <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> produced, their dose averaged LETs, and their dose contributions in the absorbing material. A 1 mm diameter carbon ion pencil beam with energies per nucleon of 155, 262, and 369 MeV was used in a geometry and tracking 4 Monte Carlo simulation to interact in a 27 L water phantom containing 3000 rectangular detector voxels. The dose-averaged LET and the dose contributions of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> were calculated from the simulation. The results of the simulations show that the <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> that contributed a major dose component had LETs 600 keV/Âµm contributed only < 0. 3 % of the dose...|$|R

The concentration of metals and water-soluble ions in collected samples were determined for source apportionment estimations. Soil-road dust (26 - 36 %) and inorganic <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> (4 - 11 %) were two important PM 10 sources.

50|$|Three {{separate}} Joe {{teams are}} deployed: The first team consisting of Gung-Ho, Roadblock, Stalker and Beach Head manages {{to recapture the}} HAARP array in Alaska, and free hostages being held by Destro and the Baroness. The second team consists of Ripcord, Duke and Scarlett. Duke and Scarlett perform a HALO jump to the Siberian facility wearing winged jet packs. They infiltrate the location, kill Zartan, and destroy the location by forcing the repurposed nuclear warheads powering the particle cannon to detonate. Tunnel Rat manages to knock out Cobra's orbiting stratellite network by reviving technology from Project Manhigh, building an assault platform capable of reaching the stratellite array, without activating each stratellite's defensive cannons. He then uses a microwave power transmission broadcast via the stratellite's rectenna to compromise and destroy the network. However, Cobra Commander unveils a second smaller HAARP array on an islet in Micronesia, and a second lesser particle cannon hidden {{in the town of}} Springfield, a major Cobra installation. Cobra fires this <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> cannon at the Flagg, sinking the already evacuated carrier. Elsewhere, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow meet on an island, containing an abandoned complex that was once used by Snake Eyes' ninja clan. In flashbacks, Snake Eyes recalls his time as a student, and how he unsuccessfully attempted to prevent his mentor's assassination {{at the hands of a}} Cobra mercenary working for Storm Shadow. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow engage in a fight to the death, a fight that ends with Storm Shadow's defeat.|$|E
50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or impeller assembly, <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> filter to protect the motor assembly, and a primary filter - a bag, cup or wet filter bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and wet filter bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While Wet filter systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good Hypo-allergenic systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric aerosol {{particles}} affect {{the quality of}} life by influencing climate and by being a significant component of air pollution. Once a particle is released into or formed in the atmosphere, several processes begin to transform its physical and chemical properties. A considerable fraction of the particulate matter is secondary material i. e. formed from gas-to-particle conversion in the atmosphere. This <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation is an important process in the evolution of atmospheric aerosols. The aim of this thesis is to study the formation and aging of secondary aerosols by experimentally simulating atmospheric oxidation of emissions from biogenic and traffic-related sources. In this work the focus is on particle size, mass and number concentration, {{as well as on the}} thermal properties of the particles formed. These measures give insight into properties relevant for understanding the evolution of particles in the ambient atmosphere. The thermal properties of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formed from oxidation of monoterpenes in two oxidation flow reactors, G-FROST and PAM, and the atmospheric simulation chamber SAPHIR, was studied using a Volatility Tandem DMA (VTDMA). The detailed laboratory studies show that the formation of monoterpene SOA and its thermal properties depend on chemical structure of the precursor and oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, freshly formed monoterpene SOA comprise of compounds with a wide distribution of volatilities ranging from extremely low volatile to semi volatile compounds. Photochemical aging of SOA was studied in SAPHIR by oxidation induced by natural sun light and in PAM by exposing SOA precursors to high concentration of OH over a short time. The results reveal two opposing processes which drive the evolution of SOA volatility in the two systems. During the course of this work an oxidation flow reactor, Go:PAM, has been developed. Go:PAM enables studies of <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation from rapidly changing emission sources, and was used to derive fuel-specific <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> emission factors from in-use transit buses under real-world driving conditions. Both primary emissions and the <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation of 29 buses running on conventional or on more sustainable fuels were investigated. The results emphasize the importance of taking the reduction in OH exposure into consideration when interpreting the <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation from plumes. However, independent of fuel and technology of the buses, the formation of secondary particulate mass was significantly higher than the primary particle mass. Furthermore, the results indicate there are emissions of non-fuel related compounds that are important for <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation. This work provides insight in the formation and aging of secondary particles from biogenic and traffic-related sources. The results highlight the importance of including <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation when predicting the climate forcing of SOA and designing of air quality strategies...|$|E
40|$|An {{agglomerate}} {{model for}} the impedance of a single micro-sized <b>secondary</b> <b>particle,</b> capable of accounting for the internal elec-trochemical reactions and material transport, is deduced in three steps: (1) A set of basic equations for the porous battery electrode is deduced while adopting a refined structure of the electric double layer and considering {{the effect of the}} structure of the electric double layer on the rate of the charge transfer reaction; (2) An impedance {{model for the}} primary particles with the reaction only occurring at the surface is developed. The model features a detailed description for the lithium-ion transportation across the SEI film; (3) Using the volume averaging method and coordinate transformation, the impedance model for the primary particle is extended to the <b>secondary</b> <b>particle.</b> The agglomerate impedance model is validated with experimental data of a single <b>secondary</b> <b>particle.</b> A much improved fit, both at the low and high frequency ends, is achieved compared to a previous model in the literature.

40|$|High-energy protons, {{and high}} mass and energy ions, {{along with the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> they pro-duce, are the main {{contributors}} to the radiation hazard during space explorations. Skin, particularly the epidermis, consisting mainly of keratinocytes with potential for proliferation and malignant transforma-tion, absorbs {{the majority of the}} radiation dose. Therefore, we used normal human keratinocytes to inves-tigate and quantify the DNA damage caused by secondary radiation. Its manifestation depends on the presence of retinol in the serum-free media, and is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinases. We simu-lated the generation of secondary radiation after the impact of protons and iron ions on an aluminum shield. We also measured the intensity and the type of the resulting <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> at two sample locations; our findings agreed well with our predictions. We showed that <b>secondary</b> <b>particles</b> inflict DNA damage to different extents, {{depending on the type of}} primary radiation.

40|$|The {{desire of}} the high-energy-physics {{community}} for more intense <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> beams motivates the development of multi-megawatt, pulsed proton sources.

40|$|A simple {{model for}} {{particle}} formation in surfactant-free emulsion polymerisation [Macromol. Symp. 92 (1995) 13; Emulsion polymerization: a mechanistic approach, 1995], with extension {{to allow for}} induced decomposition of initiator, is explored. The object is to find conditions for <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation, especially to find conditions under which {{it would be possible}} to grow core-shell particles of vinyl acetate in styrene, and vice versa; core -shell particle formation requires that <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation be avoided. The system is described by homogeneous nucleation: a radical generated in the aqueous phase will either enter a latex particle, undergo termination, or grow in the aqueous phase until it becomes the nucleus of a new particle. The simplified kinetic description contains only easily specified parameter values and requires minimal computational resources. The model implies that <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation is suppressed by decreasing seed radius, by increasing solids content, and by starved-feed conditions; seed radius is by far the most influential, while monomer-catalysed initiator decomposition has negligible effect. The model predicts that new particle formation will be rampant when vinyl acetate is polymerised in the presence of large polystyrene particles (implying that large core-shell polystyrene/poly(vinyl acetate) (PS/PVAc) particles cannot be obtained in this way), but that there should be relatively little <b>secondary</b> <b>particle</b> formation when styrene is polymerised in the presence of large PVAc particles (implying that large core-shell PS/PVAc particles can be created by inverse core-shell polymerisation). The model was also used to estimate the particle numbers expected in ab initio, surfactant-free styrene and vinyl acetate systems. The model explains why such styrene systems give large, monodisperse particles, whereas such vinyl acetate systems give much smaller particles. Comparison of predictions of the model with those of more sophisticated treatments suggests that model contains the kinetic events which are most essential in determining the rate of particle formation, and thus is sufficient for stating whether or not massive secondary nucleation will occur.
