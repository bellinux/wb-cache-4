40|$|Introduction: Leakage from process {{equipment}} and the entrance of flammable fluids to surrounding atmosphere may cause flammable gas cloud. The coincidence of flammable gas cloud with ignition source could make flash fire or vapor cloud explosion that cause injury and fatality. The concept of reduction of confluence of flammable gas cloud and potential <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> ignition is known as hazardous area classification. Several standards have provided methods regarding hazardous area classification; however, of the disadvantages of them are lack of an accurate determination of hazardous areas due to potential leakage sources which is because of low flexibility in process condition variation and equipment layout and also not considering effect of weather conditions and cumulative effects <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>sources.</b>   Method: In this paper, risk-based hazardous area classification is optimized using parameters such as the number <b>of</b> influencing <b>release</b> <b>sources</b> and weather condition probabilities. In this method, the determining factor of hazardous area boundary is the probability of acceptable ignition for every specific location. This probability is calculated using quantitative risk assessment with PHAST RISK software version 6. 7 on the gas boosting unit of a gas refinery as a case study.   Result: The results of this method showed the full dependency of hazardous area boundary to cumulative effects <b>of</b> potential <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and the prevailing wind direction and it also demonstrated that the suggested optimized method can consider wind direction probabilities and cumulative effects <b>of</b> potential <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> in risk-based hazardous area classification calculation.   Conclusion: Comparing {{the results of this}} method with the usual method determines that this method has some advantages such as considering all <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and cumulative <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and considering wind direction probabilities in determining boundary of zone 2 which makes the hazardous area classification very precise and flexible...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{incidents}} can {{be prevented}} or mitigated by improving safety performance and implementing the lessons learned from past incidents. Despite some limitations {{in the range of}} information they provide, chemical incident databases can be utilized as sources of lessons learned from incidents by evaluating patterns and relationships that exist between the data variables. Much of the previous research focused on studying the causal factors of incidents; hence, this research analyzes the chemical incidents from both the causal and consequence elements of the incidents. A subset of incidents data reported to the Hazardous Substance Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) chemical incident database from 2002 - 2006 was analyzed using data mining and text mining methodologies. Both methodologies were performed with the aid of STATISTICA software. The analysis studied 12, 737 chemical process related incidents and extracted descriptions of incidents in free-text data format from 3, 316 incident reports. The structured data was analyzed using data mining tools such as classification and regression trees, association rules, and cluster analysis. The unstructured data (textual data) was transformed into structured data using text mining, and subsequently analyzed further using data mining tools such as, feature selections and cluster analysis. The data mining analysis demonstrated that this technique can be used in estimating the incident severity based on input variables of release quantity and distance between victims and <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> Using the subset data of ammonia release, the classification and regression tree produced 23 final nodes. Each of the final nodes corresponded to a range of release quantity and, of distance between victims and <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> For each node, the severity of injury was estimated from the observed severity scores' average. The association rule identified the conditional probability for incidents involving piping, chlorine, ammonia, and benzene in the value of 0. 19, 0. 04, 0. 12, and 0. 04 respectively. The text mining was utilized successfully to generate elements of incidents {{that can be used in}} developing incident scenarios. Also, the research has identified information gaps in the HSEES database that can be improved to enhance future data analysis. The findings from data mining and text mining should then be used to modify or revise design, operation, emergency response planning or other management strategies...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for solving the chemical plume tracing problem that utilizes {{data from a}} network of stationary sensors has been developed in this study. During a toxic chemical release and dispersion incident, the imperative need of first responders {{is to determine the}} physical location of the source of chemical release in the shortest possible time. However, the chemical plume that develops from the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> may evolve into a highly complex distribution over the entire contaminated region, making chemical plume tracing one of the most challenging problems known to date. In this study, the discrete Fourier series method was applied for re-construction of the contour map representing the concentration distribution of chemical over the contaminated region based on point measurements by sensors in a pre-installed network. Particle Swarm Optimization was then applied to the re-constructed contour map to locate the position of maximal concentration. Such a methodology was found to be highly successful in solving the chemical plume tracing problem via the sensor network approach and thus closes a long-standing gap in the literature. Furthermore, the nature of the methodology is such that a visual of the entire chemical dispersion process is made available during the solution process and this can be beneficial for warning purposes and evacuation planning.

40|$|Introduction: The {{measurement}} of cardiospecific troponins is pivotal in {{the diagnostic and}} prognostic approach of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, no information {{is available on the}} commutability of results between the novel highly-sensitive (HS) troponin T (TnT) and I (TnI) immunoassays. Materials and methods: The study population consisted in 47 consecutive patients presenting at the emergency department (ED) of the Academic Hospital of Parma with suspected AMI. TnI was measu-red with the novel prototype Beckman Coulter HS-AccuTnI immunoassay on Access 2, whereas TnT was measured with the Roche HS-TnT immunoassay on Cobas. Results: Eight out of the 47 patients (17 %) were finally diagnosed as having an AMI. The overall cor-relation between TnT and TnI for total patient group was acceptable (r = 0. 944; P < 0. 01). Neverthe-less, when the analysis of data was carried out in separate groups according to the final diagnosis of AMI, two different equation results were obtained, i. e., HS-TnT = HS-AccuTnI x 0. 349 + 20 (r = 0. 823; P < 0. 01) in non-AMI patients, and HS-TnT = HS-AccuTnI x 0. 134 + 67 (r = 0. 972; P < 0. 01) in those with AMI. Conclusions: This study suggests the existence of two biological relationships between TnI and TnT in plasma, depending on the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from the myocardium.

40|$|Coal-based power {{generation}} produces over 750 Mt of coal ash per year globally, but under 50 % of world production is utilised. Large amounts of fly ash are either stored temporarily in stockpiles, disposed of in ash landfills or lagooned. Coal ash {{is viewed as}} a major potential <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> of many environmentally sensitive elements to the environment. This paper encompasses over 90 publications on coal fly ash and demonstrates {{that a large number of}} elements are tightly bound to fly ash and may not be easily released to the environment, regardless of the nature of the ash. This review provides an extensive look at the extent to which major and trace elements are leached from coal fly ash. It also gives an insight into the factors underlying the leachability of elements and addresses the causes of the mobility. The mode of occurrence of a given element in the parent coal was found to play an important role in the leaching behaviour of fly ash. The amount of calcium in fly ash exerts a dominant influence on the pH of the ash–water system. The mobility of most elements contained in ash is markedly pH sensitive. The alkalinity of fly ash attenuates the release of a large number of elements of concern such as Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sn or Zn among others, but at the same time, it enhances the release of oxyanionic species such as As, B, Cr, Mo, Sb, Se, V and W.

Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Effective ventilation {{was considered to be}} one of the least expensive engineering measures for reducing worker exposures to PERC. Ventilation was used for controlling PERC exposures and thermal comfort, both of which were important in dry cleaning shops. Possible ventilation methods included local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) captured and removed the contaminant at or near the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release,</b> thereby reducing vapor levels in the worker's breathing zone and minimizing vapor diffusion. PERC vapor exposures were greatest during machine maintenance and loading and unloading. LEV implemented at the loading and unloading door was usually activated by a door interlocking system. The retrofitting of an external ventilation hood outside the machine door was an option for older machines lacking built in exhaust ventilation. General ventilation diluted the concentration of the contaminant before it reached the breathing zone of the worker. It was used to supply conditioned fresh air and exhaust contaminated air from the general work area. A workroom air exchange every 5 minutes involving sufficient volumes of make up air was recommended.

40|$|The wide {{diffusion}} of Emerging Organic Micropollutants (EOMs) {{in the environment}} is receiving increasing attention due to their potential toxicological effects on living organisms. So far, the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) have not been designed with the purpose to remove these contaminants; therefore, they can represent the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> into the environment both through the effluent and the wasted sludge. The fate of EOMs in the WWTPs is still not completely known; further investigations are therefore needed to assess if {{it is possible to}} exploit the existing treatment units to reduce EOM concentrations or which processes must be implemented to this purpose. Among the wide class of EOMs, the present study focused on the following drugs of abuse: amphetamine (AM), methamphetamine (MET), 11 -nor-Δ 9 -THC- 9 carboxy (THC-COOH) and benzoylecgonine (BEG). Presence and removal efficiency of these drugs in the activated sludge tank of a WWTP for domestic sewage was investigated through analyses at both full-scale and laboratory scale. Determinations conducted in the full-scale WWTP highlighted that, among the searched drugs, AM was found to be the most abundant in the influent and effluent of the biological oxidation tank, while 11 -nor-Δ 9 -THC- 9 carboxy was present at the lowest concentration. Some removal took place in the units prior to the oxidation tank, although the main reduction was observed to occur in the biological oxidation reactor. All the drugs showed a wide variability of the measured concentrations during the week and the day. Taking into account results from both full-scale observations and batch tests, removals in the biological reactor were found within the following ranges: 33 – 84 % for AM, 33 – 97 % for MET, 33 – 57 % for BEG and 29 – 83 % for THC-COOH. These removals were due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation mainly, while volatilization did not play a significant role.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the result of}} a doctorate research into the impact of existential psychotherapeutic interventions with people experiencing chronic eating disorders. The results indicate that positive outcomes are correlated to therapeutic interventions which concentrate on the clients own perception of control and choice over their own eating habits. The research aim was to explore both the effects and the effectiveness of existential therapy in altering the individuals subjective interpretation of their Self when they are deeply immersed in the experience of disordered eating. Interventions went beyond the cognitive-behavioural approaches into the implementation of existential psychotherapy which helped individuals to explore the existential concerns of life, choice, hope, social inclusion and love within the context of their own sense of Being. This focus led to an improvement in all study subjects and a reduction in the use of mental health resources. All individuals entered the study following assessment criteria which included chronicity, lengthy use of mental health services and past therapeutic interventions. Three diagnostic criteria were included, Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa and Morbid Obesity. Data presented in the study supported the original premise that all three eating disorders share underlying similarities and justify the inclusion of the diagnostic criteria of morbid obesity within the study. Therapy was either in closed groups or individual and consisted of a fixed number of one-hour sessions. Therapeutic techniques included cognitive-behavioural therapy and person-centred counselling focusing on self-esteem and self-assertion, as well as an existential focus on dualistic perception of the mind/body, the conscious sense of the present and the affective bond with food itself. A series of therapeutic phases were structured to demonstrate the progress from interventions in self-esteem and self-assertion to existential concerns and principles. Taking therapy beyond cognitive-behavioural techniques involved the application of Yaloms' (1980) and Strasser and Strassers' (1997) Existential Therapy and an exploration of Duker and Slades' (1988) concepts of the fragmentation of the sense of Self in individuals experiencing eating disorders. The research demonstrated important differences between the professional perception of appropriate eating and alteration in weight as successful clinical outcomes, and the clients’ dependency on disordered eating as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from interacting with others. Mental health interventions were perceived by clients as attempts to stop such a release without providing a substitute. A clear sense of loss was presented by all study subjects when eating was controlled by others. In most cases disordered eating was habitual and the emotional effects of raised or lowered glucose levels gave a sense of numbness and nothingness which was actively pursued. This was also attained when disordered eating was combined with other self-harm behaviours. Mental health practitioners inadvertently prevented the attainment of a sense of numbness by their focus on eating and body weight. The encouragement of food regimes causes increased anxiety for all clients leading to poor compliance levels. The research results have the potential to impact on mental health education and clinical services as the data indicates that individuals with disordered eating gain more benefit when the therapeutic focus is less on restoring appropriate eating habits and more on the individuals sense of Self; the importance of food intake as a source of escape from others and escape from the internal awareness of Self...|$|E
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are fat soluble chemical substances that {{persist in the}} environment and bioaccumulate in the food chain. Through long-range environmental transportation by air, water and migratory species they are transferred to new locations distant from the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and might cause adverse effects to human health and to the environment. POPs comprise pesticides, industrial chemicals and unwanted by-products. The European Commission has implemented food and feed legislations concerning maximum permitted levels (MPLs) of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Fish and consequently fishmeal and fish oil {{has been identified as}} one of the most important contributors to the level of dioxins and DL-PCBs in food and feed products. Fish caught in some of the North-European fishing areas contain high dioxin and PCB levels resulting in fishmeal and oil with WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ levels above the maximum permitted. To meet the new industrial and socialeconomic challenges there is a need for development of cost-effective decontamination technologies. Efficiency and limitations of alternative decontamination technologies to reduce the level of PCDD/Fs, DL-PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants (PBDEs) in fishmeal (i. e., mechanical fat separation, organic solvent extraction and oil leaching) and fish oil (i. e., activated carbon (AC) adsorption and short-path distillation (SPD)) have been studied in this thesis. Factorial design experiments, response surface methodology and quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) have been utilized to model and optimize the fish oil decontamination alternatives. The trapping mechanisms for non- and mono-ortho PCBs on AC have been studied by use of molecular dynamics simulations. Optimization of the existing mechanical fat separation steps in the fishmeal process is expected to be the most cost-effective way to reduce the POPs content. However, the obtainable effects are limited (estimated to maximum 20 - 30 %) and have to be combined with organic solvent extraction if high decontamination rates are needed. The feasible use of a new oil leaching process has been studied and found to give effects comparable to hexane and isopropanol extraction of fishmeal (i. e., > 75 %). AC adsorption of PCDD/Fs is highly effective with obtainable WHO-TEQ-reduction of 99 %. Adsorption of DL-PCBs is less effective and dependent on orthosubstitution, i. e., non-ortho-PCBs are adsorbed more effectively than mono-ortho- PCBs, with maximum obtained levels of 87 % and 21 %, respectively. Compliance with present feed and food WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ legislations in fish oil can be achieved based on AC adsorption. The adsorption process had no effect on PBDEs. The selectivity can be explained based on dispersive electron interaction affected by sorbate planarity and steric effects and presence of electrostatic forces. Within each of the studied homologue groups, the volatility and reduction after SPD of the individual congeners is linearly dependent on the number of chlorine or bromine substitutions and ortho-substitution. The QSPRs were combined with process parameters to establish decontamination models for each homologue group of POPs. High decontamination efficiency (> 90 %) can be obtained by choice of favorable process conditions giving residual levels considerable below MPLs in feed and food. AC and SPD did not have any negative effects on fish oil oxidation level. Oxidative stability of the oil after SPD was affected both negative and positive depending on processing conditions. SPD did not affect the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) nor induce geometrical isomerization. Some co-evaporation and loss of vitamins, cholesterol and unsaponifiables can not be avoided during SPD. The retention level will depend on the applied process conditions and the concentration ratio and difference in vapor pressure between free and ester forms of the respective compounds. A high retention level (> 80 %) of volatile nutrients after SPD could be obtained by choice of process conditions giving residual WHO-TEQ-levels in accordance with present feed and food legislations and the voluntary industrial monograph of GOED...|$|E
