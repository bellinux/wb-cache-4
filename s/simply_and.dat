In 1995, in recognition of his reputation and standing in the legal profession, he was appointed adjunct {{professor of law at}} the Centre of South East Asian Law at Charles Darwin University in Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. Until 2006, Hickling continued travelling to the Far East and Australia, delivering lectures, reviewing examination papers and visiting friends, colleagues and students. Despite his many accolades, he lived <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> impressed staff and students with his disarming humility. In addition to his legal writings, Hickling wrote novels and short stories, mostly drawing on his experiences of life in different British colonies. Hickling was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in 1968 and a Queen's Counsel (Gibraltar) in 1970.|$|E

25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives {{us an opportunity to}} open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} years of his life he {{occupied}} a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne, where he lived <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> unostentatiously.

In the front of the Sorbonne, below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters, a tablet records an extract from his will, in which he bequeaths his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial work and triumphs.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of Irish Catholics is a cruel one. We are enslaved by a Protestant power. The penal laws against our religion {{are not yet}} abolished in full.

25|$|The strength, hardness, and {{flexibility}} of copper {{make it very}} easy to work with. Copper wiring can be installed <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> easily with no special tools, washers, pigtails, or joint compounds. Its flexibility {{makes it easy to}} join, while its hardness helps keep connections securely in place. It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings. The combination of all of these factors makes it easy for electricians to install copper wire.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, Newton-John {{secretly}} wed John Easterling, {{founder and}} president of natural remedy firm, Amazon Herb Company. The couple had first met 15 years earlier, but they only became romantically involved in 2007. (Like Newton-John, this was Easterling's second marriage.) The couple married alone in a private Incan spiritual ceremony in Cuzco, Peru on 21 June followed nine days later by a legal ceremony on the Jupiter Island beachfront in Florida. There were no guests at either service since the couple preferred to marry <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> privately. Only Newton-John's daughter, Chloe, was aware of the nuptials. The couple did not announce their marriage until a 4 July barbecue at Newton-John's Malibu, California home, where guests were surprised with the news. The wedding was confirmed thereafter by HELLO! Magazine which published exclusive pictures of both weddings. In June 2009, the Easterlings purchased a new $4.1million home in Jupiter Inlet, Florida, and Newton-John sold her Malibu home.|$|E
30|$|With a {{compression}} load of 0, the resonance frequency {{was between the}} values for the <b>simply</b> supported-sliding ends <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> supported ends. If the measured resonance frequency becomes stable for large compression stress, {{we can assume that}} the vibration of a test specimen in the compression direction is fixed sufficiently by the compression in this study. Since the resonance frequency increased slightly for large compression, the simply supported ends condition is thought to be imperfect and the end condition with the compression stress =  0 was between the <b>simply</b> supported-sliding ends <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> supported ends.|$|R

25|$|Running plays a {{much larger}} role in {{baseball}} because of the low scoring; also, players on the batting team must run much further to score a run, because runners may remain in play (that is, on the bases) without scoring, and because baserunners can advance to the next base before the ball is hit again (steal the base) {{as soon as the}} ball is live. Base stealing often requires sliding, in which the runner throws himself to the ground to avoid being tagged or over-running the base. The runner may also deliberately slide into the fielder at the base he is trying to steal to keep him from catching the ball or to disrupt a double play. At home plate the runner often will <b>simply,</b> <b>and</b> legally, run into a catcher who is blocking the baseline but who does not have the ball (a defensive player may not impede the runner unless he has the ball or {{is in the process of}} catching it).|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
25|$|CFA members were, on the whole, {{positive}} and {{enthusiastic about the}} memorial design, but they also {{had a number of}} criticisms. First, the memorial seemed to be merely a collection of elements rather than a unified design. The memorial designers were asked to <b>simply</b> <b>and</b> harmonize the design, and reduce the number of elements if possible. Member Diana Balmori, a landscape architect, made the specific suggestion that the fountain and pool be combined, and the flame placed in the pool. Second, the large number of interior walls on the site created areas that ignored the street alignments which gave the site shape. While the DVLMF believed nearly all visitors would come from the north (with pedestrians coming from the Capitol, United States Botanic Garden, and the National Museum of the American Indian), the CFA questioned this assumption and asked that pedestrian flow be studied. Finally, CFA members thought that raising and lowering the flame would trivialize the memorial, the flagpole should be located in less intrusive place, and that the trees in the reflecting pool would create serious maintenance problems. Nonetheless, the CFA approved the memorial's preliminary design on March 18, 2004.|$|E
