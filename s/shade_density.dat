40|$|Within {{the last}} few years, a new {{tendency}} has been created towards robotic harvesting of oranges and some of citrus fruits. The first step in robotic harvesting is accurate recognition and positioning of fruits. Detection through image processing by color cameras and computer is currently the most common method. Obviously, a harvesting robot faces with natural conditions and, therefore, detection must be done in various light conditions and environments. In this study, it was attempted to provide a suitable algorithm for recognizing the orange fruits on tree. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, 500 images were taken in different conditions of canopy, lighting and {{the distance to the}} tree. The algorithm included sub-routines for optimization, segmentation, size filtering, separation of fruits based on lighting density method and coordinates determination. In this study, MLP neural network (with 3 hidden layers) was used for segmentation that was found to be successful with an accuracy of 88. 2 % in correct detection. As there exist a high percentage of the clustered oranges in images, any algorithm aiming to detect oranges on the trees successfully should offer a solution to separate these oranges first. A new method based on the light and <b>shade</b> <b>density</b> method was applied and evaluated in this research. Finally, the accuracies for differentiation and recognition were obtained to be 89. 5 % and 88. 2 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractAgroforestry systems usually {{include a}} high density and {{diversity}} of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge {{on the effect of}} shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5. 6  % and larger beans by 6. 25  %. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20  %. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing <b>shade</b> <b>density</b> of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production.

The variables in the investigated models are with regard to the urban lay-out:. block, strip-like block and orientation. Concerning the houses the variables are: insulation, thermal mass, airchanges, V/A ratio and % glazing area. Significant results: The results show that passive solar systems give only a small contribution to the heat need of a dwelling. Insulation and reduction of ventilation losses are more important to reach lowenergy housing. Urban lay-out and orientat ion don't have much influence. Prevention of shading is important in winter.

40|$|Many {{ecosystems}} are facing environmental change and anthropogenic pressures {{that may affect}} communities {{in terms of both}} structure and/or function. Disturbances and stresses are commonly co-occurring in nature, however the interaction between them are generally considered as being additive without knowing the true in situ effects. The response of a Zostera marina bed community (1 m 2 plots) facing two stresses (sediment enrichment through slow nutrient diffusers; light reduction through shading) and one disturbance (80 % eelgrass density reduction) was studied in the summer of 2015. The major and interactive effects were estimated based on diversity indices and community structure of the associated species, as well as the density and relative eelgrass growth.

40|$|Many agronomic {{systems could}} be at risk {{considering}} the shorter-term climate changes but several effects and interactions are still uncertain. Process-based models (PBMs) are generally well suited for predictions under new conditions but their complexity causes high computational demand which limits their application. This is particularly true for complex multi-layer or agroforestry systems requiring plant-scale simulations in 3 D. An alternative is to summarize their outputs in statistical models called metamodels, {{which can be used}} afterwards rapidly in a prediction mode. These metamodels also 1) allow to understand better the processes within the source model (uncertainty and sensitivity analysis) and 2) can be used for coupling different spatial or time scales models. Coffee growth and fruit production are particularly sensitive to high temperatures and water availability, and previous studies often predicts future huge loss of productions or area cover. Nevertheless, shade provided in agroforestry systems could mitigate the effects of climate changes under different management options. In this study, we modeled several management options of coffee agroforestry systems, e. g. <b>shade</b> tree <b>density</b> and species, and the use of a hybrid cultivar of coffee to estimate their suitability and provision of ecosystem services under predicted future climate changes. In Tarrazu (Costa Rica), the models for future climate (AR 5, statistically downscaled) predicted an increase of air temperature, while rainfall would remain at similar levels. Two numeric models were coupled using metamodels, a tree scale PBM (MAESPA) for extinction coefficients (diffuse and direct K) and light-use efficiency (LUE) simulations, and a plot scale PBM (GO+) for growth and yield simulations. A rating between management scenarios was then proposed by comparing canopy temperature, coffee and timber yield, carbon balance and water use of past and future coffee growth cycles, under the two contrasted RCP 4. 5 and 8. 5 future climatic scenarios. First results show that management could strongly impact coffee canopy temperature, light use efficiency, water use efficiency and photosynthesis, which are the main drivers of coffee plant fitness and thus coffee beans production potential. Figure 1 shows that coffee grown under shade trees had reduced mean canopy temperature (- 1. 22 °C*** and - 2. 21 °C*** for E. poeppigiana and C. alliodora respectively) compared to full sun management, while showing a moderate reduction of net photosynthesis (- 21. 6 %*** and - 17. 8 %*** resp.) thanks to an increased light use efficiency (+ 23. 4 %*** and + 26. 2 %*** resp). Also, Coffee is particularly sensitive to maximum daily temperature, and results showed that in near future (2030 - 2049), all C. alliodora densities (i. e. 50 - 75 - 100 - 125 Trees. ha- 1) and E. poeppigiana 350 Trees. ha- 1 density will be able to significantly reduce the maximum daily canopy temperature (down to - 6. 83 °C*** in average for C. alliodora with 125 Trees. ha- 1) compared to full sun plantations on the same period (Figure 2). Moreover, simulations showed negative maximum temperature effect on assimilation was present under full sun management only, and eventually largely compensated by positive [CO 2] effect (Figure 3). These findings could drive climate change adaptations options, as the scenarios made from the simulations will now be presented to stakeholders to assess their adoptability according to their performance.

40|$|Faculty and {{students}} in the Department of Biology are bound together by a common interest in explaining the diversity of life, the fit between form and function, and the distribution and abundance of organisms. The research reported here shows how habitat selection and adaptive movement influence population dynamics. I first demonstrate by theory why habitat selection should vary with density. I then describe experiments in which I measured per capita population growth rates of the single-celled alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in separate shaded and unshaded (light) habitats {{across a range of}} densities, and used them to predict the number of cells that one should observe in adjacent habitats. Fitness was higher in the light habitat than in the shade. Using these observations, theory predicts that all individuals should occupy the light habitat at low density, but as density increases individuals should increasingly occupy the shade. More generally, individual cells should move to habitats of higher mean fitness (adaptive movement). My experiments on Chlamydomonas demonstrated a rather novel form of adaptive movement that only partially confirmed the predictions. The fitness of cells released in the light habitat in rich environments was not different from that in <b>shade</b> because <b>density</b> was higher in light. Cells released in shade, and those released in poor environments, moved such that there were no differences in density between habitats, even though fitness was usually higher in light.

We estimated the aboveground carbon stocks in cacao and shade trees, determined the floristic diversity of shade trees and explored the possibility of implementing REDD+ interventions in cacao landscapes. Using replicated multi-site transect approach, data were collected from nine 1 -ha plots established on 5  km long transects in ten cacao growing districts in Ghana West Africa. Biomass of cacao and shade trees was determined using allometric equations. Results One thousand four hundred and one (1401) shade trees comprising 109 species from 33 families were recorded. Total number of species ranged from 34 to 49. Newbouldia laevis (Bignoniacea) was the most frequently occurring specie and constituted 43. 2  % of all shade trees. The most predominant families were Sterculiaceae and Moraceae (10 species each), followed by Meliaceae and Mimosaceae (8 species each) and Caesalpiniacaea (6 species).

I found that: (1) multivariate statistical methods worked well to sort out the test species on axes defined primarily by productivity, which may have more redundancy than decomposition, and initial leaf nutrient content, (2) there were three plant functional groups defined by species (i) Psychotria berteriana, (ii) Cecropia schreberiana and Inga vera, and (iii) a group containing the other seven species, and (3) the plant traits of nitrogen-fixing capacity and mycorrhizal strategy mapped better onto these groups then those of seed size, wood <b>density,</b> <b>shade</b> tolerance or successional status. Finally, implications for key plant structures and for conservation of Neotropical areas are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abandoned {{plantations}} of coffee, tea {{and other}} commercial crops offer opportunities for understanding ecological processes in modified forest ecosystems. Unlike tree plantations tea is maintained as a shrub with a continuous dense short canopy that precludes large-frugivore activity thereby limiting dispersal of forest species to such areas. In {{this study we}} determine how location and density of Grevillea robusta a shade tree in tea plantations and proximity of plantations to forests influences seed arrival from forests into the plantations. We also estimate the importance of dispersal modes in the colonization processes. We laid 10 × 10 -m plots at three distance intervals from the forest edge in three different plantation types with varying <b>shade</b> tree <b>densities.</b> Within the plots we laid four 1 × 1 -m subplots {{at the corners of}} the plot. We estimated species richness, abundance and categorized the seeds into dispersal modes in these plots. Grevillea robusta increased species richness of seeds by three times and abundance of seeds by 3 – 30 times compared with plantations without them. Higher density of G. robusta increased seed input changed species composition and altered species dominance in the plantations. Distance to forests influenced seed arrival in plantations without G. robusta trees and plots 95 m from the forest did not have any seeds in them. No such effect was seen in plantations with G. robusta trees. Seeds dispersed by birds or a combination of birds and mammals contribute 30 % of the seeds reaching the plantations with G. robusta and this was not influenced by distance from the forest. In plantations without G. robusta bird dispersal is restricted to 25 m from the forest edge. In general <b>density</b> of <b>shade</b> trees has a strong influence on seed arrival which can negate the forest proximity effect and enhance natural forest colonization...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of shade netting on growth, oil yield and compound composition of fever tea (Lippia javaica). The treatments were nine shade nets of different light intensities (100 % bird net, 40 % green, 10, 12 and 18 % white and 30, 40, 55 and 70 % black). The layout used was a completely randomized design. The parameters measured were shoot width, fresh shoot mass, the number of plants flowered, plant height and photosynthetically active radiation. Shade netting did not have any effect on the shoot width of L. javanica. Eighteen percent white net was best suited to produce fresh shoot mass, whereas 55 % black net, 40 % black net and 10 % white net produced lower fresh shoot mass. More plants that flowered were obtained under 70 % black net than those grown under 30 % black net. The number of plants that flowered increased from 22 to 35 with an increase in <b>shading</b> <b>density.</b> The height of plants was not affected by shade netting at 49 DAT. However, at 59 and 67 DAT, the height of the plants was greater under low light intensities (40, 55, and 70 % black nets) than that of high light intensity (30 % black). Twelve percent white net had the greatest plant height at 102 DAT. Shade netting significantly affected the adsorption and utilization of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above, across and below the plants at 102 DAT. Hundred percent bird net had the greatest amount of light intercepted above, across and below the plants. The amount of light intercepted above, below and across the plants was lower for lower shading intensity (30 % black) than that of higher shading intensities (40 %, 55 % and 70 % black). To determine shade-netting effect on oil yield and compound composition, fresh leaves (± 200 g) of L. javanica were sampled from each shade net for essential oil extraction by hydrodistillation. The oil yield ranged from 0. 29 % to 0. 41 %. The oil had a clear to yellowish brown colour. No significant differences were detected for oil yield amongst the shade nets. The chemical compound analysis was carried out by GC/MS. The chemical compounds identified in the essential oil were a -pinene, sebinen, myrcene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. L. javanica plants grown under 10 % white net, resulted in significantly higher myrcene content (15. 7 %) as compared to plants grown in other shade nets. Shade netting did not have any effect on the composition of á-pinene, sebinene, 1. 8 myrcene, ipsenone, ipsedienone, b -caryophyllen and germacrene-D. For commercial usage of myrcene, white net (10 %) would be best suited for L. javanica production. To obtain information about indigenous knowledge of L. javanica, a survey was carried out among street traders, traditional healers, hawkers and farmers in Gauteng. The age group was between 20 and 73. The majority of respondents, who were self employed, were traditional healers followed by farmers. Most (98 %) of the respondents indicated that they collected L. javanica from the veld by cutting the plant, whereas other respondents uprooted the whole plant when harvesting. Amongst the different uses of L. javanica mentioned, treatment of colds and coughs through steaming was stated by most (47 %) of the respondents. Most (88 %) of the respondents felt that it was important to conserve the plant for future generations and also to prevent the plant from becoming extinct. Traditional healers knew the uses and other important aspects of L. javanica than the farmers. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Agronomy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comA series of observations and an experiment were carried out to test hypotheses {{about the effects of}} <b>shade</b> on the <b>densities</b> of spirorbid polychaetes (Neodexiospira spp.) on intertidal pneumatophores (mangrove roots) of Avicennia marina. Densities of spirorbids were greater on pneumatophores surrounded by seagrass (Zostera mucronata) than patches without seagrass. Within patches of seagrass, the density and survivorship of spirorbids on pneumatophores was greater near the substratum (covered by seagrass) than high above the substratum (not covered by seagrass). The model that these patterns of abundance are explained by greater recruitment of spirorbids to shaded surfaces was assessed. This was done by experimentally testing the hypothesis that recruitment to patches without seagrass would not differ between the upper (unshaded) and lower surfaces (unshaded) of clear plastic sheets, but would be greater on the lower surfaces (shaded) than upper surfaces (unshaded) of black plastic sheets. Recruitment was consistent with these predictions and therefore provided evidence that differences in densities of spirorbids between substrata with and without seagrass may be due largely to differences in shading.

40|$|Up to 25 {{percent of}} all {{anthropogenic}} greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation, and Indonesia is the third largest emitter worldwide due to land use change and deforestation. On the island of Sulawesi {{in the vicinity of}} the Lore Lindu National Park, smallholders contribute to conversion processes at the forest margin as a result of their agricultural practices. Specifically the area dedicated to cocoa plantations has increased from zero in 1979 to nearly 18, 000 hectares in 2001. Some of these plots have been established inside the 220, 000 hectares of the National Park. An intensification process is observed with a consequent reduction of the <b>shade</b> tree <b>density.</b> This study focuses on the impact of carbon sequestration payments for forest management systems on smallholder households. The level of incentives is determined which motivates farmers to desist from further deforestation and land use intensification activities. Household behaviour and resource allocation is analysed with a comparative static linear programming model. As these models prove to be a reliable tool for policy analysis, the output can indicate the adjustments in resource allocation and land use shifts when introducing compensation payments. The data was collected in a household survey in six villages around the Lore Lindu National Park. Four household categories were identified according to their dominant agroforestry systems. With carbon credit prices up to € 32 tCO 2 e- 1 an incentive can be provided for the majority of the households to adopt the more sustainable shade intensive agroforestry systems. The results show that with current carbon prices the deforestation activities of the majority of households could be stopped. A win-win situation seems to appear, whereby, when targeting only the shade intensive agroforestry systems with carbon payments, the poorest households economically benefit the most, the vicious circle of deforestation can be interrupted and land use systems with high environmental benefits are promoted.

40|$|Coral islands {{around the}} world are {{threatened}} by changing climates. Rising seas, drought, and increased tropical storms are already impacting island ecosystems. We aim to better understand lichen community ecology of coral island forests. We used an epiphytic lichen community survey to gauge Pisonia (Pisonia grandis R. BR.), which dominates forest conditions on Heron Island, Australia. Nine survey plots were sampled for lichen species presence and abundance, all tree diameters and species, GPS location, distance to forest-beach edge, and dominant forest type. Results found only six unique lichens and two lichen associates. A Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) test found statistically distinct lichen communities among forest types. The greatest group differences were between interior Pisonia and perimeter forest types. Ordinations were performed to further understand causes for distinctions in lichen communities. Significant explanatory gradients were distance to forest edge, tree <b>density</b> (<b>shading),</b> and Pisonia basal area. Each of these variables was negatively correlated with lichen diversity and abundance, suggesting that interior, successionally advanced, Pisonia forests support fewer lichens. Island edge and presumably younger forests—often those with greater tree diversity and sunlight penetration—supported the highest lichen diversity. Heron Island’s Pisonia-dominated forests support low lichen diversity which mirrors overall biodiversity patterns. Lichen biomonitoring may provide a valuable indicator for assessing island ecosystems for conservation purposes regionally...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{compete for}} {{photosynthesis}} light and induce a shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) that confers an important advantage in asymmetric competition for light at high canopy <b>densities.</b> <b>Shade</b> plasticity was studied in a greenhouse experiment cultivating Arabidopsis thaliana plants from 15 populations spread across an altitudinal gradient {{in the northeast}} area of Spain that contain a high genetic variation into a reduced geographical range. Plants were exposed to sunlight or simulated shade to identify the range of shade plasticity. Fourteen vegetative, flowering and reproductive traits were measured throughout the life cycle. Shade plasticity in flowering time and dry mass {{was significantly associated with}} the altitude of population origin. Plants from coastal populations showed higher shade plasticity indexes than those from mountains. The altitudinal variation in flowering leaf plasticity adjusted negatively with average and minimum temperatures, whereas dry mass plasticity was better explained by negative regressions with the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, and by a positive regression with average precipitation of the population origin. The lack of an altitudinal gradient for the widest number of traits suggests that shade light could be a driver explaining the distribution pattern of individuals in smaller geographical scales than those explored here.
