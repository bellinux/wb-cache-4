40|$|<b>Shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern and {{self-evaluation}} {{almost exclusively}} in these terms is a core feature of eating disorder psychopathology {{and it is this}} which is thought to drive weight control behaviours. The literature indicates concerns about weight <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> can be present in children at least as young as eight rears of age. Currently, there is no tool available which measures a child's over-concern with their body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight per se. This study developed an assessment of children's body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, using scales measuring <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern and perceived importance of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight. The properties of the new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern assessment were examined in relation to children's self-perception and implicit attitudes towards overweight. Participants were 333 Year 5 children (181 boys and 152 girls) from North Yorkshire primary schools, {{with a mean age of}} 9 years 7 months. They completed measures of body shape perception, dietary restraint, height and weight accuracy, self-esteem <b>and</b> body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. In addition they completed a timed implicit association task which assessed implicit attitudes towards overweight. The new assessment was concluded to have good psychometric properties and to be a reasonable assessment of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children. Children with high <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern tended to be heavier, less satisfied with their weight <b>and</b> body <b>shape,</b> have lower self-esteem and report increased levels of dietary restraint. High levels of perceived importance of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight also impacted on this latter variable. A general anti-fat bias was indicated from this group of children. Dietary restraint score was a significant predictor of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, as was global self-worth (for the boys) and physical appearance (for the girls). No gender differences were found in the assessment of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. This study is the first to measure <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children and highlights a need of continued research of over-concern in children and adults. This will continue to inform intervention and prevention programmes of eating disorders. Further research into the implicit anti-fat attitudes in children as young as 9 years is also indicated, especially in respect of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern...|$|R

5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were <b>shaped</b> <b>and</b> based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E

Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is <b>shaped</b> <b>and</b> positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{examining}} the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color {{for a new}} product in an initial process of industrial design, they should be suitable for the product’s functionality, targeted image and concept. Additionally, it is also important that the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color differ from those of existing products so that the new design is distinctive to attract consumer attention. To support designers in their endeavor to come up with new designs, we propose a computerized method of analyzing existing designs and searching for a possible usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color different from the existing designs. First, we mathematically define feature indices to represent <b>and</b> quantify <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color characteristics of designs. Then, we analyze the usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color in existing designs, which are obtained as 3 D CAD data or 3 D shape data scanned from real products, by calculating the feature indices of the designs. By plotting the calculated results as a vector in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color feature indices space, we obtain the distribution of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usages of the existing designs. Here, we assume that the distance between the two vectors in the space represents the difference in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usages of the two designs. Based on the assumption, we search for a possible new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usage by searching for a new vector in the space which is as far from any of the existing vectors as possible. Once such a new vector is obtained, we visualize the suggested usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color by generating 3 D polygon model examples with the feature indices quantified by the vector. We examine the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed idea by implementing it as a computer program and applying it to designs of &quot;card stands &quot; as simple actual product examples...|$|R
