60|$|Creeping {{along the}} {{passage to the}} library door, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> listened. Inside, there was a noise of footsteps, pacing {{up and down the}} room hurriedly. He had come to himself, then! He had slept off his drunken helplessness! <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> listened again to hear further.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> looked towards Leo, {{as though}} {{awaiting}} his reply.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> {{seemed to}} be {{referring}} the point to Staniford.|$|E
60|$|FANNY [she turns--walks {{slowly back}} towards the tea-table. Halfway <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> leaning {{over the back of}} a chair regards in silence for a while the {{portrait}} of the first Lady Bantock]. I do wish I could tell what you were saying.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> looks curiously {{from one}} to the other, as if {{weighing}} them. Morell, whose lofty confidence has changed into heartbreaking dread at Eugene's bid, loses all power of concealing his anxiety. Eugene, strung to the highest tension, does not move a muscle.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{abruptly}} <b>and</b> bit her lips, he {{watching her}} keenly, she {{not knowing that}} she was watched.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> put her small, white hand on Sir Andrew's arm.|$|E
6000|$|Unwillingly, Mrs. Crayford {{puts her}} book aside, {{and opens the}} piano--Mozart's [...] "Air in A, with Variations," [...] lies open on the instrument. One after another she plays the lovely melodies, so simply, so purely beautiful, of that unpretending and unrivaled work. At {{the close of the}} ninth Variation (Clara's favorite), <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> turns toward the garden.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> breathless <b>and</b> pale, {{and walked}} rapidly along the terrace, {{as if to}} hide or control the {{agitation}} that possessed her.|$|R
50|$|After {{treating}} the others, Lorne puts {{a touch of}} the mixture on Cordy's tongue. <b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> then runs off. Lorne finishes up his story at the lounge: describing what really happened was she was struck with a vision of a terrifying demon; Cordelia reveals to Angel that she remembers everything. Lorne then walks off and the camera reveals an empty Lounge.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{shifted her}} chair, which had rocked close to mine.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{wiped her}} brow. I sat still, and listened eagerly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> I waited, {{watching}} the daring grow in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> hesitated, <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> stood {{lingering}} there. Her glance {{had fallen}} upon Stewart's big black horse prancing in a near-by corral.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> sighed, <b>and</b> {{pressed her}} open {{hand on her}} bosom; unconsciously betraying in that action some of the ineradicable {{training}} of the theatre.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{for comment}} <b>and</b> congratulations, eyeing her {{companion}} expectantly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> {{seemed to}} reflect, still {{outwardly}} as calm as ever.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> he was {{conscious}} of a premonitory chill upon his ardour.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> he {{completed}} her sentence with a humorous {{twinkle in his}} eyes.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes one last look at the empty stage. <b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> slowly closes the door.|$|R
50|$|Fabiana {{finds the}} key to the secret room, but she doesn't know what it is used for. Fabiana {{eventually}} figures out that Belén is trapped in the house because Belén is able to communicate through tapping on the pipes in the secret room. As Fabiana is ready to open the door, <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> decides not to rescue Belén because she might lose Adrián.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> with {{heightened}} colour {{and sparkling}} eyes gazed seaward at the schooner.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} her breath was coming more quickly at the remembrance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Cosway. Her fat face brightened--she smiled graciously {{for the first}} time.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> half-turned, <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him over her shoulder, scorn in her glance, a sneer on her scarlet mouth, {{insolence}} in every line of her.|$|R
6000|$|In her evasiveness <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> again, <b>and</b> {{the younger}} {{children}} had by this time crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother's skirts, the youngest murmured-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> {{seemed to}} sway. Mr. Thomas Wilbraham ran to her, offering her a chair, which she declined {{with a quick}} wave of the hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him curiously, {{as though he were}} some strange breed of animal.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> a deep blush, partly of shame, partly of wrath, suffused {{her pale}} cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Once on {{the stairs}} <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> set a hand upon the {{shoulder}} of the stalwart Borderer.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> musing, <b>and</b> a {{spasm of}} pity rent the bosom beneath Dudley Pickering's ample shirt. There was a buzzing {{in his ears}} and a lump choked his throat.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> awhile, <b>and</b> then {{spoke in}} English. To the astonishment of all, {{her voice was}} strong and clear, and she uttered her words with an energy that, under the circumstances, seemed almost awful.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mistake me," [...] she replied, {{and looked}} up at him suddenly. [...] "Do you suppose my fears are for myself?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> again, <b>and</b> then {{abruptly}} asked him, [...] "What will befall you?" ...|$|R
