5|$|Following the {{completion}} of a tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901, the British Electric Traction Company applied to Parliament for an extension to <b>Sale.</b> The proposal was amended to continue the line further south, into Altrincham. The line through <b>Sale</b> was owned by <b>Sale</b> Urban District Council and leased to the Manchester Corporation. Services to <b>Sale</b> commenced in 1907. A branch along Northenden Road from the line to <b>Sale</b> Moor was created in 1912. <b>Sale</b> Moor's line had only a single track which in 1925 resulted in a head-on collision between two tramcars, injuring eight passengers. Bus services were first introduced to the area in the 1920s, but became more widespread in the 1930s. The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services, which from the 1930s went into decline. The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934, and throughout <b>Sale</b> in the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|The Oxford Handbook of Strategic <b>Sales</b> and <b>Sales</b> Management is an {{unrivalled}} overview {{by leading}} academics {{in the field}} of <b>sales</b> and marketing management. <b>Sales</b> theory is experiencing a renaissance driven by a number of factors, including building profitable relationships, creating/delivering brand value, strategic customer management, <b>sales</b> and marketing relationships, global selling, and the change from transactional to customer relationship marketing. Escalating <b>sales</b> and selling costs require organisations to be more focused on results and highlight the shifting of resources from marketing to <b>sales.</b> Further the growth in customer power now requires a strategic <b>sales</b> response, and not just a tactical one. The positioning of <b>sales</b> within the organisation, the <b>sales</b> function and <b>sales</b> management are all discussed. The Handbook is not a general <b>sales</b> management text about managing a <b>sales</b> force, but will fill a gap in the existing literature through consolidating the current academic research in the <b>sales</b> area. The Handbook is structured around four key topics. The first section explores the strategic positioning of the <b>sales</b> function within the modern organisation. The second considers <b>sales</b> management and recent developments. The third section examines the <b>sales</b> relationship with the customer and highlights how <b>sales</b> is responding to the modern environment. Finally, the fourth section reviews the internal composition of <b>sales</b> within the organisation.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Construction {{equipment}} <b>sales</b> {{companies are}} faced with ongoing changing critical customer requirements driven by economic conditions and in particular, the exponential growth {{of the past few}} years. This has had a tremendous impact on the business requirements requiring operational changes affecting both processes and placing increased pressure on personnel. Furthermore, <b>sales</b> managers within the earthmoving industry require an objective approach to the management and measurement of territory <b>sales</b> effectiveness. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} determine key determinants of a control system to manage <b>sales</b> coverage effectiveness, and to recommend a model to help <b>sales</b> managers manage <b>sales</b> coverage effectiveness. <b>Sales</b> process improvements, <b>sales</b> management requirements, defined territory <b>sales</b> and quantitative indicators are conceptualised as key drivers of salespersons' performance, improved <b>sales</b> coverage and <b>sales</b> organisation effectiveness. The results of this study indicated a strong relationship between salespersons' outcome performance and <b>sales</b> organisation effectiveness, as long as <b>sales</b> managers implement a <b>sales</b> control system to manage <b>sales</b> coverage effectiveness. Managing <b>sales</b> coverage effectiveness entails a series of processes that ensure salespeople are spending most of their available time selling construction equipment. In order to achieve this, this study focused on the assessment of the <b>sales</b> force perception of the generic issues of <b>sales</b> force management; these include monthly reports, setting <b>sales</b> targets, territory assessment, territory realignment and <b>sales</b> management effectiveness. These findings identify important implications for managers in considering the effectiveness of a <b>sales</b> control system and implementation through <b>sales</b> operations that should impact favourably on an organisation's market share.
