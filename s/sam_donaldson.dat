5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson,</b> when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

500|$|Fuck is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film by director Steve Anderson about the word [...] "fuck". The film {{argues that the}} word {{is an integral part}} of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film Perversion for Profit. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian Billy Connolly states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1984 {{television}} critic Rick Sherwood {{wrote that}} although the sexual tension between Sam and Diane provided a focus for Cheers other characters, their later romance and [...] "the removal of the love-hate subplot [...] much of {{the edge of the}} series [...] lost". In October 1985, Sherwood's interest in the show lessened because of the romance; Diane's affair with Frasier Crane [...] "made things worse". According to Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times in 1986, Glenn Caron (executive producer of Moonlighting) said: [...] "... I think it's masochistic to take two people who seem destined for each other and ask an audience not to see them get together". In 1989, Michael Hill of The Baltimore Evening Sun found the similarity between the Cheers characters and real-life news anchors <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> and Diane Sawyer of Primetime Live [...] "remarkable".|$|E

He died on 11 October 2013 from natural causes at age 100. His last request to have his remains returned to Argentina to be buried alongside his wife was denied by Argentina. The Vatican issued an [...] "unprecedented ban" [...] on holding the funeral in any Catholic church in Rome. But the Society of St Pius X, a Catholic splinter group often accused of having far-right and anti-Semitic leanings, offered to hold the ceremony in the city of Albano Laziale. During the funeral service, violent clashes broke out between fascist sympathizers and anti-fascist protesters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{documentary}} Framing an Execution: The Media & Mumia Abu-Jamal {{looks at}} the way <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> from the ABC program 20/20 covered the case. Many scholars believe that Mumia is a political prisoner and is only in jail because of his specific views and criticisms of how the police {{have dealt with the}} black community. This case only got recognition after people continued to dispute that Mumia's trial was fair or lawful, {{to the extent that it}} reached national and international attention. 20/20 begins to tell this case as an emotional story, making people see it as if it isn't that important. <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> starts his interviewing with the widow, Maureen Faulkner. She is seen as a damsel in distress, which makes it easier to sympathize with her. From the beginning we know the specific angle of ABC News and where the bias of <b>Sam</b> <b>Donaldson</b> comes from.
