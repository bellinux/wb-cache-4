50|$|The British <b>soup</b> <b>spoon</b> is {{the size}} of a dessert spoon (i.e., smaller than a tablespoon), but with a deeper, more {{circular}} bowl for holding liquid. Modern soup spoons are usually stainless steel or silver-plated, but in the past wooden and horn spoons were more common. The idea of including a separate <b>soup</b> <b>spoon</b> in a table setting originated in the eighteenth century, when the bowl shapes varied widely, deep or shallow, oval, pointed, egg-shaped or circular. Spoon shapes became more standardized in nineteenth-century silverware.|$|E

25|$|At some point, the amuse-bouche {{transformed}} from an unexpected bonus to a de rigueur offering at Michelin Guide-starred restaurants and those aspiring to that category (as recently as 1999, The New York Times provided a parenthetical {{explanation of the}} course). This in turn created a set of logistical challenges for restaurants: amuse-bouche must be prepared in sufficient quantities to be served to all guests, usually just after the order is taken or between main courses. This often requires a separate cooking station devoted solely to producing the course quickly {{as well as a}} large and varied collection of specialized china for serving the amuse. Interesting plates, demitasse cups, and large Asian-style <b>soup</b> <b>spoons</b> are popular choices. In addition, the kitchen must try to accommodate guests that have an aversion or allergy to ingredients in the amuse.|$|R

50|$|The freshly drawn {{blood is}} {{collected}} in a bowl, and prevented from premature coagulation (hãm huyết), by mixing it with some fish sauce of certain proportions, usually three to five <b>soup</b> <b>spoons</b> of fish sauce for one quart (approximately 1 liter) of blood. Finely chopped meat such as cooked duck innards (such as gizzards) and duck meat are put {{in a shallow dish}} along with a sprinkling of crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. The blood and fish sauce mixture is then diluted with some watery broth left from cooking the meat and/or gizzards to promote blood coagulation, then quickly poured into the prepared meat dish. After the blood has set, the finished dish resembles a pizza. The finished dish can be kept cooled in the refrigerator, which allows the blood to maintain its coagulated state, when immediate consumption is not called for right away. If the dish is removed from the refrigerator and left to sit at room temperature for a while the blood will return to a liquid state.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>soup</b> <b>spoon</b> {{is a type}} of spoon with a {{large or}} rounded bowl, used for {{consuming}} soup. The term can either refer to the British <b>soup</b> <b>spoon</b> or the Chinese spoon. Round bowled soup spoons were a Victorian invention. Canteens of silver made prior to about 1900 do not have round soup spoons; a tablespoon was used (and still is in some British houses where the silver predates 1900. Anyone wishing to verify this has only to study the vast suite of Georgian silver in the Royal Collection ("The Grand Service" [...] sic) which has neither modern-shaped soup spoons (or fish knives and forks). In some houses they are regarded as vulgar.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} Muslim world, spoons {{were used for}} eating <b>soup.</b> Medieval <b>spoons</b> for {{domestic}} use were commonly made of cow horn or wood, but brass, pewter, and latten spoons {{appear to have been}} common in about the 15th century. The full descriptions and entries relating to silver spoons in the inventories of the royal and other households point to their special value and rarity. The earliest English reference appears to be in a will of 1259. In the wardrobe accounts of Edward I for the year 1300 some gold and silver spoons marked with the fleur-de-lis, the Paris mark, are mentioned. One of the most interesting medieval spoons is the coronation spoon used in the anointing of the English sovereign.|$|R

5000|$|Thai {{people eat}} using the fork and spoon combo method. The spoon {{acts as the}} main tool and the fork is the {{supporting}} tool pushing the food onto the spoon and the shared spoon is the main tool to scoop the food from shared dish to rice dish. Some people use their own spoon to scoop the food from the shared dish directly {{but it is not}} a good dining manner for Thais because they concern about sanitation issue. If the shared dish is curry, it is transferred to an individual little cup first. Then they sip the <b>soup</b> from the <b>spoon.</b> Sipping it from the cup directly is not proper, Moreover, making noise during eating and sipping is impolite in Thailand. On the other hand, talking during eating is not prohibited. However, Thai food menus is include a lot of fish and spices of which some parts are not for eating—splitting the food is the general behavior for Thais. Splitting on the spoon, and put them on the edge of the dish or provided dish for the trash is Thai general practice.|$|R
