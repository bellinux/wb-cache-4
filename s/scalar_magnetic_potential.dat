40|$|Purpose - To {{propose a}} novel 3 D hybrid approach, {{based on a}} {{discrete}} formulation of Maxwell equations (the cell method - CM), suitable for solving eddy current problems in unbounded domains. Design/methodology/approach - Field equations for magnetodynamics are expressed directly in algebraic form thanks to the CM. The eddy current problem inside bulk conductors is formulated in terms of discrete modified vector <b>potential,</b> whereas <b>magnetic</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>potential</b> is used in order to model the free space. The CM is coupled to the boundary element method by using a surface boundary operator, which maps the surface magnetic fluxes to the surface <b>magnetic</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>potentials.</b> This leads to {{a unique set of}} linear equations to be solved in terms of discrete potentials. The eddy currents in bulk conductors are then obtained from discrete potentials. Findings - It is shown that formulation of hybrid approaches can be simplified by expressing field equations directly in algebraic form without need of weighted residual techniques. An original strategy, based on Green's formula for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>potential,</b> is proposed in order to couple conducting parts to the exterior domain. Research limitations/implications - Conducting bodies with multiply connected parts cannot be modelled by the proposed approach, since {{it is based on the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>potential.</b> The resulting global matrix is partially dense and non-symmetric; therefore, standard iterative solvers such as GMRES have to be used. Practical implications - The proposed approach can be suitably used for analyzing eddy Current problems involving models with high degree of complexity, large air domains and moving parts. These are typical of induction heating processes. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new 3 D hybrid approach, based on a discrete formulation of Maxwell equations. A novel coupling strategy relying on integral electromagnetic variables, i. e. magnetic fluxes and <b>magnetic</b> <b>scalar</b> <b>potentials,</b> is devised in order to solve uniquely for eddy currents inside conducting bodies...|$|R

First, we present a tool that allows determining if a ferromagnetic region has holes or not. If holes are found, the region is then inflated to get automatically needed cuts.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the stability of}} liquid metal drops subject to a high-frequency AC magnetic field. An energy variation principle is derived {{in terms of the}} surface integral of the <b>scalar</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential.</b> This principle is applied to a thin perfectly conducting liquid disk, which is used to model the drops constrained in a horizontal gap between two parallel insulating plates. Firstly, the stability of a circular disk is analysed with respect to small-amplitude harmonic edge perturbations. Analytical solution shows that the edge deformations with the azimuthal wavenumbers m = 2, 3, 4,... start to develop as the magnetic Bond number exceeds the critical threshold Bmc = 3 π(m + 1) / 2. The most unstable is m = 2 mode, which corresponds to an elliptical deformation. Secondly, strongly deformed equilibrium shapes are modelled numerically by minimising the associated energy in combination with the solution of a surface integral equation for the <b>scalar</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> on an unstructured triangular mesh. The edge instability is found to result in the equilibrium shapes of either two- or threefold rotational symmetry depending on the magnetic field strength and the initial perturbation. The shapes of higher rotational symmetries are unstable and fall back to one of these two basic states. The developed method is both efficient and accurate enough for modelling of strongly deformed drop shapes...|$|E
