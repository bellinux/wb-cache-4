50|$|With {{gooseneck}} couplers <b>or</b> offset <b>shank</b> couplers, {{the horizontal}} {{centerline of the}} coupler head is above the horizontal centerline of the coupler <b>shank,</b> <b>or</b> <b>shaft,</b> and the draw gear. This arrangement is designed for use with low-floor freight cars, to lift the coupler head high enough to match the couplers on other rolling stock. The large bogie boxvans for car parts, used on the Victorian Railways, were fitted with gooseneck couplers for that reason.|$|R

5000|$|Two-wheeled {{vehicles}} are {{balanced by the}} distribution of weight of the load (driver, passengers and goods) over the axle, and then held level by the animal - {{this means that the}} <b>shafts</b> (<b>or</b> sometimes a pole for two animals) must be fixed rigidly to the vehicle's body. Four-wheeled vehicles remain level on their own, and so the <b>shafts</b> <b>or</b> pole are hinged vertically, allowing them to rise and fall with the movement of the animals. A four-wheeled vehicle is also steered by the <b>shafts</b> <b>or</b> pole, which are attached to the front axle; this swivels on a turntable or [...] "fifth wheel" [...] beneath the vehicle.|$|R

In {{machines}} {{designed to allow}} for vertical mounting, {{the upper part of}} the <b>shaft</b> <b>or</b> hub could commonly be rotated by 60° so the upper splines locked the reel in place. Some tape decks could accommodate either format by using removable hubs for the larger reel size. When in use these hubs were locked onto the cine spindles by the same mechanism used to secure the smaller reels.|$|R

The some of the air vents are provided with masonry lining (historically without any mortar) and 2 ft high parapet (parapet is mostly modern entity). The average dimension of the air vent is 4 m2. Lack of maintenance, thick vegetation growth, and run-off erosion has led to collapse of parapets.|$|R
