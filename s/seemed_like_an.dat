5|$|At {{the time}} of the invading army's entry into Laconia, Sparta was only lightly defended. The {{majority}} of the Spartan army had accompanied Areus on campaign in Crete, where the Lacedaimonians were supporting the polis of Gortyn. As such, Sparta must have <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> easy target to Pyrrhus. Arriving outside Sparta in the evening, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack immediately {{to take advantage of the}} dearth of defenders. Pyrrhus decided against launching an immediate offensive as he feared the destruction that would be wrought by his Gallic soldiers if they were to enter the city at night. Anticipating no resistance, Pyrrhus order his army to make camp and prepared to enter Sparta in the morning.|$|E

During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

But Mannerheim {{did not want}} to meet him in his {{headquarters}} in Mikkeli or in Helsinki, as it would have <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> official state visit. The meeting took place near Imatra, in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.|$|E

Its lead elements arrived there on 18 June.

25|$|When {{it became}} obvious that the United States was {{eventually}} going to become involved in the war raging in Europe, the U.S. Army contacted 135 companies asking for working prototypes of a four-wheel-drive reconnaissance car. Only two companies responded to the request: American Bantam Car Company and Willys-Overland. The Army had set what <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> impossible deadline of 49 days to supply a working prototype. Willys asked for more time, but was refused. The bankrupt American Bantam Car Company had no engineering staff left on the payroll and solicited Karl Probst, a talented freelance designer from Detroit. After turning down Bantam's initial request, Probst responded to an Army request and commenced work, initially without salary, on July 17, 1940.|$|E
25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids to try their sausages over the other teams. It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E

In July 2008, police in Queensland, Australia smashed a car window to rescue what <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{unconscious}} baby only to find it was a reborn doll. The police stated that the doll was [...] "incredibly lifelike" [...] and that bystanders who thought a baby was dying were frightened by the incident.

500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in 2012, calling Q an [...] "iconic figure". [...] Handlen said Q allowed the writers {{to compare the}} different reaction of the characters to his presence in DS9 and TNG. However, Handlen felt that Q {{was not a good}} fit for DS9, as the character <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> afterthought. Also, the pairing of Vash and Q took up too much screen time compared to the main cast, Handlen noted, while the overall plot involving the [...] "stealth alien" [...] embryo [...] "plays like an abandoned script from early in TNGs run, and an example of a fascinating concept reduced to a perfunctory MacGuffin," [...] Handlen wrote.|$|E
500|$|Hurd {{recalled}} {{that she had}} heard of the comic before, and upon reading it, felt that it would be great for film. She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> odd pairing for this. Then I heard it wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} a prevalent Moroccan chant {{of the phrase}} deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to [...] "rise up" [...] (literally: [...] "come quickly"). In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|When Lasance {{secured the}} role, he said [...] "Aden causes {{a bit of}} {{mischief}} in the Bay but he's really a good guy." [...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking guy with a smile that melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough {{said that}} Sellers [...] "had the genius {{comparable}} to Chaplin", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as [...] "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts {{he gave to}} the world. For them, he is assured of {{a place in the}} history of art as entertainment." [...] Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that [...] "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> umbrella over everything". Director Blake Edwards thought that [...] "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said [...] "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, [...] "Anything to avoid paying for dinner". Secombe later declared to journalists [...] "Bluebottle is deaded now". Milligan later said that [...] "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time." [...] The Daily Mail described Sellers as [...] "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a [...] "flawed genius" [...] who, once he latched on to a comic idea, [...] "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{category}} of poems are generally urban-themed, opting {{in favor of}} modernist means in both subjects and vocabulary.

[...] He added: [...] "The poet is a lucid one, a modern one, who [...] demystifies, demythifies and desacralizes poetry's old themes." [...] Caragiale's generic interest was in adapting to poetry the elements of [...] "bad taste" [...] in popular culture, of kitsch aesthetics and the banal.|$|E
