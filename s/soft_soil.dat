5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The <b>soft</b> <b>soil,</b> the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Increased {{traffic volume}} {{has made it}} urgent to improve highway {{capacities}} by widening the existing embankments in south-eastern coastal areas of China. Adding a new embankment adjacent to the existing embankment will result in additional settlement within the existing embankment. And also, differential settlement will occur between the existing and widened embankment over <b>soft</b> <b>soils.</b> Excessive settlement and/or excessive differential settlement may cause longitudinal cracks, drop-off on the road surface, even local or global instability. A numerical analysis was conducted to investigate {{the influence of the}} thickness of <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> on the development of settlements of the existing and widened embankment. The effect of widening time on the settlements was also discussed. The results indicate that the thicker the <b>soft</b> <b>soils,</b> the more time needed for the existing embankment to reach its final settlements. It is also found that there exists a most appropriate widening time for minimizing the additional settlements of the existing embankment on <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> with a given thickness...|$|R

25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of incremental launching of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through <b>soft</b> <b>soil.</b> No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E
40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>soils</b> are {{characterized}} by their high compressibility, and low shear strength. Highway embankments proposed to construct on such soils will undergo excessive consolidation settlements. The failure of embankments on <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> is attributed also to the undrained shear when the embankments are constructed in a short time. Hence, the construction of high embankments is taken up in stages by maintaining enough waiting period for consolidation between stages due to stage loading, which delays the whole construction period. Among the several ground improvement technics available to reduce the construction period, pre-consolidation of <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> {{through the application of}} surcharge, use of vertical drains are common methods to achieve required degreed of consolidation (usually 90 - 95 %). In any of these methods, time and cost of the project takes a major role in achieving the required degree of improvement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> {{are complex}} geomaterials: they are {{structured}} and exhibit viscous behaviour. The structure of natural soils consists of fabric (i. e. {{the arrangement of}} soil particles and particles contacts) and apparent bonding. The fabric of soft clays is often anisotropic and the anisotropy changes during plastic deformations. In addition, the constitutive behaviour of <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> is time-dependent. Firstly, some recent experimental results on soft natural Finnish clays are shown, demonstrating the complexity of material behaviour that constitutive models for soft clays need to capture. The formulations of recently proposed constitutive models that attempt to represent the soil behaviour under general stress states are then presented. The models are relatively simple hierarchical models, which enable model features to be switched on and off dependent on the problem to be solved. Comparisons with experimental data highlight the importance of accounting for anisotropy and its evolution when modelling the viscous behaviour of <b>soft</b> <b>soils.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{lateral load}} {{distributions}} specified by seismic design provisions are primarily based on elastic behaviour of fixed-base structures without considering {{the effects of}} soil-structure-interaction (SSI).

In this paper, a practical optimization technique is introduced to obtain optimum seismic design loads for non-linear shear-buildings on <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> based {{on the concept of}} uniform damage distribution. SSI effects are taken into account by using the cone model. Over 30, 000 optimum load patterns are obtained for 21 earthquake excitations recorded on <b>soft</b> <b>soils</b> to investigate the effects of fundamental period of the structure, number of stories, ductility demand, earthquake excitation, damping ratio, damping model, structural post yield behaviour, soil flexibility and structural aspect ratio on the optimum load patterns. The results indicate that the proposed optimum load patterns can significantly improve the seismic performance of flexible-base buildings on <b>soft</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E

The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on <b>soft</b> <b>soil</b> lest it throw a track.
