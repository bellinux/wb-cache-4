50|$|The {{fundamental}} genetic {{consideration in}} artificial regeneration is that seed and planting stock must {{be adapted to}} the planting environment. Most commonly, the method of managing seed and stock deployment is through a system of defined seed zones, within which seed and stock can be moved without risk of climatic maladaptation. Ontario adopted a seed zone system in the 1970s based on Hills' (1952) site regions and provincial resource district boundaries, but Ontario's seed zones are now based on homogeneous climatic regions developed with the Ontario Climate Model. The regulations stipulate that source-identified seedlots may be either a general collection, when only the seed zone of origin is known, or a stand collection from a specific latitude and longitude. The movement of general-collection seed and stock across seed zone boundaries is prohibited, {{but the use of}} stand-collection seed and stock in another seed zone is acceptable when the Ontario Climate Model shows that the planting site and place of <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> are climatically similar. The 12 seed zones for white spruce in Quebec are based mainly on ecological regions, with a few modifications for administrative convenience.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{invasive}} {{behavior of}} beggarticks (Bidens pilosa L.) in cropped areas {{is due to}} its ecological adaptation and aggressive regeneration, which is dependent on seed germination. The objective {{of this research was}} to verify the effects of B. pilosa <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and temperature on seed germination. The seeds were collected in Entre Rios do Oeste, PR, Botucatu, SP, Capão Bonito, SP, São Joaquim da Barra, SP, Sertãozinho, SP, Selvíria, MS, Barra do Garças, MT, Areia, PB and Manaus, AM. The seeds were evaluated regarding moisture content, 1000 -seed weight, germination speed index and germination at 60 days (normal seedlings, dormant seeds and dead seeds) at the temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 ºC.

40|$|Summary We {{studied the}} effects of <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and sowing time on height {{development}} and timing of height growth cessa-tion of first-year silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings in a greenhouse experiment. Seeds of seven origins ranging in latitudes from 58 ° to 67 ° N were sown at 1 – 2 -week intervals eight times from May 21 to July 30, 2001. The day/night tem-perature in the greenhouse was set at 20 / 10 °C, but lighting was natural and day length varied accordingly. Seedling height was measured twice a week. The interaction term between seed ori-gin and sowing date was significant, but the pattern of height development and timing of growth cessation depended system-atically on latitude of <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and sowing date. As seed ori-gin became increasingly northern, growth cessation began earlier and resulted in shorter growth periods. Later sowing dates delayed growth cessation but also shortened the growth period.

40|$|Climate {{envelope}} models {{predict that}} boreal trees can potentially migrate northward {{by as much}} as 10 ? by 2100 {{as a consequence of the}} predicted climate change associated with the doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentration, which might expose them to a new set of environmental conditions. The ability of the migrating trees to acclimate to the new set of environmental conditions may be critical for the actual scope and success of their migration or seed transfer. The changes in photoperiod, soil temperature and soil moisture associated with the migration will likely affect tree?s ecophysiological traits. Furthermore, the combined effects of several environmental factors may be substantially different from the total of their individual effects. In this study, I investigated the interactive effects of (1) photoperiod and soil temperature and (2) photoperiod and soil moisture on the ecophysiological responses of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) seedlings to elevated [CO 2]. In the first set of experiments, jack pine seedlings were exposed to two [CO 2] (400 and 950 ?mol mol- 1), two soil temperatures (soil temperature at <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and 5 ? C warmer) and three photoperiod regimes (photoperiod at <b>seed</b> <b>origin,</b> 5 o and 10 o north of the <b>seed</b> <b>origin).</b> It was found that the photoperiod regime associated with a 10 ? northward migration advanced the timing of budburst by 10 days under the doubled [CO 2] and current soil temperature at the <b>seed</b> <b>origin.</b> Also the photoperiod regimes at higher latitudes prolonged the process of bud setting. Photoperiod regimes at latitudes higher than the <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> increased seedling height growth but did not have significant impact on seedling biomass. The elevated [CO 2] increased the total leaf area per seedling, but reduced shoot to root ratio. Elevated [CO 2] also increased the photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic water use efficiency (WUE). The maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and triose phosphate utilization (TPU) were affected by interactions involving CO 2 and photoperiod but no meaningful pattern could be discerned. Both CO 2 elevation and soil warming reduced the cold hardiness of jack pine seedlings as indicated by the injury index tested at - 15 and - 30 ? C testing temperatures. The lack of photoperiod effects on cold hardiness suggests that jack pine may be plastic enough to acclimate to the new photoperiod regime associated with climate change induced northward migration. However, advanced budburst associated with long distance migration (e. g. 10 ? north) will likely expose the species to late-spring frost damage. In the second set of experiments, seedlings were exposed to two [CO 2] (400 and 950 ?mol mol- 1), two soil moistures (60 ? 70 % and 30 ? 40 % of field capacity) and three photoperiod regimes (photoperiod at <b>seed</b> <b>origin,</b> 5 o and 10 o north of the <b>seed</b> <b>origin).</b> The results suggest that the responses of jack pine to climate change will become complicated under the interactive effects of the longer growing season photoperiod and faster rate of change in day length at higher latitudes, and soil moisture stress under elevated [CO 2]. Longer photoperiods at higher latitudes advanced budburst at both high and low soil moisture regime, which will likely increase the risk of late spring frosts damage prior to and during budburst. Longer summer photoperiods with northward migration increased the WUE under elevated [CO 2] and low soil moisture regime. However, the significant 2 - and 3 -way interactions suggest that drought and longer photoperiods associated with northward migration will limit the positive effects of elevated [CO 2] on growth and physiological processes in the species. Hydraulic conductivity in jack pine seedlings was significantly increased under elevated [CO 2] while it was reduced at low soil moisture regime. The interactions of [CO 2] and photoperiod had significant effects on the stem xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Tendency to embolize was significantly greater in the seedlings grown under elevated [CO 2] with the photoperiod regime 10 ? north of the <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> compared to those grown under ambient [CO 2] with photoperiod 10 ? north of the <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and elevated [CO 2] at the photoperiod regime of the <b>seed</b> <b>origin.</b> This result suggests that 10 ? northward migration under elevated CO 2 will affect the hydraulic behavior of the species and make it vulnerable to xylem cavitation...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{germination}} {{and development}} depend upon a seed's successful dispersal into a suitable habitat {{and its ability}} to grow and survive within the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. The seeds of Aechmea mertensii, a tank-bromeliad species, are dispersed by either Camponotus femoratus or Neoponera goeldii, two ant species that initiate ant gardens (AGs). These two mutualistic ant species influence the vegetative and reproductive traits of the bromeliad through their divergent ecological preferences (i. e. light and substrate). We hypothesised that the seeds dispersed by these two ant species have underlying genetic differences affecting germination, growth and survival of A. mertensii seedlings in different ways. To test this, we used an experimental approach consisting of sowing seeds of A. mertensii: (i) taken from the two AG-ant associations (i. e. <b>seed</b> <b>origin),</b> (ii) in two contrasting light conditions, and (iii) on three different substrates. Light and substrate had significant effects on germination, survival and on eight key leaf traits reflecting plant performance. <b>Seed</b> <b>origin</b> had a significant effect only on germination and on two leaf traits (total dry mass and relative growth rate). Overall, this bromeliad performs better (i. e. high growth and survival rates) when growing both in the shade and in the carton nest developed by C. femoratus ants.

Contrary to common opinion, species pairs of xeric origins are more affected by water deficit than those of mesic origins, probably because the narrower range in mountainous regions of Prince Rupprecht’s larch results in lower adaptation to water deficits, while larger distribution along coastal regions of eastern larch contributes to its higher phenotypic plasticity of variable soil conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe gene {{structure}} of oryzacystatin-II, a new cystatin superfamily member of rice <b>seed</b> <b>origin,</b> was determined. In spans approximately 2. 5 kbp the comprises 3 exons. The number of exons and the intron-breakpoints coincide {{with those of}} oryzacystatin-I, the first well-defined plant cystatin. However, no similar sequences were observed between the two oryzacystatin genes in 5 ′-upstream regulatory regions, even though both are expressed specifically during the ripening stage of rice seeds. The gene organization of these two plant cystatins is generally {{different from that of}} animal cystatins...|$|E
40|$|A seed is an {{intricate}} structure. Of the two development {{processes involved in}} seed formation, seed maturation, or seed program includes accumulation of storage products, acquisition of desiccation tolerance, and induction of dormancy. Little is known about how these processes were originated and integrated into {{the life cycle of}} seed plants. While previous investigation on <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> was almost exclusively through fossil comparison in paleobotany, a wealth of information about the key role of LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1) in seed formation of spermatophyte inspired a new approach to investigating the <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> mystery. Here, we examined the expression pattern of AcLEC 1 during the entire life cycle of Adiantum capillus-veneris, a non-seed plant, confirmed no AcLEC 1 gene expression detectable in prothalli, demonstrated inductive expressed by both sucrose and glucose in prothalli. As expected, we found that sugar treatments delayed prothallus development, promoted differentiation of reproductive organs, and triggered accumulation of storage products. These findings demonstrated links between the sugar treatments and the induction of AcLEC 1 expression, as well as the sugar treatments and the events such as accumulation of storage products, which is similar to those considered as seed maturation process in seed plants. These links support a modified hypothesis that inductive expression of LEC 1 homologs during embryogenesis might be a key innovation for the origin of the seed program...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{relationships}} of several wood quality traits with <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> and phenological characteristics, measured {{at a young}} age, were tested from six seed sources in a young Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) provenance plantation. The wood quality traits measured were wood density, uniformity of wood density, percentage latewood, fiber length, Runkel ratio, and holocellulose content. Data for each seed source concerning the phenological characteristics of bud bursting time, bud set time, and needle length during the second growing season, were obtained from an earlier study. <b>Seed</b> <b>origin</b> data concerning the latitude and elevation of each seed source were also obtained from an earlier study. As an estimate of mature wood properties the outer three annual rings (most samples contained ten rings) away from the pith were used. It was hoped that these relationships would show possible predictors of mature wood properties from young seedlings. Such predictors {{could be used as}} selection criteria for out planting seedlings with desired wood properties or as early indicators of the genetic influence on wood properties in genetic experiments. The overall average wood density, uniformity of wood density, percentage latewood, and annual ring width were measured for each of the six seed sources. These measurements were used to test the influence of <b>seed</b> <b>origin</b> or phenological characteristics (measured at age two) on juvenile wood formation. These same traits were measured ring by ring, from pith to bark, in each of the seed sources in an attempt to explain some of the results encountered. The latitude of seed source origin showed a significant relationship with mature wood fiber length indicating strong genetic control. Time of bud set appeared to have an influence on holocellulose content in mature wood. Needle length showed a significant negative correlation with average wood density but not mature wood density, indicating it may have some influence on wood formation but may not be used as a predictor of future wood properties. From the variation patterns in wood density, uniformity of wood density, percentage latewood, and ring width from pith to bark it appeared that a possible relationship between wood formation and crown-development may exist...|$|E
40|$|Serpentine {{soils are}} {{distributed}} {{in a small}} area in Korea, and generally exhibit high contents ofNi, Cr, Fe, Mn, Co and Mg. We investigated the growth of woody plants and herbs in the Andong serpentinearea, Korea. Pinus densiflora and P. rigida growing on serpentine soils have high contents of Fe, Mg, Ni andCo, with contents approximately {{twice as high as}} those of non-serpentine plants. Tree species on serpentinesoil also had lower ratios of tree height/DBH than trees in a control area. In greenhouse culture experimentson two bodenvag herb species, Setaria viridis and Cymbopogon tortilis, the biomass of the plants was significantlyaffected by soil type but not by <b>seed</b> <b>origins.</b> After 66 days, the growth of S. viridis and C. tortilis seedlingswas significantly inhibited in serpentine soil, and the dry weight of each species showed significant negativecorrelations with soil heavy metal contents (Ni, Co and Cr). These results suggest that the growth of plants wasinhibited by properties of the serpentine soil, and in particular, their high heavy metal concentration, whichinduced dwarfing in woody plants and reduction of total plant biomass in herbs...|$|R
40|$|Andean {{blueberry}} propagation is {{done with}} wild plants {{and there is an}} absence of knowledge for the agronomical potential of the available materials for sexual propagation. Therefore, developing a propagation protocol that provides technical information for field growers is needed. The present paper aimed to evaluate the effect {{of the size of the}} fruits that were used to extract the seeds on the growth and development of Andean blueberry plants during the germination and nursery stages, comparing fruits from four different regions of Colombia: Antioquia, Cauca, Cundinamarca and Boyaca. During the germination stage, seeds from Antioquia and Cauca showed the best results with germination rates close to 90 % and reached important physiological events, such as seed coat cracking and radicle extension earlier than seeds from Boyaca and Cundinamarca. In the nursery stage, fruit size significantly affected the growth variables, such as plant height and leaf length, in all the different <b>seed</b> <b>origins.</b> Seedlings from Boyaca showed better results for growth and development after transplanting, as indicated by a higher amount of leaves and presence of basal branching, followed by seedlings from Cauca, Cundinamarca and Antioquia, which showed delayed phenological events...|$|R
40|$|Larvae of {{the pine}} beauty moth Panolis flammae (Denis & Schiffermuller) were reared in sleeve cages on five {{different}} <b>seed</b> <b>origins</b> (provenances) of pole stage Pinus contorta {{in the field in}} each of four years from 1985 to 1988. Survival varied significantly between the years. In those years when survival was high, significant differences between tree provenance were not found. However, between provenance significant differences were found in larval weight and stage of development. In the years when survival was low, the results seen in good years were reversed. Significant differences attributable to provenance were found but these were not reflected in significant differences between larval weight or development. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the proportion surviving and larval weight, which was not the case in those years where larval survival was high. The results are discussed in light of the pest status of P, flammea in Britain and in view of current silvicultural policies. The use of trees resistant to insect attack as part of an integrated pest management programme is highlighted and the need to coordinate laboratory and field studies so as to control for environmental variation discussed...|$|R
