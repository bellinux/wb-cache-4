[...] For a survey of applications of Stackelberg differential games to supply chain and marketing channels, see He et al. (2007). In recent years, Stackelberg games have contributed a lot in the <b>security</b> <b>domain</b> where it is essential for the security personnel to protect some valuable resource and search for any potential threats to it. This is where it involves the security personnel (leader) to design his/her strategy first so that irrespective of the strategy adopted by the thief (follower), the resource remains safe.|$|E

An approach for providing IdM in a scenario with multiple <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> is through an AAI that uses the federated IdM model (FIM) [150, 151]. In a federation, trust relationships are established among IdPs and SPs to enable the exchange of identity information and service sharing. Existing trust relationships guarantee that users/devices authenticated in home IdP may access protected resources provided by SPs from other federation <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> [148]. Single Sign-On (SSO) is obtained when the same authentication event can be used to access different federated services [146].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Research on Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) has {{recently}} shifted to green <b>security</b> <b>domains,</b> e. g., protecting wildlife from illegal poaching. Pre-vious {{research on this}} topic has advocated the use of behavioral (bounded ra-tionality) models of adversaries in SSG. As its first contribution, this paper, for the first time, provides validation of these behavioral models based on real-world data from a wildlife park. The paper’s next contribution is the first algorithm to handle payoff uncertainty – an important concern in green <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> – {{in the presence of}} such adversary behavioral models. Finally, given the availability of mobile sensors such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in green <b>security</b> <b>domains,</b> as our third contribution, we introduce new payoff elicitation strategies to strate-gically reduce uncertainty over multiple targets at a time. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{security}} {{goals of}} an organization are realized through security policies, which concern physical security, digital security and security awareness. An insider is aware of these security policies, and {{might be able to}} thwart the security goals by combining physical, digital and social means. A systematic analysis of such attacks requires the whole environment where the insider operates to be formally represented. This paper presents Portunes, a framework which integrates all three <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> in a single environment. Portunes consists of a high-level abstraction model focusing on the relations between the three <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> and a lower abstraction level language able to represent the model and describe attacks which span the three <b>security</b> <b>domains.</b> Using the Portunes framework, we are able to represent a whole new family of attacks where the insider is not assumed to use purely digital actions to achieve a malicious goal...|$|R

The <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> are configurable, they can be transient (changes to the file system will not be preserved), and their network connection can be routed through special virtual machines (for example one that only provides Tor networking).

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of people with}} autonomous agents has become increasingly prevalent. Some of these settings include <b>security</b> <b>domains,</b> where people {{can be characterized as}} uncooperative, hostile, manipulative, and tending {{to take advantage of the}} situation for their own needs. This makes it challenging to design proficient agents to interact with people in such environments. Evaluating the success of the agents automatically before evaluating them with people or deploying them could alleviate this challenge and result in better designed agents. In this paper we show how Peer Designed Agents (PDAs) – computer agents developed by human subjects – can be used as a method for evaluating autonomous agents in <b>security</b> <b>domains.</b> Such evaluation can reduce the effort and costs involved in evaluating autonomous agents interacting with people to validate their efficacy. Our experiments included more than 70 human subjects and 40 PDAs developed by students. The study provides empirical support that PDAs can be used to compare the proficiency of autonomous agents when matched with people in <b>security</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R

Modern military, intelligence, and law enforcement operations critically depend on timely sharing of information. CDS is distinct from the more rigorous approaches, because it supports transfer that would otherwise be precluded by established models of computer, network, and data security, e.g., Bell-LaPadula model and Clark-Wilson model. CDS development, assessment, and deployment are based on risk management.|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{applying}} machine learning(ML) {{to solve problems}} in <b>security</b> <b>domains</b> is almost 3 decades old. As information and communications grow more ubiquitous and more data become available, many security risks arise as well as appetite to manage and mitigate such risks. Consequently, research on applying and designing ML algorithms and systems for security has grown fast, ranging from intrusion detection systems(IDS) and malware classification to security policy management(SPM) and information leak checking. In this paper, we systematically study the methods, algorithms, and system designs in academic publications from 2008 - 2015 that applied ML in <b>security</b> <b>domains.</b> 98 percent of the surveyed papers appeared in the 6 highest-ranked academic security conferences and 1 conference known for pioneering ML applications in security. We examine the generalized system designs, underlying assumptions, measurements, and use cases in active research.
