50|$|Risers, {{also known}} as feeders, {{are the most common}} way of {{providing}} directional solidification. It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for solidification shrinkage. For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot <b>supply</b> <b>liquid</b> metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the yield of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote directional solidification is by adding chills to the mold. A chill is any material which will conduct heat away from the casting more rapidly than the material used for molding.|$|E

5000|$|The {{kerosene}} burning Primus stoves {{and their}} imitators {{were made of}} brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to <b>supply</b> <b>liquid</b> fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus burner vaporized the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from the fuel tank at the stove's base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or [...] "methylated spirits") before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand operated pump integrated into the stove's fuel tank. The flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust the flame. Primus-style stoves were made {{in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and many were designed to be disassembled for storage and transportation in a separate case.|$|E

40|$|Accompanying the {{requirements}} for higher quality welds in structural parts, {{there is a growing}} demand for more rapid and automatic methods for their nondestructive inspection. Conventional X-ray methods are inherently slow and are difficult to automate. Furthermore, they often present a safety hazard that adds mass and bureaucracy to the application of the method. Ultrasonics, on the other hand, can be very rapid, is easily made automatic, and does not present any safety problems. Its main drawbacks are the requirement for a carefully aligned transducer, a plumbing system to <b>supply</b> <b>liquid</b> couplant, and an educated operator to maintain the alignment and coupling throughout the scan of the weld line. Since electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) 1 eliminate the need for a couplant fluid, they would appear to offer a major improvement for weld inspection technology...|$|E

50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must {{be filled with}} liquid before the pump is started, or the pump {{will not be able}} to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction.
