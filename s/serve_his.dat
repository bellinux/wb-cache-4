5|$|Several {{years prior}} to the start of the game, Hoshido's King Sumeragi is ambushed by Nohr's King Garon during a fake peace treaty talk between the nations and is killed. King Garon kidnaps Sumeragi's young child, the Avatar, and decides to raise them to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> purposes. Meanwhile, back in Hoshido, without their king, Sumeragi's wife Mikoto becomes the new ruler of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for {{overtaking}} a lapped car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and stopping for 10 seconds, and the rules state that a driver must <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> penalty within three laps of the penalty being issued. On the third lap after receiving the penalty, Schumacher turned into the pit lane to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> penalty, but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving the penalty. The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the penalty completely due to the irregularities in how the penalty had been issued.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{contacts}} with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently hoping that the Muslims, humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims.|$|E

5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> followers.|$|E
50|$|Mohammed Burhanuddin {{was born}} in the same year his father became 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra community.

5|$|On April 19, {{after the}} firing on Battle of Fort Sumter and in {{response}} to President Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion, Virginia joined three more Southern states in seceding from the Union. Native son Pickett journeyed from Oregon to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> state. Arriving after the First Battle of Bull Run, he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army on June 25, 1861; he had been holding a commission as a major in the Confederate States Army Artillery since March 16. Within a month he was appointed colonel in command of the Rappahannock Line of the Department of Fredericksburg, under the command of Major General Theophilus H. Holmes. Holmes's influence obtained a commission for Pickett as a brigadier general, dated January 14, 1862.|$|E
5|$|With {{financial}} success came more clients {{and opportunities to}} <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> community. Tucker received many cases in debt collection, and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Tucker was also elected {{to serve in the}} United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825, representing the Lynchburg area in the 16th, 17th, and 18th United States Congresses. His financial largess was short-lived, as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington, not to mention the increased expenses of a larger immediate family.|$|E
5|$|Without {{leaving the}} jury box, the jurors found Berkman guilty on all charges. The judge gave Berkman the maximum {{sentence}} for each count: {{a total of}} 21years in prison and one year in the workhouse, to be served consecutively. Berkman argued that he should only be sentenced for the attempt on Frick's life, that the other charges were elements of the main crime of assault {{with the intent to}} kill, but the judge overruled his objection. In four hours, Berkman had been tried, convicted, and sentenced. He was brought to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> sentence at Pennsylvania's Western Penitentiary.|$|E

5|$|Marius {{begins his}} {{story as a}} soldier having just {{successfully}} completed his training, {{who is about to}} leave Rome to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> duty in the relatively sedate II Legion, holding a post in peaceful Alexandria. Just before his deployment, he enjoys a return to his family in Rome and the adulation of his father Leontius (Nick Brimble), a former general and current member of the Roman Senate. Marius' visit is cut short by a barbarian incursion; a running battle through the streets of Rome results in the death of his parents and younger sister. Commander Vitallion, a friend and former comrade of the slain Leontius, transfers Marius to his XIV Legion, and promises Marius vengeance for his murdered family. Vitallion leads the XIV Legion to Britain, but the fleet is ambushed off the coast; Marius leads the counter-attack, rallying the surviving Roman troops and nearly single-handedly preventing the destruction of the remainder of the fleet, which impresses Vitallion. Marius is promoted to Centurion.|$|E
5|$|On lap17, Massa and Hamilton {{were given}} drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen {{off the track}} into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with engine {{problems}} and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

5|$|William ceased his active {{service in}} the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain {{declared}} war on France in 1793, he was anxious to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> country and expected a command, but was not given a ship, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, expecting a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to any actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV Vasa, son of Sigismund III, {{ruled the}} Commonwealth during 1632–1648. Born {{and raised in}} Poland, {{prepared}} for the office from the early years, popular, educated, free of his father's religious prejudices, he seemed a promising chief executive candidate. Władysław however, like his father, had the life ambition of attaining the Swedish throne by using his royal status and power in Poland and Lithuania, which, to <b>serve</b> <b>his</b> purpose, he attempted to strengthen. Władysław ruled {{with the help of}} several prominent magnates, among them Jerzy Ossoliński, Chancellor of the Crown, Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, and Jakub Sobieski, the middle szlachta leader. Władysław IV was unable to attract a wider szlachta following, and many of his plans had foundered because of lack of support in the increasingly ineffectual sejm. Because of his tolerance for non-Catholics, Władysław was also opposed by the Catholic clergy and the papacy.|$|E
