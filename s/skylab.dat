5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled {{to serve as}} members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the <b>Skylab</b> program where they flew on <b>Skylab</b> 4.|$|E
5|$|Ava {{was given}} the most {{advanced}} measurement and reconnaissance available at the time. Recon flights were conducted and meteorological equipment was tested. The hurricane was also photographed from space by satellites and <b>Skylab</b> astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, <b>Skylab</b> 3 {{took two}} orb-web spiders into space {{to test their}} web-spinning {{capabilities}} in zero gravity. At first, both produced rather sloppy webs, but they adapted quickly.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of limited gimbal movement such as <b>Skylab's</b> is that singularities are {{less of a}} problem. If <b>Skylab's</b> inner gimbals {{had been able to}} reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.|$|R

5|$|Another major {{facility}} is Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama {{at which the}} Saturn 5 rocket and <b>Skylab</b> were developed. The JPL worked together with ABMA, one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first American space mission.|$|E
5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the <b>Skylab</b> space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing {{the development of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E
5|$|The S-IVB orbital {{workshop}} was {{the only}} one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. Dubbed <b>Skylab,</b> it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its existence, Christine was {{monitored}} by astronauts in the <b>Skylab</b> 3 project. During this project, active and passive microwave satellite imagery {{was used for}} the first time to determine the wind speed within a tropical cyclone. This was accomplished after the removal of regions of heavy rain from the data, a factor that gives inaccurate wind readings.|$|E
5|$|To save cost, NASA {{used one}} of the Saturn V rockets {{originally}} earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the <b>Skylab.</b> Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts {{to and from the}} station. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was , which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 1972, Lunney {{was given}} overall {{responsibility}} for the test project; henceforth {{he would be in}} charge not only of building a partnership with the Soviets, but also of mission planning and of negotiating with North American Rockwell, the spacecraft contractor. According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him {{responsibility for the}} Apollo spacecraft used during <b>Skylab</b> missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP.|$|E

5|$|Triethylborane is a {{substance}} which ignites the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. It {{was also used}} to ignite the F-1 Engines on the Saturn V Rocket utilized by NASA's Apollo and <b>Skylab</b> programs from 1967 until 1973. Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially {{the fact that it}} burns with a very high temperature. Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the <b>Skylab</b> orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard <b>Skylab</b> and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{assembly}} {{marked the}} beginning of the third generation of space station design, being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft (thus opening a new era in space architecture). First generation stations such as Salyut 1 and <b>Skylab</b> had monolithic designs, consisting of one module with no resupply capability; the second generation stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as Progress. The capability of Mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind (for instance, the core module functioned largely as living quarters), thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.|$|E
