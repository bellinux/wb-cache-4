There is debate about whether to continue using catgut in a medical setting, since cotton is usually cheaper and wounds closed with either cotton or <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> are less prone to infection.

50|$|While {{synthetic}} material didn't {{exist in a}} way to create whole jerseys, <b>synthetic</b> <b>thread</b> or blends were added in 1947, following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn. Riders, especially the Frenchman Louison Bobet (Louis Bobet as he was still known), believed in the pureness of wool. Bobet insisted that cyclists needed wool for their long days of sweating in the heat and dust. It was a matter of hygiene. Artificial fabrics made riders sweat too much. And, in his first Tour de France, he refused to wear the jersey with which he had been presented.|$|E
50|$|Bobet {{was driven}} by {{personal}} hygiene and refused to accept his first yellow jersey because {{it had not been}} made with the pure wool he believed the only healthy material for a sweating and dusty rider. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>thread</b> or blends were added in 1947 following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn. The race organiser, Jacques Goddet wrote:It produced a real drama. Our contract with Sofil was crumbling away. If the news had got out, the commercial effect would have been disastrous for the manufacturer. I remember debating it with him {{a good part of the}} night. Louison was always exquisitely courteous but his principles were as hard as the granite blocks of his native Brittany coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{next great}} leap {{came in the}} twentieth century. The {{chemical}} industry drove production of the first <b>synthetic</b> <b>thread</b> in the early 1930s, which exploded into production of numerous absorbable and non-absorbable synthetics. The first synthetic absorbable was based on polyvinyl alcohol in 1931. Polyesters were developed in the 1950s, and later the process of radiation sterilization was established for catgut and polyester. Polyglycolic acid was discovered in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s. Today, most sutures are made of synthetic polymer fibers. Silk and, rarely, gut sutures are the only materials still in use from ancient times. In fact, gut sutures have been banned in Europe and Japan owing to concerns regarding Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. Silk suture is still used, mainly to secure surgical drains.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} terms used {{for what is}} {{essentially}} the same technique. Traditionally the process was called screen printing or silkscreen printing because silk was used in the process prior to the invention of polyester mesh. Currently, <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> are commonly used in the screen printing process. The most popular mesh in general use is made of polyester. There are special-use mesh materials of nylon and stainless steel available to the screen printer. There are also different types of mesh size which will determine the outcome and look of the finished design on the material.|$|R

This work, developed at SRI Internation, proposes a hierarchy of correlations. Security alerts - detected by sensors spread over a network - are fused into meta-alerts at three different processing levels: (1) intra-sensor or <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> - alerts from a single sensor are fused together according to a high minimum expectation similarity on the sensor itself, the attack class, and source and target IPs; (2) security incidents - alerts that {{belong to the same}} class and target the same IP are fused together despite the expectation of similarity on the sensor identifier; (3) correlated attack reports: multistage attacks are possibly detected by relaxing the minimum expectation in similarity on the attack class.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} self reported musculoskeletal complaints in the back, arms or neck, and legs among workers in the spinning industry, and to investigate the relations between these complaints and work related variables. METHODS: An interview based questionnaire survey {{was carried out in}} two spinning industry factories in Lithuania. RESULTS: The study group consisted of all workers in production (n = 363). Symptoms of the legs were the musculoskeletal symptom reported most often (61 %). Many subjects had arms or neck (55 %) or back problems (28 %). 20 % had experienced pain from all three sites. Almost 25 % had had musculoskeletal pain every day and 16 % had experienced constant pain during previous year. Packers had the highest risk of arms or neck problems whereas spinners had the highest risk of back or leg problems. Working in a strained posture (bending, work with arms raised up above shoulder level, and repetitive movements of the fingers) was associated with all three complaints. Only arms or neck complaints were associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal disorders are a common problem among workers producing gobelin or <b>synthetic</b> <b>thread</b> in Lithuania and working in a strained posture is a risk factor for developing musculoskeletal disorders in three body sites: legs, arms or neck, and back. To better understand the different aspects of physical load as risk factors, a more detailed study of the frequency of postural changes as well as an observation of individually adopted postures would be necessary. This applies to intervention studies in factories of the spinning industry to prevent complaints of the legs and shoulders...|$|E

40|$|Morphological and morphometric {{aspects of}} {{tracheal}} anastomosis in rabbits sutured with two absorbable <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> and two nonabsorbable <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> were compared in this study. The animals {{were divided into}} three equal groups of twenty-four individuals (A, B, C), for post-operation studies on the 7 th, 14 th and 28 th day. Each group was subdivided into four equal subgroups of six animals. After the excision of three cartilaginous rings, the tracheal anastomosis was sutured with polygalactine 910, polydioxan, polypropylene and polyester thread. The macroscopic examination verified a tracheal fistula on the seventh postoperation day in the anastomosis sutured with polyester. Cicraticial stenosis was most intensive and frequent with polyester and polydioxan threads in all the periods observed. On the fourteenth and twenty-eighth post-operation days, the optical microscopy revealed a chronic inflammatory reaction with higher intensity in sutures with polyester, polydioxan and polypropylene with a clear correlation between intense chronic inflammatory reaction and the macroscopic bad results observed in the anastomoses sutured with such threads. The final results lead {{to the conclusion that}} polygalactine 910 provided the best cicratization for tracheal anastomosis in rabbits, followed by polypropylene. Polydioxan and polyester threads provided the worst anastomosis cicratizationNeste trabalho foram comparados aspectos mofolÃ³gicos e morfomÃ©tricos da anastomose traqueal em coelhos, com a sutrua realizada por dois fios sintÃ©ticos absorvÃ­veis e dois fios sintÃ©ticos inabsorvÃ­veis. Os animais foram separados em trÃªs grupos iguais de 24 animais (A, B e C), estudos nos 7 Âº, 14 Âº e 28 Âº dias de pÃ³s-operatÃ³rio. Cada grupo foi dividido em quatro subgrupos iguais de seis animais. ApÃ³s a excisÃ£o de trÃªs anÃ©is cartilaginosos, a anastomose traqueal foi realizada com o fio de poligalactina 910, polidioxanona, polipropileno ou poliÃ©ster. Ao exame macroscÃ³pico, verificou-se que ocorreu uma fÃ­stula traqueal no 7 Âº dia de pÃ³s-operatÃ³rio na anastomose suturada com o fio de poliÃ©ster. A estenose cicatricial ocorreu com maior intensidade e freqÃ¼Ãªncia com os fios de poliÃ©ster e polidioxanona, em todos os perÃ­odos de observaÃ§Ã£o. No 14 Âº e 28 Âº dias de pÃ³s-operatÃ³rio, verificou-se, Ã  microscopia Ã³ptica, reaÃ§Ã£o inflamatÃ³ria crÃ´nica com intensidade maior nas suturas com os fios de poliÃ©ster, polidioxanona e polipropileno, nesta ordem, com nÃ­tida correlaÃ§Ã£o entre a resposta inflamatÃ³ria crÃ´nica intensa e os maus resultados macroscÃ³picos observados nas anastomoses onde foram utilizados estes fios.

50|$|Paisley, as {{with other}} areas in Renfrewshire, was at one time famous for its weaving and textile industries. As a consequence, the Paisley pattern has long {{symbolic}} associations with the town. Until the Jacquard loom {{was introduced in the}} 1820s, weaving was a cottage industry. This innovation led to the industrialisation of the process and many larger mills were created in the town. Also as a consequence of greater mechanisation, many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canada and Australia. Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture of cotton sewing thread. At the heyday of Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s, there were 28,000 people employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills of J & P Coats Ltd, said to be the largest of their kind in the world at that time. In the 1950s, the mills diversified into the production of <b>synthetic</b> <b>threads</b> but production diminished rapidly as a result of less expensive imports from overseas and the establishment of mills in India and Brazil by J & P Coats. By the end of the 1993, there was no thread being produced in Paisley. Both industries have left a permanent mark on the town {{in the form of the}} many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street, Gauze Street and Incle Street.|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades {{created on}} the loom, {{as part of}} the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ikat patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called buttis or bhuttis (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called zari work.Sometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. Resham work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. Zardozi embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and precious stones.

40|$|We propose "self-migrating threads" {{as a new}} cluster {{computing}} {{paradigm for}} multi-agent applications, which {{can be viewed as}} the interactions among autonomous computing entities, each having its own objectives, behavior, and local information in a <b>synthetic</b> world.

With those aspects, we expect that self-migrating threads provide multi-agent applications with good programmability and performance. We have designed the functionality of self-migrating threads and implemented a low-level migration library. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of our design by considering the implementation techniques and basic migration performance...|$|R
30|$|Throughout history, various exotic {{materials}} {{have been used}} to close surgical wounds. Leather has been used as far back as 1100 BC [1]. Woven horse hair, cotton, and linen are examples of natural fibers used in sutures; in fact, silk is still used today. With the evolution of advancing technology, arrays of <b>synthetic</b> polymeric <b>threads</b> have replaced natural fibers for the majority of purposes with Vicrylâ¢ (Ethicon, Kirkton, Scotland) absorbable sutures becoming one of the most popular. Cyanoacrylate adhesives offer the surgeon and patient an alternative to suturing wounds. They offer a fast and less traumatic closure for appropriately selected wounds and typically do not require the use of local anesthesia [2]. These adhesives are commonly used for the closure of topical skin incisions and trauma-induced lacerations in areas of low skin tension [3]. Numerous potential advantages have been reported for both surgeons, healthcare system providers, and patients compared to conventional surgical wound closure techniques, including faster closure time, good cosmesis, non-invasive, less tissue trauma, no requirement for secondary dressing, ease of bathing, and no requirement for suture or staple removal [4]. Additionally, they spontaneously slough off in a short time period of time (5 â 10 Â days), thereby not requiring clinician removal [5]. These unique benefits have resulted in a significant increase in both the use and acceptance of the product within the medical community.|$|R
40|$|With {{the use of}} <b>synthetic</b> {{fabric and}} <b>thread</b> as well as high speed sewing in sewing industry, needle heating due to {{friction}} between the needle and fabric becomes a serious problem. The high temperature in the needle can scorch the fabric as well as accelerate thread wear and damage the thread. It also causes wear at the needle eye, and may temper and weaken the needle itself. It is desirable to develop analytical computer simulation models to study the needle heating problem. In this thesis, three models are developed: a sliding model, a lumped model, and a Finite Element (FE) simulation model. In the sliding model and the lumped model, {{it is assumed that}} needle can be modeled as a cylinder and the effect of the thread can be ignored. These simplified analytical models focus on the needle-fabric interactions, especially the friction heat partition between needle and fabric. In the FE model, both the detailed needle geometry characteristics and thread effects are considered. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|X-ray {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning the structural state of myosin heads of <b>synthetic</b> filaments in <b>threads.</b> These were made from purified rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and studied by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy by Cooke et al. (Cooke, P. H., E. M. Bartels, G. F. Elliott, and R. A. Hughes, 1987, Biophys. J., 51 : 947 - 957). X-ray patterns show a meridional peak at a spacing of 14. 4 nm. We concentrate here on the only other feature of the axial pattern: this is a central region of diffuse scatter, which we find {{to be similar to}} that obtained from myosin heads in solution (Mendelson, R. A., K. M. Kretzschmar, 1980, Biochemistry, 19 : 4103 - 4108). This means that the myosin heads have very large random displacements in all directions from their average positions, and that they are practically randomly oriented. The myosin heads do not contribute to the 14. 4 -nm peak, which must come entirely from the backbone. Comparison with x-ray data from the unstriated Taenia coli muscle of the guinea pig indicates that in this muscle at least 75 % of the diffuse scatter comes from disordered myosin heads. The results confirm that the diffuse scatter in x-ray patterns from specimens that contain myosin filaments can yield information about the structural behavior of the myosin heads...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of myosin light chains with heavy chains, i. e. the intact oligomeric structure, profoundly affects the Ca 2 +-binding {{properties of the}} light chains. The Ca 2 +-binding affinity of the light chains is more than two magnitudes higher {{in the presence of}} heavy chains than in its absence. Modification of the reactive SH 2 thiol of myosin results in an alteration in the conformation of heavy chains of the molecule that influences the Ca 2 +-binding properties of light chains and generation of tension. When the SH 2 moiety is blocked with N-ethylmaleimide the influence of the heavy chains on the Ca 2 +-binding properties of light chain LC 2 is lost; under these conditions the Ca 2 +-binding affinity value of SH 2 -N-ethylmaleimide-blocked myosin (3. 3 Ã 104 mâ 1) decreases to near that expressed with the dissociated light chain LC 2 (0. 7 Ã 104 mâ 1). Conversely, the presence of actin, nucleotides or modification of either the reactive lysyl residue or SH 2 thiol does not affect Ca 2 + binding. The native secondary and tertiary structure of myosin seem to be required for Ca 2 + binding; binding does not occur in the presence of 6 m-urea with either native myosin or the dissociated light chains. With SH 2 -N-ethylmaleimide-blocked myosin normal Ca 2 +- and (Mg 2 ++actin) -stimulated ATPase activities are expressed; however, there is a loss in K+-stimulated ATPase activity and the <b>synthetic</b> actomyosin <b>threads</b> of such myosin express no isometric tension. There are also variances in the binding of Ca 2 + with alterations in pH values. In the absence of Ca 2 +/EGTA buffer the biphasic Ca 2 +-binding affinity of myosin is twice as high at pH 7. 4 (site one: 1. 2 Ã 106 mâ 1 and site two: 0. 4 Ã 106 mâ 1) as compared with values obtained at pH 6. 5 (site one: 0. 64 Ã 106 mâ 1 and site two: 0. 2 Ã 106 mâ 1). The Ca 2 +-binding affinity of light chain LC 2 and S 1, where the (S- 1) â(S- 2) junction was absent, were not influenced by changes in pH values. Both expressed a low Ca 2 +-binding affinity, approx. 0. 7 Ã 104 mâ 1, whereas heavy meromyosin, where both (S- 1) and (S- 2) myosin subfragments were present, expressed a Ca 2 +-binding affinity value similar to that of native myosin, but was not biphasic. However, it is important to point out than in preparation of S 1 myosin subfragment light chain LC 2 was lost and thus was added back to the purified S 1 fraction. Light chain LC 2 was not, however, added to the heavy meromyosin fraction because it was not lost during preparation of the heavy meromyosin subfragment. In conclusion, it appears that the (S- 1) â(S- 2) junction is needed for the positioning of light chain LC 2 and thus influences its essential conformation for Ca 2 + binding...|$|R
