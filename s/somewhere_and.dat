5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from <b>somewhere</b> <b>and</b> dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house <b>somewhere),</b> <b>and</b> all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

25|$|According to legend, Sherab Zangpo and Palden Zangpo were {{performing}} some sacred rituals {{near the}} Yellow Temple.

25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go <b>somewhere</b> <b>and</b> Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation <b>somewhere</b> <b>and</b> of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966.
