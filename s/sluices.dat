5|$|Five sets of <b>sluices</b> and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The <b>sluices,</b> located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver <b>Sluices,</b> are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney <b>Sluices</b> were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The <b>sluices</b> are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver <b>Sluices,</b> accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven <b>Sluices</b> were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven <b>Sluices</b> or Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven <b>Sluices,</b> and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E
5|$|The Basin gates contain many <b>sluices,</b> so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock <b>sluices.</b> In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{multiple}} wh-fronting under <b>Sluicing.</b> Contrary {{to previous}} proposals that an interrogative +wh complementizer licenses TP-ellipsis, I propose that +focus feature licenses this ellipsis operation. Assuming the deletion analysis of <b>sluicing,</b> following Ross (1969), I argue for focus-licensed <b>sluicing</b> {{based on data}} from Slavic languages like Russian and Polish, where it is possible to have focused R-expressions as remnants of <b>sluicing.</b> I demonstrate how semantic restrictions in multiple interrogatives are maintained under <b>sluicing,</b> presenting a new argument for the clausal structure of the <b>sluice.</b> Finally, I explore Superiority effects under <b>sluicing,</b> deriving those from parallelism in variable binding...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sluice</b> (from the Dutch [...] "sluis") is a {{water channel}} {{controlled}} at its head by a gate. A mill race, leet, flume, penstock or lade is a <b>sluice</b> channelling water toward a water mill. The terms <b>sluice,</b> <b>sluice</b> gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably {{in the water}} and wastewater control industry.|$|R
5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills. The channel included <b>sluices</b> to regulate water levels above it, but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow <b>sluices</b> and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow <b>sluices</b> enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver <b>sluices,</b> just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E

40|$|The general goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{properties}} of <b>sluicing</b> (IP-ellipsis) in Russian and to see how the Russian data shed light on the general processes underlying the phenomenon of <b>sluicing.</b> The first issue we will address is what positions wh-remnants occupy in <b>sluicing</b> constructions in Russian, considering the properties of wh-movement in Russian. We will then turn to <b>sluicing</b> with multiple wh-remnants, which I will refer to as multiple <b>sluicing,</b> following Takahashi (1994). Here we will investigate how the interpretative properties of multiple interrogatives in Russian affect the multiple <b>sluicing</b> possibilities in this language. Finally, I will present the data showing that superiority effects emerge under <b>sluicing</b> in Russian. This is unexpected, given that Russian does not exhibit superiority effects in corresponding non-elliptical interrogatives. In addressing the question of what causes superiority effects under <b>sluicing,</b> I will propose an analysis which makes use of an independent property of ellipsis, namely, quantifier parallelism...|$|R
5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and <b>sluices</b> which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this did not happen. Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E
5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and <b>sluices</b> were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Fort Nieulay, {{located along}} the Avenue Roger Salengro {{originally}} dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, <b>sluices</b> gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 {{on the principle}} that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly the site of a low-key scuffle with Germans in May 1940.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{reconstruction of}} the <b>sluice</b> gate was commissioned in 1914 with the canal opening. Instead of the old <b>sluice</b> of 165 m in length and 10 m in breadth a new <b>sluice</b> chamber with a usable length of 190 m and a breadth of 12 m were commissioned, so that bigger ships with lighters (barges) as specified in Euro class II can pass through the <b>sluice</b> gates.|$|R

50|$|Today, {{the rocker}} box {{is not used}} as {{extensively}} as the <b>sluice,</b> but still is an effective method of recovering gold in areas where {{there is not enough}} available water to operate a <b>sluice</b> effectively. Like a <b>sluice</b> box, the rocker box has riffles and a carpet in it to trap the gold. It was designed to be used in areas with less water than a <b>sluice</b> box. The mineral processing involves pouring water out of a small cup and then rocking the small <b>sluice</b> box like a cradle, thus the name rocker box or cradle.|$|R
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville <b>Sluices</b> to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and <b>sluices,</b> and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the <b>sluices</b> (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract‚ÄîThis article {{discusses}} the syntax and LF {{properties of the}} phenomenon of <b>sluicing</b> as ellipsis of the sentential complement to an interrogative complementizer hosting a wh-phrase in Persian. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore <b>sluicing</b> in Persian as a real wh-in-situe language that displays optional wh-movement, with a special focus on multiple <b>sluicing.</b> Built on focus movement analysis rather than wh-movement, we examined the movement-plus-deletion approach and the role of focus fronting in moving the remnant out of the deleted constituent in Persian <b>sluicing</b> to a position where it can be stranded. Finally, we also looked into possibility of non-interrogative <b>sluicing</b> and non-d-linked wh words and briefly put forward our proposition about wh the hell phrases in Persian.

5|$|After its closure the {{pumping station}} lay {{derelict}} {{until the late}} 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the pumping station to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the <b>sluices</b> and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The pumping station was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} changes from the 1370s onwards was the {{adaptation}} of the town walls to mount gunpowder weapons. At this time cannon were still unreliable, only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports. Cannons fired stone cannonballs, which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls, and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications {{rather than as an}} offensive weapon by besiegers. The first gunports in Britain were installed in the 1360s on the Isle of Wight, but Southampton was not far behind. Around 1378 to 1379 the ongoing French threat led to gunports for handguns being built into the western Arcade wall, and by 1382 the town bought its own gun. God's House Tower was built to defend the southern quays around 1417 and the <b>sluices</b> that controlled the level of the town's moats, and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points, and by 1439 Catchcold tower had also been constructed, again designed to accommodate gunpowder weapons.|$|E
5|$|The major {{trade was}} salt. The {{arrival of the}} Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was {{detrimental}} to the salt trade at first, but ultimately beneficial, as salt was tipped down chutes from the canal into barges on the river navigation. Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal, which provided a link to Weston Point, where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide, as the water was deeper. The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900, with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks, capable of handling 1000-tonne coasters. With {{the opening of the}} Manchester Ship Canal, a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point. All water from the river entered the canal nearby, and any surplus was released into the Mersey through the Weaver <b>sluices,</b> which were located just upstream of the junction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to current {{advances in the}} cross-linguistic variation of syntactic contexts that allow <b>sluicing.</b> We investigate a relatively rare <b>sluicing</b> strategy: TP-ellipsis inside relative clauses.

5000|$|The Little <b>Sluice,</b> {{also known}} as the <b>Sluice</b> Box or simply as [...] "The Box", is close to Spider Lake. It is the most {{difficult}} section of the trail, and as such can be bypassed in two ways for vehicles that cannot ascend the main trail. The most common bypass route is {{to the left of the}} obstacle known as the long bypass. The second way to bypass the Little <b>Sluice</b> is to drive up Toyota Rock. Toyota Rock is to the right toward Spider Lake (so named because it resembles a spider from above), just before the large rocks in the Little <b>Sluice,</b> and leads to the slabs that surround Little <b>Sluice.</b> The large rocks in the Little <b>Sluice</b> were reduced in size in the fall of 2012 by El Dorado County in order to reduce concentrated camping and the [...] "spectator" [...] atmosphere at the <b>Sluice.</b> The section is still difficult, but difficulty has been reduced.|$|R

5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from ¬£981 in 1858 to ¬£168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from ¬£40 to ¬£10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct <b>sluices</b> if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea sluice at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669. The financial burden on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay rent on all land that was not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven <b>Sluices.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the North, the {{commander}} of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike {{because of a lack}} of ships. This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position, which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel, which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained. The main fortifications contained 47mm antitank-guns. Long channel piers projected in front of and behind the <b>sluices,</b> on both the right and left; on these, pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam, which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker. On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20mm anti aircraft battery. It had been Feldt's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten. Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex under cover of an artillery bombardment, but soon fled after being fired upon; the first was pinned down and could only retreat under cover of darkness, leaving behind some dead.|$|E
