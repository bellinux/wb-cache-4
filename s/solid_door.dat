60|$|By {{this time}} we were quite {{prepared}} for their visit. The two dwelling-houses for ourselves and the men were completed, so also was the store for our goods.

6000|$|It was Mother Sowler. The horrible {{woman was}} {{tramping}} {{round and round}} {{in the middle of}} the kitchen, like a beast in a cage; raving in the dreadful drink-madness called delirium tremens. In the farthest corner of the room, barricaded behind the table, the landlord's wife and daughter crouched in terror of their lives. The gas, turned full on, blazed high enough to blacken the ceiling, and showed the heavy bolts shot at the top and bottom of the <b>solid</b> <b>door.</b> Nothing less than a battering-ram could have burst that door in from the outer side; an hour's work with the file would have failed to break a passage through the bars over the window. [...] "How did she get there?" [...] the sergeant asked. [...] "Run downstairs, and bolted herself in, while the missus and the young 'un were cooking"--was the answering cry from the people in the yard. As they spoke, another vain attempt was made to break in the door from the passage. The noise of the heavy blows redoubled the frenzy of the terrible creature in the kitchen, still tramping round and round under the blazing gaslight. Suddenly, she made a dart at the window, and confronted the men looking in from the yard. Her staring eyes were bloodshot; a purple-red flush was over her face; her hair waved wildly about her, torn away in places by her own hands. [...] "Cats!" [...] she screamed, glaring out of the window, [...] "millions of cats! all their months wide open spitting at me! Fire! fire to scare away the cats!" [...] She searched furiously in her pocket, and tore out a handful of loose papers. One of them escaped, and fluttered downward to a wooden press under the window. Amelius was nearest, and saw it plainly as it fell, [...] "Good heavens!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "it's a bank-note!" [...] "Wall-Eyes' money!" [...] shouted the thieves in the yard; [...] "She's going to burn Wall-Eyes' money!" [...] The madwoman turned back to the middle of the kitchen, leapt up at the gas-burner, and set fire to the bank-notes. She scattered them flaming all round her on the kitchen floor. [...] "Away with you!" [...] she shouted, shaking her fists at the visionary multitude of cats. [...] "Away with you, up the chimney! Away with you, out of the window!" [...] She sprang back to the window, with her crooked fingers twisted in her hair! [...] "The snakes!" [...] she shrieked; [...] "the snakes are hissing again in my hair! the beetles are crawling over my face!" [...] She tore at her hair; she scraped her face with long black nails that lacerated the flesh. Amelius turned away, unable to endure the sight of her. Morcross took his place, eyed her steadily for a moment, and saw the way to end it. [...] "A quarter of gin!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Quick! before she leaves the window!" [...] In a minute he had the pewter measure in his hand, and tapped at the window. [...] "Gin, Mother Sowler! Break the window, and have a drop of gin!" [...] For a moment, the drunkard mastered her own dreadful visions at the sight of the liquor. She broke a pane of glass with her clenched fist. [...] "The door!" [...] cried Morcross, to the panic-stricken women, barricaded behind the table. [...] "The door!" [...] he reiterated, as he handed the gin in through the bars. The elder woman was too terrified to understand him; her bolder daughter crawled under the table, rushed across the kitchen, and drew the bolts. As the madwoman turned to attack her, the room was filled with men, headed by the sergeant. Three of them were barely enough to control the frantic wretch, and bind her hand and foot. When Amelius entered the kitchen, after she had been conveyed to the hospital, a five-pound note on the press (secured by one of the police), and a few frail black ashes scattered thinly on the kitchen floor, were the only relics left of the ill-gotten money.|$|E

5000|$|Air {{curtains}} consume {{electrical energy}} during their operation, {{but can be}} used for net energy savings by reducing the heat transfer (via mass transfer when air mixes across the threshold) between two spaces.

5000|$|The K-tool {{can be used}} on most {{styles of}} door, {{although}} it is often faster to use the [...] (combination of an axe and halligan tool) or a hydraulic ram on a <b>solid</b> <b>door.</b> The benefit of a K-tool comes where it is impractical or dangerous to break the door, for example, the large plate-glass doors in front of a commercial building will quickly yield to a well-placed blow from an axe, but may send fragments of glass flying, and will result in a pile of broken glass. The K-tool can be used to pull the core from the lock without damaging the door itself. The K-tool is also useful during investigations where no fire is readily evident. The core can be pulled from a lock, which can often be repaired at lower cost than replacing a door and jamb damaged by other, more energetic entry methods.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} made hollow wood structures are hollow core doors. Hollow core doors are much lighter than <b>solid</b> wood <b>doors,</b> cheaper and are easier to install.

Also, hollow core doors should not be used as doors to the outside because they can more easily be broken open by robbers. <b>Solid</b> wood <b>doors</b> are slightly more fire resistant because the fire has to burn through more material, however, using a steel door will increase fire resistance by a much larger margin.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} concept {{called for}} the bleachers to simply extend out over the sidewalks, supported by open steel columns in cantilevered design, connecting new steel to the existing steel that supported the old bleachers. That plan was altered somewhat when it was feared the area would become an impromptu homeless shelter. Thus the vertical part of the supporting structure for the new bleachers was encased in a wall constructed of new bricks, in a style reminiscent of the original wall, and the sidewalk (repaved in brick) became a few feet narrower. The only part hanging over the sidewalk is the flat walkway behind the bleachers. The {{upper part of the}} formerly vacant center field area is occupied by a large luxury suite, fronted by darkened, slanted windows so as not to interfere with the batters' sight lines, and the lower part by juniper plants that had been temporarily removed. Another notable change to the configuration was to replace the <b>solid</b> <b>door</b> in the right field corner with a chain-link fence gate, so passers-by can see part of the ballfield (an idea borrowed from AT&T Park).|$|E
