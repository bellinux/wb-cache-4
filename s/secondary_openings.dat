40|$|Bibliography: pages [121]- 125. Groundwater {{contamination}} {{caused by}} improper disposal of {{hazardous industrial waste}} has become a serious problem in the United States. The Byron-Johnson Salvage is an EPA Superfund Site in north-central Illinois where contamination of a shallow fractured dolomite aquifer has occurred. In this study, the hydrogeology and hydraulic characteristics of this aquifer were investigated to help understand contaminant migration paths and evaluate aquifer remediation potential. Water-level measurements taken across the study area indicate that regional groundwater flow patterns are partly controlled by topography and related fracture zones. However, water levels measured in closely spaced wells and piezometer nests suggest that a laterally variable zone of competent dolomite restricts vertical groundwater flow southeast of the site, resulting in steep, irregular water-table gradients at the salvage yard. Slug test analyses indicate lithologic/stratigraphic controls on permeability distribution within the dolomite, but also suggest that fracture interconnection, regardless of stratigraphic position, ultimately controls aquifer permeability. Analysis of core samples indicates that lithologic controls on permeability distribution are mainly due to preferential dissolution along fractures and other <b>secondary</b> <b>openings.</b> The cone of water-table depression during an aquifer pumping test conducted at the site was elliptical, with {{the direction of the}} major axis being nearly identical to the major orientation of faults and fractures measured in the area. This strongly suggests a structural control on aquifer anisotropy, and that contaminants may be transported from the site preferentially along systems of interconnected fractures. Quantitative aquifer-test analysis using the Boulton Streltsova- Adams (1978) double-porosity model for unconfined aquifers indicates that transmissivity along the major axis of the drawdown ellipse is approximately 660 ft/day, while transmissivity along the minor axis is approximately 480 ft/day.

Based on pathology, the rectal cancer was diagnosed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and this adenocarcinoma had lymph node metastasis (yp T 3 N 2 aM 1 b). There was no communication between the rectal lesion and the anal fistula, and a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma resembling the rectal lesion was noted in the anal fistula. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that both the rectal lesion and anal fistula were cytokeratin 7 (CK 7) (−) and cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) (+), and the patient’s condition was diagnosed as implantation of rectal cancer in an anal fistula.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a model-based nonlinear feed-back controller designed {{to regulate the}} crank angle at 50 % fuel burned (50) for a gasoline homogeneous charge compression ignition engine model during load transitions. The regulation of the combustion timing is based on manipulating the charge temperature through internal dilution, {{which is achieved by}} controlling the lift of a <b>secondary</b> <b>opening</b> of the exhaust valve, also known as the rebreathing lift. The nonlinear feedback con-troller developed is based on a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function using a simplified control model which contains only the cycle-to-cycle temperature dynamics. The nonlinear feedback controller depends on measurement of the combustion timing 50 and estimation of the temperature at intake valve closing. Closed-loop simulation of the full-order engine model shows that the nonlinear feedback controller, along with a nonlinear observer, is able to regulate the combustion timing 50 by stabilizing the temperature dynamics during load transitions. The closed-loop system with the observer-based feedback controller is shown to be robust to some classes of model uncertainty and measurement noise through simulation and an estimate of the region of attraction.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} acellular dermal matrix (ADM) bioprosthetic material and endorectal advancement flap (ERAF) in treatment of complex anorectal fistula. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with complex anorectal fistulae admitted to Anorectal Surgical Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University from March 2008 to July 2009, were enrolled in this study. Complex anorectal fistula was diagnosed following its clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic diagnostic criteria. Under spinal anesthesia, patients underwent identification and irrigation of the fistula tracts using hydrogen peroxide. ADM was securely sutured at the <b>secondary</b> <b>opening</b> to the primary opening using absorbable suture. Outcomes of ADM and ERAF closure were compared in terms of success rate, fecal incontinence rate, anorectal deformity rate, postoperative pain time, closure time and life quality score. Success was defined as closure of all external openings, absence of drainage without further intervention, and absence of abscess formation. Follow-up examination was performed 2 d, 2, 4, 6, 12 wk, and 5 mo after surgery, respectively. RESULTS: No patient was lost to follow-up. The overall success rate was 82. 22 % (37 / 45) 5. 7 mo after surgery. ADM dislodgement occured in 5 patients (11. 11 %), abscess formation was found in 1 patient, and fistula recurred in 2 patients. Of the 13 patients with recurrent fistula using ERAF, 5 (11. 11 %) received surgical drainage because of abscess formation. The success rate, postoperative pain time and closure time of ADM {{were significantly higher than}} those of ERAF (P < 0. 05). However, no difference was observed in fecal incontinence rate and anorectal deformity rate after treatment with ADM and ERAF. CONCLUSION: Closure of fistula tract opening with ADM is an effective procedure for complex anorectal fistula.

40|$|AbstractThe Receptor Tyrosine kinase (RTK) and TGF-β {{signaling}} pathways play essential roles during {{development in}} many organisms and regulate {{a plethora of}} cellular responses. From the genome sequence of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, we have made an inventory of the genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, and of the genes encoding cytokines of the TGF-β superfamily and their downstream components. The sea urchin genome contains at least 20 genes coding for canonical receptor tyrosine kinases. Seventeen of the nineteen vertebrate RTK families are represented in the sea urchin. Fourteen of these RTK among which ALK, CCK 4 /PTK 7, DDR, EGFR, EPH, LMR, MET/RON, MUSK, RET, ROR, ROS, RYK, TIE and TRK are present as single copy genes while pairs of related genes are present for VEGFR, FGFR and INSR. Similarly, nearly all the subfamilies of TGF-β ligands identified in vertebrates {{are present in the}} sea urchin genome including the BMP, ADMP, GDF, Activin, Myostatin, Nodal and Lefty, as well as the TGF-β sensu stricto that had not been characterized in invertebrates so far. Expression analysis indicates that the early expression of nodal, BMP 2 / 4 and lefty is restricted to the oral ectoderm reflecting their role in providing positional information along the oral–aboral axis of the embryo. The coincidence between the emergence of TGF-β-related factors such as Nodal and Lefty and the emergence of the deuterostome lineage strongly suggests that the ancestral function of Nodal could have been related to the <b>secondary</b> <b>opening</b> of the mouth which characterizes this clade, a hypothesis supported by functional data in the extant species. The sea urchin genome contains 6 genes encoding TGF-β receptors and 4 genes encoding prototypical Smad proteins. Furthermore, most of the transcriptional activators and repressors shown to interact with Smads in vertebrates have orthologues in echinoderms. Finally, the sea urchin genome contains an almost complete repertoire of genes encoding extracellular modulators of BMP signaling including Chordin, Noggin, Sclerotin, SFRP, Gremlin, DAN and Twisted gastrulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the sea urchin complement of genes of the RTK and TGF-β signaling pathways is qualitatively very similar to the repertoire present in vertebrates, and that these genes are part of the common genetool kit for intercellular signaling of deuterostomes...|$|R
