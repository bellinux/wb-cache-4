A flare from the volcano had cast a red light over the bewildering scene, and {{revealed}} {{the fact that the}} brig was no longer above the ocean's bed, but was passing in its wild career right through, or rather over, the demolished town of Anjer. A few of the houses that had been left standing by the previous waves were being swept--hurled--away by this one, but the mass of rolling, rushing, spouting water was so deep, that the vessel had as yet <b>struck</b> <b>nothing</b> save the tops of some palm-trees which bent their heads like straws before the flood.|$|E

Dampier and one or two of the others declared their certainty that there was ice near them, but, at least, they could not see it, though there was now no doubt about the crackling beneath the schooner's side. It was a somewhat anxious night for most of them, but a breeze that drove the haze aside got up with the sun, and Dampier expected to reach the creek before darkness fell.|$|E

60|$|All {{the tents}} were <b>struck,</b> but <b>nothing</b> else could be done, {{and to the}} deep disgust of all--officers and men--their {{property}} was left to the mercies of the enemy. During the night it was all looted and burnt. Many of the officers thus lost every stitch of clothing they possessed. The flames rising {{from the scene of}} destruction were visible far and wide, and the tribesmen in the most distant valleys were encouraged to hurry to complete the slaughter of the accursed infidels.|$|R
60|$|The shanty was cheerfully lighted and cosily warm. Nasmyth {{had slept}} soundly {{there on the}} springy spruce-twigs, and {{there was at least}} {{abundance}} when the mealtimes came round. Now he was about to be cast adrift again to face a three days' march in the open, under the bitter frost, and what might await him {{at the end of it}} he did not know. At length, the meal was cleared away, and when the pipes were lighted, he told his comrades that he was going. They were not demonstrative in their expressions of regret, but they thrust upon him little plugs of tobacco, which could not well be replaced there, and several of them told him that, if he <b>struck</b> <b>nothing</b> he liked better, all he had to do was to present himself at this ranch or the other beside blue lake or frothing river when they went back in the spring. What was more to the purpose, they meant it.|$|E

Hate is very strong, but cunning hath a longer arm.

Conanchet was then a boy. His hand had <b>struck</b> <b>nothing</b> but deer. His heart was full of wishes. By day he thought of Pequot scalps, at night he heard the dying words of Miantonimoh. Though slain by cowardly Pequots and lying Yengeese, his father came with the night into his wigwam, to talk to his son. 'Does the child of so many great Sachems grow big?' would he say; 'is his arm getting strong, his foot light, his eye quick, his heart valiant? Will Conanchet be like his fathers?--when will the young Sachem of the Narragansetts become a man?' Why should I tell my brother of these visits? Metacom hath often seen the long line of Wampanoag Chiefs, in his sleep? The brave Sachems sometimes enter into the heart of their son?" ...|$|E

Dampier and one or two of the men declared their certainty that there was ice near them, but, at least, they could not see it, though there was now no doubt about the crackling beneath the schooner's side. It was an anxious night for most of the crew, but a breeze that drove the haze aside got up with the sun, and Dampier expected to reach the creek before darkness fell. He might have succeeded but for the glistening streak on the horizon, which presently crept in on them, and resolved itself into detached gray-white masses, with openings of various sizes in and out between them. The breeze was freshening, and the Selache was going through it at some six knots, when Dampier came aft to Wyllard, who was standing at the wheel. There was a moderately wide opening in the floating barrier close ahead of him. The rest of the crew stood silent watching the skipper, for they were by this time more or less acquainted with Wyllard's temperament.|$|E
6000|$|Gregory {{stood by}} the empty hearth and waited, and while he waited, <b>nothing</b> <b>struck</b> him at all, for the Stoics seemed very natural, just mere men like himself, except that their clothes were better, which made him think: 'I shouldn't care to belong here and have to dress for dinner every night.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} been reading, in Mr. Hazlitt's translation, Montaigne's account of his journey into Italy, and am <b>struck</b> with <b>nothing</b> more agreeably than the self-respecting fashions of the time. His arrival in each place, {{the arrival of a}} gentleman of France, is an event of some consequence. Wherever he goes he pays a visit to {{whatever}} prince or gentleman of note resides upon his road, as a duty to himself and to civilization. When he leaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks, he causes his arms to be painted and hung up as a perpetual sign to the house, as was the custom of gentlemen.|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} he was <b>struck</b> violently. By <b>nothing!</b> A vast weight, it seemed, leapt upon him, and he was hurled headlong down the staircase, with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin. An invisible foot trod on his back, a ghostly patter passed downstairs, he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run, and {{the front door of}} the house slammed violently.|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner was}} at the Town Hall, and the rooms and the whole affair {{were all in the}} most splendid style. <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me more than the footmen in the city livery. They really looked more {{magnificent}} in their gold-lace and breeches and white silk stockings than any officers of state. The rooms were beautiful; gorgeously painted and gilded, gorgeously lighted, gorgeously hung with paintings,--the plate was gorgeous, and the dinner gorgeous in the English fashion.|$|R

I was fulfilling the object of our existence by enlarging on a remark of Guy's, that <b>nothing</b> <b>struck</b> him more than {{the way in which}} Philip could adapt his conversation to the hearers.

6000|$|There {{are public}} gardens (one, at least) in Geneva. [...] . <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me so much, I think, as {{the color of}} the Rhone, as it flows under the bridges in the lower town. It is {{absolutely}} miraculous, and, beautiful as it is, suggests the idea that the tubs of a thousand dyers have emptied their liquid indigo into the stream. When once you have conquered and thrust out this idea, it is an inexpressible delight to look down into this intense, brightly transparent blue, that hurries beneath you with the speed of a race-horse.|$|R
50|$|In his {{interview}} Mohammed Rahim {{said that when}} Mohammed Omar's home in Kandahar {{was hit by a}} missile strike he engaged him to drive his taxi, containing Mohammed Omar, his second wife, and several of his children to Sangisar, an hour away.Almost immediately after their arrival, and exit from his taxi, it too was struck by a missile.

Mohammed Rahim said he fled one way, and Mohammed Omar fled another, and that this was his last contact with him.|$|R
60|$|And perhaps <b>nothing</b> <b>struck</b> into me such {{a feeling}} of wild romance, as {{a view of the}} first vessel we spoke. It was of a clear sunny afternoon, and she came bearing down upon us, a most {{beautiful}} sight, with all her sails spread wide. She came very near, and passed under our stern; and as she leaned over to the breeze, showed her decks fore and aft; and I saw the strange sailors grouped upon the forecastle, and the cook look-cook-house with a ladle in his hand, and the captain in a green jacket sitting on the taffrail with a speaking-trumpet.|$|R
6000|$|Once more I felt, what I {{had felt}} already, {{that there were}} hidden {{reserves}} of strength {{in the character of}} this innocent young fellow, which had utterly escaped my superficial observation of him. In choosing his vocation, he was, no doubt, only following the conventional modern course in such cases. Despair has its fashions, as well as dress. Ancient despair (especially of Oscar's sort) used to turn soldier, or go into a monastery. Modern despair turns nurse; binds up wounds, gives physic, and gets cured or not in that useful but nasty way. Oscar had certainly <b>struck</b> out <b>nothing</b> new for himself: he had only followed the fashion. Still, it implied, as I thought, both courage and resolution to have conquered the obstacles which he must have overcome, and to have held steadily on his course after he had once entered it. Having begun by quarreling with him, I was in a fair way to end by respecting him. Surely this man was worth preserving for Lucilla, after all! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. The proprietors had {{absolutely}} despaired of being paid, at any time, any proportion, of their demand, until {{the change of}} that ministry. The merchants were checked and discountenanced; they had often been told, by some in authority, of the cheap rate at which these Canada bills had been procured; yet the author can talk of the composition {{of them as a}} necessity induced by the change in administration. They found themselves indeed, before that change, under a necessity of hinting somewhat of bringing the matter into Parliament; but they were soon silenced, and put in mind of the fate which the Newfoundland business had there met with. <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> them more than the strong contrast between the spirit, and method of proceeding, of the two administrations.|$|R
60|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me more in Burlington, {{than the}} {{great number of}} Irish emigrants. They have filled the British Provinces to the brim, and still {{continue}} to ascend the St. Lawrence in infinite tribes overflowing by every outlet into the States. At Burlington, they swarm in huts and mean dwellings near the lake, lounge about the wharves, and elbow the native citizens entirely out of competition in their own line. Every species of mere bodily labor is the prerogative of these Irish. Such is their multitude in comparison with any possible demand for their services, {{that it is difficult}} to conceive how a third part of them should earn even a daily glass of whiskey, which is doubtless their first necessary of life,--daily bread being only the second.|$|R
60|$|But <b>nothing</b> <b>struck</b> {{him so much}} as the {{appearance}} of the people. In size they were almost giants, a peculiarity which was shared by the women, some of whom measured six feet in height. In common with other uncivilised races most of these women were little except a girdle and a goat-skin cloak that hung loosely upon their shoulders, displaying their magnificent proportions somewhat freely. They were much handsomer than the men, having splendid solemn eyes, very white teeth, and a remarkable dignity of gait. Their faces, however, wore the same sombre look as those of their husbands and brothers, and they did not chatter after the manner of their sex, but contented themselves with pointing out the peculiarities of the strangers in a few brief words to their children or to one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, is it?" [...] he said, tugging wildly at his bit of string; [...] "is it {{nonsense}} {{to affirm}} {{that if a}} man {{wants to make sure}} that his victim shall not escape, he does not usually wind rope 'loosely' round his figure, nor does he throw a wool shawl lightly round his mouth. The police were idiotic beyond words; they themselves discovered that Morton was so 'loosely' fastened to his chair that very little movement would have disentangled him, and yet it never <b>struck</b> them that <b>nothing</b> was easier for that particular type of scoundrel to sit down in an arm-chair and wind a few yards of rope round himself, then, having wrapped a wool shawl round his throat, to slip his two arms inside the ropes." ...|$|R
60|$|Eleven o'clock <b>struck</b> {{and still}} <b>nothing</b> happened. A rumour got about, among the crowd, that the {{criminal}} would not confess; in which case, the priests {{would keep him}} until the Ave Maria (sunset); for it is their merciful custom never finally to turn the crucifix away from a man at that pass, as one refusing to be shriven, and consequently a sinner abandoned of the Saviour, until then. People began to drop off. The officers shrugged their shoulders and looked doubtful. The dragoons, who came riding up below our window, every now and then, to order an unlucky hackney- coach or cart away, {{as soon as it}} had comfortably established itself, and was covered with exulting people (but never before), became imperious, and quick-tempered. The bald place hadn't a straggling hair upon it; and the corpulent officer, crowning the perspective, took a world of snuff.|$|R
6000|$|Nine o'clock struck, and {{ten o'clock}} <b>struck,</b> and <b>nothing</b> happened. All the bells {{of all the}} churches rang as usual. A little {{parliament}} of dogs assembled in the open space, and chased each other, in and out among the soldiers. Fierce-looking Romans of the lowest class, in blue cloaks, russet cloaks, and rags uncloaked, came and went, and talked together. Women and children fluttered, on the skirts of the scanty crowd. One large muddy spot was left quite bare, like a bald place on a man's head. A cigar-merchant, with an earthen pot of charcoal ashes in one hand, {{went up and down}}, crying his wares. A pastry-merchant divided his attention between the scaffold and his customers. Boys tried to climb up walls, and tumbled down again. Priests and monks elbowed a passage for themselves among the people, and stood on tiptoe for a sight of the knife: then went away. Artists, in inconceivable hats of the middle-ages, and beards (thank Heaven!) of no age at all, flashed picturesque scowls about them from their stations in the throng. One gentleman (connected with the fine arts, I presume) went up and down in a pair of Hessian-boots, with a red beard hanging down on his breast, and his long and bright red hair, plaited into two tails, one on either side of his head, which fell over his shoulders in front of him, very nearly to his waist, and were carefully entwined and braided! ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the amount}} of food which a man can get off this little patch I dare not guess. Well says Humboldt, that an European lately arrived in the torrid zone is <b>struck</b> with <b>nothing</b> so much as the extreme {{smallness}} of the spots under cultivation round a cabin which contains a numerous family. The plantains alone ought, according to Humboldt, to give one hundred and thirty-three times as much food as the same space of ground sown with wheat, and forty-four times as much as if it grew potatoes. True, the plantain is by no means as nourishing as wheat: which reduces the actual difference between their value per acre to twenty-five to one. But under his plantains he can grow other vegetables. He has no winter, and therefore some crop or other is always coming forward. From whence it comes, that, as I just hinted, his wife and children seem to have always something to eat in their mouths, if it be only the berries and nuts which abound in every hedge and wood. Neither dare I guess at the profit which he might make, and I hope will some day make, out of his land, if he would cultivate somewhat more for exportation, and not merely for home consumption. If any one wishes to know more on this matter, let him consult the catalogue of contributions from British Guiana to the London Exhibition of 1862; especially the pages from lix. to lxviii. on the starch-producing plants of the West Indies.|$|R
60|$|I did perceive. At {{the time}} the amazing {{thoroughness}} with which she {{had gone into the}} subject of my own unimportant affairs, the astuteness and knowledge of the world she had shown, and the clearness with which she had put the situation, did not strike me. <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me but the alarming sense of my own stupidity, which was as keen as I have ever felt it. What man in a public position, however humble, has not political enemies? The image of O'Meara was wafted suddenly before me, disagreeably near, and his face wore the smile of victory. All of Mr. Cooke's money could not save me. My spirits sank as the immediate future unfolded itself, and I even read the article in O'Meara's organ, the Northern Lights, which was to be instrumental in divesting me of my public trust and fair fame generally. Yes, if the Celebrity was caught {{on the other side of}} Far Harbor, all would be up with John Crocker! But it would never do to let Miss Thorn discover my discomfiture.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Versailles, however, Rupert was <b>struck</b> with wonder. <b>Nothing</b> {{that he had}} seen could compare with the stately glories of Versailles, which was then the real capital of France. A wing of the magnificent palace was set apart for the reception of the nobles and military men whose business brought them for short periods to the court, and here apartments had been assigned to the marquis. The clothes had already been sent down by mounted lackeys, and Rupert was soon in full uniform again, the cuirass alone being laid aside. The laced scarlet coat, and the other items of attire, were strictly in accordance with the somewhat lax regulations as to the dress of an officer of dragoons; but the lace cravat falling in front, and the dress lace ruffles of the wrists, were certainly more ample than the Duke of Marlborough might have considered fit for strict regimental attire. But indeed there was little rule as to dress in those early days of a regular British army.|$|R
60|$|We {{intended}} {{to go to}} the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal Palace first--a building which necessarily figures largely in Venetian poetry and tradition. In the Senate Chamber of the ancient Republic we wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, but <b>nothing</b> <b>struck</b> us forcibly except the one thing that strikes all strangers forcibly--a black square {{in the midst of a}} gallery of portraits. In one long row, around the great hall, were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows, with flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to the office, the oldest was usually chosen Doge,) and each had its complimentary inscription attached--till you came to the place that should have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and black--blank, except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the conspirator had died for his crime. It seemed cruel to keep that pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy wretch had been in his grave five hundred years.|$|R

5000|$|The men, {{believing that}} Jensag {{is playing a}} trick on them, listen, but hear him calling [...] "Agnes! Agnes!" [...] from far away; he {{does not seem to}} be near the wreck. The men again row out to the wreck to investigate, but find no explanation. Cargunka asks the mate to ring the ship's bell at half past twelve, and rows out quietly to wait and watch the wreck. As Jensag is heard in the {{distance}} singing [...] "And the sound of her bells came back to me," [...] the half past twelve bell about the Happy Return rings, and again is echoed by the bell of the Laughing Sally, even though the bell is now underwater. Cargunka feels the bell underwater to see if he can determine how it was <b>struck,</b> but finds <b>nothing.</b> Upon returning to the island, Durritt, the bo'sun, tells Cargunka that the sound is a [...] "dead man's bell," [...] and that [...] "no good'll come messin 'round wiv that!"

60|$|On {{our return}} {{down the river}} we passed La Crosse, at which we had embarked, and went down as far as Dubuque in Iowa. On our way down we came to grief and broke one of our paddle-wheels to pieces. We had no special accident. We <b>struck</b> against <b>nothing</b> above or below water. But the wheel went to pieces, and we laid to on the river side for {{the greater part of}} a day while the {{necessary}} repairs were being made. Delay in traveling is usually an annoyance, because it causes the unsettlement of a settled purpose. But the loss of the day did us no harm, and our accident had happened at a very pretty spot. I climbed {{up to the top of}} the nearest bluff, and walked back till I came to the open country, and also went up and down the river banks, visiting the cabins of two settlers who live there by supplying wood to the river steamers. One of these was close to the spot at which we were lying; and yet though most of our passengers came on shore, I was the only one who spoke to the inmates of the cabin. These people must live there almost in desolation from one year's end to another. Once in a fortnight or so they go up to a market town in their small boats, but beyond that they can have little intercourse with their fellow-creatures. Nevertheless none of these dwellers by the river side came out to speak to the men and women who were lounging about from eleven in the morning till four in the afternoon; nor did one of the passengers, except myself, knock at the door or enter the cabin, or exchange a word with those who lived there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you want}} to see the loveliest woman in Europe?' said the officer. 'Ah! you sly rogue, I see THAT will {{influence}} you;' and, truth to say, such a proposal WAS always welcome to me, as I don't care to own. 'The people are great farmers,' said the Captain, 'as well as innkeepers;' and, indeed, the place seemed more a farm than an inn yard. We entered by a great gate into a Court walled round, and at one end of which was the building, a dingy ruinous place. A couple of covered waggens were in the court, their horses were littered under a shed hard by, and lounging about the place were some men and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touched their hats to my friend the Captain. This customary formality <b>struck</b> me as <b>nothing</b> extraordinary, but the aspect of the inn had something exceedingly chilling and forbidding in it, and I observed the men shut to the great yard-gates as soon as we were entered. Parties of French horsemen, the Captain said, were about the country, and one could not take too many precautions against such villains.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Doctor Sandwith,--Since {{my return}} from Paris I have {{frequently}} spoken to my brother, the Marquis of St. Caux, respecting {{the difference of}} education between your English boys and our own. <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me more when I was in London than your great schools. With us the children of good families are almost always brought up at home. They learn to dance and to fence, but have no other exercise for their limbs, and they lack the air of manly independence which struck me in English boys. They are more gentil--I {{do not know the}} word in your language which expresses it--they carry themselves better; they are not so rough; they are more polite. There are advantages in both systems, but for myself I like yours much the best. My brother is, to some extent, a convert to my view. There are no such schools to which he could send his sons in France, for what large schools we have are under the management of the fathers, and the boys have none of that freedom which is the distinguishing point of the English system of education. Even if there were such schools, I am sure that madame my sister-in-law would never hear of her sons being sent there.|$|R
60|$|I {{started for}} the States in August and {{returned}} in the following May. The war was raging {{during the time that}} I was there, and the country was full of soldiers. A part of the time I spent in Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, among the troops, along the line of attack. I visited all the States (excepting California) which had not then seceded,--failing to make my way into the seceding States unless I was prepared to visit them with an amount of discomfort I did not choose to endure. I worked very hard at the task I had assigned to myself, and did, I think, see much of the manners and institutions of the people. <b>Nothing</b> <b>struck</b> me more than their persistence in the ordinary pursuits of life in spite of the war which was around them. Neither industry nor amusement seemed to meet with any check. Schools, hospitals, and institutes were by no means neglected because new regiments were daily required. The truth, I take it, is that we, all of us, soon adapt ourselves to the circumstances around us. Though three parts of London were in flames I should no doubt expect to have my dinner served to me if I lived in the quarter which was free from fire.|$|R
