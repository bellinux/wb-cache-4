5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the Central section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> {{was frequently}} enormous and a daunting logistical task to transport. Re-assembly also depended heavily upon {{the availability of}} skilled labour at the customer’s premises. However, {{as in the case}} of the Chauncy Maples, this was frequently the only viable option when the ultimate destination was very far inland, away from any semblance of modern communications.|$|E
25|$|Symphony No. 2, Op. 19 is a three-movement {{work for}} {{orchestra}} by American composer Samuel Barber. The 25-minute work was originally written in 1944. The work underwent many revisions and was finally published in 1950. The original manuscript was withdrawn by Barber in 1964. He ordered that G. Schirmer destroy the original manuscript and all scores in their library. The work remained unpublished {{for many years}} until 1984 when a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> turned up in a warehouse in England. Renewed interest in Barber's work led to a 1990 reprint of the 1950 edition.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} challenge changes each year, and {{the teams}} can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh at most , without batteries and bumpers. The kit issued to each team contains a base <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> Registration and the {{kit of parts}} together cost about US$6,000. In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when that Saturday falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} a duet, followed {{by a series of}} alternating recitatives and arias and concluded by a chorale. Similar to several other cantatas on words by Franck, it is scored for a small ensemble: four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc) including bassoon (Fg). A choir is only needed for the chorale, if at all. The score, partly an autograph, is titled [...] "Concerto. / Dominica post Trinit: / Brmhertziges Hertze der ewigen Liebe. ect. / â 5 Strom. 4 Voci / Tromba / 1 Hautb 2 Violini. 1 Viola. / Violoncello / è Fagotto.

500|$|At the Southern Railway’s January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it {{was decided}} to use outside {{contractors}} to build the Kclass, Maunsell received authority to retain one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on Nclass No.822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the [...] driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the Kclass. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. [...] This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with [...] bore (compared to the [...] cylinders of the Kclass), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder [...] "K1" [...] was narrower than the Kclass and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No.822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by [...] above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive.|$|E

2500|$|Buddhism {{posits that}} there is no inherent, unchanging {{identity}} (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{publisher of}} Mussorgsky's piano suite, W. Bessel & Co. rushed {{to produce an}} orchestral version of its own after Ravel's proved popular. The publisher had passed on the opportunity to publish Ravel's arrangement, seeing no great commercial advantage in printing a score and <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> for large orchestra; it had granted Koussevitzky permission to commission the setting and publish the score himself {{on the condition that}} no one else be allowed to perform it. Bessel turned to a Ravel student, 21-year-old Russian-born pianist Leonidas Leonardi (1901–1967), a.k.a. Leon Leonardi or Leonid Leonardi, to create an orchestral version that could meet the now burgeoning demand and help the publisher regain some of its lost advantage. Leonardi's orchestration requires even larger forces than the version made by his mentor. The young pianist dedicated his setting of the suite to Igor Stravinsky and conducted the premiere in Paris with the Lamoureux Orchestra on 15 June 1924. The US premiere took place on 4 December 1924 when the New York Symphony Orchestra performed it under the baton of Walter Damrosch. Regardless, Leonardi's orchestration was soon eclipsed by Ravel's, and today only the third Promenade and [...] "Tuileries" [...] movement of his version may be heard on audio record (Leonard Slatkin/Saint Louis Symphony: The Slatkin Years: 6 CD Set).|$|E

5000|$|A {{closely related}} {{technique}} due to K. Morita and M. Harao consists in partitioning each cell into {{a finite number}} <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> each part being devoted to some neighbor. The evolution proceeds by exchanging the corresponding parts between neighbors and then applying on each cell a purely local transformation [...] depending only {{on the state of}} the cell (and not on the states of its neighbors). With such a construction scheme, the cellular automaton is guaranteed to be reversible if the local transformation [...] is itself a bijection. This technique may be viewed as a block cellular automaton on a finer lattice of cells, formed by the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> each larger cell; the blocks of this finer lattice alternate between the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> within a single large cell and the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> in neighboring cells that share parts with each other.|$|R

50|$|This symphony (among others) {{was known}} to Ludwig Ritter von Köchel only by an incipit in the {{catalogue}} of Breitkopf & Härtel, and so he placed it in the Anhang of the Köchel catalogue as Anh. 216.
