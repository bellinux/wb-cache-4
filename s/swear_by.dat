25|$|Although the juntas, which {{forced the}} French to leave Spain, had sworn {{by the liberal}} Constitution of 1812, Ferdinand openly held {{that it was too}} liberal for the country. On his return to Spain on April 16, 1814, he refused to <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> the {{constitution}} himself, and continued to rule in the authoritarian fashion of his forebears. Thus the first bourgeois revolution ended in 1814. The reign of Ferdinand VII from 1814 to 1820 was a period of a stagnant economy and political instability. Much of the country was devastated after the Peninsular War, and government coffers were drained to fight against the independence movements in the Latin American colonies. Political conflict between liberals and royal absolutists further diverted energy and resources needed to rebuild the country.|$|E

25|$|In 219 BC, Hannibal {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Saguntum, which stood under the special protection of Rome. According to Roman tradition, Hannibal {{had been made to}} <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> his father never to be a friend of Rome, and he certainly did not take a conciliatory attitude when the Romans berated him for crossing the river Iberus (Ebro), which Carthage was bound by treaty not to cross. Hannibal did not cross the Ebro River (Saguntum was near modern Valencia – well south of the river) in arms, and the Saguntines provoked his attack by attacking their neighboring tribes who were Carthaginian protectorates and by massacring pro-Punic factions in their city. Rome had no legal protection pact with any tribe south of the Ebro River. Nonetheless, they asked Carthage to hand Hannibal over, and when the Carthaginian oligarchy refused, Rome declared war on Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Rahab {{promptly}} {{went up to}} the spies on {{the roof}} and told them that she knew that God had given the Israelites the land, and that the people lived in terror of the Israelites, having heard how God dried up the Red Sea before them and how the Israelites had destroyed the forces of Sihon and Og. So Rahab asked the spies to <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house and give her a token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She let them down by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. She told them to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E
25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

500|$|During {{the rest}} of the year, Holmes {{published}} only five more poems. His last major poem that year was [...] "The Last Leaf", which was inspired in part by a local man named Thomas Melvill, [...] "the last of the cocked hats" [...] and one of the [...] "Indians" [...] from the 1774 Boston Tea Party. Holmes would later write that Melvill had reminded him of [...] "a withered leaf which has held to its stem through the storms of autumn and winter, and finds itself still clinging to its bough while the new growths of spring are bursting their buds and spreading their foliage all around it." [...] Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe called the poem one of the finest works in the English language. Years later, Abraham Lincoln would also become a fan of the poem; William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner and biographer, wrote in 1867: [...] "I have heard Lincoln recite it, praise it, laud it, and <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> it".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury, some material was cut, including two songs and a recitative: {{a song for}} the foreman of the jury, [...] "Oh, do not blush to shed a tear", {{which was to be}} sung just after [...] "Oh, will you <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> yonder skies"; and a recitative for the Judge and song for the Usher, [...] "We do not deal with artificial crime" [...] and [...] "His lordship's always quits", which came just before [...] "A nice dilemma". The melody for [...] "His Lordship's always quits" [...] is known, and it was reused in [...] "I loved her fondly" [...] in The Zoo and later modified into the main tune from [...] "A wand'ring minstrel, I" [...] in The Mikado. [...] A few changes were made to the end of [...] "I love him, I love him!" [...] after the first night. [...] A third verse for [...] "Oh, gentlemen, listen I pray" [...] was sung, at least on the first night, and part was quoted in a review in the Pictorial World.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{took to the}} Senate floor {{after the}} election, giving a speech well {{received}} in the North, [...] "I will not give up this government... No; I intend to stand by it... and I invite every man who is a patriot to... rally around the altar of our common country... and <b>swear</b> <b>by</b> our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved." [...] As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon {{be the president of}} the Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.|$|E
