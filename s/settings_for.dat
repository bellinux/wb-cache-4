5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women.

Fox Home Entertainment released the season in Region 1 on September 4, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Provost {{declined}} to renew his contract. Producers decided {{to broaden the}} show's demographics to appeal to older viewers, and, to that end, dropped {{the boy and his}} dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger. Robert Bray, a former Marine and Gary Cooper look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart. During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> the show. Eventually, Bray's alcoholism forced him from the show, and Jack De Mave and Jed Allan were hired to replace him.|$|E

5|$|The Windows {{version of}} Remastered {{was criticized for}} {{suffering}} {{from a number of}} technical issues in the multiplayer, with players also being dissatisfied with the game's available <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> PC. On Steam, it received mostly negative user reviews, with complaints including poor performance, a locked 90 frames per second, inadequate mouse support, numerous hackers, and a low player count. Some users suggested that the multiplayer of Modern Warfare would be a more suitable alternative, which still attracted a sizable amount of players and offered better options for performance, modding and customization.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> some of his novels and short stories. During and after the First World War, {{together}} with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, he wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies that were {{an important part of the}} development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence.

Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a piano version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced to only one piano, also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> harmonium and only one piano. Ricordi published a piano reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only <b>settings</b> <b>for</b> signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E
