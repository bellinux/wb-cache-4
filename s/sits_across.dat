The building comprises two classroom wings and two laboratory wings grouped around a square central courtyard, which includes a small pond, containing some small fish and aquatic pond snails. The main foyer houses a large Foucault pendulum. (Another much smaller pendulum is located in Brown Hall on the East Campus). The Science Building was also designed by Howe and opened {{at the same time as}} the Library.|$|E

The largest and oldest building on the farm is the residence. Built as early as 1876 and as late as 1883, the house stands 1.5 stories tall and is of a late Victorian style in a cruciform shape. The cross-wing Western Farmhouse designed structure has a gabled roof (double Gabled-Ells) with four hip-roofed porches, one on each corner. The home is a wood framed building that had a concrete foundation added in 2006. Materials include mainly Douglas-fir for the wood, and a composite shingle roof.|$|E

25|$|Front Street – The final {{component}} of Adriaen's Landing, 'Front Street', <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> from the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and The Hartford Times Building. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded {{parts of the}} project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project – the first developer {{was removed from the}} project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential {{component of}} Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an ESPN Zone to the Front Street (ESPN is headquartered in nearby Bristol). On the back side of Front Street, the historic Beaux-Arts Hartford Times Buildinzg is being converted into a downtown campus of the University of Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Scott Stadium <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> {{from the}} first-year dorms along Alderman Road and {{is home to}} the University of Virginia's {{football}} program. The press box at Scott Stadium was a gift from an alumnus in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at UVA from 1934 until his death in 1950. Students, fans and alumni began to sport orange clothing for the games, a new tradition the former head coach, Al Groh, had been pushing for since he became head coach in 2000. Many students, however, have continued to wear the traditional sundresses or coats and ties at football games. Several fans have also begun garbing themselves in outlandish costumes in the style of football superfans (such as the Orange Gorilla or The Superhoo). Funding from benefactor Carl Smith created the foundation for the 280-piece Cavalier Marching Band in 2004, replacing the Virginia Pep Band in its official capacity at athletic events. The current head coach is Bronco Mendenhall, former head coach at BYU, who replaced Mike London in December 2015.|$|E

Jersey City, which <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been referred to as New York City's [...] "Sixth borough". It therefore forms an important part of Khan's identity and the narrative journey of her character since most of Marvel Comics' stories are set in Manhattan.

2500|$|Augustus Woodward's {{plan for}} Detroit's streets created oddly-shaped {{triangular}} blocks, including Capitol Park {{on the west}} and Harmonie Park on the east. Starting in the 1830s and 1940s, this area was home to {{a growing number of}} German immigrants to Detroit. In 1849, to preserve their ethnic traditions, a group of Detroit Germans founded a singing group, the Gesang-Verein Harmonie. The club built a [...] frame clubhouse at the corner of Lafayette and Beaubien in 1874. This frame Harmonie Club structure burned in 1893, and the club almost immediately organized a competition, open to German architects, to design a new building. Richard Raseman (the architect of the Grand Army of the Republic Building) won the competition; the resulting building <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> from Harmonie Park.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the entire}} island {{south of the}} Tropic of Cancer, the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The {{temperature}} is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is [...] in January and [...] in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea {{and the fact that}} Cuba <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes.

2500|$|The {{area around}} Lenox has grown immensely {{in the past}} few decades {{following}} its opening, with expanding retail developments and over 75 restaurants within a mile radius, which has made the area a highly desirable location to live and work. A two-story Target store <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> from Lenox at Lenox Marketplace, connected inside via escalators and elevators designed for shopping carts as well as shoppers, and having checkouts on both levels at the exits to a parking deck. Other stores at Lenox Marketplace include Dick's Sporting Goods and Neiman Marcus Last Call (Previously the site of a Filene's Basement). [...] The Sembler Company was the developer. In addition, Phipps Plaza is located to the northeast of Lenox Square across Peachtree Road. Traffic levels around Lenox are high and the streets are confusing for those unfamiliar with the area. Georgia 400 opened in 1993, restricting traffic to and from the west after it cut many existing roads. However, the BUC (Buckhead Uptown Connection), the free shuttle bus service around Buckhead, is available, supported voluntarily by a self-taxing district (Buckhead CID) which includes Lenox, and by GRTA and other agencies. The Peachtree Streetcar initiative would also extend free or low-fare streetcars to Lenox in the north, through midtown and downtown, to a proposed mixed-use redevelopment around historic Fort McPherson, [...] south. MARTA, the city's main mass transit system, provides one station across the street from the J W Marriott, as well as the Buckhead station a quarter mile Northwest on Peachtree Road.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotary engine}} places severe thermal {{stresses}} on its cases, as {{two sides of}} rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external jacketing. Oil is fed from an engine sump by a trochoid pump at around [...] The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass {{in case of a}} blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor jacketing but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that <b>sits</b> <b>across</b> the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the inlet port and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. [...] The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan {{on the right side of}} the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at [...] and cutting when the temperature falls below [...]|$|E
