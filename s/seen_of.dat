5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes have colonized southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area, but appear to have mixed with the Sacramento Valley red fox V.v.patwin only in a narrow hybrid zone. In addition, no evidence is <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> interbreeding of eastern red foxes in California with the montane Sierra Nevada red fox V.v.necator or other populations in the Intermountain West (between the Rocky Mountains {{to the east and}} the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges to the west.|$|E
5|$|Further to {{the east}} of Begumpur Masjid, in the Serai Shahji village, Mughal period {{buildings}} are <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> which the Serai Shaji Mahal is a distinguishing monument. The area surrounding this is scattered with decrepit gates, graves and a large slum area. A little distance from this place is the tomb of Shiekh Farid Murtaza Khan, who during Emperor Akbar’s period, was credited with building a number of Serai's, a mosque and Faridabad village, which is now the presentday large city in Haryana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given {{for the sale of}} a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, {{with an increase in}} interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Little can be <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> {{the levels}} {{now for the}} entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5|$|Little was <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> Katsura for {{the next}} few years. She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's You Asked for It, and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was elected}} Bishop of Mileto on September 18, 1411.

5|$|The {{original}} {{name came}} from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All that can be <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies {{on the site of}} a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.|$|E
5|$|The predators of the {{tilefish}} {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish. Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish, but no evidence is <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> free-swimming tilefish {{being attacked by}} dusky sharks or sandbar sharks. The one listed predator for the tilefish is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter.|$|E

25|$|The forest between Kakahi and Lake Taupo {{remained}} standing until after World War II {{when it was}} felled. By then the railway proposal {{had given way to}} road transport.

25|$|In the 1880s Valette {{worked as}} an unpaid {{volunteer}} labor inspector in the Paris region. At the age of forty she became a socialist in response to what she had <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> factory conditions.

She attended the 1891 international congress in Brussels as a confirmed Guesdist.|$|E

25|$|The site {{is in an}} {{earthquake}} zone and has suffered {{a great deal of}} damage at various times, especially in severe tremors of the 4th and 7th centuries. An added complication was that one of the 4th century earthquakes altered the water table, making parts of the town prone to flooding. Evidence can be <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> emergency plumbing installed to combat this problem.|$|E
25|$|Following the Blitz, which {{destroyed}} {{the chamber of}} the House of Commons, the Lord's chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> this today, with damage clearly visible {{on one of the}} doors where they were struck by Black Rod.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, Thomas Karsten {{presented}} a paper of the Indies Town Planning at the Decentralisation Congress. The paper was <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> a new radical idea in which Karsten {{argued that a}} town planning is an activity of interconnected components (social, technology, etc.) {{that is needed to}} be addressed harmoniously. His idea for a methodological approach to create an organic town plan with a social dimension received much acclaim in the colony, {{as well as in the}} Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R.

His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{advantages}} for postalcoholic fermentation answer the disadvantages of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts). Also, the advantage is <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> the lees being a nutrient source through the autolysis of the dead yeast cells, though that nutrient source {{may not always be}} enough to ensure MLF runs successfully to completion. Conversely, many of the disadvantages of late inoculation are the absence of {{the advantages}} that come from early inoculation (higher temperatures, potentially quicker completion, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be <b>seen</b> <b>of</b> the eyes themselves, {{he thought he would}} {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
