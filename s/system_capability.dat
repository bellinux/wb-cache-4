25|$|From 1961 to 1963, the B-58 was {{retrofitted}} {{with two}} tandem stub pylons under each wing root, {{adjacent to the}} centreline pod, for B43 or B61 nuclear weapons {{for a total of}} five nuclear weapons per aircraft. Although the USAF explored the possibility of using the B-58 for the conventional strike role, it was never equipped for carrying or dropping conventional bombs in service. A photo reconnaissance pod, the LA-331, was also fielded. Several other specialized pods for ECM or an early cruise missile were considered, but not adopted. The late 1950s High Virgo air-launched ballistic missile was designed to be launched from the B-58 with four test launches of the High Virgo carried out by a B-58 to determine ballistic missile and anti-satellite weapon <b>system</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} key {{sustainability}} performance management factors used by Australian Companies and {{their association with}} organisational performance. The study {{found that there were}} seven key factors related to sustainability performance - environmental practices, new product innovation, customer acquisition and retention, information <b>systems</b> <b>capability,</b> employee welfare and community engagement, operational profitability, and organisational profitability. In relation to organisational performance, the combination of factors relating to environmental practices, new product innovation, customer acquisition and retention, and information <b>systems</b> <b>capability</b> would appear to generate sales of new products. The factors of environmental practices, information <b>systems</b> <b>capability,</b> and employee welfare and community engagement appear to have considerable influence on environmental budget allocations.
