However, in jurisdictions where <b>surrogacy</b> <b>motherhood</b> are not legally accepted, couples deliberately turn to other jurisdictions to conclude a surrogacy agreement where {{it is in fact}} legal to do so. When different jurisdictions are involved in one <b>surrogacy</b> <b>motherhood</b> agreement, several problems arise, especially {{due to the lack of}} regulation on an international level. These poblems must therefore be resolved by the implementation of an international document or agreement. This discussion will therefore firstly focus on the national position regarding <b>surrogacy</b> <b>motherhood</b> in the South African content to determine whether South Africa will benefit from the implementation of a proposed international document or agreement. Secondly, the research focus on international surrogacy and evaluate the concept to identify the problems arising as a result thereof. Thirdly, the contents of the proposed international document or agreement will be discussed in depth in order to determine what the contents of the document or agreement should include. The aim of the research is to determine which issues and problems should be included in the proposed document or agreement in order to effectively regulate international surrogacy. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how political parties have addressed the problem with <b>surrogacy</b> <b>motherhood</b> and identify politically relevant ideas in terms of policy frames. Using Carol Bacchis approach for analysing policy, the study aims to deconstruct the represented problem in each policy and reveal implicit assumptions.             Policy production can be understood as a struggle of meaning where political parties function as strategic actors. Studying parliamentary motions, bills and records of proceedings in the Chamber highlights how actors construct the problem differently using framing strategies. Moreover by analysing meanings as results of strategic actions, ideas can be more or less harmonised with the public opinion regarding surrogacy.                As a consequence of the innovation in reproductive technology methods such as artificial insemination, in vitro-fertilisation and surrogacy have become alternatives to involuntary childlessness. The issue of surrogacy is controversial as it challenges many of our thoughts on parenting, individuals right to control over their own body and reproductive rights. The debate is complex and reveals the question can be perceived from different premises. This is further presented by describing policy frames in the Swedish political landscape, the problem construction shows policy frames have elaborated by using different framing strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUntil recently, {{surrogacy}} {{was banned}} in Vietnam for all cases. The government, however, has altered {{its position on}} reproductive technology and will soon legalize non-commercial <b>surrogacy</b> among relatives. <b>Motherhood</b> is highly venerated in Vietnamese society and, under this local kinship conception, gestational process {{is of paramount importance}} in establishing a connection between the fetus and the woman. The implications of this new government decision for local kinship, motherhood and the individuals concerned will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Surrogacy {{has been}} a point of {{contention}} for feminists and others since the 1980 s. More recently surrogacy has developed a heightened profile within the media, imposing further scrutiny upon the social and legal perspective on motherhood. The legal framework surrounding surrogacy and, in particular, its construction of motherhood is a key area of concern. Surrogacy openly, and obviously, challenges the hetero-normative family form. Subsequently, surrogacy is the ideal lens through which to observe the legal framework surrounding mothers as this practice reflects the socially adaptable nature of motherhood. This thesis argued that the legal regulation of <b>surrogacy</b> frames <b>motherhood</b> as a hetero-normative concept which is open to, and ready for, challenge. This legal construction of motherhood, {{in the context of}} surrogacy, is in conflict with social understandings of motherhood. In other words, the way that surrogacy is currently regulated does not reflect the lived experiences of motherhood and requires urgent reform. The legal conceptualisation of motherhood should reflect the social experience of mothers. It is crucial that societal and legal doctrines of motherhood coincide to present a comprehensive understanding. This will ensure that women’s choices to engage with motherhood in the context of surrogacy are observed and protected. It is argued that contract law provides possible solutions to the difficult relationship between <b>surrogacy</b> and <b>motherhood,</b> helping to re-envision the legal hetero-normative framework currently governing familial structure and women’s choices. The introduction of surrogacy contracts will offer greater legal recognition to non-normative families which are so prevalent within contemporary society. The social reality of motherhood should be the starting point from which to develop a new legal framework. This improved legal framework should incorporate alternative regulatory methods to fully address feminist concerns about women, maternity and the law. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} three predominant discourses {{that are part}} of the analysis of commercial surrogacy: the commodification of “mother-hood; ” the “romance ” of the gift relationship; and the “agency ” of the surrogate mother, especially in relation to the feminist and academic analysis of commercial <b>surrogacy</b> in India. <b>Motherhood,</b> agency, and the romance of the gift continue to influence the study and analysis of sur-rogacy as strong rhetorical ideologies. In the process, they are reified as the primary structural contexts within which surrogacy seems to operate. The article reviews the contemporary research literature on commercial surrogacy to look at the academic engagements with these three ideas...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical {{appraisal of the}} psychosocial empirical research on surrogate mothers, their motivations for entering into surrogacy agreements and the outcome of their participation. I apply a social constructionist approach toward analyzing the scholarship, arguing that the cultural assumption that "normal" women do not voluntarily become pregnant with the premeditated intention of relinquishing the child for money, together {{with the assumption that}} "normal" women "naturally" bond with the children they bear, frames much of this research. I argue that this scholarship reveals how Western assumptions about motherhood and family impact upon scientific research. In their attempt to research the anomalous phenomenon of surrogacy, these researchers respond to the cultural anxieties that the practice provokes by framing their research methodologies and questions in a manner that upholds essentialist gendered assumptions about the naturalness and normalness of motherhood and childbearing. This leads the researchers to overlook the intrinsic value of the women's personal experiences and has implications for social policy.

40|$|Surrogacy - {{abstract}} This master thesis {{deals with}} the phenomenon of surrogate <b>motherhood</b> (<b>surrogacy)</b> and analyses it {{from the point of}} view of Czech and British law, especially the Private law. Its main objective is to approximate to the answer to the question whether surrogacy should be entrenched in Czech law and, if so, what should the main features of such legal regulation be. In order to achieve this aim, it, firstly, focuses on the currently valid and effective Czech legislation. It is a well-known fact that, apart from the provision of § 804 of the Czech Civil Code, Czech law does not provide for surrogacy, at all. Surrogacy is, therefore, only partially regulated in some of its aspects, namely assisted reproduction, legal parenthood and adoption. Since the United Kingdom is often mentioned as one of the possible sources of inspiration for the future Czech legal regulation of surrogacy, British law concerning this phenomenon is considered in the following part of this thesis - especially in the light of the extensive case law. In particular, issues such as surrogacy arrangements, assisted reproduction, legal parenthood and transfer of legal parenthood (that is adoption and parental orders) are analysed. These are then subjected to critical assessment. In its last chapter, the thesis returns to the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis – One aim of {{this article}} is to examine how {{normative}} motherhood pervades the discussion of <b>surrogacy.</b> How has <b>motherhood</b> been fabricated so that the very experience of it, the language that women use to describe that experience, and even the arguments that are framed both in defense of and in opposition to surrogacy are mired in essentialist constructs? The other aims of this work are many leveled but interconnected. Proponents of surrogate contracts have argued that banning contracts will take women back to the days of “biology is destiny. ” Many opponents of surrogacy invoke the maternal instinct or maternal–infant bonding theory to counter surrogate contracts. Meanwhile, the Sorkow decision [in the Baby M case] institutionalized male “genetic fulfillment ” in upholding the validity of surrogate contracts and awarding custody to the sperm donor, Bill Stern, and few seem to notice this new brand of father–right established as paternal essentialism. In the aftermath of the New Jersey court case, we learn that Betsy Stern will stay home and take care of the child, thus displacing maternal essentialism onto another woman [...] So where does essentialism lie, and whose essentialism has legal standing? Finally, this article examines the rise of the new reproductive technologies within a western context of returning-to-motherhood and baby craving and an extra–Western context of women as population polluters. The rhetoric and reality of motherhood pervad...|$|R
