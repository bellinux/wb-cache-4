40|$|Background: Postnatal {{breastfeeding}} {{support in}} the form of home visits is difficult to accommodate in regional Australia, where hospitals often deal with harsh economic constraints in a context where they are required to provide services to geographically dispersed consumers. This study evaluated a predominately telephone-based <b>support</b> <b>service</b> called the Infant Feeding <b>Support</b> <b>Service.</b> Methods: A prospective cohort design was used to compare data for 696 women giving birth in two regional hospitals (one public, one private) and participating in the <b>support</b> <b>service</b> between January and July 2003 with data from a cohort of 625 women who gave birth in those hospitals before the introduction of the <b>support</b> <b>service.</b> Each mother participating in the <b>support</b> <b>service</b> was assigned a lactation consultant. First contact occurred 48 hours after discharge, and approximately weekly thereafter for 4 weeks. Breastfeeding duration was measured at 3 months postpartum. Results: For women from the private hospital, the <b>support</b> <b>service</b> improved exclusive breastfeeding duration to 4. 5 weeks postpartum, but these improvements were not evident at 3 months postpartum. No effects were observed for mothers from the public hospital. Quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated high levels of client satisfaction with the <b>support</b> <b>service.</b> Conclusions: This small-scale, predominately telephone-based intervention provided significant, although apparently context-sensitive, improvements to exclusive breastfeeding duratio...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight <b>Support</b> <b>Services.</b> Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight <b>Support</b> <b>Services</b> had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
