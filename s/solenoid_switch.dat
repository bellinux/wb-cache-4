5000|$|Though {{retaining}} much of Lawrie Bond's original {{concept of}} a simple, lightweight, economical vehicle, the Minicar was gradually developed by Sharp's through several different incarnations. The majority of cars were convertibles, though later, hardtop models were offered, along with van and estate versions. Minicars were generally available either in standard or deluxe form, though {{the distinction between the}} two was largely one of mechanical detail rather than luxury. The cars were powered initially by a single-cylinder two-stroke Villiers engine of [...] In December 1949 [...] this was upgraded to a [...] unit. The engine was further upgraded in 1958, first to a single-cylinder [...] and then to a [...] twin-cylinder Villiers 4T. These air-cooled engines were developed principally as motorcycle units and therefore had no reverse gear. However, this was a minimal inconvenience, because the engine, gearbox and front wheel were mounted as a single unit and could be turned by the steering wheel up to 90 degrees either side of the straight-ahead position, enabling the car to turn within its own length.A method of reversing the car was offered on later models via a reversible Dynastart unit. The Dynastart unit, which doubled as both starter motor and alternator on these models incorporated a built-in reversing <b>solenoid</b> <b>switch.</b> After stopping the engine and operating this switch the Dynastart, and consequently the engine, would rotate in the opposite direction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to model electro-dynamically the pinion-engaging {{mechanism}} (PEM) of starter motors. The purpose of the PEM is to switch a high current by means of relatively low control current. The PEM is the system of components (<b>solenoid</b> <b>switch,</b> pinion-engaging lever, and overrunning clutch with drive pinion) that engages the drive pinion with the ring gear. The solenoid switches consist of a pull-in winding and a hold-in winding and a movable iron core. The electro-dynamic model of the <b>solenoid</b> <b>switch</b> contains the inductance and its partial derivatives which depend on the current and the position of the solenoid armature.

50|$|A variant on the {{electric}} starter motor is the inertia starter (not {{to be confused}} with the Bendix-type starter described above). Here the starter motor does not turn the engine directly. Instead, when energized, the motor turns a heavy flywheel built into its casing (not the main flywheel of the engine). Once the flywheel/motor unit has reached a constant speed the current to the motor is turned off and the drive between the motor and flywheel is disengaged by a freewheel mechanism. The spinning flywheel is then connected to the main engine and its inertia turns it over to start it. These stages are commonly automated by <b>solenoid</b> <b>switches,</b> with the machine operator using a two-position control switch, which is held in one position to spin the motor and then moved to the other to cut the current to the motor and engage the flywheel to the engine.|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{relying on}} relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) methodology {{has been designed}} and developed for continuous-field measurements of vertical Hg 0 fluxes over cropland ecosystems. This micro-meteorological technique requires sampling of turbulent eddies into up- and downdraught channels at a constant flow rate and accurate timing, based on a threshold involving the sign of vertical wind component (w). The fully automated system is of a whole-air type drawing air at a high velocity to the REA sampling apparatus and allowing for the rejection of samples associated with w-fluctuations around zero. Conditional sampling was executed at 10 -Hz resolution on a sub-stream by two fast-response three-way <b>solenoid</b> <b>switching</b> valves connected in parallel to a zero Hg 0 air supply through their normally open ports. To suppress flow transients resulting from switching, pressure differentials across the two upstream ports of the conditional valves were minimised using a control unit. The Hg 0 concentrations of the up- and downdraught channel were sequentially (each by two consecutive 5 -minute gas samples) determined after enhancement collection onto gold traps by an automated cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer (CVAFS) instrument. A protocol of regular reference sampling periods was implemented during field campaigns to continuously adjust for bias that may exist between the two conditional sampling channels.

40|$|Abstract Quantification of disproportionate {{contribution}} made by signalised traffic intersections (TIs) {{to overall}} daily commuting exposure is important but barely known. We carried out mobile measurements {{in a car}} for size–resolved particle number concentrations (PNCs) in the 5 – 560  nm range under five different ventilation settings on a 6  km long busy round route with 10 TIs. These ventilation settings were windows fully open and both outdoor air intake from fan and heating off (Set 1), windows closed, fan 25 % on and heating 50 % on (Set 2), windows closed, fan 100 % on and heating off (Set 3), windows closed, fan off and heating 100 % on (Set 4), and windows closed, fan and heating off (Set 5). Measurements were taken sequentially {{inside and outside the}} car cabin at 10  Hz sampling rate using a <b>solenoid</b> <b>switching</b> system in conjunction with a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 50). The objectives were to: (i) identify traffic conditions under which TIs becomes hot–spots of PNCs, (ii) assess the effect of ventilation settings in free–flow and delay conditions (waiting time at a TI when traffic signal is red) on in–cabin PNCs with respect to on–road PNCs at TIs, (iii) deriving the relationship between the PNCs and change in driving speed during delay time at the TIs, and (iv) quantify the contribution of exposure at TIs with respect to overall commuting exposure. Congested TIs were found to become hot–spots when vehicle accelerate from idling conditions. In–cabin peak PNCs followed similar temporal trend as for on–road peak PNCs. Reduction in in–cabin PNC with respect to outside PNC was highest (70 %) during free–flow traffic conditions when both fan drawing outdoor air into the cabin and heating was switched off. Such a reduction in in–cabin PNCs at TIs was highest (88 %) with respect to outside PNC during delay conditions when fan was drawing outside air at 25 % on and heating was 50 % on settings. PNCs and change in driving speed showed an exponential–fit relationship during the delay events at TIs. Short–term exposure for ∼ 2 % of total commuting time in car corresponded to ∼ 25 % of total respiratory doses.

40|$|Roadside {{vegetation}} {{barriers are}} used in many urban areas to restrict air and noise pollution from reaching roadside pedestrians, but their effectiveness in limiting the movement of nanoparticles is not yet known. This study investigates {{the influence of a}} roadside vegetation barrier on particle number distribution (PND) and concentration (PNC) and associated exposure under different wind directions. Size-resolved particles in the 5 – 560 nm size range were measured along a busy roadside in Guildford (Surrey, UK) using a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 50). A custom-built <b>solenoid</b> <b>switching</b> system, together with the DMS 50, was used to make sequential measurements at the front (L 2), middle (L 3) and back (L 4) of the vegetation barrier; L 1 was in parallel to L 2 at a vegetation-free location. Measured data were divided into the three predominant wind directions: cross-road (NW–SW), cross-footpath (NE–SE) and along-road (NW–NE). The consistency in the shape of PNDs and the corresponding geometric mean diameters at the three sites (L 2, L 3, L 4) indicate an identical removal effect of vegetation barrier for all sizes of particles. Comparison of the PNCs at two parallel locations (with and without the vegetation barrier) showed ∼ 11 % higher PNCs (1. 99 ± 1. 77 × 105 cm− 3) at L 2 than those at L 1 during cross-road winds, showing the impeding effect of the vegetation barrier. Such differences were insignificant during the remaining wind directions. Cross-road winds indicate the effect of vegetation barrier; the PNCs were decreased by 14 and 37 % at L 3 and L 4, respectively, compared with L 2. During cross-footpath winds, particles were carried away by the wind from the sampling location. Significant decrease in PNCs were consequently seen at L 3 (1. 80 ± 1. 01 × 104 cm− 3) and L 4 (1. 49 ± 0. 91 × 104 cm− 3) compared with L 2 (6. 26 ± 3. 31 × 104 cm− 3). The PNCs at these locations showed modest differences during the cross-footpath and along-road winds. Respiratory deposited doses (RDD) at L 4 were found to be the lowest during all wind directions compared with the L 1 –L 3. The vegetation barrier efficiently reduced the RDD by ∼ 36 % during cross-road winds. Our results show the mitigation potential of vegetation barriers in limiting near-road nanoparticles exposure and the measured data can facilitate performance evaluation of theoretical models...|$|R

Because {{of the size}} of these accelerators, it is difficult to probe the low energy electron clouds over substantial lengths of the beam pipe. We applied a novel technique to directly measure the electron cloud density via the phase shift induced in a TE wave which is independently excited and transmitted over a straight section of the accelerator. The modulation in the wave transmission which appear to increase in depth when the clearing <b>solenoids</b> are <b>switched</b> off, seem to be directly correlated to the electron cloud density in the section. Furthermore, we expect a larger phase shift of a wave transmitted through magnetic dipole field regions if the transmitted wave couples with the gyration motion of the electrons.
