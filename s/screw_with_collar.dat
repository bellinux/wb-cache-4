40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> {{and without a}} shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— <b>Screw</b> types <b>with</b> independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear tests were conducted in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than screws without shaft. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than screws without shaft before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement <b>with</b> <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft was 55 % to 60 % of that <b>with</b> <b>screws</b> without shaft. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft. Clinical Significance— Cortex bone <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a shaft inserted in lag fashion should be considered for the fixation of equine MC(T) III condylar fractures...|$|R
