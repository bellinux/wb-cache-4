5000|$|The letter J {{originated}} as a <b>swash</b> <b>letter</b> I, {{used for}} the letter I {{at the end of}} Roman numerals when following another I, as in XXIIJ or xxiij instead of XXIII or xxiii for the Roman numeral representing 23. A distinctive usage emerged in Middle High German. Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478-1550) was the first to explicitly distinguish I and J as representing separate sounds, in his Ɛpistola del Trissino de le lettere nuωvamente aggiunte ne la lingua italiana ("Trissino's epistle about the letters recently added in the Italian language") of 1524. Originally, 'I' and 'J' were different shapes for the same letter, both equally representing , , and but, Romance languages developed new sounds (from former [...] and [...] ) that came to be represented as 'I' and 'J'; therefore, English J, acquired from the French J, has a sound value quite different from [...] (which represents the initial sound in the English word [...] "yet").|$|E
40|$|Differs from variant "a" in Norma Russell's Bibl. of Cowper, no. 305, in {{that the}} "n" in "written" is not a <b>swash</b> <b>letter,</b> the digits of the date {{are all the same}} height, and the {{semicolon}} after "Fleet Street" is not out of alignment.

25|$|Adobe Caslon is a {{very popular}} revival {{designed}} by Carol Twombly. It is based on Caslon's own specimen pages printed between 1734 and 1770 {{and is a member}} of the Adobe Originals programme. It added many features now standard in high-quality digital fonts, such as small caps, old style figures, <b>swash</b> <b>letters,</b> ligatures, alternate letters, fractions, subscripts and superscripts, and matching ornaments.|$|R
5000|$|By 1903 Old Style Antique {{was sold}} by American Type Founders {{under the new}} name of Bookman Old Style, with an added 'italic'. ATF did not offer a normal titalic, instead {{featuring}} an oblique, or [...] "sloped roman", in which the letters are simply slanted. Serif typefaces which use an oblique are now quite rare, but the style was relatively common for display typefaces in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. It was sold with some swash capitals and other letters. Although one critic described its <b>swash</b> <b>letters</b> in 1913 as [...] "ridiculous", they would become a popular feature of revivals and derivatives.|$|R
25|$|Released by Font Bureau, it {{includes}} bold and bold italic designs, {{and a complete}} feature set across all weights, including bold small caps and swash italic alternates as well as optional shorter descenders and a 'modernist' italic option to turn off <b>swashes</b> on lower-case <b>letters</b> and reduce the slant on the 'A' for a more spare appearance. It is currently used in Boston magazine and by Foreign Affairs.|$|R
5000|$|Goudy {{described}} the design as very {{loosely based on}} the 'Fell Types', a set of type in the Dutch style collected by Bishop John Fell of Oxford for the Oxford University Press, although he conceded that [...] "comparison of my type with the Fell letter will disclose {{little more than an}} identity of spirit" [...] and Walter Tracy found the claim of influence implausible. It has also been compared in some details, notably the tilted understroke on the 'e', to the type of late 15th century Venetian printer Nicolas Jenson by Walter Tracy and others; American Type Founders' historian Henry Lewis Bullen somewhat cruelly described it as [...] "a spoilt Jenson". The italic is somewhat florid, with <b>swashes</b> on some <b>letters,</b> and additional <b>swashes</b> were available for other capitals.|$|R
