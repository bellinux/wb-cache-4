40|$|The {{decline of}} {{manufacturing}} in OECD countries and job implications {{has been a}} long-time concern. Recently, policy-makers have set out for reindustrialisation. A trend related to these concerns and aspirations is the <b>servicification</b> of manufacturing – the increase in use, produce and sales of services. However, <b>servicification</b> of firms and its role for foreign trade and policy have only received limited attention. This paper reviews micro- level evidence and discusses trade policy implications. <b>Servicification</b> is found in several countries, including China, and {{there are indications that}} imported, domestic and exported services are key for the competitiveness of today’s manufacturing firms and their participation in international value chains. Therefore, the historic divides in trade-policy-making between trade in manufactures and services, between offensive and defensive interests, and between modes of supply are largely antiquated. Potential trade policy implications also include to: reform how governments consult business for trade negotiations; facilitate cross-border movement of persons; and cut tariffs on services embodied and embedded in manufactures and their sales.  Tjänstefiering och internationalisering av tillverkningsindustri...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new type of service CAD system {{utilized}} in Service/Product Engineering (SPE), a much-needed and novel engineering discipline within the background of <b>servicification.</b> In this research a design-object model was defined, and a prototype named Service Explorer was implemented. The model represents critical concepts such as value, costs, functions either of products or of service activities, and entities. Through its application to business cases such as selling washing machines, providing pay-per-wash service, and cleaning washing machines, the Service Explorer was proven to support designers as they describe and operate design objects. In the future we expect that the Service Explorer can help designers with generating new ideas...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{dimensions}} to the evolving economic development model in China {{and the role}} for urbanization within it. One key component is a requirement to incorporate {{a wider range of}} service industries, especially in the nation's fast-growing cities where there is demand for knowledge and related advanced services that will support, for example, the necessary shift to more 'modern' manufacturing. This paper summarizes progress towards <b>servicification</b> and the rationale for undertaking more research that will deepen understanding of the actual and potential contribution of producer services. Some recent empirical evidence on the growth trends for producer service in selected cities, including the four case study cities of Shanghai, Huangshan, Chongqing and Kunming, is presented. It is shown that in majority of cities the manufacturing-services gap remains a significant...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{products}} in many industries recently experienced <b>servicification.</b> This phe-nomenon, {{that has already}} been described by Vargo and Lusch in 2004, describes changes in society and markets that foster a shift towards a service-centered view. In this vein, the focus of trade is on services while the importance of goods decreases. The emergence of advanced Web technologies leverages the provisioning and consumption of services over the Internet. Additionally, the presence of the Internet and the availabil-ity of Web-related technologies has influenced the offering and provisioning of services. The existence of platforms like Google’s AppExchange or Amazon’s Web Services man-ifest this trend. The legal framework for service outsourcing and thus, service provi-sioning and consumption is stipulated in service level agreements (SLAs). SLAs deter-mine the objectives for service quality through service level objectives (SLOs), contain a price for service provisioning and a penalty in case of SLA violation. This way, SLAs set incentives for providers to adhere to SLAs. The provisioning of services underlies an inherent risk of service failure caused for instance by power outages, hardware mal...|$|E
40|$|Summary Today's {{economic}} systems are characterised by flexible specialisation {{driven by a}} growth of service-based firms, a <b>servicification</b> of manufacturing firms and projectification. There is therefore {{a growing number of}} matrix organisations being co-dependent on line organisations and projects. The study aims to advance theorising on such organisations by empirically studying the assumption that tensions act as drivers for managerial action in project organisations and that they constitute a foundation upon which theories may be built. The study shows that tensions are concerns in project organisations and that sources of tensions are primarily created by the co-existence of fundamentally different organising principles, the way employees identify themselves with either the line function or with projects and by competition for limited organisational resources. The study differentiates project-oriented organisations and project-based organisations from one another. The main contribution is to empirically study and validate Lundin and Söderholm's (1995) [Lundin, R. A., & Söderholm, A. (1995). A theory of the temporary organisation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evidence on}} service innovation using the 2012 Census of Philippine Business and Industry and the 2009 Pilot Survey of Innovation Activities. It reveals the wide variation in R&D intensities and differences in innovation behavior between the manufacturing and services sectors, for example, with respect to information sources and innovation activities. Many similarities were also detected in terms of service product innovation, the popularity of organizational innovation, and the preference for training activities, among others. Looking at structural factors, the probit regression analyses indicate {{that the size of}} the firm is a good determinant for all types of innovation. Ownership and age were also significant for certain innovation outputs, which could help inform policies on foreign direct investment and entrepreneurship. The results of this paper reveal the importance of service innovation not only for the services sector but also for the manufacturing sector consistent with <b>servicification.</b> In general, different types of innovation are undertaken by industries for various reasons, and the technological and nontechnological forms of innovation complement each other. If the government aims to promote economy-wide upgrading, support for innovation should not favor only one type of innovation output or activity. Further research on innovation behavior to cover more industries will be useful in developing a comprehensive and more nuanced approach to innovation policy.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of services in international trade {{through the lens of}} global value chains (GVCs). Services account for more than 70 % of world GDP but only for around 20 % of world trade in balance of payments terms. In value added terms, accounting for services embodied in exported goods, services account for 40 % of world trade. However, the international supply of services is not only represented through cross-border transactions. Services are also traded through the movement of labour and capital. The latter contributes to the GDP of the domestic country. The services value added of foreign affiliates in selected EU countries account, on average, for a quarter of domestic services value added. The role of services as input into manufacturing production often termed <b>servicification</b> of manufacturing, is substantial with services value added accounting for almost a third of manufacturing exports in developed countries and 26 % in developing economies. While the share of foreign services content in manufacturing exports is close to 12 % in both developed and developing countries, the latter add significantly less domestic services value to their manufacturing exports. Services industries increasingly produce in networked or "fragmented" arrangements. The paper lays out conceptual and measurement issues related to services networks and provides evidence based on trade in value added statistics and on a case study on the film industry. In contrast to goods value chains, services networks appear less fragmented internationally based on trade in value added statistics and survey evidence. However, to better capture the international services fragmentation, advances in statistics by enterprise characteristics and by mode of supply, i. e. taking into account the movement of labour and capital, are required...|$|E
40|$|The paper’s {{interest}} arises {{thanks to}} the intention of fulfilling a gap occasioned {{by the lack of}} research, didactically and empirically, on solving problems concerning dynamics within the Supply Chain. Globalization has promoted an environment that extent and scarce competitiveness, leading companies to move their manufacturing and production tasks away and to take advantages from every location to beat competitors around the world. Now that globalization is settled to stay and even small and medium enterprises have performed offshoring or outsourcing activities to reduce their costs, a new era to stand out has arisen for companies. Enterprises search for new manners to be distinct than competitors and gain share in their markets. As a consequence, during the last years, a new phenomenon, known as reshoring, has been noticed mainly in US and partly in Germany, UK and Italy. The blank in the researches of reshoring activities is more obvious in Europe, especially in Sweden. Therefore, this paper seeks the answer to ‘How do companies with headquarters in Sweden relocate activities?’ in order to verify the existence of any trend, or even the appearance of this new trend regarding location decisions. The study of eight companies has enabled to collect information about companies that are implementing reshoring processes and which were the reasons that guided them to perform the way they did. As the definition of reshoring processes refers to cases where a previous offshoring process has been developed, the study of reshoring is not realized in isolation. It has been collected information regarding the reasons why some companies undertook offshoring processes in the past and how the outcome of that strategy is associated to the current phenomenon. Furthermore, it has been identified the reasons that explain why some companies did not carry out offshoring processes in the past and why those that did have been reshoring in recent years. It has emerged the presence of the <b>Servicification</b> process, which could clarify the manufacturing climate and affect companies’ location decisions in Sweden. In short, the gathering of information has enabled to build an overall picture of the evolution of offshoring and reshoring in the Swedish Industry in terms of size and the causes of this evolution, with the appearance of a possible Regionalization trend in a long-term scenario. The main conclusion is that in the hunt of companies to achieve a right mix of offshore and in-home activities, a reshoring movement is happening between, but it is accompanied by the remaining offshoring trend, which is much larger. Although small, reshoring exists and the main key variables to control the phenomenon are lower costs, proximity to markets, core competences protection and concentration of facilities. The most attractive countries for Swedish companies as a destination to relocate their activities seem to be countries in Eastern Europe. Companies do not perceive the phenomenon as a trend neither they refer to those movements as ‘reshoring’ due to the probable bad feelings and bad popularity that brings ‘coming back’...|$|E
40|$|The total {{lifecycle}} of {{a vehicle}} contains many phases, from production to sales to first customer to second customer and so on {{until the end of}} life. Each one of these phases includes different activities in different business areas and under different conditions. This means that the customers´ needs will vary depending on which lifecycle phase the vehicle is in and the offered services have to be adapted to this. Therefore it is important for truck developing companies to know when a transition, from one lifecycle phase to another has occurred. This study is based on a case study provided by Scania, a company that develops trucks and busses. Delimitations were that the study would focus on connected long-haulage trucks that are in Europe under their first life cycle phase, that the developed services would be described on a conceptual level and not cover any economic aspects. With this in mind, the following research questions were created: RQ 1) What defines a transition phase? RQ 2) How can the long-haulage trucks’ usage pattern be used to identify a transition phase? RQ 3) Which data is needed to identify a transition phase? RQ 4) Based on the results of RQ 2 and RQ 3, how could the transition alert service be designed? RQ 5) Which applications could the transitions alert service be used for? The study included a literature study covering product lifecycle theory, <b>servicification,</b> second-hand market, big data, telematics, intelligent vehicles and statistic hypothesis testing. Further, two truck drivers were observed in order to get better understanding of the transportation business and the truck driving activities. Two qualitative interview studies were made with hauliers, service salesmen, truck salesmen and distributors from Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. The results of the empirical studies were analysed and RQ 1 could be answered. Transition phase is the period between two different vehicle owners and/or two different ways of utilizing the truck. The analysis also gave a good picture of how the trucks are used during their life and in the transition phases, which gave an idea about usage patterns that could answer RQ 2. The answer was formulated as something named phase-DNA, composed by six parameters that should change during a transition phase: Geography, Route, Driver, Traffic Condition, Assignments and Services. Through a group brainstorming with experts in connected services, ideas of which data {{that could be used to}} describe each one of the parameters in the phase-DNA were found. These were sorted and evaluated until at least one data type for each parameter was set. The specific data types were chosen because they reflected their parameter well and because they were data that were accessible in order to conduct tests and validations. The final set of data types consisted of: Route Shape, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Idle Time, Distance Driven, Coasting, Driver ID, Average Speed, Fuel Consumption and Workshop History Data. This set of data types was used for the formulation of a hypothesis, that said that after a transition phase at least some of these data types should change. This was also the point where RQ 3 was answered. II The hypothesis was analysed using an exploratory analysis by plotting all the data types over time and observing if a change could be seen close to the change of ownership. The result showed that Amount of Stops and Driver ID were the most indicative data types, these two were further analysed with a statistical hypothesis test and a visualisation method. The results were used to develop an algorithm that is able to give an indication if a transition phase has occurred. The algorithm searches for changes in the six data types: Driver ID, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Distance Driven, Idle Time and Route Shape. The results from the empirical studies were used to define requirements for the development of a service based on the information of phase transition called transition alert service (TAS), which is the answer to RQ 4. Furthermore possible stakeholders that could be interested in the transition phase information were investigated together with an examination of their needs. TAS fulfils the five main needs identified from the stakeholders: ease start and cancellation of services, avoid unnecessary telecom expenses, avoid that information goes to the wrong customer, find new customers and customize services. In order to solve this, an algorithm detecting a transition phase was developed; it was done by searching for changes in the six data types: Driver ID, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Distance Driven, Idle Time and Route Shape. Moreover if the TAS information is combined with other information it could be used for creating new services. Through different idea generation workshops a large number of new ideas and concepts were generated, which became the answer to RQ 5. In total eleven applications for the transition alert service were developed: nine connected to change in ownership and two connected to change in utilization. Additionally, one support service named "Vehicle History" that is based on collected historical TAS was created. Further, one total solution named "No Worries Second-Hand" was created that includes five of the developed services. This total solution offers the customer the perfectly suitable second-hand truck without having to spend time searching for it. It also consists of a contract saying that if the customer signs a R&M contract, the dealer will buy back the vehicle and offer a new used vehicle when the old one gets too old or used. TAS makes this total solution possible by giving the dealer access to information about the truck and through this predict phase transitions. In conclusion, the developed services and especially the combination of them into a total solution would, according to the authors, favour the transition from a product focused company to a total solution provider, and extend the knowledge about the second-hand market...|$|E
