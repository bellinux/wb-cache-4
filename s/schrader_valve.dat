25|$|A <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve.</b> A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve,</b> as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. [...] Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|E

50|$|Whereas <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> {{are almost}} {{universal}} on car tires, bicycle tubes have <b>Schrader</b> or Presta <b>valves,</b> with most higher end bikes having Presta <b>valves.</b> Both the <b>Schrader</b> and the Presta types {{are good at}} sealing high pressures. Their chief differences are that <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> are larger and have springs that close the valve except when the pin is depressed. <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> are used {{in a wide variety}} of compressed gas and pressurized liquid applications such as small torch and grill cylinders, and air shocks. <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> are also viewed as more complex (requiring two seals over one), and heavier than Presta valves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> {{consist of}} a valve stem into which a poppet valve is {{threaded}} with a spring attached. They are used on virtually all automobile and motorbike tires, and on wider rimmed bicycle tires. In addition to tires, <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> of varying diameters are used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, plumbing, engine fuel injection, suspension systems, and SCUBA regulators, allowing the user to remove and attach a hose while in use.The <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> in the fuel injector rail of many automobiles {{is used as a}} quick and easy point to check fuel pressure or connect an injector cleaner cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> (also called American valve) {{is a type}} of {{pneumatic}} tire valve used on virtually every motor vehicle in the world today. The Schrader company, for which it was named, was founded in 1844 by August Schrader. The original <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> design was patented in the United States in 1893.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the rims}} of {{bicycles}} drilled for Presta valves cannot accommodate the wider <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves,</b> {{it is often}} the case that rims need to be drilled for such replacements which can structurally weaken the rim. Conversely, when a Presta valve is fitted into the larger Schrader rim hole, grommets or reducers are sometimes used to take up the extra space.|$|R
50|$|The outer {{valve stem}} is {{manufactured}} in various lengths for different applications, {{and has a}} narrower diameter (6 mm) than Dunlop and <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> (8 mm). The weakest point of a bicycle rim is usually the hole for the valve stem. The smaller hole for a Presta valve {{makes it possible to}} have extremely narrow wheels while maintaining sufficient strength in the wheel.|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{mixtures}} have environmental {{advantages and}} have success-fully replaced R 12 and R 134 a in over 200, 000 US car air-conditioners. On ten popular Australian cars, an extinguished propane torch detected ignition sources {{and carbon dioxide}} tracer measured volume and air ow for the pas-senger compartment. The insurance risk increment calculated from these measurements was negative {{because of the high}} cost of R 12 repairs. 1 Car Air-Conditioner Requirements The passenger compartment on automobiles is light, small and sealed to reduce fuel consumption and capital cost. Closed in summer sun, the compartment temperature can exceed 20 K above ambient, without cooling using vapour compression usually referred to as air-conditioning. The fuel consumption due to air-conditioning is usually less than that due to opening the windows above 60 km/hour. Car air-conditioners use a simple reversed Rankine cycle (ASHRAE 1995). Power is most efciently available if the compressor is bolted to the motor and driven through a belt and electrically operated clutch. A shaft seal is necessary which leaks. Flexible hoses must carry vapour to and from the compressor to reduce transmission of motor vibrations to the chassis and avoid uctuating stresses causing fatigue fracture. Flexible hoses and their connections leak much more than metal pipe. Permanent <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> are provided on both low and high pressure lines to the compressor, so refrigerant may be added, air released and pressure gauges attached for service. <b>Schrader</b> <b>valves</b> also leak. Typically total leakage rates from car air-conditioners vary from 0. 1 l. 0 L of liquid per year but is under 0. 2 L/year for new, quality components, correctly installed. Either a liquid lin...|$|R

50|$|A {{valve cap}} is {{important}} on a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> because {{if one is}} not fitted, dirt and water can enter {{the inside of the}} valve stem, potentially jamming it or contaminating the sealing surfaces and causing a leak.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> {{consists}} of a valve stem into which a valve core is threaded, and is used on virtually all automobile tires and motorcycle tires and most wider rimmed bicycle tires. The valve core is a poppet valve assisted by a spring.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> {{consists}} of an externally threaded hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically of nickel plated brass.

50|$|Around 1890, after {{reports of}} English cyclists' success using {{pneumatic}} tires, August Schrader saw {{the need for}} a bicycle tire valve. By 1891 he had produced the <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve,</b> which was his most popular invention and is still used today. August’s son, George, is generally credited with the experimental work that resulted in the valve's creation.|$|E

Upon opening the solenoid valve (1), the air from the reservoir is transferred to the projectile, which is fired out of the muzzle.|$|E
5000|$|Presta {{valve stems}} are 6 mm in diameter, whereas <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> stems for bicycle tires are 8 mm, thus {{requiring}} a larger diameter {{hole in a}} bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the air chuck must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation (and potentially introducing debris into the tube or the seal inside the valve), whereas the Presta valve relies on a small knurled nut to keep it shut. To fill up a bicycle tire with a Presta-valved tube {{at a gas station}} requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Bike riders also need to purchase Presta pumps, or more commonly the dual valve capable pumps for both Schrader and Presta valves. As of this point, most CO2 inflators are also Presta only, although some manufacturers are developing Schrader compatible inflator heads which use pressure to open the <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve.</b> Presta valves are also available in a wider variety of stem lengths for aero-bicycle rims. A removable core Presta valve has become common in many applications, specifically tubeless tires where the ability to introduce sealant into the tire through the stem is considered useful.|$|E
50|$|The modern vessel {{is a small}} {{container}} or tank divided in two by a rubber diaphragm. One side {{is connected to the}} pipe work of the heating system and therefore contains water. The other, the dry side, contains air under pressure, and normally a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> (car-tire type valve stem) for checking pressures and adding air. When the heating system is empty or {{at the low end of}} the normal range of working pressure, the diaphragm is pushed against the water inlet; as the water pressure increases, the diaphragm moves, compressing the air on its other side.|$|E

At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of tire valves to which the bicycle tire pump attaches. These are the Presta valve and the <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve.</b> Some pumps fit both types of valves, whereas others do not, but {{adapters}} are available that enable the pump to fit any type of valve. [...] "All valves adjustable connecting systems," [...] also known as AVACS, enable the pump to fit any type of valve found on a bicycle, and {{it also has the}} capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings. The AVACS feature is commonly available on pump models and can also be bought as a separate valve attachment.|$|E
50|$|The Dunlop valve, (also {{called a}} Woods valve or an English valve) {{is a type}} of {{pneumatic}} valve stem in use in some countries, such as Japan, Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and a number of developing countries, mostly on bicycle inner tubes. It has a wider base than a Presta valve, similar enough in size to a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> to use identically drilled valve holes in rims, but it can be inflated with a Presta valve adapter. The inner mechanism of the valve can be replaced easily, without the need for special tools. The inventor was C. H. Woods. It superseded Dunlop's original valve for pneumatic tyres.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve,</b> as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to tube and tubeless tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and test port on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft.Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve,</b> but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content.|$|E
50|$|The {{valve stem}} is a tube made of metal or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. Valve stems usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in valve stems eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the valve stem at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their valve stem is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Quick-exhaust valves (QEVs for short) are {{ready-made}} piston valves or diaphragm valves, {{designed to}} quickly exhaust pneumatic cylinders. They work somewhat similarly to pneumatically modified sprinkler valves, {{they are more}} expensive and harder to find, but also perform better. QEVs need a separate pilot valve for triggering. They can be very sensitive, triggering at a pressure drop of a few psi, so care should be taken when filling with a <b>Schrader</b> <b>valve</b> or other valves that will let out air when disconnected. Most QEVs {{are designed to be}} filled from the pilot side, and will typically work well using a 3 -way valve as the fill/pilot valve. Some QEVs will also work when filled from the chamber side. Small QEVs are sometimes used as pilots for larger valves, often to allow the use of a blowgun as the trigger...|$|E
