However, it is less well appreciated that local competition favours selection for spite, the relatively neglected ugly sister of altruism. Here, we use extensions of social evolution theory that were formulated to deal with the consequences for altruism of competition between social partners, to illustrate several points on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>spite.</b> Specifically, we show that: (i) the conditions for the evolution <b>of</b> <b>spite</b> are less restrictive than previously assumed; (ii) previous models which have demonstrated selection for spite often implicitly assumed local competition; (iii) the scale of competition must be allowed for when distinguishing different forms <b>of</b> <b>spite</b> (Hamiltonian vs. Wilsonian); (iv) local competition can enhance the spread of spiteful greenbeards; and (v) the theory makes testable predictions for how the extent <b>of</b> <b>spite</b> should vary dependent upon population structure and average relatedness...|$|R

Presented method {{is based on}} series of confusion and diffusion processes guided by user key. This method generates large key space which results bruit force attack. In <b>spites</b> <b>of</b> this, proposed algorithm is simple enough to consume fewer amounts of computations resulting fast processing. Statistical analysis of this method has been performed and result shows that proposed method is secure enough and is suitable for image encryption...|$|R
