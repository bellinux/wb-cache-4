5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is {{referent}} to economics - the title scheme {{was used for the}} arc the episode fell inside and was pitched by Greg Weisman, story editor and producer for The Spectacular Spider-Man. It also refers to the episode's theme of people competing for glory. Several scenes from the episode were taken directly from the film Spider-Man 3. Spider-Man does a leg-sweep on Sandman in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> in the film.

Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E

Another chicken character called Wendy appeared in the first broadcast episode as a reference to Debbie.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this article is to present an {{approach}} allowing the fault detection of a multivariate process with a bayesian network. As a discriminant analysis is easily modeled with a bayesian network, we will show that we we can consider the multivariate T² and MEWMA control charts as particular cases of the discriminant analysis. So, we give the structure of the bayesian network as well as the parameters of the network in order to detect faults in the multivariate space in the <b>same</b> <b>manners</b> <b>as</b> if we used multivariate control charts. The resulting bayesian network, with a computed threshold, is similar to the multivariate control charts...|$|R
5|$|The Curia of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this curia. In the first stage, the suffrage was determined in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> with the Curia of the Cities: those in the two-thirds highest tax bracket, {{with a high level}} of education, or an important office, were eligible. These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E

Its usage in the Falklands War was its most high profile and important success, where {{it was the only}} fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea Harriers shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict with two lost to enemy ground fire. They were also used to launch ground attacks in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the Harriers operated by the Royal Air Force.|$|E

The first round was split all teams into fourpools, where the teams competed in a round-robin, {{as was the case}} in the 2006 tournament. The second round used the same modified double-elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament. The final round was contested in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> both previous tournaments: the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi-final matches, the winners of which played in the championship game.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> a tree's trunk. The cells {{beneath the}} epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over {{that of a}} woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height {{in order to support}} itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the <b>same</b> <b>manner</b> <b>as</b> ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), {{with the exception of the}} noble gases.|$|E
