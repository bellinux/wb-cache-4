Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
25|$|On May 6, 1993, a court {{rejected}} her {{claims to}} the papers after finding that a July 16, 1964 letter King's husband wrote to the institute had constituted a binding charitable pledge to the university and outright stating that Martin Luther King retained ownership of his papers until giving them to the university as gifts or his death. King however, <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> had {{changed his mind about}} allowing Boston University to keep the papers. After her son Dexter took over {{as the president of the}} King Center for the second time in 1994, King was given more time to write, address issues and spend time with her parents.|$|E
25|$|Duly {{declared}} fit, {{he appeared}} {{for his second}} examination before the magistrate. His solicitor, William Clegg, tried to prove that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms with Peace than {{she was ready to}} admit, and that Dyson had been the aggressor in a struggle in which Peace had reacted in self-defence. A number of pencilled notes had been found near the scene, which appeared to have been written by Mrs. Dyson, indicating a close relationship with Peace, though she denied having written them. (At the Coroner's inquest after the murder, she <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> had seen them and declared them to be forgeries, possibly by Peace himself.) After the hearing, Peace was committed to take his trial at the Leeds Assizes, to begin on 4 February 1879.|$|E

500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it... I think the candidacy opened a door for women in national politics, and I don't regret that for one minute. I'm proud of that. But I just wish it could have been done in a different way." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{sketches}} for the Monty Python's Flying Circus television show (1969–73) were filmed {{on location in}} and around both Torquay and neighbouring Paignton. It was while staying in Torquay at the Gleneagles Hotel with the Python team in 1971, that John Cleese found inspiration (and the setting, although not the actual film location) for the popular sitcom Fawlty Towers (1975, 1979). Incidents during the Pythons' stay are said to include the owner, Donald Sinclair, having thrown Eric Idle's suitcase {{out of the window}} thinking it was a bomb. Cleese later described the eccentric owner as, [...] "the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met", although Mr. Sinclair's widow has since <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was totally misrepresented in the comedy.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{source of}} {{ammunition}} {{for both sides}} of the debate was a 1940 interview of Whitehead's wife Louise. The Bridgeport Sunday Post reported that Mrs. Whitehead said her husband's first words upon returning home from Fairfield on 14 August 1901, were an excited, [...] "Mama, we went up!" [...] Mrs. Whitehead <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was always busy with motors and flying machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories. The interview quoted her as saying, [...] "I hated to see him put so much time and money into that work."

She said she never saw any of her husband's reported flights.|$|E
2500|$|During the Sandusky trial, an accuser and Sandusky's wife Dottie both testified {{about the}} Alamo Bowl incident. The accuser said Sandusky was {{attempting}} to negotiate oral sex {{with him in the}} bathroom while Sandusky's wife was in the apartment and that she came to the [...] "edge" [...] of the bathroom for a few words with Sandusky including [...] "What are you doing in there?" [...] Mrs. Sandusky <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was having a disagreement, including yelling, with the boy—in the bathroom but [...] "clothed"—about attending a luncheon. She went on to characterize the boy as [...] "very demanding. ... And he was very conniving. And he wanted his way, and he didn’t listen a whole lot." [...] Mrs. Sandusky testified when it was still uncertain whether her husband would testify. Though Sandusky's defense attorney Joe Amendola had said on the opening day of the trial that Sandusky would testify, Amendola ultimately rested the case without calling him to testify in his own defense.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} her husband's death, King spoke at Ebenezer Baptist Church and made her first {{statement}} on his views since he had died.

[...] She brought up his ideals {{and the fact that}} he may be dead, but concluded that [...] "his spirit will never die." [...] Not very long after the assassination, Coretta took his place at a peace rally in New York City. Using notes he had written before his death, King constructed her own speech. Coretta approached the African-American entertainer and activist Josephine Baker to take her husband's place as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Baker declined after thinking it over, stating that her twelve adopted children (known as the [...] "rainbow tribe") were [...] "...too young to lose their mother". Shortly after that Mrs. King decided to take the helm of the movement herself.|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, 1980, {{at about}} 8:45a.m. CST, 33-year-old Kenneth Swyers of Overland, Missouri, {{parachute}}d {{onto the top}} of the arch. His plan was to release his main parachute and then jump off the arch using his reserve parachute to perform a base jump. Unfortunately, after landing the wind blew him to the side, and he slid down the north leg to his death. The accident was witnessed by several people, including Swyers' wife, also a parachutist. She <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> [...] "was not a hot dog, daredevil skydiver" [...] and that he had prepared for the jump two weeks in advance. Swyers, who had made over 1,600 jumps before the incident, was reported by one witness to have [...] "landed very well" [...] on {{the top of the}} arch, but [...] "had no footing." [...] Swyers was reportedly blown to the top of the arch by the wind and was unable to save himself when his reserve parachute failed to deploy. The Federal Aviation Administration said the jump was unauthorized, and investigated the pilot involved in the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Cleese {{achieved}} greater {{prominence in}} the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with his wife Connie Booth. The series won three BAFTA awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The series also featured Prunella Scales as Basil's acerbic wife Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel ("...he's from Barcelona"), and Booth as waitress Polly, the series' voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, Donald Sinclair, whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair's mantra, [...] "I could run this hotel just fine if it weren't for the guests." [...] He later described Sinclair as [...] "the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met," [...] although Sinclair's widow has <b>said</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons' stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle's briefcase {{out of the hotel}} [...] "in case it contained a bomb," [...] complained about Gilliam's [...] "American" [...] table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.|$|E
