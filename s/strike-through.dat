50|$|Like other coins, {{the value}} of errors is based, in part at least, on rarity and condition. In general, lower {{denomination}} errors are less expensive than higher denomination errors simply more such coins are minted resulting in available errors. Modern errors are generally less expensive than older errors simply because, with billions being struck, errors are made. Because of modern technology, some types of errors {{are less likely to}} occur now, but that has not seemed to have a dramatic impact on values. Some types of errors, such as clipped planchets, edge strikes, and foreign object <b>strike-throughs</b> can be faked perhaps keeping down {{the value of}} some types of mint errors. Many errors are sold ungraded because of their relatively low value. Grading services often charge more to grade a coin than it is worth. Errors are often not noted by grading services.Overdates, mules, brockage, double denomination, and struck on the wrong planchet errors are often valuable. Errors on ancient, medieval, and higher-value coins are usually detrimental to the coin's numismatic value.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of methods of preparing relatively rigid polymeric materials by tensile drawing, {{in a sense}} [...] "cold working," [...] raised the possibility that such materials {{could be used in}} the reinforcement of soils for walls, steep slopes, roadway bases and foundation soils. The principal function of geogrids is for reinforcement. This area, as with many other geosynthetics, is very active, with a number of different products, materials, configurations, etc., making up today's geogrid market. The key feature of all geogrids is that the openings between the adjacent sets of longitudinal and transverse ribs, called “apertures,” are large enough to allow for soil <b>strike-through</b> {{from one side of the}} geogrid to the other. The ribs of some geogrids are often quite stiff compared to the fibers of geotextiles. As discussed later, not only is rib strength important, but junction strength is also important. The reason for this is that in anchorage situations the soil <b>strike-through</b> within the apertures bears against the transverse ribs, which transmits the load to the longitudinal ribs via the junctions. The junctions are, of course, where the longitudinal and transverse ribs meet and are connected. They are sometimes called “nodes”.|$|E

Although a law book with annotations describes amendments to the text, the actual amendment {{is not included in}} a presentation of the constitution; only the text as the amendment revised it.

5000|$|Partial barres {{indications}} are also determined by editorial style. A vertical <b>strike-through</b> {{of the letter}} [...] "C" [...] commonly indicates a partial barre, the number of strings to be barred dependent on context and performer choice. Other editorial styles use superscript fractions (e.g. 4/6, 1/2) to indicate the number of strings to be barred {{in addition to the}} letters B or C. In some notation styles (particularly classical staff notation), the letters [...] "B" [...] or [...] "C" [...] are omitted altogether, with the number of courses to barre (from the highest-tuned downwards) written as an index (superscript). For example: on a guitar, VII4 indicates a barre on the 7th fret over the highest four strings (D, G, B, and E). There is no rule for whether full barre chords are written with indices (e.g. [...] "6" [...] for a standard guitar) or without; {{it is a matter of}} personal taste for the editor. [...] It is customary to place the barre sign above the staff, with a spanning line to mark duration.|$|E

40|$|A test is {{described}} which correlates {{the stress of}} stretching surgical gown and drape material with moist bacterial <b>strike-through.</b> By application of this test {{to a number of}} woven and nonwoven surgical gown and drape materials, it was found that not all of these materials, either woven or nonwoven, are impermeable to moist contamination for equal periods of time. Nonwoven disposable materials now in use range from those which remain impermeable to moist bacterial permeation through all tests while some remain impermeable for limited periods of time, and others almost immediately permeable to moist bacterial penetration. The same situation holds for woven materials. Under conditions of our test, Quarpel treated Pima tight-woven cotton cloth was impermeable to moist bacterial <b>strike-through,</b> through up to 75 washing and sterilizing cyclings, while ordinary linen and untreated Pima cloth permitted bacterial permeation almost immediately. These results have significance in lengthy wet surgical operations...|$|E
30|$|Surgical gown {{should be}} made out of liquid proof fabric to protect the {{blood-borne}} infectious microbes from penetrating through the fabric. Risks of patients are contamination from both endogenous and exogenous microorganisms and risk of healthcare workers are contamination from various blood-borne pathogens due to occupational exposure to patient blood and body fluids (Unsal et al. 2005). Surgical gowns should provide an effective protective barrier against the transfer of microorganisms, particulates and fluids, in addition to acting as an aseptic barrier for the patient’s protection, {{in order to minimize}} <b>strike-through</b> and the potential for personnel contamination (Rutala and Weber 2001). Due to the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses in the patient population, the barrier efficacy of protective surgical gowns have gained importance. During surgery, in an operating room, a patient’s blood can penetrate surgical gown material and possibly contaminate the surgeon’s skin, if not well protected. Several blood borne pathogens have the potential to spread in this manner, the most important being the HIV and the hepatitis B virus, which are related to AIDS and hepatitis (Loveday et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} resist fluid {{penetration}} {{was measured in}} body fabric and forearm seams of standard and reinforced non-woven disposable theatre gowns. Six standard use, non-woven gowns showed water <b>strike-through</b> in the body area at pressures ranging between 12. 1 +/- 0. 8 cmH 2 O and 23. 2 +/- 2. 2 cmH 2 O (means +/- 95 % confidence interval). Two products resisted fluid penetration of the forearm seam at pressures {{similar to that of}} the fabric alone (16. 8 +/- 1. 0 cmH 2 O and 18. 6 +/- 0. 9 cmH 2 O respectively) but other standard gowns leaked at significantly lower pressures (range 4. 6 - 6. 9 cmH 2 O). (P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). Six of seven high-protection gowns proved fluid resistant at a pressure in excess of 50 cm in the reinforced body zone but four reinforced gowns leaked at stitched arm seams at a pressure of less than 10 cmH 2 O despite an inner impermeable layer of fabric covering the forearm. Three gowns with heat or adhesive sealed reinforced arm seams resisted fluid penetration up to a pressure of 50 cmH 2 O. Standard gowns and some reinforced gowns do not offer full protection against forearm contamination through stitched seams. A gown with sealed seams and impermeable fabric should be chosen for high-risk cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} {{high-performance}} poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers {{is difficult to}} wet and impossible to chemically bond to different matrices. Sizing applied on the fiber surface usually improves fiber wetting, but prevents good adhesion between a matrix and the fiber surface. The present study demonstrates that the plasma treatment performed by Surface dielectric barrier discharge (Surface DBD) can lead to improved adhesion between sized PET fabric and polyurethane (PU) or poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) coatings. Moreover, it points out that this plasma treatment can outperform current state-of-the-art adhesion-promoting treatment. Plasma treatment of sized fabric {{was carried out in}} various gaseous atmospheres, namely N 2, N 2 + H 2 O, N 2 + AAc (acrylic acid) and CO 2. The adhesion was assessed by a peel test, while wettability was evaluated using <b>strike-through</b> time and wicking rate tests. Changes in fiber surface morphology and chemical composition were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Only the CO 2 plasma treatment resulted in improved adhesion. As indicated by the analyses, increased surface roughness and the incorporation of specific oxygen-containing groups were responsible for enhanced adhesion. The results presented were obtained using a plasma reactor suitable only for batch-wise treatment. As continuous treatment is expected to provide higher homogeneity and, therefore, even better adhesion, a scaled-up Surface DBD plasma system allowing continuous treatment is presented as well. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|E

No compatibility of face and support material can cause greater number of problems associated with apparel quality. There are too many suppliers of support material present on the market, and its very important to make an appropriate selection. Therefore, the supplier evaluation in apparel production, for face and support materials is important for the process of selection which should result in selection of right supplier. 	In this master thesis, methodology for selection of supplier of fusible interlining for man's shirts is presented. The methodology consist of performing a number of pre-production tests for the evaluation of interlining quality: bond strength, color consistence, dimensional changes, <b>strike-through,</b> strike-back, as the key quality characteristics defining the quality of fusible interlining. In the framework of pre-production tests, for the evaluation of some factors on bond strength and for optimization of fusing process conditions, Taguchi robust design was applied. The first step of supplier selection starts with identification of suppliers of support materials, evaluation of quality, and the evaluation of economic and commercial performance of potential suppliers by following criteria: quality of fusible interlining, procurements coast, supplier operational capability, financial stability and additional services offered. Evaluation of suppliers is made by numerical evaluation of sub criteria, and the final selection is made by summation of “weight” of particular features.
