25|$|The muscle fiber {{has many}} cells with a plasma {{membrane}} and outer sheath or <b>sarcolemma.</b> The <b>sarcolemma</b> is invaginated {{and can make}} contact with the tracheole carrying oxygen to the muscle fiber. Arranged in sheets or cylindrically, contractile myofibrils run the length of the muscle fiber. Myofibrils comprising a fine actin filament enclosed between a thick pair of myosin filaments slide past each other instigated by nerve impulses.|$|E
25|$|Digitalis, {{displaces}} magnesium {{into the}} cell. Digitalis causes an increased intracellular concentration of sodium, {{which in turn}} increases intracellular calcium by passively decreasing {{the action of the}} sodium-calcium exchanger in the <b>sarcolemma.</b> The increased intracellular calcium gives a positive inotropic effect.|$|E
25|$|Dystrophin {{protein is}} found in muscle fibre membrane; its helical nature allows it {{to act like a}} spring or shock absorber. Dystrophin links actin in the {{cytoskeleton}} and dystroglycans of the muscle cell plasma membrane, known as the <b>sarcolemma</b> (extracellular). In addition to mechanical stabilization, dystrophin also regulates calcium levels.|$|E
2500|$|A {{special case}} of a {{chemical}} synapse is the neuromuscular junction, in which the axon of a motor neuron terminates on a muscle fiber. In such cases, the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which binds to the acetylcholine receptor, an integral membrane protein in the membrane (the <b>sarcolemma)</b> of the muscle fiber. [...] However, the acetylcholine does not remain bound; rather, it dissociates and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, located in the synapse. This enzyme quickly reduces the stimulus to the muscle, which allows the degree and timing of muscular contraction to be regulated delicately. Some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase to prevent this control, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides diazinon and malathion.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{potential}} {{in a normal}} skeletal muscle cell {{is similar to the}} {{action potential}} in neurons. [...] Action potentials result from the depolarization of the cell membrane (the <b>sarcolemma),</b> which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; these become inactivated and the membrane is repolarized through the outward current of potassium ions. [...] The resting potential prior to the action potential is typically −90mV, somewhat more negative than typical neurons. The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2–4ms, the absolute refractory period is roughly 1–3ms, and the conduction velocity along the muscle is roughly 5m/s. [...] The action potential releases calcium ions that free up the tropomyosin and allow the muscle to contract. [...] Muscle action potentials are provoked by the arrival of a pre-synaptic neuronal action potential at the neuromuscular junction, which is a common target for neurotoxins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{same effect}} {{has been shown}} to occur in humans by other researchers. [...] Billman's more recent work has focused on {{discovering}} the biochemical mechanisms of the antiarrhythmic effects omega-3 fatty acids, and on whether the same protection can be gained through dietary omega-3 fatty acids. A 2003 review of the research suggested the effect was due to electrophysiological properties of free omega-3s in <b>sarcolemma.</b> [...] Dietary fatty acids are incorporated into membrane phospholipids and are then released during ischemia, suggesting a possible mechanism whereby the cardiac muscle is more resistant to entering arrhythmia under stress. [...] However, large-scale clinical trials of dietary omega-3s have been inconclusive, with some studies finding significant reduction in sudden cardiac death and others finding no effect. [...] Meta-analysis performed in 2014, found statistically significant reduction in sudden cardiac death (odds ratio (OR) 0.86; confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.98), while 2013 meta-analysis using a different data set found a non-statistically significant reduction (OR 0.82; CI 0.60 to 1.21).|$|E

60|$|Section 98. In {{the heart}} {{we have an}} {{intermediate}} kind of muscle cardiac muscle (Figure 2), in which the muscle fibres branch; there is apparently no <b>sarcolemma,</b> and the undivided nuclei lie in {{the centre of the}} cell.|$|E
60|$|Section 97. In {{striated}} muscle extensive modifications mask the cell character. Under a 1/4 inch objective, transverse striations of the fibres are also distinctly visible, and under {{a much higher}} power we discern in a fibre (Sheet 7) transverse columns of rod-like sarcous elements (s.e.), the columns separated by lines of dots, the membranes of Krause (k.m.), and nuclei (n.), flattened and separated into portions, and lying, in some cases, close to the <b>sarcolemma</b> (sc.) the connective tissue enclosing the fibre, in others scattered throughout {{the substance of the}} fibre. The figure shows the fibre ruptured, in order to display the sarcolemma; e.p. is the end plate of a nerve (n.v.), and fb. are the fibrillae into which a fibre may be teased.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sarcolemma</b> is {{the cell}} {{membrane}} of a {{striated muscle fiber}} and receives and conducts stimuli. At {{the end of each}} muscle fiber, the outer layer of the <b>sarcolemma</b> combines with tendon fibers. Within the muscle fiber pressed against the <b>sarcolemma</b> are multiple flattened nuclei; this multinuclear condition results from multiple myoblasts fusing to produce each muscle fiber, where each myoblast contributes one nucleus.|$|E
50|$|When the {{acetylcholine}} {{is released}} it diffuses across the synapse and binds to a receptor on the <b>sarcolemma,</b> a term unique to muscle cells {{that refers to}} the cell membrane. This initiates an impulse that travels across the <b>sarcolemma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Skeletal muscle, with <b>sarcolemma</b> labeled at upper left.|$|E
50|$|Each {{muscle cell}} is {{surrounded}} by a <b>sarcolemma.</b> As T-tubules are simply continuations of the <b>sarcolemma,</b> their membranes are very {{similar to that of the}} cell membrane, consisting of two layers of lipid (fat) molecules (known as a lipid bilayer) with proteins, including: L-type calcium channels, sodium-calcium exchangers, calcium ATPases and Beta adrenoceptors, (see below) embedded within.|$|E
50|$|Epsilon sarcoglycan {{itself is}} part of the dystrophin-associated protein (DAP) complex that binds the <b>sarcolemma</b> of muscle cells to the {{extracellular}} connective tissue. The purpose is to reduce the mechanical force on the <b>sarcolemma</b> as a result of muscle contraction. In addition to myoclonus dystonia, problems associated with a dysfunctional DAP complex include Duchenne muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5000|$|Depolarization of the <b>sarcolemma</b> and {{transmission}} {{of an action}} potential through the T-tubules.|$|E
50|$|Dystrophin is {{a protein}} located between the <b>sarcolemma</b> and the {{outermost}} layer of myofilaments in the muscle fiber (myofiber). It is a cohesive protein, linking actin filaments to another support protein that resides {{on the inside}} surface of each muscle fiber’s plasma membrane (<b>sarcolemma).</b> This support protein on the inside surface of the <b>sarcolemma</b> in turn links to two other consecutive proteins {{for a total of}} three linking proteins. The final linking protein is attached to the fibrous endomysium of the entire muscle fiber. Dystrophin supports muscle fiber strength, and the absence of dystrophin reduces muscle stiffness, increases sarcolemmal deformability, and compromises the mechanical stability of costameres and their connections to nearby myofibrils; as shown in recent studies where biomechanical properties of the <b>sarcolemma</b> and its links through costameres to the contractile apparatus were measured, and helps to prevent muscle fiber injury. Movement of thin filaments (actin) creates a pulling force on the extracellular connective tissue that eventually becomes the tendon of the muscle.|$|E
5000|$|The neuromuscular {{junction}} differs from chemical synapses between neurons. Presynaptic motor axons stop 30 nanometers from the <b>sarcolemma,</b> the cell membrane of a muscle cell. This 30-nanometer space forms the synaptic cleft through which signalling molecules are released. The <b>sarcolemma</b> has invaginations called postjunctional folds, which increase {{the surface area}} of the membrane exposed to the synaptic cleft. [...] These postjunctional folds form what {{is referred to as}} the motor endplate, which possess nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at a density of 10,000 receptors/micrometer2 in skeletal muscle. [...] The presynaptic axons form bulges called terminal boutons (or presynaptic terminals) that project into the postjunctional folds of the <b>sarcolemma.</b> The presynaptic terminals have active zones that contain vesicles, also called quanta, full of acetylcholine molecules. These vesicles can fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release ACh molecules into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis after depolarization.AChRs are localized opposite the presynaptic terminals by protein scaffolds at the postjunctional folds of the <b>sarcolemma.</b> Dystrophin, a structural protein, connects the sarcomere, <b>sarcolemma,</b> and extracellular matrix components. Rapsyn is another protein that docks AChRs and structural proteins to the cytoskeleton. Also present is the receptor tyrosine kinase protein MuSK, a signaling protein involved in the development of the {{neuromuscular junction}}, which is also held in place by rapsyn.|$|E
50|$|Transverse tubules (T-tubules) are {{extensions}} of the <b>sarcolemma</b> (muscle cell membrane) that penetrate into the centre of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. T-tubules are highly specialised structures, that form within {{the first few weeks}} of life, containing large amounts of specific proteins known as ion channels that allow for electrical impulses (action potentials) travelling along the <b>sarcolemma,</b> to enter rapidly into the cell, to initiate muscle contraction.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Intercalated discs {{are part}} of the cardiac muscle <b>sarcolemma</b> and they contain gap {{junctions}} and desmosomes.|$|E
50|$|Every single {{organelle}} and macromolecule of {{a muscle}} fiber is arranged to ensure form meets function. The cell membrane {{is called the}} <b>sarcolemma</b> with the cytoplasm known as the sarcoplasm. In the sarcoplasm are the myofibrils. The myofibrils are long protein bundles about 1 micrometer in diameter each containing myofilaments. Pressed against {{the inside of the}} <b>sarcolemma</b> are the unusual flattened myonuclei. Between the myofibrils are the mitochondria.|$|E
50|$|Myotonia {{may present}} in the {{following}} diseases with different causes related to the ion channels in the skeletal muscle fiber membrane (<b>Sarcolemma).</b>|$|E
50|$|Depolarizing {{blocking}} agents: These agents act by depolarizing the <b>sarcolemma</b> of {{the skeletal}} muscle fiber. This persistent depolarization makes the muscle fiber resistant to further stimulation by ACh.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical impulses, {{known as}} action potentials, travel along the cell {{membrane}} (<b>sarcolemma)</b> of muscle cells. [...] Located in the <b>sarcolemma</b> of smooth muscle cells are receptors, called dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR). In skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, however, these receptors are located within structures known as T-tubules, that are {{extensions of the}} plasma membrane penetrating deep into the cell (see figure 1). These DHPRs are located directly opposite to the ryanodine receptors, located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activation, by the action potential causes the DHPRs to change shape.|$|E
50|$|Sustained {{myocardial}} stretch activates tension dependent Na+/H+ exchangers, bringing Na+ ions {{into the}} sarcolemma.This increase in Na+ in the <b>sarcolemma</b> reduces the Na+ gradient exploited by sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and stops them from working effectively.Ca2+ ions accumulate inside the <b>sarcolemma</b> {{as a result}} and are uptaken by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps.Calcium induced calcium release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is increased upon stimulation of the cardiac myocyte by an action potential.This leads {{to an increase in}} the force of contraction of the cardiac muscle to try and increase stroke volume and cardiac output to maintain tissue perfusion.|$|E
50|$|In cardiomyocytes, αE-catenin {{is present}} in cell to cell regions known as adherens {{junctions}} which lie within intercalated discs; these junctions anchor the actin cytoskeleton to the <b>sarcolemma</b> and provide strong cell adhesion.|$|E
50|$|Desmin is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the DES gene. Desmin is a muscle-specific, type III {{intermediate}} filament that integrates the <b>sarcolemma,</b> Z disk, and nuclear membrane in sarcomeres and regulates sarcomere architecture.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermediate}} filaments {{are connected}} to other intermediate filaments via dense bodies, which eventually are attached to adherens junctions (also called focal adhesions) in the cell membrane of the smooth muscle cell, called the <b>sarcolemma.</b> The adherens junctions consist of large number of proteins including α-actinin, vinculin and cytoskeletal actin. The adherens junctions are scattered around dense bands that are circumfering the smooth muscle cell in a rib-like pattern. The dense band (or dense plaques) areas alternate with regions of membrane containing numerous caveolae. When complexes of actin and myosin contract, force is transduced to the <b>sarcolemma</b> through intermediate filaments attaching to such dense bands.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{skeletal}} muscle fiber {{is surrounded by}} a plasma membrane called the <b>sarcolemma,</b> which contains sarcoplasm, the cytoplasm of muscle cells. A muscle fiber is composed of many fibrils, which give the cell its striated appearance.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group of}} cells, the myosatellite cells are {{found between the}} {{basement}} membrane and the <b>sarcolemma</b> of muscle fibers. These cells are normally quiescent but can be activated by exercise or pathology to provide additional myonuclei for muscle growth or repair.|$|E
5000|$|Digitalis, {{displaces}} magnesium {{into the}} cell. Digitalis causes an increased intracellular concentration of sodium, {{which in turn}} increases intracellular calcium by passively decreasing {{the action of the}} sodium-calcium exchanger in the <b>sarcolemma.</b> The increased intracellular calcium gives a positive inotropic effect.|$|E
50|$|The sarcoglycans are {{a family}} of transmembrane {{proteins}} (α, β, γ, δ or ε) involved in the protein complex responsible for connecting the muscle fibre cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, preventing damage to the muscle fibre <b>sarcolemma</b> through shearing forces.|$|E
5000|$|PKG also {{activates}} the <b>sarcolemma</b> calcium pump {{to remove}} activating calcium. PKG acts on K+ channels to promote K+ efflux {{and the ensuing}} hyperpolarization inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels. Overall, this leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and coronary vasodilation.|$|E
50|$|Diazoxide (INN; {{brand name}} Proglycem) is a {{potassium}} channel activator, which causes local relaxation in smooth muscle by increasing membrane permeability to potassium ions. This switches off voltage-gated calcium ion channels, preventing calcium flux across the <b>sarcolemma</b> and {{activation of the}} contractile apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Neuromuscular {{junction}} diseases can be {{of genetic}} and autoimmune origin. Genetic disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction, whereas autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, occur when antibodies are produced against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the <b>sarcolemma.</b>|$|E
50|$|External lamina is a {{structure}} similar to basal lamina {{that surrounds the}} <b>sarcolemma</b> of muscle cells. It is secreted by myocytes and consists primarily of Collagen type IV, laminin and perlecan (heparan sulfate proteoglycan). Nerve cells, including perineurial cells and Schwann cells also have an external lamina-like protective coating.|$|E
