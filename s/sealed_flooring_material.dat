40|$|The present research, {{studies the}} {{feasibility}} of replacing part of the PVC {{in the formulation of}} <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> by lignin, an abundant and renewable natural polymer. The utilization of lignin, is aimed to develop more cost-effective <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> with appreciable mechanical properties, to decrease their susceptibility to microbial attack, to decrease the amount of VOC's release, and to explore a market for lignin. To evaluate the role of lignin, a series of <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> with different proportions of lignin, are obtained, based on the investigation into the use of plasticizers for reducing the degree of association existing within lignin, macromolecules, The mechanical and thermal properties, as well as the processibility of the obtained materials are tested. As a result of the present study, an alternative <b>flooring</b> <b>material</b> is attempted with appreciable properties, such as Young's modulus, tensile strength at break and at yield, elongation at break, as well as impact and hardness tests.

40|$|Ongoing {{structural}} changes within the forest sector, competition with substitute materials in construction business and rising stakeholder pressure towards actions of environmentally sensitive forest sector are pushing extra {{challenges to the}} communication efforts of forest sector. Communication has an essential role when promoting the favorable characteristics of wood products and influencing perceptions of stakeholders but inapplicable messages or channels may cause obstacles for effective communication. The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine what kind of information forest sector provides to consumers related to sustainability features of wooden <b>floor</b> <b>materials.</b> Sustainability communication is defined using sustainability dimensions. Additionally, aim is to evaluate how important different type of information is for consumers purchasing wooden <b>floor</b> <b>materials</b> and to find the meaning of various communication channels for consumers in obtaining sustainability-related information. Additionally, also the communication planning is approached in the study by scrutinizing, what communication should be and could be. Data collection was conducted using quantitative questionnaire survey. Consumers of wooden <b>floor</b> <b>materials</b> were included as a consumer group of interest and survey was conducted to 52 respondents in a special wooden <b>floor</b> <b>material</b> store using exit method. Communication was approached from the theoretical view of communication process. Results of this study underline the significance of the personnel as the method to tailor the communication of sustainability. When communicating the benefits of wooden <b>floor</b> <b>materials,</b> focus should be on health aspects of wooden floor and additionally in safety issues as these were most appreciated by respondents. According to the results of this study, communication efforts should be put on tailoring communication according to the content of the sustainability messages, as {{there seemed to be no}} significant dependency in sustainability communication perceptions between different stakeholder segments...|$|R

40|$|Gasoline, {{as one of}} the {{flammable}} liquids, is used commonly in arson. Due to its typical fluidity and permeability, particular burn patterns can {{be formed}} in fire scene. In order to provide references for fire investigators to collect trace evidences and identify fire cause accurately, the burn patterns on different <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> are investigated in this paper. Two polymer <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> (Polypropylene fiber and Polyvinyl chloride coil) were selected in the experiments to study the burn pattern characteristics by simulating the fire scene. By comparing the difference of the burning pattern with and without gasoline, rules of pattern characteristics on different material surface have been summarized. Meanwhile, fire extinguishing style was considered in this work. The results show that the burn pattern characteristics become remarkably different when the <b>flooring</b> <b>materials</b> loaded by gasoline. In addition, fire extinguishing style has a great impact on the burn patterns, such as the carbonized degree, the residual shape and the fire traces.
