50|$|There {{are five}} species of lizard {{in the nature}} reserve, six snakes and an amphisbaenian. This last is a small, {{subterranean}} reptile that has no legs and no eyes. The most common lizard is the small green or brown Iberian wall lizard. The larger Algerian sand racer and the mainly nocturnal Moorish gecko are also common. Rarer lizards are the Turkish gecko and the ocellated lizard. Snakes include the horseshoe whip snake, Montpellier snake, <b>southern</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>snake,</b> false smooth snake, grass snake and ladder snake.|$|E
50|$|Cotton swab studies {{emitting}} predatory chemosensory signals {{have also}} been performed in order to quantify the Iberian worm lizard's anti-predatory response mechanisms. Swabs exhibiting signals from predators like the <b>southern</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>snake,</b> Coronella girondica, the scolopendromorph centipede (Scolopendra), and the Bedriaga's skink, Chalcides bedriagai were all tested. Again, the amount and rate of tongue flicks was used to quantify the anti-predatory response, {{as well as any}} defensive acts taken upon the swab. High rates of tongue flicks were seen for all three predator chemicals with defensive biting by B. cinereus subjects on the swabs smelling like snake or centipede. While a conclusive statement cannot be made about the hierarchy of predators based on tongue flicks, the self-defense response would indicate the skink as being the greatest threat to B. cinereus.|$|E

40|$|Predictive {{models of}} species {{distribution}} {{may be very}} useful for understanding actual distribution of elusive species, including several snakes. The <b>southern</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> (Coronella girondica) is likely the most elusive snake species of peninsular Italy, and is therefore well-suited for predicting potential distribution studies. In this paper we predict the potential distribution map of this species in Italy by using MAXENT algorithm, that finds the probability distribution of maximum entropy that is constrained by considered ecological parameters. Presence data for Coronella girondica were gotten from CKmap. The potential distribution model of Coronella girondica showed a very good overall performance (AUC = 0. 959), and indicated that high suitability areas correspond mainly to Tyrrhenian north and central regions, including Liguria, western Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, and northern Latium. Southern Italian regions were clearly unsuitable for this snake species. Overall, our study revealed that previous distribution maps indicating the occurrence of Coronella girondica in southern Italy and Sicily were poorly reliable. The conservation and management implications of our study are also addressed...|$|E

40|$|Heathland in the UK, {{and parts}} of {{mainland}} Europe, is being managed increasingly by landowners and statutory conservation bodies e. g., Natural England, using cattle grazing which {{is often referred to}} as 'conservation grazing' in an attempt to justify its use in the absence of any detailed prior research into its actual benefits for wildlife species whose individual habitat requirements are likely to vary. Over four years, between 2010 and 2013, cattle were excluded from six hectares of lowland heath that had been subject to annual summer cattle grazing between May 1997 and autumn 2009 and in which reptile numbers had been monitored annually since 1997. Changes in <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> (Coronella austriaca) numbers were recorded annually in the ungrazed area and in a four hectare area of heathland adjacent to it that continued to be grazed. The number of individual <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes,</b> and the total number of <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> captures, were significantly higher in the ungrazed heath than the grazed heath and were associated with increased habitat structure, resulting principally from tall heathers and grasses. The results of the study suggest that the use of cattle grazing as a management tool on lowland heath is detrimental to <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> populations and that their recovery, following the cessation of grazing, may take many years...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of a parasitic nematode of slow worms, Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum, was also investigated using PCR primers. Prevalence was higher in {{males and females}} in April. Analysis of <b>smooth</b> <b>snake</b> diet confirmed that predation on reptiles was high but revealed increasing consumption of small mammals with age. Predation on reptiles by grass snakes was higher than expected and suggests competition may exist between <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> and grass snakes at a juvenile stage. Overall, these results provide information pertinent to translocation and reintroduction programmes along with conservation management strategies.

40|$|Reptiles {{are declining}} {{in many parts}} of the world, mainly due to habitat loss and {{environmental}} change. A major factor in this is availability of suitable food. For many animals, dietary requirements shift during developmental stages and a habitat will only be suitable for conserving a species if it supports all stages. Conventional methods for establishing diet often rely on visual recognition of morphologically identifiable features of prey in faeces, regurgitation or stomach contents, which suffer from biases and poor resolution of taxa. DNA-based techniques facilitate noninvasive analysis of diet from faeces without these constraints. We tested the hypothesis that diet changes during growth stages of <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> (Coronella austriaca), which have a highly restricted distribution in the UK but are widespread in continental Europe. Small numbers of the sympatric grass snake (Natrix natrix) were analysed for comparison. Faecal samples were collected from snakes and prey DNA analysed using PCR, targeting amphibians, reptiles, mammals and invertebrates. Over 85 % of <b>smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> were found to have eaten reptiles and 28 % had eaten mammals. Predation on mammals increased with age and was entirely absent among juveniles and subadults. Predation on reptiles did not change ontogenetically. <b>Smooth</b> <b>snakes</b> may, therefore, be restricted to areas of sufficiently high reptile densities to support young snakes...|$|R
