These mechanisms initiate and grow cracks in chrome molybdenum headers, from the bore hole edges and stub tube-to-header welds.

In order to extend the header life and operate safely, a better understanding of crack growth that may occur during specific plant operating conditions is needed. With that understanding, harsh operating conditions that may be causing excessive crack propagation and header damage can be curtailed. Acoustic emission monitoring of headers was performed to assist in identifying operating conditions that lead to header damage.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} application of Distributed Digital Controls in order to review {{the application of}} this recent control technology towards Steam Boilers in a step-by-step manner. The main purpose of a steam generating boiler is to supply enough steam to meet process demands. Steam conditions must remain as stable as possible, because variations in the steam system can affect downstream processes. Pressure variations in the steam supply header, for example, can have a severe effect on heat transferred to a process. If that process suffers an upset, unstable conditions can propagate from one process to another via the steam supply system. The closer the tolerance in the boiler control system, the smaller the <b>steam</b> <b>header</b> disturbances will be. This reduces the interaction, or 'coupling', of upsets between steam-consuming processes. Also, it may reduce the complexity of instrumentation needed for those processes.

40|$|Components in {{advanced}} gas cooled reactor (AGR) operating at elevated {{temperatures in the}} range of 500 - 650 °C are typically susceptible to the initiation and growth of cracks due to creep. Type 316 H stainless steel <b>steam</b> <b>headers</b> after a long term service are susceptible to reheat cracking {{in the vicinity of the}} weld driven by the presence of welding residual stresses. For this reason, this research has focused on developing pragmatic numerical methods for predicting creep crack growth behaviour of welded components containing residual stresses, using a simplified continuum damage and fracture mechanics method. The work presented had three main aims. The first was to derive a comprehensive set of plastic η factors for standard fracture mechanics geometries containing welds. The impetus for this was to improve material crack growth characterisation for welds by improving the creep C* solutions for these geometries that are presently recommended in standard codes of practice for creep crack growth testing. The second part was to experimentally examine appropriate creep material properties for as-received and service-exposed 316 H stainless steels containing welds for use in numerical modelling and predictive methods for creep crack growth in a real component. The third was to develop and validate a simplified method of simulating residual stresses and creep crack growth behaviour in an ex-service AISI 316 H weld header with reheat cracking. This approach simulates the presence of residual stresses using appropriate loading and boundary conditions in actual components that undergo reheat cracking without the need to develop full weld simulations to quantify them. The creep crack growth behaviour was studied using two methods based on the theories of fracture mechanics and continuum damage mechanics. Fracture mechanics parameter C* was firstly used to examine the approximate crack growth rate using the reference stress approach and approximate NSW model. The second method was to predict long term cracking by using a simplified continuum damage mechanics model, with a consideration of stress relaxation. For this purpose, a simplified multi-axial ductility exhaustion model was developed and implemented in an Abaqus user subroutine, taking into account the changes in the ex-service creep properties and the effect of reduction in creep ductility under low loads and long term operation at service temperatures. Resulting from the findings, the task was to identify the geometric and the material reasons of how and why the crack growth follows a path of least resistance and higher constraint which did not necessarily mean growing through the welds or the heat affected zone region.

40|$|Improving {{the steam}} cycle design to {{maximize}} power generation is demonstrated using pinch analysis targeting techniques. Previous work models the steam pressure level in composite curves {{based on its}} saturation temperature alone. The present work examines the effect of including both sensible and latent heating of steam in the composite curve. It is shown that including sensible heating allows for better thermal matching between the process and steam system which results in improving the overall efficiency while minimizing the capital cost. Additionally, fixed <b>steam</b> <b>headers,</b> such as assumed in total site analysis, give no allowance for reheating before turbine expansion, which can be valuable to consider when optimizing the steam system for certain plant configurations. A case study using an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is analyzed to assess changes in steam cycle design on the plant efficiency and cost. In addition to improving the steam system within an IGCC plant to improve efficiency, losses within the radiant heat exchanger can also be reduced. Instead of using high temperature syngas, cooling from 1300 °C to 760 °C, to boil steam at 330 °C, another heat transfer fluid can be used and heated to higher temperatures. Material constraints restrict the maximum allowable temperature of the heat transfer fluid. To maintain high heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer fluid, a fluid with high thermal conductivity, such as a liquid metal, can be used and heated to high temperatures (~ 700 °C). Liquid metals can then act as an intermediate heat transfer medium, absorbing heat from high temperature syngas and rejecting it to steam at temperatures in excess of 500 °C. The use of liquid metals leads to a 0. 75 point increase in plant efficiency. Gases, such as carbon dioxide and helium, are also considered as potential heat transfer fluids in the radiant heat exchanger. These gases can be at equal pressure to the syngas pressure in the radiant heat exchanger, reducing the tensile stress in tube walls, but their low thermal conductivities still necessitate high strength materials at high temperature. A Brayton power cycle with recuperation is considered in this work, absorbing heat from the hot syngas and rejecting it to steam. Over a range of different Brayton cycle pressure ratios and maximum temperatures, no improvement in plant efficiency was found {{with respect to the}} case where steam is boiled in the same sized heat exchanger. by Barbara Brenda Botros.

Since {{all of these factors}} can be quantified, and because a standard procedure can be defined for evaluating in-plant cogeneration opportunities, this task is ideally suited for a digital computer. This paper discusses the development and methodology of a microcomputer program to analyze in-plant cogeneration opportunities. User-oriented features of the program are highlighted and thermodynamic and financial computational routines are discussed. The results obtained by this program for a case study are presented...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{electrical}} power production from renewable sources {{has led to}} changing demands {{in the field of}} conventional power plants in recent years in Germany. Coal-fired power plants that have been designed for Base load operation must withstand frequent start-up and shut-down cycles at present and in the future. Therefore, thick-walled components {{have a negative impact on}} the required flexibility and the life expectancy of these components. The exchange (retrofit) of these components and the commercial impact on an economically optimized operation of the power plant, as well as the financial effect of the exchange of such critical components are investigated in this work. As an example a thick-walled <b>steam</b> outlet <b>header</b> was selected. Different materials and different loading characteristics (number of warm and hot starts) including start-up gradients were taken as variables during the optimization process. The component design is based on EN standards. Economic results of the retrofit of critical components were investigated with sensitivity studies. The results show, that material and manufacturing costs are less important compared to the loading characteristics (i. e. number of starts), the electricity price and the fuel costs. Even the change in the design specifications, with a resulting reduction in the wall thickness, leads to improved flexibility in the plant operation and an economic benefit, even without the use of different materials. Due to the modular design of the implemented methods, this optimization can be easily adapted to other components...|$|R
