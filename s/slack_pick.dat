25|$|While {{the first}} two full seasons in Hartford were not {{glittering}} (the Whalers recorded losing records both years), the final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes–50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards John McKenzie, Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed of the league's best defense. The next season was not so fine, however, but while age {{finally caught up with}} Gordie Howe, the <b>slack</b> was <b>picked</b> up by Andre Lacroix, the WHA's all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{has been}} Japan's largest {{economic}} partner, taking 31.5 {{percent of its}} exports, supplying 22.3 percent of its imports, and accounting for 45.9 percent of its direct investment abroad in 1990. As of 2013, the United States takes up 18% of Japanese exports, and supplies 8.5% of its imports (the <b>slack</b> having been <b>picked</b> up by China, which now provides 22%).|$|R
5000|$|... 1996-97 saw {{the arrival}} of Russian phenom Sergei Samsonov and IHL All-Star Stan Drulia to the Vipers. Drulia led the team in scoring and Samsonov would win Rookie of the Year honors as the Vipers won another {{division}} title. Detroit would advance to their first Turner Cup Final, against the Long Beach Ice Dogs. Led by Samsonov and Peter Ciavaglia, the Vipers won the series four games to two for their first Turner Cup. Samsonov would be a high first round draft pick of the Boston Bruins, but the <b>slack</b> was <b>picked</b> up in 1997-98 by 40 goals from Dan Kesa as the Vipers won their third division title in four years. They would advance to the Turner Cup Finals against the Chicago Wolves, but after going up three games to two, would {{only be able to}} score one goal in the final two games and lost four games to three. 1997-98 also saw a one shift comeback from Gordie Howe, making him the only person to play hockey in six different decades as a professional.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Jagu for his help in probing the {{subtleties}} of space and time, and for always sending me in a useful direction when I hit a block. His guidance was integral to the integrals (and other equations) contained herein. The Physics Department of Amherst College taught me everything I know, and I am grateful to them. I {{would also like to thank}} my family, especially my parents, for their love and support, and my grandfather, Herman Stone, for inspiring me to study the sciences. They have always encouraged me to push myself and are willing to lend a helping hand whenever I need it. Wing, Devindra, Lucia, Maryna, and Ina, my suitemates, are owed thanks as well for helping me relax and feel at home, and for not playing video games all the time. The <b>slack</b> was <b>picked</b> up by Matt, whose lightheartedness has kept me optimistic even in the darkest times. To all who have made me laugh this past year, thank you. Lastly, I {{would like to}} thank Vanessa Eve Hettinger for her warmth and love. She fended off distractions and took good care of me, and she is always there when I need a hug. I don’t know what this year would have been like without her...|$|R
5000|$|When the {{business}} was closed by its parent company in January 2012, the <b>slack</b> was quickly <b>picked</b> up by former staffers in a newly created company, Country Travel DISCOVERIES. Led by Steve Uelner, who had served as WWCT's Director for over 25 years, Country Travel DISCOVERIES has continued to offer a similar type and quality of [...] "off-the-beaten-path" [...] tours focused on rural settings and the country lifestyle that travelers had experienced and learned to expect from World Wide Country Tours. Continuity with the World Wide Country Tours legacy {{can be seen in}} the tours, past WWCT traveler testimonials, and letter by Roy Reiman on Country Travel DISCOVERIES' website at www.countrytraveldiscoveries.com, as well as in its partnership with new magazines published by Reiman, including Our Iowa Magazine [...] and Our Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|Fly reels, or fly casting reels, {{with a few}} exceptions, {{are really}} little more than line-storage devices. In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel {{with one hand while}} casting and {{manipulating}} the rod with the other. <b>Slack</b> line is <b>picked</b> up by rotating the reel spool. Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large arbors to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs. In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with sealed bearing and drive mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|With three leading ladies on {{maternity}} leave, the <b>slack</b> was <b>picked</b> up by Martha Byrne, who {{had played}} Lily Snyder on and off since 1985 and now tackled a dual role. While walking at the Snyder pond one day, Lily found some old love letters made out to [...] "Beloved." [...] Lily found a picture of [...] "Beloved" [...] and was startled to find she looked exactly like her. When Lily posted the picture of [...] "Beloved" [...] on the Internet, she found out that somebody in Atlantic City had exactly the same picture. Meanwhile, Lily was remodeling her home {{with the help of}} a mysterious Australian named Simon Frasier (Paul Leyden). Simon was after the [...] "Rose of Sharon," [...] a priceless diamond that his family member had given to Beloved. When Lily went to Atlantic City (where she met her doppelgänger, Rose D'Angelo), Simon followed. Lily found the diamond that she had read about in the letters Simon's grandfather had written to [...] "Beloved", and accidentally came to possess it. Though fighting for her life while being chased by Simon and his insane sister Celia (Fiona Hutchison), Lily had become friends with Rose and didn’t want to lose the priceless heirloom. The psychotic Celia didn’t want Simon to find the diamond, so she proceeded to leave them on a deserted island, while Rose, convinced by a cryptic phone message that Lily was not coming home, settled into the rich Lily’s life. Rose gradually fell in love with Holden and Lily (in a case of Stockholm syndrome) with Simon. Rose was discovered to have been Lily’s identical twin, as their mother (Iva) had been drugged during the birth. The two initially hated each other, but gradually formed a bond at Lucinda’s insistence.|$|R
5000|$|Things looked bright {{when the}} Canucks went 6-1-1 in the {{pre-season}} {{and on an}} early-season visit to Edmonton ended a three-year, 27-game winless streak against the Oilers with a 6-2 victory. Though they would only lose by more than three goals once all season, goal production was a problem. Both Tony Tanti (47 points) and Stan Smyl (25) had big drop-offs in production and, by association, so did Greg D. Adams (33) and Barry Pederson (41). The scoring <b>slack</b> was <b>picked</b> up somewhat by Petri Skriko (66 points), Linden (59), and by Reinhart (57) and Nordmark (41). Even with that, however, by mid-season the Canucks were only producing results that were marginally better than the previous few seasons and only remained in the playoff race due to an unexpectedly poor season by Winnipeg. A club-record seven-game winning streak in February changed the team's outlook. Jim Sandlak was the hero in the seventh win, a tight-checking game against Toronto that was played {{in front of a}} packed house and a national television audience. His rebound goal with 18 seconds to play in overtime off of a Snepsts point shot after an offensive-zone face-off win by Linden sent the home crowd into a frenzy. People around the league were now taking notice. Don Cherry hopped on the Canucks bandwagon and on Coach's Corner wore a button declaring [...] "I vote Trevor Linden NHL Rookie-of-the-Year 1989". Those buttons became a common site around town that spring. In the game following the seventh win, the Canucks lost 3-2 in Montreal to end the streak, but Linden scored twice to tie and pass Ivan Hlinka's club record for rookie goal scoring. He finished with 30—tied with Skriko for the team lead. These new heroes would continue to delight the Coliseum faithful, as they racked up a 12-game home unbeaten streak (11-0-1). The Canucks nailed down a playoff spot on March 23 and threatened to overtake Edmonton for third place in the Smythe before tapering off {{in the last couple of}} weeks. The 74 points would earn them a playoff date against the NHL's number one team in the regular season, the Calgary Flames.|$|R
