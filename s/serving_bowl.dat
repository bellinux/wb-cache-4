This {{is due to the}} fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing {{communal}} side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same <b>serving</b> <b>bowl</b> on the table.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} how common serving bowls containing food for multiple persons influence serving behavior and consumption {{and whether they}} do so independently of satiation and food evaluation. Methods: In this between-subjects experiment, 68 participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either a group serving pasta from a large-sized bowl (6. 9 -L capacity) or a medium-sized bowl (3. 8 -L capacity). Results: Analysis of covariance showed that when given a large-sized bowl, diners served 77 % more pasta (364. 0 versus 205. 5 g; P . 32). Conclusions and Implications: In contrast to those in studies involving larger-sized plates and spoons, people serving from larger bowls felt more satiated. These findings again highlight the role that external cues play in food consumption and show the importance of considering <b>serving</b> <b>bowl</b> size in nutrition education...|$|E
