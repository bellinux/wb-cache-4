5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English. It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> languages combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides have names with <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.|$|E
5|$|Scots {{is today}} {{considered}} a separate language from English, {{but it has}} its origins in early Northern Middle English and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> and Old Norse. Scots itself {{has a number of}} regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.|$|E

It was performed simultaneously at six venues in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Scotland over the summer solstice of 2007.

5|$|The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides {{who speaks}} in chamber debates {{and the amount}} of time for which they are allowed to speak. Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between {{different}} viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use <b>Scots,</b> <b>Gaelic,</b> or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.|$|E

25|$|The Cornish {{language}} is a language from the Brythonic branch of the Celtic language family, {{closely related to the}} other Brythonic languages of Welsh and Breton, and less so to the Goidelic languages of Irish, <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> and Manx.

25|$|Newfoundland {{was also}} the only place outside Europe {{to have its own}} {{distinct}} name in Irish: Talamh an Éisc, which means 'land of the fish'.

5000|$|The {{epitome of}} PEI musical {{culture is the}} fiddle, piano and step dancer. The Ceilidh (<b>Scot's</b> <b>Gaelic</b> for {{gathering}} essentially) {{has long been the}} most common place for this type of music to be found. This music was imported straight from the Highlands of Scotland and remained unchanged for centuries. On the island it mixed with Irish and Acadian musical tradition, but Scottish style still dominates. Today musicians on the island are expanding beyond the fiddle in many cases, incorporating other Celtic instruments. Traditional Celtic Music on the island also takes the form of popular Maritime or East Coast Music, which is what some have described as an amalgam of Celtic Music and Sea Shanties. This type of music is also heavily influenced by the traditions of Newfoundland and is very commonly found in Pubs all over Atlantic Canada.|$|R
25|$|Kilmacolm is {{generally}} believed {{to take its}} name from the <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> language, meaning cell or church of Columba, derived from the dedication of an ancient church to St. Columba of Iona. This {{is generally}} associated with the religious cell which was established in the sixth or seventh century {{on the site of the}} current parish church. The current parish church, known as the Old Kirk, was largely constructed in the 19th century and incorporates parts an older 13th century Norman church, which has become the Murray Chapel.|$|E
25|$|The dialect {{spoken in}} Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish), {{is the one}} closest to Scottish Gaelic (which {{developed}} into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic,</b> and the dialects of east Ulster – those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim – were {{very similar to the}} dialect of Argyll, the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. And those dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the river once abounded in flightless moa, predated upon by the Haast's eagle. The river was known by the Māori as Mata-au, meaning current or eddy in an expanse of water. This name, now more {{frequently}} rendered as Matau, is still used for one of the two main channels of the Clutha delta. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 Māori close to the river's banks. The river takes its European name from Cluaidh, the <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> name for the River Clyde in Scotland which runs through Glasgow. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by Captain Cook. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy.|$|E
50|$|Bungi is a creole {{based on}} Scottish English, <b>Scots,</b> Scottish <b>Gaelic,</b> Cree, and Ojibwe. Some French words {{have also been}} {{incorporated}} into its lexicon.

500|$|The {{origin of}} Hirta, which long pre-dates St Kilda, is {{similarly}} open to interpretation. Martin (1703) avers that [...] "Hirta {{is taken from}} the Irish Ier, which in that language signifies west". Maclean offers several options, including an (unspecified) Celtic word meaning [...] "gloom" [...] or [...] "death", or the <b>Scots</b> <b>Gaelic</b> h-Iar-Tìr ("westland"). Drawing on an Icelandic saga describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions {{a visit to the}} islands of [...] "Hirtir", he speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a stag, (Hirtir meaning [...] "stags" [...] in Norse). Steel (1998) quotes the view of Reverend Neil Mackenzie, who lived there from 1829 to 1844, that the name is derived from the Gaelic Ì Àrd ("high island"), and a further possibility that it is from the Norse Hirt ("shepherd"). In a similar vein, Murray (1966) speculates that the Norse Hirðö, pronounced 'Hirtha' ("herd island"), could be the origin. All the names of and on the islands are fully discussed by Coates (1990).|$|E
