We present here an exact {{solution for the}} magnetic field of an ideal solenoid in an especially easy to use form. The field is {{expressed in terms of}} a single function that can be rapidly computed by means of a compact, highly efficient algorithm, which can be coded as an add-in function to a <b>spreadsheet,</b> making <b>field</b> calculations accessible even to introductory students. In computational work these expressions are not only accurate but also just as fast as most approximate expressions. We demonstrate their utility by numerically simulating the experiment of dropping a cylindrical magnet through a nonmagnetic conducting tube and then comparing the calculation with data obtained from experiments suitable for an undergraduate laboratory.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics {{conducts a}} {{nationwide}} census of ferry boat operators for the U. S. Department of Transportation and the collected information {{is used for}} statistical purposes. The Caltrans Division of Local Assistance has been asked by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to gather data regarding ferry operations under MAP- 21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act. MAP- 21 includes a new formula program for ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities eligible under 23 USC 129 (c) which authorizes federal participation in toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ferries. FHWA has asked that Caltrans assure the ferry boat data is current for MAP- 21. The Mineta Transportation Institute was contacted by Caltrans to conduct this research. The research team compiled a spreadsheet and accompanying maps that include ferry boats, routes, and operators along {{with a number of}} related characteristics including ownership (public or private), daily trip counts, regulation of fares, terminal locations (street address and coordinates), boarding statistics, and route segment lengths. The <b>spreadsheet</b> contains <b>fields</b> that will allow it to be linked in a Geographic Information System to Caltrans Earth software for further analysis. Additionally, where relevant, the report includes a brief description of expansion plans for certain ferry service providers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary care {{serves as}} an {{integral}} part of the health systems of nations especially the African continent. It is the portal of entry for nearly all patients into the health care system. Paucity of accurate data for health statistics remains a challenge in the most parts of Africa because of inadequate technical manpower and infrastructure. Inadequate quality of data systems contributes to inaccurate data. A simple-to-use classification system such as the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) may be a solution to this problem at the primary care level. Objectives: To apply ICPC- 2 for secondary coding of reasons for encounter (RfE), problems managed and processes of care in a Nigerian primary care setting. Furthermore, to analyze the value of selected presented symptoms as predictors of the most common diagnoses encountered in the study setting. Materials and Methods: Content analysis of randomly selected patients' paper records for data collection at the end of clinic sessions conducted by family physicians at the general out-patients' clinics. Contents of clinical consultations were secondarily coded with the ICPC- 2 and recorded into excel <b>spreadsheets</b> with <b>fields</b> for sociodemographic data such as age, sex, occupation, religion, and ICPC elements of an encounter: RfE/complaints, diagnoses/problems, and interventions/processes of care. Results: Four hundred and one encounters considered in this study yielded 915 RfEs, 546 diagnoses, and 1221 processes. This implies an average of 2. 3 RfE, 1. 4 diagnoses, and 3. 0 processes per encounter. The top 10 RfE, diagnoses/common illnesses, and processes were determined. Through the determination of the probability of the occurrence of certain diseases beginning with a RfE/complaint, the top five diagnoses that resulted from each of the top five RfE were also obtained. The top five RfE were: headache, fever, pain general/multiple sites, visual disturbance other and abdominal pain/cramps general. The top five diagnoses were: Malaria, hypertension uncomplicated, visual disturbance other, peptic ulcer, and upper respiratory infection. From the determination of the posterior probability given the top five RfE, malaria, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, refractive error, and conjuctivitis were the five most frequent diagnoses that resulted from a complaint of a headache. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that ICPC- 2 can be applied to primary care data in the Nigerian context to generate information about morbidity and services provided. It also provided an empirical basis to support diagnosis and prognostication in a primary care setting. In developing countries where the transition to electronic health records is still evolving and fraught with limitations, more reliable data collection can be achieved from paper records through the application of the ICPC- 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This data set consists of twenty Excel spreadsheets (. xlsx format) — {{one for each}} language represented in the Oto-Manguean Inflectional Class Database. Each spreadsheet provides a list of verbs, together with information pertaining to the inflectional exponents of these verbs and details regarding their membership in inflectional classes. Each row in the spreadsheets is a unique record, containing the details for a single verb. Each column in a <b>spreadsheet</b> is a <b>field</b> common to all records for that language. Each file {{can be used as}} a stand-alone data set in its own right; given that each language is a unique system, and each file encodes different information for each language. Project description: Grammatical meaning is expressed by changes in word form (inflection) : for example, in English, the ending -s is added to a verb form to show that it has a third person singular subject in the present tense. This is fairly simple. In other languages the systems are more intricate. In Spanish, the ending for 'we' in 'we sing' (cant-amos) differs from the one in 'we want' (quer-emos), which in turn differs from the one in 'we open' (abr-imos). Such inflectional classes are apparently useless: the variation is independent of meaning, and must simply be memorised. But these systems are widely found, highly structured, and remarkably resilient over time. They represent a unique sort of complexity with implications for theories of language and mind. Our knowledge of inflectional classes is largely limited to European languages. We move beyond this, focusing on the Oto-Manguean languages of Mexico, numbering about 200, many of which are threatened. They have a rich array of suffixes, prefixes, complex tonal patterns and stem alternations, co-occurring in a single word form. This results in the interaction of multiple layered inflectional classes, drastically increasing complexity. They provide important evidence of the degree of inflectional complexity a language can tolerate...|$|R
