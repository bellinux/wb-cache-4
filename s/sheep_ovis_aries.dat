5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by feral <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> <b>aries),</b> cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> <b>aries)</b> on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> <b>aries).</b> There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.

We compared projections of PVA models for the sheep that incorporated either an unrealistic ceiling carrying capacity using INMAT (the only choice) and VORTEX (the default), or realistic density dependence for survival (VORTEX). At year 50, the ceiling models predicted extinction probabilities of 60. 4 % (INMAT) and 87. 4 % (VORTEX), compared to only 4. 6 % for the density-dependent model. Small populations were equally likely to increase or decrease with the ceiling models, while they had high probabilities of increase with the density-dependent model, as found in reality.

However, larger animals are taken only sporadically {{due to the}} fact only large males typically attack very large prey and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species' range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees and thus can amply support large crocodiles. Any type of domestic livestock, such as chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> <b>aries),</b> pigs, horses (Equus ferus caballus) and cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs (Dugong dugon), rays (including large sawfish), and small sharks. Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.|$|E

500|$|The Andean condor is a scavenger, feeding {{mainly on}} carrion. Wild condors inhabit large territories, often {{traveling}} more than [...] {{a day in}} search of carrion. In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses. Naturally, they feed on the largest carcasses available, which can include llamas (Lama glama), alpacas (Vicugna pacos), rheas (Rhea ssp.), guanacos (Lama guanicoe), deer and armadillos. Wild individuals could acquire extra carotenoids from vegetal matter contained in carcass viscera and fresh vegetation. However, most inland condors now live largely off of domestic animals, which are now more widespread in South America, such as cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), horses (Equus ferus caballus), donkeys (Equus africanus a sinus), mules, <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> <b>aries),</b> pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). They also feed on the carcasses of introduced game species such as wild boars (Sus scrofa), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). For condors who live around the coast, the diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals, largely cetaceans. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. Andean condors have been observed to do some hunting of small, live animals, such as rodents, birds and rabbits, which (given their lack of powerful, grasping feet or developed hunting technique) they usually kill by jabbing repeatedly with their bill.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl {{is perhaps}} the only living owl widely {{reported}} (if not commonly) to kill the young of ungulates. At least nine species {{have been identified as}} their food.

40|$|The pneumonic lesions and {{mortality}} caused by Mannheimia haemolytica in bighorn <b>sheep</b> (BHS; <b>Ovis</b> canadensis) are {{more severe than}} those in the related species, domestic <b>sheep</b> (DS; <b>Ovis</b> <b>aries),</b> under both natural and experimental conditions. Leukotoxin (Lkt) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are the most important virulence factors of this organism. One hallmark of pathogenesis of pneumonia is the influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into the lungs. Lkt-induced cytolysis of PMNs results in the release of cytotoxic compounds capable of damaging lung tissue. Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) is a potent PMN chemoattractant. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine if there is differential expression of IL- 8 by the macrophages and PMNs of BHS and DS in response to M. haemolytica. Macrophages and PMNs of BHS and DS were stimulated with heat-killed M. haemolytica or LPS. IL- 8 expression by the cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The PMNs of BHS expressed severalfold higher levels of IL- 8 than those of DS upon stimulation. Lesional lung tissue of M. haemolytica-infected BHS contained significantly higher levels of IL- 8 than nonlesional tissue. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of infected BHS also contained higher levels of IL- 8 than that of infected DS. Depletion of IL- 8 reduced migration of PMNs toward BAL fluid by approximately 50 %, indicating that IL- 8 is integral to PMN recruitment to the lung during M. haemolytica infection. Excessive production of IL- 8, enhanced recruitment of PMNs, and PMN lysis by Lkt are likely responsible for the severity of the lung lesions in M. haemolytica-infected BHS...|$|R

We report on a method of DNA profiling on a confiscated shahtoosh using the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene to produce a test that will identify unambiguously the presence of P. hodgsonii.

When the DNA sequences were compared with the sequences registered in GenBank and EMBL databases, the sequences with the highest homology were the cyt b genes of P. hodgsonii, C. hircus, and O. aries.

Three-dimensional data sets from healthy adult Merino <b>sheep</b> (<b>Ovis</b> orientalis <b>aries,</b> 12 ewes and 26 neutered rams) were acquired on a 1. 5 T Philips MRI using a T 1 w sequence. Data were averaged by linear and non-linear registration algorithms. Moreover, animals were subjected to detailed brain volume analysis including examinations with respect to body weight, age and sex. The created T 1 w brain template provides an appropriate population-averaged ovine brain anatomy in a spatial standard coordinate system. Additionally, TPM for gray (GM) and white (WM) matter as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classification enabled automatic prior-based tissue segmentation using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Overall, a positive correlation of GM volume and body weight explained about 15 % of the variance of GM while a positive correlation between WM and age was found. Absolute tissue volume differences were not detected, indeed ewes showed significantly more GM per bodyweight as compared to neutered rams. The created framework including spatial brain template and TPM represent a useful tool for unbiased automatic image preprocessing and morphological characterization in sheep. Therefore, the reported results may serve as a starting point for further experimental and/or translational research aiming at in vivo analysis in this species...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State UniversityBighorn <b>sheep</b> (BHS; <b>Ovis</b> canadensis) {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to Mannheimia haemolytica-caused pneumonia, than domestic <b>sheep</b> (DS; <b>Ovis</b> <b>aries).</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} elucidate the basis for enhanced susceptibility of BHS, and explore potential strategies to prevent pneumonia in BHS. I hypothesized that enhanced lung pathology in BHS is due to inadequate clearance of M. haemolytica from the lungs. To test this hypothesis, M. haemolytica was inoculated intra-tracheally into groups of BHS and DS that were necropsied at 4, 12, and 18 hours post-inoculation (hpi). DS completely cleared the bacteria from the lungs by 18 hpi, whereas BHS had large number of bacteria still remaining in the lungs. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from BHS had significantly lower titers of neutralizing antibodies to leukotoxin, the critical virulence factor of M. haemolytica. These findings suggested that enhanced lung pathology in BHS is likely due to inadequate clearance from the lungs, which, at least partly, is due to low titer of leukotoxin-neutralizing antibodies. In another study, serine protease inhibitor B 1 of BHS and DS was cloned and expressed to facilitate future studies on the role of protease-anti-protease imbalance in enhanced susceptibility of BHS to M. haemolytica-caused pneumonia. M. haemolytica are more frequently isolated from nasopharynx of DS than that of BHS. Furthermore, most DS isolates are leukotoxin-positive whereas most BHS isolates are leukotoxin-negative, which is likely responsible for the negligibly low titers of leukotoxin-neutralizing antibodies in BHS. A `proof-of-concept' study was designed to determine whether repeated immunization will protect BHS against M. haemolytica challenge. Four BHS were repeatedly inoculated with a vaccine prepared with M. haemolytica A 1, A 2, and Bibersteinia trehalosi T 10 culture supernatant. Upon subsequent challenge with M. haemolytica, all four vaccinated animals survived while all four un-vaccinated animals died within two days, suggesting that BHS are capable of mounting protective immune response against M. haemolytica. This notion was confirmed by another study that showed that MHC class II diversity in BHS is comparable to that of DS. Therefore, induction of immunity to M. haemolytica, particularly to its leukotoxin, is likely to protect BHS against pneumonia caused by this organism.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} sheep farming {{practices}} rely on animals {{with a greater}} level of behavioral autonomy than before, a phenotype that actively contributes to the sustainability of animal production. Social reactivity and reactivity to humans are relevant behavioral traits in sheep, known for their strong gregariousness and weak tolerance to handling, which have previously been reported with moderate to high heritabilities. To identify loci underlying such behaviors, we performed a genome study in Romane lambs. The experiment was carried out on 934 male and female lambs allocated into 9 half-sib families (average of 103 lambs per family) and reared outside. After weaning, all the lambs were individually exposed to 4 standardized behavioral tests combining social isolation, exposure to humans or handling, confinement and novelty (i. e. arena test, corridor test, isolation box test, shearing test). A broad range of behaviors including vocalizations, locomotion, vigilance and flight distance, {{as well as the}} cortisol response to handling, were collected. All lambs were genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP 50 BeadChip. QTL detection was performed by linkage, association and joint linkage and association analyses using the QTLmap software. Five main QTL regions were identified on <b>sheep</b> chromosomes (<b>Ovis</b> <b>Aries</b> Region, OAR) 12, 16, 19, 21 and 23 among many other QTLs with small to moderate effects. The QTLs on OAR 12, 16 and 21 showed significant associations with social reactivity. The QTLs on OAR 19 and 23 were found to be associated with reactivity to humans. No overlapping QTLs were identified for the different traits measured in the behavioral tests, supporting the hypothesis that different genetic factors influence social reactivity and tolerance to humans. The results of this study using ovine SNP data suggest that in domestic sheep the behavioral responses to social separation and exposure to humans are under polygenic influence. The most relevant QTLs reported in the present study contain interesting candidate genes previously described to be associated with various emotional and social behaviors in mammals...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{differences}} in preferences for flavours between ruminant species, two-choice tests were conducted on <b>sheep</b> (Scottish Blackface, <b>Ovis</b> <b>aries)</b> and goats (feral hybrids, Capra hircus). Feed pellets (nutritionally improved barley straw) were treated with synthetic human food-flavouring agents representing: strawberry (ST), apple (AP), orange (OR), maple (MA), caramel (CA), truffle (TR), garlic (GA) and onion (ON) flavours. Animals were first exposed {{to each of the}} flavours and then presented with each, paired with an untreated (control) feed, and the consumption of individual feeds recorded. Preference values (PV) were calculated from the proportion of the total feed consumption derived from the flavour-treated feed. Differences in PV were found between species (P = 0. 01) and between flavours (P < 0. 005). Although sheep showed stronger preference for flavoured feeds than did goats, both sheep and goats showed a similar pattern of preference across the flavours offered. In general, sheep exhibited significant preference for TR, GA, ON, AP, CA, MA and OR relative to the unflavoured feeds, whereas goats showed significant preference for TR, ON, AP and GA. The findings of this research suggest that it would be of practical use to evaluate feeds flavoured with compounds representing truffle, garlic and onion as intake enhancers in goats and sheep. Only if flavouring agents are successful in enhancing intake could we recommend flavouring as a means of masking undesirable feed flavours, production of a more uniform feed from variable ingredients or in prompting feed consumption...|$|R
