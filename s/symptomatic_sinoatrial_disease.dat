The technique of premature atrial stimulation {{was used to}} calculate sinoatrial conduction time. Rapid atrial pacing was applied to measure maximum sinus node recovery time. In 4 cases both stimulation methods were repeated after intravenous administration of atropine Group A had a sinoatrial conduction time of 56 ms +/- 11 (SD) and a maximum sinus node recovery time of 1122 ms +/- 158. In 3 out of 4 patients with sinus node dysfunction a prolongation of sinoatrial conduction time could be demonstrated (145, 105, and 150 ms). In addition, one showed probable sinus node exit block after premature atrial stimulation. Sinus node recovery time was excessively prolonged in 2 (3880 and 3215 ms) and normal in the other 2 patients with <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>disease</b> (1330 and 1275 ms).

40|$|Verapamil {{is a novel}} {{antiarrhythmic}} agent which appears {{to act as a}} calcium-ion antagonist, blocking calcium transport across the myocardial cell membrane. It was given intravenously, in a dose of 10 mg, to thirty-two patients suffering from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and sinus rhythm was achieved promptly in all. Identical results were obtained in a further ten patients with supraventricular tachycardias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White or other pre-excitation syndromes. In a separate group of eighteen patients in whom A-V junctional tachycardias were induced during intracardiac electrography, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in fifteen patients, with prolongation of the cycle length in the others. Circus-movement tachycardias were induced in eight patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in seven. The results were less consistent in patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias including ectopic atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter, and, in the single patient with supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, only the former was controlled. In the single patient with atrial fibrillation complicating the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who received verapamil, sinus rhythm was restored. Side effects were few and mild, with rare exceptions of profound hypotension, bradycardia and asystole; their management is discussed, and reasons are advanced why their occurrence is likely to be related either to the concomitant administration of beta-adrenergic blockers or to the presence of <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>disease.</b> It appears that verapamil is particularly suitable for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias due to a circus movement as calcium antagonism is likely to be most effective in the N region of the atrioventricular node...|$|R
40|$|Although {{differences}} in exercise performance {{have been observed}} between different rate adaptive modes, the relative impact of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony and rate adaptation on quality of life (QOL) have not been determined. Thirty-three patients with either <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>disease</b> (18) or complete atrioventricular (AV) block (15) received DDDR pacemakers (16 minute ventilation sensing, 17 activity sensing). There were 11 males and 22 females, {{with a mean age}} of 66 ± 1 (range 39 - 78) years. The study was a double-blind, triple cross-over study comparing DDDR, DDD, and VVIR modes. At the end of each 8 -week study period in each mode. QOL was assessed by a questionnaire evaluating patients functional class (Classes I-IV), physical malaise inventory (41 items), illness perception (43 items), and overall QOL rating based on a 48 items measure covering different aspects of the patients daily life adjustment. Two patients required early crossover from VVIR mode during the study. Patients experienced significantly fewer physical malaise such as temperature intolerance, dyspnea, and palpitations in the DDDR mode, compared with either DDD or VVIR pacing, DDDR pacing reduced the perception of illness in 5 of 43 items compared to VVIR pacing, and improved stamina and appetite compared to DDD pacing. The overall QOL score was 102 ± 2, 105 ± 2, 113 ± 2 in the DDDR, DDD, and VVIR modes, respectively, with a higher score indicating a poorer QOL (DDDR/DDD vs VVIR, P < 0. 02). There was no change in functional classes between the three pacing modes. In conclusion, VVIR pacing has a lower QOL compared with DDD pacing, which can be further enhanced with rate augmentation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDual-chamber (DDD) pacing mode {{survival}} {{was assessed by}} reviewing 486 consecutive initial transvenous DDD pacemaker implantations between December 1981 and December 1988 inclusive, with a mean follow-up time of 33 months. The patients' mean age was 71. 4 years and 55 % were male; 38 % had dominant sinoatrial and 62 % had dominant atrioventricular (AV) node disease. Nineteen patients (4 %) underwent secondary operative intervention for lead dislodgment (n = 11), lead or pulse generator malfunction (n = 6) or infection (n = 2). During follow-up, 87 patients (18 %) had their device permanently reprogrammed out of the DDD mode and 10 others (2 %) required temporary reprogramming out of this mode; 12 patients who required device reprogramming were managed in other dual-chamber or atrial pacing modes. Reasons for reprogramming included atrial fibrillation (n = 48; 10 %); loss of atrial sensing (n = 26; 5 %); recurrent “endless loop” tachycardia (n = 5; 1 %); lead dislodgment without repositioning (n = 4; 1 %); pulse generator malfunction (n = 1; 1 %) and other (n = 5; 1 %). The occurrence of atrial fibrillation was associated with dominant <b>sinoatrial</b> <b>disease</b> and a prior history of atrial fibrillation; 19 % of atrial sensing loss was attributable to early or faulty pacemaker technology. The DDD mode survival rate at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years was, respectively, 90 %, 88 %, 84 %, 79 % and 78 %. It is concluded that 1) 4 % of DDD pacemaker implants required secondary surgical intervention; 2) 82 % of implanted pacemakers remained in the DDD mode throughout follow-up; 3) onset of atrial fibrillation or loss of atrial sensing accounted for 73 % of the mode changes; 4) 10 % of the permanent mode changes were directly related to early or defective pacemaker technology; and 5) DDD pacing remains a very reliable and effective long-term therapy {{in the majority of}} patients with a DDD pacemaker...|$|R

40|$|During acute {{myocardial}} infarction (MI), the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is 6 % to 22 %, and its occurrence in this setting is associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this case control study was evaluate the characteristics associated {{with the development of}} new-onset AF. Of 2, 460 consecutive patients with acute MI, 149 (6 %) were identified as having AF within 7 days of MI. After excluding patients with prior AF, previously documented heart failure, reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, valvular heart disease, LV hypertrophy, AF after coronary artery bypass grafting, or pericarditis; we identified 42 AF patients in whom coronary anatomy was assessed by invasive angiography and cardiac structure and function was evaluated using transthoracic echocardiography. Another 42 patients from the same cohort with MI but no AF matched for age, gender, and LV ejection fraction were studied as controls. AF patients were more likely to present with an inferior MI (P =. 002) but less likely to present with ST-segment elevation MI (P =. 02). Univariate associations with AF included indexed left atrial volume (P <. 001), LV filling pressure (E/e'; P =. 001), right atrial branch disease (P <. 001), left atrial branch disease (P =. 009), <b>sinoatrial</b> branch <b>disease</b> (P <. 001), left main stem disease (P =. 02), and time from onset of symptoms to coronary intervention (P =. 002).

40|$|ReviewThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] middle-aged Coloured man had a 6 -year history of chest pain induced by effort and also experienced at rest. Quite dramatic episodes of associated arrhythmias, specifically 'torsade de pointes' (atypical ventricular tachycardia) and syncope were experienced by the patient, despite the use of numerous anti-arrhythmic and anti-anginal agents. Transmural anteroseptal and non-transmural anterolateral myocardial infarctions were documented {{in the presence of}} a normal left coronary artery (LCA). Severe reversible vasospasm of the right coronary artery (RCA) was provoked with the use of ergonovine (ergometrine) maleate at cardiac catheterization. It is postulated that the cause of the previous myocardial infarctions was significant vasospasm of the LCA branches, and that he was subject to multiple coronary vasospasm, as was highlighted by the visualization of spasm superimposed on atheromatous plaque within the RCA. Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that the potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, including 'torsade de pointes', were a direct result of coronary vasospasm, which in turn gave rise to his presyncope and syncope attacks. No evidence of <b>sinoatrial</b> node <b>disease</b> could be found. The only risk factor for ischaemic heart disease which applied in his case was heavy cigarette smoking. Control of his disabling symptoms seems to have been achieved by the use of maintenance nifedipine (a calcium-blocking agent) long-acting nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) and quinidine gluconate, confirming the probable vasospastic aetiology of the 'torsade de pointes'. At no stage was there dangerous prolongation of the QT interval, an oft-quoted prerequisite for this arrhythmia. Some of the more important aspects of coronary vasospasm are discussed; as far as I am aware this is the first patient documented in the literature with 'torsade de pointes' associated with angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of oral sotalol for various arrhythmias in pediatric patients and to evaluate the incidence of proarrhythmia and systemic side effects. Background. Sotalol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with additional class III antiarrhythmic properties. Experience in pediatric patients is limited. Data concerning the incidence of proarrhythmia in children are lacking. Methods. Seventy-one pediatric patients (mean age 7. 3 years) with various supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias were treated with oral sotalol. All the patients were {{admitted to the hospital}} for initiation of sotalol therapy. Antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects of sotalol were assessed by daily surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the in-hospital phase and by serial Holter monitoring. Results. Sotalol was either completely (27 [66 %] of 41 patients) or partially effective (11 [27 %] of 41) in 38 (93 %) of 41 patients with supraventricular reentrant tachycardias. In patients with atrial flutter predominantly after operation for congenital heart disease, sotalol was effective in 84 % of patients (completely in 9 of 19 and partially in 7 of 19). Ventricular tachycardia was completely (3 of 11) or partially (4 of 11) controlled in 64 % of children. Proarrhythmia occurred in seven patients (10 %) and consisted of <b>symptomatic</b> bradycardia from <b>sinoatrial</b> block and high grade atrioventricular (AV) block, respectively, in two children; asymptomatic high grade AV block in one; torsade de pointes in one; and relevant increased ventricular ectopic activity in three. Proarrhythmia required drug discontinuation in four patients. Mean duration of treatment for all patients was 18 months (range 1 to 40). Conclusions. Sotalol was an effective antiarrhythmic drug {{for a wide range of}} pediatric tachyarrhythmias.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{examined}} the effect of physiologic pacing {{on the development of}} chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) in the Canadian Trial Of Physiologic Pacing (CTOPP). BACKGROUNDThe role of physiologic pacing to prevent CAF remains unclear. Small randomized studies have suggested a benefit for patients with sick sinus syndrome. No data from a large randomized trial are available. METHODSThe CTOPP randomized patients undergoing first pacemaker implant to ventricular-based or physiologic pacing (AAI or DDD). Patients who were prospectively found to have persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) lasting {{greater than or equal to}} one week were defined as having CAF. Kaplan-Meier plots for the development of CAF were compared by log-rank test. The effect of baseline variables on the benefit of physiologic pacing was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTSPhysiologic pacing reduced the development of CAF by 27. 1 %, from 3. 84 % per year to 2. 8 % per year (p = 0. 016). Three clinical factors predicted the development of CAF: age ≥ 74 years (p = 0. 057), <b>sinoatrial</b> (SA) node <b>disease</b> (p < 0. 001) and prior AF (p < 0. 001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a trend for patients with no history of myocardial infarction or coronary disease (p = 0. 09) as well as apparently normal left ventricular function (p = 0. 11) to derive greatest benefit. CONCLUSIONSPhysiologic pacing reduces the annual rate of development of chronic AF in patients undergoing first pacemaker implant. Age ≥ 74 years, SA node disease and prior AF predicted the development of CAF. Patients with structurally normal hearts appear to derive greatest benefits...|$|R
