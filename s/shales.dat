5|$|Before {{separating}} {{from his}} wife Mahone pursued Oscar <b>Shales,</b> a murderer whom he struggled to capture; it is revealed that Mahone killed <b>Shales</b> and buried the body in his backyard. Fearful that his wife would discover his secret, he cuts her out of his life. Mahone is plagued with visions of <b>Shales,</b> which cause him to self-medicate with prescription drugs.|$|E
5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group <b>shales</b> in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these <b>shales</b> may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
50|$|What {{constitutes}} the upper {{boundary of the}} Thermopolis <b>Shale</b> is disputed, {{making it difficult to}} identify what overlays the Thermopolis <b>Shale.</b> In 1922, Collier identified the beds below the Mowry <b>Shale</b> as the Nefsy <b>shale</b> member of the Graneros <b>Shale.</b> This left the Thermopolis <b>Shale</b> underlying the Graneros <b>Shale.</b> But Rubey assigned these rocks to the Mowry <b>Shale</b> in 1931, so that now the Thermopolis <b>Shale</b> underlay the Mowry <b>Shale.</b> Eicher redefined these beds in 1960 as the Shell Creek <b>Shale,</b> separating them from the Mowry <b>Shale.</b> This effectively put the Thermopolis <b>Shale</b> below the Muddy Sandstone Formation. In 1998, Porter et al. identified the Shell Creek <b>Shale</b> as the upper member of the Thermopolis <b>Shale,</b> a position with which Lash agreed in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Oil <b>shale</b> gas is {{produced}} by retorting (pyrolysis) of oil <b>shale.</b> In the pyrolysis process, oil <b>shale</b> is heated until its kerogen decomposes into vapors of a petroleum-like condensable <b>shale</b> oil, non-condensible combustible oil <b>shale</b> gas, and spent <b>shale</b> - a solid residue. [...] The process {{is the same as}} the <b>shale</b> oil extraction and oil <b>shale</b> gas usually occurs as a byproduct of <b>shale</b> oil production. The ratio of oil <b>shale</b> gas to <b>shale</b> oil depends on retorting temperature and as a rule, increases by the rise of temperature.|$|R

5|$|There are varying classifications of oil <b>shales</b> {{depending}} on their mineral content, type of kerogen, age, depositional history, and organisms from which they are derived. The age of the oil shale deposits ranges from Cambrian to Tertiary age. Lithologies range from <b>shales</b> to marl and carbonate rocks, all of which form a mixture of tightly bound organic and inorganic materials.|$|E

50|$|Spent <b>shale</b> or spent oil <b>shale</b> (also {{known as}} {{retorted}} <b>shale)</b> {{is a solid}} residue from the <b>shale</b> oil extraction process of producing synthetic <b>shale</b> oil from oil <b>shale.</b> It consists of inorganic compounds (minerals) and remaining organic matter known as char - a carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Depending on the extraction process {{and the amount of}} remaining organic matter, spent <b>shale</b> may be classified as oil <b>shale</b> coke, semi-coke or coke-ash residue, known also as oil <b>shale</b> ash. According to the European Union waste list all these types of spent <b>shale</b> are classified as hazardous waste.|$|R
25|$|The Polk Creek <b>Shale</b> and Missouri Mountain <b>Shale</b> overlie the Bigfork Chert and {{generally}} consist of <b>shale</b> with minor thin layers of quartzitic sandstone. The Polk Creek <b>Shale</b> is a black, fissile, graphitic <b>shale.</b> The Missouri Mountain <b>Shale</b> varies in color, and {{is soft and}} argillaceous.|$|R
500|$|The {{oldest and}} the most common {{extraction}} method involves pyrolysis (also known as retorting or destructive distillation). [...] In this process, oil <b>shale</b> is heated {{in the absence of}} oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable <b>shale</b> oil vapors and non-condensable combustible oil <b>shale</b> gas. [...] Oil vapors and oil <b>shale</b> gas are then collected and cooled, causing the <b>shale</b> oil to condense. [...] In addition, oil <b>shale</b> processing produces spent oil <b>shale,</b> which is a solid residue. Spent <b>shale</b> consists of inorganic compounds (minerals) and chara carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent <b>shale</b> produces oil <b>shale</b> ash. Spent <b>shale</b> and <b>shale</b> ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture. [...] The composition of the oil <b>shale</b> may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including ammonia, sulfur, aromatic compounds, pitch, asphalt, and waxes.|$|R
5|$|Early in the Acadian orogeny, as the Acadian Mountains {{were rising}} up, {{the black and}} gray <b>shales</b> of the Hamilton Group began accumulating as erosion of the {{mountains}} deposited terrigenous sediments from the land into the sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{petroleum}} geology, {{these black}} <b>shales</b> {{are an important}} source rock that filled conventional petroleum reservoirs in overlying formations, are an unconventional shale gas reservoir, and are an impermeable seal that traps underlying conventional natural gas reservoirs.|$|E

50|$|Oil <b>shale</b> {{economics}} {{deals with}} the economic feasibility of oil <b>shale</b> extraction and processing. Although usually oil <b>shale</b> economics is understood as <b>shale</b> oil extraction economics, the wider approach evaluates usage of oil <b>shale</b> as whole, including for the oil-shale-fired power generation and production of by-products during retorting or <b>shale</b> oil upgrading processes.|$|R
5000|$|The Lurgi-Ruhrgas {{process is}} a hot {{recycled}} solids technology, which processes fine particles of coal or oil <b>shale</b> sized 0.25 to 0.5 in. As a heat carrier, it uses spent char or spent oil <b>shale</b> (oil <b>shale</b> ash), mixed with sand or other more durable materials. [...] In this process, crushed coal or oil <b>shale</b> is fed {{into the top of}} the retort. [...] In retort, coal or oil <b>shale</b> is mixed with the [...] heated char or spent oil <b>shale</b> particles in the mechanical mixer (screw conveyor). [...] The heat is transferred from the heated char or spent oil <b>shale</b> to the coal or raw oil <b>shale</b> causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil <b>shale</b> decomposes to <b>shale</b> oil vapors, oil <b>shale</b> gas and spent oil <b>shale.</b> [...] The oil vapor and product gases pass through a hot cyclone for cleaning before sending to a condenser. In the condenser, <b>shale</b> oil is separated from product gases.|$|R
50|$|As a heat carrier, LLNL HRS process uses spent oil <b>shale.</b> Raw oil <b>shale</b> {{and spent}} oil <b>shale</b> are mixed in the {{fluidized}} bed mixer. The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil <b>shale</b> throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil <b>shale</b> moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil <b>shale</b> to the raw oil <b>shale</b> causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil <b>shale</b> decomposes to <b>shale</b> oil vapors, oil <b>shale</b> gas and spent oil <b>shale.</b> Oil vapors are collected from the pyrolyzer. The spent oil <b>shale,</b> still including residual carbon (char), by the air pneumatic lift pipe to the delayed-fall combustor where it is combusted to heat the process. The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil <b>shale</b> ash and spent <b>shale</b> falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent <b>shale</b> is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|R
5|$|The Marcellus {{has also}} been used locally for shale {{aggregate}} and common fill, although the pyritic <b>shales</b> are not suitable for this purpose because of acid rock drainage and volumetric expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous <b>shales</b> beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The <b>shales</b> are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of rock is greywacke, {{followed}} by other types of sandstones and <b>shales.</b> Landslides and mass wasting are common in this region due to erosion as well as earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|In this process, crushed oil <b>shale</b> is {{fed into}} the top of the retort where it is mixed with the hot oil <b>shale</b> ash. The oil <b>shale</b> moves {{downward}} through the retort as fluidized bed of particles. While descending, the heat is transferred from the oil <b>shale</b> ash to the raw oil <b>shale</b> causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil <b>shale</b> decomposes to <b>shale</b> oil vapors, oil <b>shale</b> gas and spent oil <b>shale.</b> A stripping gas is inserted from the bottom of retort, which carries oil vapors into solids separation section. The fine particles are directed to the combustor while oil vapors are moved to the condenser. In condenser, <b>shale</b> oil is separated from water vapor and product gases. On the bottom of retort the spent <b>shale</b> is transported to cumbustor.|$|R
30|$|Two {{different}} <b>shale</b> {{samples were}} chosen for the Geo-mechanical analysis from the Sanand field of Cambay basin, Gujarat, India. Cambay <b>shale</b> was deposited during the Eocene time when synrift stage was continuing. The <b>shale</b> is predominantly black to dark grey in colour. The Cambay <b>shale</b> is further divided into older Cambay <b>shale</b> and younger Cambay <b>shale</b> formations. Detailed understanding of Cambay <b>shale</b> {{is available in the}} literature (Chowdhary 2004; Biswas 1999; Scarrar et al. 2000). The first one from a higher level is a younger Cambay <b>shale</b> with high density (ρ =  2.21  g/cc) and the second one from the lower level older Cambay <b>shale</b> with a low density (ρ =  2.16  g/cc).|$|R
50|$|The {{predominant}} lithology of the West Falls Group is <b>shale.</b> The Rhinestreet Member can {{be further}} subdivided into two <b>shale</b> types: a thick, fissile black <b>shale</b> underlies a gray to greenish-gray <b>shale</b> that likely indicates a transitional environment. The Angola member is a gray to greenish-gray <b>shale,</b> easily distinguished by its consistent low gamma ray signature, which is typical of this <b>shale</b> type.|$|R

Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed <b>Shales,</b> and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Silurian Longmaxi <b>Shale</b> (SLS) is {{the target}} for <b>shale</b> gas {{exploration}} and exploitation in the southeastern Sichuan Basin. Based on detailed description of cores and outcrops, analysis of Gamma Ray (GR) logs, thin sections and mineralogical data, the SLS can be subdivided into six lithofacies: (1) clayey <b>shale,</b> (2) siliceous calcareous <b>shale,</b> (3) siliceous dolomitic <b>shale,</b> (4) silty-clayey interlaminated <b>shale,</b> (5) muddy siltstone, and (6) graptolite <b>shale.</b> Three facies associations are recognized in the study area, i. e., inner shelf, outer shelf, and bathyal plain (including turbidite) facies. Outer shelf and bathyal plain facies dominate the lower interval of the SLS, while inner shelf facies dominates {{the upper part of}} the SLS. The thickness of the black <b>shale</b> in the northern part of the study area is the greatest, where siliceous calcareous <b>shale,</b> siliceous dolomitic <b>shale,</b> and graptolite <b>shale</b> are predominant. These three kinds of <b>shale</b> are rich in total organic carbon (TOC) content and brittle minerals, which is favourable for the accumulation of <b>shale</b> gas and its future exploitation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the research on}} fluidized-bed retorting of pulverized oil <b>shale</b> on pilot-plant scale (daily processing capacity of 50 tonnes oil <b>shale).</b> Chinese Yi Lan pulverized oil <b>shale</b> 0 – 3 mm was used as feed. Oil <b>shale</b> is fed and pyrolyzed in a fluidized-bed pyrolyzer, where it is heated to about 500 °C by recycled hot <b>shale</b> ash coming from a fluidized-bed combustor. Nitrogen, coal gas or superheated steam is used as fluidizing agent in the pyrolyzer. The <b>shale</b> char formed from oil <b>shale</b> in the pyrolyzer mixed with <b>shale</b> ash is recirculated to the fluidized-bed combustor, where it is burnt by incoming air (as fluidizing agent) to form <b>shale</b> ash at about 700 °C and is recycled to the pyrolyzer as hot solid heat carrier. The mixture of <b>shale</b> oil vapors and pyro-lysis gas, formed from oil <b>shale,</b> mixed with steam or other fluidizing agent coming from the pyrolyzer, comes through two cyclones for removal of entrained dust and is washed by warm water to condense heavy <b>shale</b> oil, then goes to cooler for recovery of light <b>shale</b> oil. The total <b>shale</b> oil yield accounts for 80 % of Fischer assay. The properties of <b>shale</b> oil and pyrolysis gas are analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Oil <b>shale</b> gas (also: retort gas or {{retorting}} gas) is {{a synthetic}} non-condensable gas mixture (syngas) produced by oil <b>shale</b> thermal processing (pyrolysis).
