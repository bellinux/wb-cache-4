5|$|In 1954, the Soviet Union <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should join NATO to {{preserve}} peace in Europe. The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was {{to weaken the}} alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{analysis}} of Titan's atmospheric nitrogen <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has possibly been sourced from material {{similar to that}} found in the Oort cloud and not from sources present during co-accretion of materials around Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, {{given its}} {{conservation}} status, Kingsley Dixon of Kings Park and Botanic Garden <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{anterior}} teeth and slender posterior teeth of Concavispina <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on soft-bodied {{animals such as}} fish and jellyfish while the pointed {{anterior teeth}} and broad posterior teeth of Xinpusaurus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on harder prey with shells.|$|R
50|$|Records <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was rarely}} worn.|$|R
50|$|The {{size of its}} osteocytic lacunae <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had {{a fairly}} large genome (C-value of about 36.7 pg, with a 95% {{confidence}} interval ranging from 30.2 to 44.2 pg), though not as large as that of obligatorily neotenic extant urodeles. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been facultatively neotenic.|$|R
5|$|In its {{standard}} configuration the IFV {{would have a}} crew of three and carry a squad of nine. The vehicle could be reconfigured to support casualty evacuation. The Army stated no preference {{as to whether the}} IFV should be tracked or wheeled but <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{might be possible to}} make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Oryzomys peninsulae arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may have been}} introduced from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits.|$|E
5000|$|Cytosolic beta-glucosidase is a {{predominantly}} liver enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes beta-D-glucoside and beta-D-galactoside, but not any known physiologic beta-glycoside, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved}} in detoxification of plant glycosides. GBA3 also has significant neutral glycosylceramidase activity (...) , <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved in}} a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway of glucosylceramide metabolism.|$|R

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of incipient seafloor spreading {{in the basin}} is under controversy. Some researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not occur within the basin because of the crustal thickness, magnetic anomaly patterns, and intracrustal diapirism. Other geoscientists <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is occurring and is related to seamount volcanism and normal faulting within the basin.|$|R
5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of resistance to}} batrachotoxins {{and the use of}} those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history. Jønsson (2008) <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an ancestral adaptation in Corvoidea songbirds, and that further studies would reveal more toxic birds. Dumbacher (2008) argued instead that it was an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{an important step in}} the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, {{it may be that the}} gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
50|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{comes from}} Turkey <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is adapted to}} harsh climates.|$|R

50|$|Henodus, however, {{differs from}} other placodonts in having {{developed}} unique baleen-like denticles, which alongside {{features of the}} hyoid and jaw musculature <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a filter feeder. Recent comparisons to Atopodentatus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a herbivore as well, bearing a similar broad jaw shape, albeit it obtained plant matter through filter-feeding it from the substrates.|$|R
5|$|To {{support the}} effort, other PAVN {{elements}} would {{close on the}} city from the west and south. Since no code name had been applied to the new offensive, Dũng <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> be named the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. The Politburo concurred on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{thorough}} examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features, {{it was thought}} to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably Anomalocaris, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.|$|E
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{date and}} {{location}} of composition is disputed: some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Salzburg, the boy's home town, in 1762 or 1763; others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Paris in 1763 or 1764, during Mozart's first visit to <b>that</b> city. <b>It</b> was published in Paris in February 1764, along with another violin sonata, K. 7, as Mozart's “Opus 1”.|$|R

5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is the primary}} host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis {{are the result of}} spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E

50|$|SelP {{may have}} {{antioxidant}} properties. It can attach to epithelial cells, and may protect vascular endothelial cells against peroxynitrite toxicity. The high selenium content of SelP <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved}} in selenium intercellular transport or storage. The promoter structure of bovine SelP <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may be involved in}} countering heavy metal intoxication, and may also have a developmental function.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin Hudson <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was only}} the {{vigorous}} campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir. Alex Woolf suggested that Flann had not only attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had come close to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to that created by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
