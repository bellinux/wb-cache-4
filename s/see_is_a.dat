They also cited the lack of equal status for other religions and the Vatican representatives' history of pushing Catholic views on reproductive health.|$|E

Slow <b>Seeing</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> experience offered to the viewer in deciphering the imprinted, residual relationships between the works in the exhibition. Requests to move, pause, relook and ruminate are hoped to be imbued upon the viewer as an embodiment of slow seeing.

Schram explained that her [...] "very kind and very sweet" [...] character finds herself in an [...] "unfortunate situation of having lost someone in her life. The Cinderella that you'll <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> portrayal of someone that's desperate {{to get out of}} the situation that she's in.

500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's for you and me living out our dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All I want to <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sky full of lighters".

500|$|Although the Parents Television Council, a {{frequent}} Family Guy critic, did not name Family Guy its [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] for [...] "Road to the Multiverse", it did {{refer to this}} episode in its negative review of the following episode, [...] "Family Goy". The review noted that {{the appearance of the}} Griffin family's Jewish neighbor, Mort Goldman, in [...] "Multiverse" [...] was notable since, in the Disney parody, Mort was beaten to a bloody pulp by Disney-inspired versions of the cast– a reference to Walt Disney's purported antisemitism. The review goes on to state, [...] "apparently, in Seth MacFarlane's mind, the best way to fight anti-Semitism is with more anti-Semitism.

500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E.

He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening."
