The static linearity performance, namely the integral nonlinearity and differential nonlinearity, {{as well as the}} parasitic effects of the split DAC, are analyzed hereunder. In addition, a code-randomized calibration technique is proposed to correct the conversion nonlinearity in the conventional SAR ADC, which is verified by behavioral simulations, as well as measured results. Performances of both switching methods are demonstrated in 90 nm CMOS. Measurement results of power, speed, and linearity clearly show the benefits of using Vcm-based switching...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technology the research activities have been concentrated on {{a detailed analysis of}} SOI devices and their use in different application fields (low-voltage, low-power circuits, high temperature electronics, digital circuits, etc.). The present thesis deals with low-voltage, low-power mixed-mode design using a SOI technology. The goal is to establish the concepts that allow one to design SOI mixed-mode circuits, and to apply these concepts to the design of fully depleted (FD) and partially depleted (PD) SOI circuits and systems. Two studies have been realized in the scope of this work: a Hall sensor based microsystem design using an experimental FD SOI technology a DRAM design using capacitor-less 1 T floating-body PD SOI memory cells. At the beginning of this thesis, two major types of SOI devices are introduced, namely FD and PD devices. The most important properties of these devices are then presented and compared to those of CMOS bulk devices. A design methodology based on design retargeting from bulk to SOI technology is further proposed. This methodology is developed with the aim of being implemented for the design of FD SOI circuits. It consists in using the same device dimensions and bias currents for the bulk and the corresponding FD SOI design. The analysis performed proves that such an approach permits one to obtain better circuit performances using the FD SOI technology. The EKV model is chosen for Spice simulations. For that purpose the extraction of the EKV intrinsic parameters has been performed for the experimental 0. 5 μm FD SOI technology. The EKV model card obtained from transistor measurements is implemented straightforwardly for circuit simulations. The first study presented in this thesis is an FD SOI Hall sensor front-end for energy measurement. The mixed-mode microsystem design is completely based on the proposed design methodology. The system level solutions are also included, such as the spinning-current method that serves for reduction of the offset and low frequency noise of the analog front-end, and a high resolution analog-to-digital conversion technique. The integrated microsystem is entirely functional. Furthermore, according to the existing literature, this integrated circuit is the first microsystem completely realized using FD SOI technology. The overall system error that is obtained is less than 1. 5 %. During the second part of this work, a novel sensing scheme that exploits an automatic reference generation based on <b>successive</b> <b>approximations</b> has been developed for the PD SOI capacitor-less 1 T DRAM. The 1 T DRAM reference current is generated by an adjustable current source. The electrical calibration of the reference current is performed using a digital-to-analog converter and <b>successive</b> <b>approximations</b> algorithm. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a 2 kb test chip. The circuit integrated using PD SOI technology contains a 2 kb 1 T memory array, as well as automatic reference generators and peripheral circuits. The automatic reference generator comprises current mode sense amplifier, M/ 3 M converter, and <b>successive</b> <b>approximations</b> <b>register.</b> All blocks implemented in the test chip are described in detail, and PD SOI design issues are discussed. A number of experimental results demonstrate the potential of the PD SOI 1 T DRAM for future embedded DRAM applications. The measured retention time under holding conditions is higher than 1 s. In the continuous read mode, a few hundreds of the read cycles can be performed without a refresh operation. The test chip has a measured access time of 25 ns with a read cycle time of 70 ns...|$|R

Then the next bit is set to 1 and the same test is done, continuing this binary search until every bit in the SAR has been tested. The resulting code is the digital approximation of the sampled input voltage and is finally output by the SAR {{at the end of}} the conversion (EOC).|$|E

50|$|A successive-approximation ADC uses a {{comparator}} to successively narrow a {{range that}} contains the input voltage. At each successive step, the converter compares the input voltage to the output of an internal {{digital to analog converter}} which might represent the midpoint of a selected voltage range. At each step in this process, the approximation is stored in a <b>successive</b> <b>approximation</b> <b>register</b> (SAR). For example, consider an input voltage of 6.3 V and the initial range is 0 to 16 V. For the first step, the input 6.3 V is compared to 8 V (the midpoint of the 0-16 V range). The comparator reports that the input voltage is less than 8 V, so the SAR is updated to narrow the range to 0-8 V. For the second step, the input voltage is compared to 4 V (midpoint of 0-8). The comparator reports the input voltage is above 4 V, so the SAR is updated to reflect the input voltage is in the range 4-8 V. For the third step, the input voltage is compared with 6 V (halfway between 4 V and 8 V); the comparator reports the input voltage is greater than 6 volts, and search range becomes 6-8 V. The steps are continued until the desired resolution is reached.|$|E
