5|$|With a crew {{of roughly}} 120 persons, filming took a total of 25 days, {{spanning}} from July to August 2012. Car chase scenes were shot at Long Beach and a Westlake Village office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center. The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked {{in the trunk of}} a car. Other filming locations include the Burbank Town Center on Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank, California, Santa Clarita, California and the 170 Highway. At one point, Berry was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence. A spokesperson for Berry confirmed that she suffered a minor head injury and was taken to the hospital as a precaution, but <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> out healthy and was released.|$|E

25|$|Another famous {{resident}} of the hotel is the purported ghost of Kate Morgan. On November 24, 1892, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> into room 304 (then 3318, now 3327). She told staff she was awaiting the arrival of her brother who was a doctor. She {{said he was going}} to treat her stomach cancer, but he never arrived. She was found dead on the steps leading to the beach three days later. The case was declared a suicide; she had shot herself. Another tragedy took place on the beach at the hotel in 1904 when actress Isadore Rush drowned.|$|E
25|$|Isabella's parents started raising Ricky {{and took}} him to see his mentally ill mother from time to time until <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> out {{completely}} from reality and started becoming violent. Ricky suffered from this experience and also felt abandoned by his father. When Ricky returned to Genoa City nine years later and grown up, Paul and Christine recalled all that Isabella had done. Paul then went to see Isabella following Ricky's tragic death, in which Paul shot him to stop him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). However, Isabella's face was not shown and she was only seen brushing her hair while humming from the back.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, a 9-1-1 {{call was}} made by someone {{who claimed to be}} Locklear's doctor, who said that Locklear was trying to commit suicide. Emergency {{responders}} were dispatched to Locklear's home. Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as she appeared to be fine. They did, however, state that they believed the call to be genuine. On June 24, 2008, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological ailments including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Her agent confirmed that she was suffering from anxiety and depression. On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.|$|E

25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated {{that she wanted to}} stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police told her it was from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E

[...] Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the Associated Press that she left the station. She said that <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.|$|E

2500|$|Bahá'ís {{sometimes}} objected that contradictory {{ideas were}} presented together while others sometimes objected {{there was too}} much Bahá'í coverage. `Abdu'l-Bahá's advise to Farmer was to be more direct about the religion and less supportive of [...] "mouldered, two thousand years old superstitions". However, in 1907 other events took hold when, at the age of 60, Farmer fell off a train car in Boston, was injured and never fully recovered. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> herself into McLean Hospital possibly with a severe injury to her back, when it was a sanitorium.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> {{into the}} Institute of Living {{to be treated}} for her chronic {{insomnia}} and diffuse abdominal pains. Shock treatment was tried and numerous psychological tests performed. Bow's IQ was measured [...] "bright normal", while others claimed {{she was unable to}} reason, had poor judgment and displayed inappropriate or even bizarre behavior. Her pains were considered delusional and she was diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, she experienced neither auditory nor visual hallucinations. Analysts tied the onset of the illness, as well as her insomnia, to the [...] "butcher knife episode" [...] back in 1922, but Bow rejected psychological explanations and left the Institute. She did not return to her family. After leaving the institution, Bow lived alone in a bungalow, which she rarely left, until her death.|$|E

2500|$|The media later {{reported}} the frantic attempt by Rodger's parents to intervene {{on the evening}} of the killings. After receiving a copy of the manifesto, Rodger's therapist phoned his mother. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> his YouTube channel, where she found the [...] "Retribution" [...] video that he had uploaded minutes earlier. She called Rodger's father regarding the disturbing video. He was horrified when he watched the full video. Rodger's father, his current wife, and Rodger's mother all started frantically driving from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara in two separate cars. During the drive, they called police in Isla Vista and they arranged to meet them upon arrival. Hearing a radio news report of a shooting in Isla Vista, his mother called the therapist, who told her it was unrelated, saying that Rodger promised to act the following day and it would be unlike him to deviate from such details. When they reached the police station in Isla Vista, they learned that the news report was, in fact, about their son, and that he had killed six people.|$|E
2500|$|Faber {{published}} {{the book in}} 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art, the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only £43; the U.S. edition published by Harcourt, Brace the following year fared no better. Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim's financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted {{for a bottle of}} whiskey a day. In February 1939 <b>she</b> <b>checked</b> into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from Mary Baker Eddy, having converted to Christian Science. In March 1940 her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out. Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that [...] "there is no reason any longer why I should feel for them in any way but hate." [...] This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play The Antiphon. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} Nevada brothels, {{customers}} were buzzed {{in through a}} gate. Once in, they chose a woman from a lineup in a lobby, and negotiated prices and services in the woman's room. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> the penis for any open sores or signs of venereal disease and tested the pre-ejaculatory fluid. A short negotiation was made as {{to the type of}} [...] "party" [...] the customer wanted. Typical prices ranged from $100 to $500 plus tips, although the standard price of $25 for 30 minutes with [...] was enforced and could not be refused. Some women, who performed bizarre acts approved by the Confortes, could get up to $10,000 for a party. The house received half of anything the women made. After the negotiations (overheard by a hidden intercom system) were over, the prostitute collected the money and deposited it with a cashier. She returned to the room, washed the male genitals in a basin. After the act, she would again wash the male and slip on her skimpy outfit. The women was require to escort the customer from her room to the door. Some men would relax in the bar or on sofas talking to the girls. In time the men would be rested for [...] "round two." [...] Many men had favorites or wanted variety. They could be with as many women as they could afford. The fantasy of two and three women simultaneously was common. Another frequent fantasy was of an older and younger prostitute being intimate with the customer and each other; he pretended they were mother and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|MacDonald {{suffered}} in her later years with heart trouble. She worsened in 1963 and underwent an arterial transplant at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. [...] She had been signed {{to play the}} role of the Mother Abbess in the film version of The Sound of Music, but died before she could fulfill this commitment (the role went to Peggy Wood). [...] Nelson Eddy, in Australia on a nightclub tour, pleaded illness and returned to the States at word of MacDonald's surgery. [...] After the operation, she developed pleurisy and was hospitalized for two-and-a-half months. [...] Her friends kept the news from the press until just before her release. [...] Her large home was sold and she moved into a Los Angeles apartment that would not require so much of her energies. [...] Her husband moved into an adjoining apartment. Nelson Eddy took his own apartment in the opposite building. MacDonald was again stricken in 1964. Nelson Eddy was with her when she was admitted to UCLA Medical Center, where on Christmas Eve, she was operated on for abdominal adhesions. She was able to go home for New Year's, but in mid-January, husband Raymond flew her back to Houston. It was hoped that pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey, who had recently operated successfully on the Duke of Windsor, could perform the same miracle for her. <b>She</b> <b>checked</b> in on January 12, and a program of intravenous feedings was begun to build her up for possible surgery. MacDonald died two days later on January 14 at 4:32 pm, with her husband at her bedside.
