5|$|In 1998 {{the festival}} {{was once again}} struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers {{departed}} early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur. Tony Bennett, however, overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> 1998 {{was also the first}} year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E

Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide during his career.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inaugural}} 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor {{controversy}} erupted when one opposition {{member of parliament}} (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> {{instead of the usual}} official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other MPs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee to seek an audience with him.|$|E
5|$|Resuming for New South Wales in 1952–53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in {{the last}} match before the {{beginning}} of the Test series against South Africa. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, Barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player, Ray Flockton. During a drinks break {{on the second day of}} the match, he appeared on the ground in a <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> (rather than 'whites') carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game. The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings, officially complained to the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.|$|E

25|$|At one of {{the group}} debates in August 1964, a record 70 women turned up to discuss 'the freedom of dress'. This took place in a room above the Shakespeare's Head in Carnaby Street.

This {{eventually}} led to long-term social divisions within the group where Butch women became excluded.|$|E

25|$|The cope, therefore, {{is often}} worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would {{conventionally}} wear the chasuble. In general those clergy who robe wear a cassock, surplice, scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there {{has sometimes been}} a practice of wearing a long surplice without a cassock, particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in street clothes ranging from a <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a <b>suit</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
