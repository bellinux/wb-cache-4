Hurley Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). [...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet <b>Switch</b> <b>Network</b> (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. [...] An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. [...] The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information Network Server (WARP/WINS) system. [...] The weather data is then distributed to the ARTCCs via commercially provided Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone lines.

40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve. In this paper, we give this set of inputs, demonstrate a "weird" polynomially-sized monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> for directed connectivity which solves this set of inputs, and prove that no polynomially-sized certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> can solve this set of inputs, thus proving that monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity are strictly more powerful than certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Based on different target applications: we categorize WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> into two connection models: the wavelength-based model and the fiberlink-based model. Most of existing WDM optical switching networksbelongtothefirst category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. The newly designed sparse WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> have minimum hardware cost {{in terms of both}} the number of crosspoints and the number of wavelength converters.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, many {{bandwidth}} intensive applications have evolved and the demand for telecommunications as well as computational power has increased dramatically. Consequently, optical communication, and in particular Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, has become a versatile transmission medium for many applications. ^ The introduction of WDM technology has resulted in increasing the dimensionality of switching by addition of the wavelength switching domain. A main challenge in designing WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> is to provide a nonblocking space wavelength switching capability with optimum hardware and switching complexity. In this dissertation, we address this challenge, and accordingly investigate the problem of designing nonblocking WDM optical <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with reduced hardware complexity. ^ We propagate a new design philosophy that exploits the unique capability of optical technologies to reduce switching complexity and enhance scalability, and show that such a design philosophy enables novel classes of WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> with many interesting and useful features. ^ We introduce a novel concept of Wavelength-Exchanging WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that are capable of switching signals simultaneously and seamlessly both in space and wavelength domains. This concept leads to <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> that have the following advantages: (1) reduced size and complexity, (2) a shorter signal path, (3) strict wavelength conversion between two predefined and fixed wavelengths, and (4) transparency to routing algorithms. ^ We introduce a new design approach for multicast WDM <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> based on concentrators and multi-wavelength converters (MWCs) technologies to enhance the design flexibility of nonblocking multicast <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> For example, we show {{that it is possible to}} design a nonblocking WDM <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> with full-multicast capability without using 2 ̆ 2 any 2 ̆ 2 power splitters. ...|$|R
