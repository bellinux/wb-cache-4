40|$|Reactive {{nitrogen}} (NOy) {{plays an}} important role in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Its constitutents NO and NO 2 both catalyze ozone detruction and limit other catalytic ozone depletion cycles as they transform the involved radicals into reservoir species, e. g. chlorine nitrate and nitric acid. While the partitioning within the NOy family may change rapidly, its chemical lifetime is long compared to the time scale of atmospheric transport processes. This also holds for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), whose photochemical destruciton in the middle stratosphere in the tropics is the principle source of NOy. Therefore, a compact anticorrelation is anticipated and frequently found for the two tracers. However, deviations from this corelation can occur due to processes that redistribute the abundance of reactive nitrogen within the stratosphere, e. g. by particle formation, sedimentation and reevaporation. As such processes alter the balance between ozone destructing radicals, they can have substantial in fluence on <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry...</b>|$|E

40|$|Several stratospheric {{chemistry}} modules from box, 2 -D or 3 -D models, have been intercompared. The intercomparison {{was focused on}} the ozone loss and associated reactive species under the conditions found in the cold, wintertime Arctic and Antarctic vortices. Comparisons of both gas phase and heterogeneous chemistry modules show excellent agreement between the models under constrained conditions for photolysis and the microphysics of polar stratospheric clouds. While the mean integral ozone loss ranges from 4 - 80 % for different 30 - 50 days long air parcel trajectories, the mean scatter of model results around these values is only about +/- 1. 5 %. In a case study, where the models employed their standard photolysis and microphysical schemes, the variation around the mean percentage ozone loss increases to about +/- 7 %. This increased scatter of model results is mainly due to the different treatment of the PSC microphysics and heterogeneous chemistry in the models, whereby the most unrealistic assumptions about PSC processes consequently lead to the least representative <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Furthermore, for this case study the model results for the ozone mixing ratios at different altitudes were compared with a measured ozone profile to investigate the extent to which models reproduce the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> losses.

Very accurate isomeric energy differences have also been determined at the CCSD(T) level with atomic natural orbital basis sets that include through g-type functions. In most cases, the isomer with a normal neutral Lewis dot structure is the lowest energy form, with the single exception that FBrO is predicted to be 11. 1 kcal/mol (0 K) lower in energy than FOBr. In all cases, however, the hypervalent isomer is more stable relative to the isomer with a normal Lewis dot structure as compared to the chlorine analogs.

40|$|The {{vertical}} profile of global-mean stratospheric temperature changes has traditionally represented an important diagnostic for the attribution of the cooling effects of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion and CO 2 increases. However, CO 2 -induced cooling alters ozone abundance by perturbing <b>ozone</b> <b>chemistry,</b> thereby coupling the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and temperature responses {{to changes in}} CO 2 and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Here we untangle the ozone-temperature coupling and show that the attribution of global-mean stratospheric temperature changes to CO 2 and ODS changes (which are the true anthropogenic forcing agents) can be {{quite different from the}} traditional attribution to CO 2 and ozone changes. The significance of these effects is quantified empirically using simulations from a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model. The results confirm the essential validity of the traditional approach in attributing changes during the past period of rapid ODS increases, although we find that about 10 % of the upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> decrease from ODS increases over the period 1975 – 1995 was offset by the increase in CO 2, and the CO 2 -induced cooling in the upper stratosphere has been somewhat overestimated. When considering ozone recovery, however, the ozone-temperature coupling is a first-order effect; fully 2 / 5 of the upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> increase projected to occur from 2010 – 2040 is attributable to CO 2 increases.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{presentation}} is to assess our quantitative understanding of the polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> loss process. We present lagrangian observations of chemical ozone loss rates and of the temporal evolution of key chlorine species during sunset. These observations allow us to derive detailed information about the kinetics of the underlying chemical processes. The results are compared with highly constrained model calculations for these air masses. The space of kinetic parameters that lead to model results reproducing the observations within combined uncertainties is explored. The consistency with laboratory measurements of the parameters is assessed. In this approach good consistency suggests a complete understanding of the chemical processes while the lack of consistency would suggest gaps in the system of reactions in the model. In particular uncertainties of the photolysis cross sections of ClOOCl have long been a limiting factor in our theoretical understanding of the rate of polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> losses.
