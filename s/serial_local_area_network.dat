50|$|A {{baseband}} channel or lowpass channel (or system, or network) is {{a communication}} channel that can transfer frequencies {{that are very}} near zero. Examples are <b>serial</b> cables and <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (LANs), as opposed to passband channels such as radio frequency channels and passband filtered wires of the analog telephone network. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) allows an analog telephone wire to carry a baseband telephone call, concurrently as one or several carrier-modulated telephone calls.|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} {{and operation of}} a wireless instrumentation bus based on the Bluetooth standard are presented together with a detailed characterization. The bus, via suitable wireless interface boards, allows measurement instruments equipped with standard RS 232, IEEE 488, universal <b>serial</b> bus, and <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> interface ports to be simply connected within the wireless area without any firmware modification. In addition, a comparison with traditional wired interface buses is carried out in terms of communication reliability and throughput with reference to some basic operating modes. Finally, the results of distance tests and a detailed evaluation of power consumption for each wireless interface module are reported. This will enable measurement system designers to evaluate the convenience of the solution for their application requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The {{very first}} device that had {{fundamentally}} the same functionality as a router does {{today was the}} Interface Message Processor (IMP); IMPs were the devices {{that made up the}} ARPANET, the first TCP/IP network. The idea for a router (called [...] "gateways" [...] at the time) initially came about through an international group of computer networking researchers called the International Network Working Group (INWG). Set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks, later that year it became a subcommittee of the International Federation for Information Processing. These devices were different from most previous packet switching schemes in two ways. First, they connected dissimilar kinds of networks, such as <b>serial</b> lines and <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> Second, they were connectionless devices, which had no role in assuring that traffic was delivered reliably, leaving that entirely to the hosts.|$|R

A <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> can save in {{hardware}} costs when expensive peripherals are shared; it can save time when large blocks of data are rapidly exchanged among users. The need for more cost-effective and capable communications has inspired the emergence of rapidly developing markets and technologies for <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the characteristics, components, costs, and implementation considerations of <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> The paper does not compare or define specific vendor offerings; however, recent IBM announcements regarding <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> are summarized in the last section of the paper...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navy Supply Systems Command has developed the Stock Point Integrated Logistics Communications Environment (SPLICE) concept. It {{will be a}} foreground and background distributed system built around <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> This research describes an evaluation strategy to identify off-the- shelf <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> architectures to support SPLICE. Tee strategy develops a performance classification system for <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> architectures and identifies evaluation guidelines based on the functional needs of the SPLICE system. Then the evaluation process is implemented to identify example <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> products with architectures that meet SPLICE needs.

The plethora of system software, application software and accessories available combined with the various computer clones, and open architecture present in microcomputers makes tracking <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> configuration and maintenance a very daunting task. This thesis modifies a previous design for a <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> configuration and maintenance database and implements the new design in Dbase IV version 1. 1 using the Naval Postgraduate School Administrative Science Department <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> as a prototype database.

A discussion of academic theory concerning structured systems analysis and design, <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> communications standards, and the characteristics of a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> provide the theoretical foundation for the analysis and design of a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> information support system for the Air Station.

Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Since <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> are widely in use, their modification to integrate multimedia streams is very important. In our work we consider some possible solutions to the problems associated with multimedia on <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> as well as studying the performance aspects of these solutions.
