5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a <b>satisfying</b> assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a <b>satisfying</b> assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Theme Hospital {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{noted the}} strong gameplay, detailed graphics, <b>satisfying</b> comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.|$|E
5|$|There {{also exist}} {{algorithms}} for finding two <b>satisfying</b> assignments {{that have the}} maximal Hamming distance from each other.|$|E
5|$|Although erections are not {{necessary}} for <b>satisfying</b> sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life. Whatever treatment is used, it works best in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.|$|E
5|$|By {{mathematical}} induction, a setQ is convex if and onlyif every {{convex combination}} of members ofQ also belongs toQ. By definition, a convex combination of an indexedsubset{v0,v1,...,vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexedset of non-negative real numbers{λd} <b>satisfying</b> the equation=1.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Park and the 29 other Torrance {{city parks}} were deemed busy enough <b>satisfying</b> the {{citizens}} pleasure and recreation needs. Reservations {{are available from}} the , and needed for group picnic areas, organized sports fields, and larger special group events in the park and its facilities.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and <b>satisfying,</b> especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very <b>satisfying.</b> Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a <b>satisfying</b> manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|Wharton later {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy {{would have been}} better suited to playing fewer concerts, in bigger venues. He also felt that after the {{experience}} of fronting his own band Dare, it was not <b>satisfying</b> enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes. Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.|$|E
5|$|After the Finance Committee vote on October 15, {{negotiations}} {{turned to}} moderate Democrats. Majority leader Harry Reid focused on <b>satisfying</b> centrists. The holdouts {{came down to}} Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a public option was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's staff drew up {{detailed}} {{plans for}} a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully <b>satisfying</b> career, in late 1982 {{he decided not to}} run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.|$|E
25|$|Any (∨,0)-semilattice <b>satisfying</b> Schmidt's Condition is representable.|$|E
25|$|Let U be {{a unitary}} {{operator}} on a Hilbert space H; more generally, an isometric linear operator (that is, a not necessarily surjective linear operator <b>satisfying</b> ‖Ux‖ = ‖x‖ for all x in H, or equivalently, <b>satisfying</b> U*U = I, {{but not necessarily}} UU* = I). Let P be the orthogonal projection onto {ψnbsp&∈nbsp&Hnbsp&|nbsp&Uψnbsp&=nbsp&ψ}nbsp&=nbsp&ker(Inbsp&−nbsp&U).|$|E
25|$|With this definition, D(U) {{becomes a}} {{complete}} locally convex topological vector space <b>satisfying</b> the Heine–Borel property.|$|E
25|$|Both {{of these}} bases allow Boolean algebras {{to be defined}} via {{a subset of the}} equational {{properties}} of the Boolean operations. For the lattice basis, it suffices to define a Boolean algebra as a distributive lattice <b>satisfying</b> x∧¬x = 0 and x∨¬x = 1, called a complemented distributive lattice. The ring basis turns a Boolean algebra into a Boolean ring, namely a ring <b>satisfying</b> x2 = x.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, all locally {{integrable}} functions <b>satisfying</b> the (volume) mean-value property {{are both}} infinitely differentiable and harmonic.|$|E
25|$|The section s whose {{existence}} is guaranteed by axiom 2 {{is called the}} gluing, concatenation, or collation of the sections s'i. By axiom 1 it is unique. Sections s'i <b>satisfying</b> the condition of axiom 2 are often called compatible; thus axioms 1 and 2 together state that compatible sections can be uniquely glued together. A separated presheaf, or monopresheaf, is a presheaf <b>satisfying</b> axiom 1.|$|E
25|$|Most {{pairs of}} {{integers}} <b>satisfying</b> these conditions are the Chern numbers for some complex surface of general type.|$|E
25|$|Equally important, it can {{be shown}} that any matrix <b>satisfying</b> these two {{conditions}} acts as a rotation.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} F(x, y) = y2, which is C1 and {{therefore}} locally Lipschitz continuous, <b>satisfying</b> the Picard–Lindelöf theorem.|$|E
25|$|If T is {{a theory}} of {{arithmetic}} <b>satisfying</b> certain hypotheses, with Gödel sentence G'T, then PRA proves the implication Con(T)G'T.|$|E
25|$|Since f* is injective, θ = w. Thus the Stiefel–Whitney {{class is}} the unique functor <b>satisfying</b> the four axioms above.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, it can {{be shown}} that such a g-valued 1-form on a {{principal}} bundle generates a horizontal distribution <b>satisfying</b> the aforementioned properties.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{modular form}} is a (complex) {{analytic}} function {{on the upper}} half-plane <b>satisfying</b> {{a certain kind of}} functional equation with respect to the group action of the modular group, and also <b>satisfying</b> a growth condition. The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.|$|E
25|$|A Boolean algebra is any {{set with}} binary {{operations}} ∧ and ∨ and a unary operation ¬ thereon <b>satisfying</b> the Boolean laws.|$|E
25|$|These {{two great}} blocks rest atop Tiger Wall and offer many classic lines that {{end in a}} <b>satisfying</b> peak bagging experience.|$|E
25|$|Many (and {{possibly}} all) {{pairs of}} integers <b>satisfying</b> these conditions are the Chern numbers for some complex surface of general type.|$|E
25|$|Finally, if {{infinitely}} many numbers <b>satisfying</b> {{this property}} can be found, then the root {{is represented by}} the (infinite) corresponding continuous fraction.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{attempts}} {{to show that}} we cannot satisfy (a) either through introspection or through observation, and that qualia's very definition undermines its chances of <b>satisfying</b> (b).|$|E
25|$|A logical system <b>satisfying</b> Lindström's {{definition}} that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.|$|E
25|$|A logical system <b>satisfying</b> Lindström's {{definition}} {{that has a}} semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.|$|E
25|$|A {{model of}} a theory is an algebra {{interpreting}} the operation symbols {{in the language of}} the theory and <b>satisfying</b> the equations of the theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} of such inverse functions as objects <b>satisfying</b> differential equations can be given. Some such differential equations admit explicit power series solutions, despite their non-linearity.|$|E
25|$|The only {{difference}} is the requirement to satisfy the conditions (such as showing marriage status or <b>satisfying</b> entrepreneur requirements) before the two-year period ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} inner models {{is common in}} the study of determinacy and large cardinals, {{especially}} when considering axioms such as the axiom of determinacy that contradict the axiom of choice. Even if a fixed model of set theory satisfies the axiom of choice, it is possible for an inner model to fail to satisfy the axiom of choice. For example, the existence of sufficiently large cardinals implies that there is an inner model <b>satisfying</b> the axiom of determinacy (and thus not <b>satisfying</b> the axiom of choice).|$|E
25|$|Support for companionate marriages, {{which can}} be <b>satisfying</b> even if no longer sexually vital, since romantic needs are met elsewhere. This acts to {{preserve}} existing relationships.|$|E
