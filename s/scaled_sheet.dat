40|$|Ductile {{fracture}} of metallic materials in micro/meso scale plastic deformation {{is influenced by}} geometry and grain sizes and the so-called size effect thus exists. To reveal how the size effect affects the formability of sheet metals in micro/meso scale plastic deformation, the forming limit of sheet metals was studied by experiment and modeling. An extended coupled damage model was first developed based on the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman and the Thomason models via considering the geometry and grain size effects on void evolution. In modeling process, the void nucleation was analyzed by taking account the phenomenon {{that the number of}} voids decreases with the ratio of thickness to grain size of workpiece. For the void growth, the widely used surface layer model was employed to describe the size effect on the flow stress of material. The grain size effect on void spatial arrangement was also modeled during the coalescence of micro voids. The model was then implemented into finite element simulations and the predicted forming limit curves under different scale factors were constructed. On the other hand, the forming limit experiments were conducted based on the miniaturized Holmberg and Marciniak tests to estimate the formability of sheet metals under different conditions. Both the physical experiments and finite element simulations show a significant size effect on the micro/meso scaled fracture behavior: The forming limit curve shifts down with the decreasing ratio of the thickness to grain size. The simulation results were also corroborated and verified by experiments. In addition, when the ratio is two or less than two, the very scattered limit strain results are observed in the experiments and the strain localization tends to occur at the beginning of deformation. The research conducted advances the understanding of size effect on the formability of micro/meso <b>scaled</b> <b>sheet</b> metals and thus helps the development of the successful and reliable microforming processes.

40|$|The {{most often}} used {{friction}} model for sheet metal forming simulations is the relative simple Coulomb friction model. This paper presents a more advanced friction model for large scale forming simulations based on the surface change on the micro-scale. The surface texture of a material changes when two surfaces are in contact under a normal load. This is caused by flattening due to combined normal loading and stretching. The consequence {{of this is that}} shear stresses between the contacting surfaces, developed by adhesion and ploughing effects between contacting asperities, will change when the surface texture changes. A numerical procedure has been developed which accounts for the change of the surface texture on the micro-scale and its influence on the friction behavior on the macro-scale.

40|$|A multi-scale {{two-phase}} flow model {{based on an}} Eulerian/Lagrangian coupled approach is developed to capture the sheet cavitation formation and unsteady breakup and cloud shedding on a hydrofoil. No assumptions are needed on mass transfer. Instead, natural free field nuclei and solid boundary nucleation are modelled and enable capture of the dynamics. The multi-scale model includes a micro-scale model for tracking the bubbles, a macro-scale model for describing large cavity dynamics and a transition scheme to bridge the micro and macro scales. With this multi-scale model small nuclei are seen to grow into large bubbles, which eventually merge to form a large <b>scale</b> <b>sheet</b> cavity.

Approximately 94 % of breast cancers are diagnosed in women over age 40.
