5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E

In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate <b>surface</b> <b>velocity,</b> at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500â€“11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E
500|$|Some desert plants produce seed {{which lies}} dormant {{in the soil}} until sparked into growth by rainfall. When annuals, such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks, aiming to {{complete}} their development before the last vestige of water dries up. For perennial plants, reproduction {{is more likely to}} be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position, but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it. Some seed will not germinate until it has been blown about on the desert floor to scarify the seed coat. The seed of the mesquite tree, which grows in deserts in the Americas, is hard and fails to sprout even when planted carefully. When it has passed through the gut of a pronghorn it germinates readily, and the little pile of moist dung provides an excellent start to life well away from the parent tree. [...] The stems and leaves of some plants lower the <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion. Even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called cryptobiotic soil) can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms. Some plants, including the Plantago Lanceolata, have to reproduce via wind pollination due to living in the environment. Cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil. Grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with lichens. Most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the year.|$|E

[...] This latter {{may be the result}} of the movement of the aircraft through the air or, when lift at low air speeds is important for short take-off performance, produced by engine power. The channel wing, the brainchild of [...] Willard Ray Custer, is an example of the latter, where the air velocity over the upper <b>surface</b> <b>velocity</b> in a U-shaped channel formed out of the wing was increased with a pusher propeller at the trailing edge. [...] This near semi-circular channel laterally constrained the airflow produced by the propeller, even when the aircraft was at rest, producing higher flow velocities than over a conventional pusher wing.

40|$|Nonoptimal {{fluid flow}} {{patterns}} in the mold cause level fluctuations and excessive <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> at the top surface, which shears off and emulsifies liquid slag, leading to inclusions and other defects in the steel product. Physical water models are often used to investigate these phenomena.

Trying to include these effects presents other difficulties. Constructing smaller, scaled-down water models introduce further differences. These differences are investigated using computational models of both the water models and real casters. The Froude similarity criterion reasonably reproduces overall flow features for different scale models, so long as the flow regime stays fully turbulent. Flow in small scale water models behaves differently, if the flow regime becomes laminar. Neglecting the surface slag layer causes excessive <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> in a water model. Neglecting the solidifying shell causes unrealistic lower <b>surface</b> <b>velocities</b> and <b>surface</b> waves in the water model, especially for thinner cross sections.
