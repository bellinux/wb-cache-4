40|$|Abstract Reduction of {{inventories}} and optimum {{delivery of}} input goods are important parameters for efficient production processes. Therefore transport processes are {{a vital part}} of industrial production, and their features are important determining factors for production planning. Especially in the Baltic Sea region, short sea roro shipping connections {{are an important part of}} transport chains but also constitute a bottleneck through their restricted schedules. The attractivity of a <b>short-sea</b> roro <b>shipping</b> connection is determined through several factors. Among these are shipping prices, transport time, frequency but also factors that cannot be influenced by the ships operator, such as obligatory driver breaks for truck drivers, which use the shipping service, the geographical position of ports and the geographical position of logistics hotspots which determine the main-transport flows. A roro shipping service that is part of an optimal connection between two logistics hotspots would have a clear advantage on the market. The paper shall present a model that allows for the analysis of complete intermodal RoRo-shipping chains in regard to their attractivity for their end-customers. The model cumulates different features of a transport chain into one indicator. Thereby allowing the optimization of RoRo shipping connection towards customer needs...|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{and world}} trade creates {{increasing}} demand for transportation. Europe is {{strongly influenced by}} the automotive industry and large quantities of cargoes are transported by truck, resulting in congestion and pollution affecting {{human health and the}} environment. <b>Short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> is promoted by the EU as a sustainable alternative to road to avoid overloading road networks, thus minimizing bottlenecks. RoRo <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> provides great potential to create more energy- and cost efficient transport networks throughout Europe. To unleash its potential as well as increase business opportunities within RoRo <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping,</b> ship operators need to become more attractive to cargo owners and logistics service providers. Through multiple case studies with in-depth interviews with ship-operators, logistics service providers, as well as related industry actors it became evident that ship-operators must focus more on their customers' needs, implement effective marketing strategies and supply chain management as well as integrate to a larger extent into the European intermodal transport networks. RoRo short-sea operators must increase their visibility in the marketplace and create awareness of RoRo short-sea shipping's benefits among shippers i. e. cargo owners as well as logistics service providers. When ship operators have gained knowledge of, and implemented, overall marketing and supply chain strategies, as well as have mitigated the by shippers experienced weaknesses with RoRo <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping,</b> their business opportunities in the European freight transport market are likely to increase.

40|$|This thesis conducts an {{analysis}} of the effects of reducing the mineral oil tax reimbursement scheme for the Norwegian <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> and fisheries sectors. An important contribution {{of this study is to}} review this measure in a wide context based on the Norwegian governments’ principles and goals relating to climate, environment and its goals for the <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> and fisheries sectors. Based on the dynamics of supply- and demand elasticities for the sectors, the likely tax-incidence determined. The tax incidence is in turn used to discuss and contrast the different outcomes of the tax increase for the sectors. Costs are expected to rise by at least 2. 2 % for the <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> sector and 0. 9 % for the fisheries sector. This increase will fall on the vessel- and ship-owners based on the tax incidence. In terms of the principles and goals for environmental taxes the effort is found to be a step in the right direction, but falling short of estimates of the social cost of carbon. The tax is found to be better for the fishing industry than the short-sea sector. Short-sea has environmental benefits over its closest competitors and the tax increase may shift volume to other modes of transport. Thus the measure may result in increased emissions from transport. Both effects undermine the goals for the short-sea sector. For fisheries sector some goals may be achieved with regards to profitability, reduced overcapacity/redundancy and investment in new technology. This may reduce emissions in the long run, but not in the short run because of perfectly inelastic supply due to fishing quotas. Going forward the reimbursement scheme should be held constant for the <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> sector at least until other sector goals are achieved. For the fisheries sector however, the reduction of the reimbursement should continue. nhhma...|$|E

40|$|Greater Vancouver {{is home to}} one of {{the largest}} ports in North America and some of the most modern {{container}} terminals in the world, the Port of Vancouver. Every year, the Port of Vancouver trades approximately $ 43 billion with more than 90 economies, creates jobs for approximately 70, 000 Canadians, contributes almost $ 4 billion to Canada's GDP, and generates $ 763 million in tax revenue. By working together to maximize the opportunities being presented, the Port hopes to triple its benefits within 15 years (Vancouver Port Authority 2005). Increasing container trade with Asia, and specifically China, makes containers the Port of Vancouver’s fastest growing sector, - a growth which is not expected to subside significantly over the next two decades. Container handlings facilities on the Lower Mainland are, accordingly, being expanded and developed to capitalize on this major market opportunity and the considerable economic benefits it represent (Greater Vancouver <b>Short-Sea</b> Container <b>Shipping</b> Study). But {{at the same time the}} Port of Vancouver is at a crossroads. Despite their vast potential, Vancouver’s advantages are being jeopardized by freight congestion in the Lower Mainland, and alarming concerns about capacity to handle the projected trade growth over the next 20 years.

40|$|The cost of <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> on {{the seas}} {{surrounding}} Sweden will increase considerably after 2015 {{as a result}} of the introduction of stringent emission limits on NOx and sulphur. This may give trucks and trains an upper hand in market segments where customers can choose between sea transport and land-based modes. This report shows that the balance would shift in favor of shipping if government gives all modes an equal liability for external costs. With the internalization based on the short-term social marginal costs of infrastructure use, accident risk, and emissions of NOx, sulphur and CO 2, rail will be losing market shares. In this scenario the current fairway dues would have to be lowered by at least 90 per cent in order to reflect the short-term marginal cost (rather than variable + fixed costs), while at the same time railway infrastructure charges would quadruple. A surprising result of the calculations is that long-distance freight transport by truck on the main road arteries that compete with <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> will by 2015 have internalized its short-term social marginal costs based on the current (2011) taxation of vehicles, roads and fuels. This is a result of an increasingly cleaner vehicle fleet and the use of the best roads whose social marginal costs for accidents and road tear are well below average. Equal treatment of all modes with regard to social cost liability will make it possible for <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> to relieve the national railway system of some of its growing capacity problems that would otherwise have to be resolved by substantial investment in additional rail infrastructure.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages of}} <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> (SSS) in Croatia {{as well as the}} environmental concerns related to shipping in general and <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> in particular. A comprehensive strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) study was undertaken with regard to the strategy of SSS development in Croatia. The study shows that strengths and opportunities largely diminish the significance of weaknesses and threats, provided that the emphasis in policy-making is placed on wider public, economic and environmental interests, {{as well as on the}} internalization of external costs. The impetus for conducting this study comes from new regulations within MARPOL Annex VI, oriented towards the reduction of GHG emission.

40|$|Abstract: Since 1990 s {{the liner}} {{shipping}} industry has faced {{a period of}} restructuring and consolidation, and been confronted with a continuing increase in container vessel scale. The impact of these changes is noticeable in trade patterns, cargo handling methods and shipping routes, in short 'operations'. After listing factors influencing size, growth in container ship size is explained by economies of scale in deploying larger vessels. In order to quantify economies of scale, this paper uses the liner service cash flow model. A novelty in the model is the inclusion of + 6000 - 20 -foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) vessels and the distinction in costs between single and twin propeller units on ships. The results illustrate that scale economies have been - {{and will continue to}} be - the driving force behind the deployment of larger container vessels. The paper then assesses the link between ship size and operations, given current discussions about the increase in container vessel scale. It is found that (a) ship size and operations are linked; (b) optimal ship size depends on transport segment (deep-sea vs. <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping,</b> SSS), terminal type (transhipment terminals vs. other terminals), trade lane (East-West vs. North-South trades) and hnology; and (c) a ship optimal for one trade can be suboptimal for another...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the environmental and economic advantages of using LNG as fuel for ships. Air emissions from ships are an increasing environmental concern. Since the shipping sector can expect to face more stringent environmental regulations in the future, LNG’s potential {{as a response to}} these regulations is analyzed. This study offers an overview of present environmental regulations as well as a description of the properties of LNG. The aim of the final analysis is to identify the cost position of LNG-fueled vessels within different sectors of the Norwegian <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> market. Net present value (NPV) analysis sets the technical framework for the economic evaluation. The analysis comes to the conclusion that using LNG as fuel for ships offers the potential for significant environmental improvement, regarding both air quality and climate protection, in all sectors subject to the analysis. Economically, LNG as fuel can compete with conventional marine fuel (MGO), at oil prices around approximately 60 $/bbl. Hence, {{the results of this study}} indicate that from both an environmental- and economic perspective the investment in LNG powered ships is strongly recommendable. The study also presents some potential barriers with regards to commercial viability and technological feasibility that need to be overcome before LNG becomes fully competitive with other fuels...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} energy and {{environmental}} impacts of emissions associated with freight transportation, the Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transport (GIFT) model was created as a joint research collaborative between the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the University of Delaware (UD). The GIFT model is a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based model that links the U.

40|$|This paper {{takes a look}} {{at various}} {{tradeoffs}} that are at stake in the goal for reduced ship emissions and may impact the cost-effectiveness of the maritime logistics chain and presents some models {{that can be used to}} evaluate these tradeoffs. The reason for investigating such tradeoffs is that measures to reduce such emissions may possibly have ramifications as regards the logistical supply chain, and vice-versa. The broad spectrum of measures that are involved in the drive to reduce emissions generally depends on the type of emissions that are studied. In this paper we focus on operational measures that have a direct link to logistical operations, and investigate related tradeoffs. The focus is mainly on CO 2 and SO 2 emissions. Measures such as reduction of speed, change of number of ships in the fleet, and possibly others, will generally entail changes (positive or negative) in overall emissions, but also in other logistics and cost-effectiveness attributes such as in-transit inventory and other costs. Industry circles have also voiced the concern that low-sulphur fuel in SECAs (these are the so-called ‘sulphur emissions control areas ’ that exist in some parts of the world- for instance the Baltic and the North Sea) may make maritime transport (and in particular <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping)</b> more expensive and induce shippers to use land-based alternatives (mainly road), even though shifting cargo from land to sea is an important policy goal. A reverse shift of cargo from sea to land might ultimately increase the overall level of CO 2 emissions along the intermodal chain. Models to investigate such problems are developed and some examples are presented...|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} liner container-shipping networks worldwide {{serving the}} intercontinental supply chains have {{shown to be}} very diverse regarding the types of offered transport services, the network spatial/operational complexity {{in terms of the}} strength of presence on the global and secondary lines/routes, and the types of bundling of TEU flows. Regarding the strength of presence on the global and secondary lines/routes, they have been roughly categorized into H&S (Hub-and-Spoke), ETE (End-To-End), RTW (Round-The-World), pendulum, and triangle (Tran and Haasis 2015). Regarding the type of bundling of TEU flows, they have been categorized as: i) Bundling with and individual liner service; and ii) Bundling by combining/linking two or more liner services (Ducruet and Notteboom 2012). In the former case, the network carriers collect the TEU flows by calling different ports along the given trunk line/route constrained by the origin and destination seaports, i.e., they operate the MPC (Multi-Port-Call) network configurations. In the latter case, the TEU flows are collected at the seaports usually located at the intersections of the main maritime trade routes and additionally consolidated by the feeder short-sea and inland transport services. The same or different carriers and/or their alliances as that operating the trunk line/main route between the hubs can carry out the <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> feeder services. The road and rail transport mode and their systems usually provide the inland transport services. Consequently, these seaports operate as hubs of the H&S networks of the liner container-shipping carriers and/or their alliances (Panayides and Wiedmer 2011). In these networks, the trunk lines/routes usually connect a pair of hubs by the shipping services carried out with much less or no intermediate port calls compared to the MPC counterparts. Due to concentration of the TEU flows at hubs the ships are sufficiently full thus not needing to exchange their cargo at the intermediate ports (Ducruet and Notteboom 2012).|$|E

In the paper, a best practice of SSS is examined, having reference to the ro-ro traffic along the Adriatic Corridor on the Italy-Greece axis. The goal is that of identifying and evaluating the main port choice criteria by key actors of the logistics chain so as {{to come up with a}} general choice model of ports. First, a quite comprehensive literature review is performed. Among other things, literature highlights how port choice criteria (and their relative weights) vary depending on the specific context (logistics chain) and on time. This implies that a generalized and unique choice model does not exist while the need to consider specific case-studies is necessary. Then, by using a methodology mainly based on primary data – i. e. in-depth interviews and questionnaires to a sample of key actors – the decision-making process of logistics operators is analysed and the results from responses are discussed and presented by means of a process-oriented model. It shows, partly according to the literature and partly in contrast with it, a hierarchical structure of choices (shipping company first/port second) in which it is highlighted the relevant role of choice factors related to the quality of service and to logistics needs of deliveries (supply chain context). Likewise, the model emphasizes the predominant role of ‘human ’ aspects (attitudes, perceptions, experience, tradition, etc.) of decision-makers. Factors related to economic convenience (total and partial costs, etc.) definitely seem to play a minor role. Key words: port choice criteria; ro-ro traffic; decision-making process 1...|$|E

The aim of the project was to investigate different variables that influence competition between these ports and their overall effect on cargo flows. This dataset only contains statistics on Rotterdam. (Dataset D 0095 contains the data collected on the port of Antwerp.) The statistics offer detailed time-series on international cargo flows passing through Rotterdam. Cargo shipped to and from the port by domestic <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> is not registered by the sources, because in this kind of transport no border is crossed. Furthermore, like sea-borne transport, only hinterland transport from and to Rotterdam that has a foreign origin or destination is registered in the available statistical series. In other words, not all maritime-related hinterland transport is registered: transports within the Netherlands are missing. On the other hand, the hinterland data also contain cargo flows that have no relation with sea-borne transport to and from Rotterdam at all. It is not possible to assess the volume of these so-called continental transports. They consist for instance of exports by Rotterdam manufacturing firms to neighbouring European countries. This is a very important feature of the database. It implies that it is not possible to match the sea-borne traffic with the hinterland transports or, in other words, to assess the total modal split in hinterland transport of cargo that is shipped to and from Rotterdam by sea.

40|$|The {{growth in}} {{container}} volumes and {{the concentration of}} container flows on {{a limited number of}} hubs, which derives, among other things, from the increasing vessel size, requires the development of new terminal infrastructure at ports able to handle the latest generation of vessels. In addition to the pressure that such vessels impose on the terminal cargo handling capabilities, it is often forgotten, that those larger vessels will also require higher capacity in hinterland transportation or a rationalization and better use of existing transport alternatives. Those ports that are already plagued by inland congestion or that are located in the proximity of densely populated areas, will {{have to come up with}} viable alternatives to reduce the impact of congestion and relieve local communities from the negative externalities generated by increasing cargo flows. The development of new terminal infrastructure should then take into account the effects that increasing traffic volumes will have on the existing infrastructure and plan for expansion if necessary. As volumes increase, alternative modes of transport, such as rail or <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> are being promoted both to reduce both congestion and environmental impacts.

Formal regulations suggest using manual inspection of the ship rotation and the work effectiveness of the engine during manoeuvring in ports and in the open sea regions. The accuracy of this procedure is very low and depends on the personnel of the deck. Therefore, automation and computer control systems are constantly required to assist the human eye. This problem becomes clearly visible when dealing with full ship autonomy in the open sea in the <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping</b> regions. The trend of maritime technology development will only increase {{in the area of}} human interaction decrease with the physical operations and the shipping procedures, which will lead to the future full ship autonomy in the open sea regions around the globe. With the growing automation technologies, predictive control can prove to be a better approach than the traditionally applied visual inspection policy and linear control models. Ship full autonomy is also linked to the ship's machinery regular repair and maintenance that has to be carried out for delivering satisfactory performance and minimizing downtime during transportation operations. In this paper, current stages of development of the intelligent transportation system concept are discussed for the ship autonomy in manoeuvring control and a robust ships' systems integration and communication system concept is presented for several normal and abnormal situations: high-traffic, potentially dangerous situations or port approaching or ship maintenance, with the capability to solve problems with the limited human interface and with a remote control possibility.

The purpose is to determine the pivotal dimensions and characteristics of these part cargo operations in tramp shipping, and offer both the individual case company and wider research community better understanding of potential risks and benefits related to utilization of part cargo operations. A mixed method research approach is utilized in this research, as the objectives are related to complex, real-life business practices in the field of supply chain management and more specifically, maritime logistics. A quantitative analysis of different voyage scenarios is executed, including alternative voyage legs with varying cost structure and customer involvement. An on-line-based questionnaire designed and prepared by case company’s decision group again provides desired data of predominant attitudes and views of most important industrial customers regarding the part cargo-related operations and potential future utilization of this business model. The results gained from these quantitative methods are complied with qualitative data collection tools, along with suitable secondary data sources. Based on results and logical analysis of different data sources, a framework for characterizing the different aspects of part cargo operations is developed, utilizing both existing research and empirical investigation of the phenomenon. As conclusions, part cargoes have the ability to be part of viable fleet operations, and even increase flexibility among the fleet to a certain extent. Naturally, several hinderers for this development is recognized as well, such as potential issues with information gathering and sharing, inefficient port activities, and increased transit times...|$|E
40|$|The global {{economic}} structure, with its decentralized {{production and the}} consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping {{to become the most}} suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or <b>short-sea</b> <b>shipping,</b> that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal {{of this article is to}} research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K 2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a dry port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed...|$|E
