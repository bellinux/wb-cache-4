In {{a seminal}} STOC’ 95 paper, Arya et al. conjectured that <b>spanners</b> <b>for</b> {{low-dimensional}} Euclidean spaces with constant maximum degree, hop-diameter O(log n) and lightness O(log n) (i. e., weight O(log n) · w(MST)) {{can be constructed}} in O(n log n) time. This conjecture, which became a central open question in this area, was resolved in the affirmative by Elkin and Solomon in STOC’ 13 (even for doubling metrics). In this work we present a simpler construction of <b>spanners</b> <b>for</b> doubling metrics with the above guarantees. Moreover, our construction extends in a simple and natural way to provide k-fault tolerant spanners with maximum degree O(k 2), hop-diameter O(log n) and lightness O(k 2 log n). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for constructing a span-ner for ad hoc networks whose nodes have variable transmission range. Almost all previous <b>spanner</b> constructions <b>for</b> ad hoc networks assumed that all nodes {{in the network}} have the same transmission range. This allowed a succinct representation of the network as a unit disk graph, serving {{as the basis for}} the construction. In contrast, when nodes have variable transmission range, the ad hoc network must be modeled by a general disk graph. Whereas unit disk graphs are undirected, general disk graphs are directed. This complicates the construction of a <b>spanner</b> <b>for</b> the network, since currently there are no efficient constructions of low-stretch <b>spanners</b> <b>for</b> general directed graphs. Nevertheless, in this paper it is shown that the class of disk graphs enjoys (efficiently constructible) spanners of quality similar to that of unit disk graph spanners. Moreover, it is shown that the new construction can be done in a localized fashion. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{geometric}} <b>spanner</b> <b>for</b> static wireless ad hoc networks, {{which can be}} constructed efficiently in a localized manner. It integrates the connected dominating set and the local Delaunay graph to form a backbone of the wireless network. Priori arts showed that both structures can be constructed locally with bounded communication costs. This new spanner has these following attractive properties: 1) the backbone is a planar graph, 2) the node degree of the backbone is bounded from above by a positive constant, 3) it is a <b>spanner</b> <b>for</b> both hops and length, 4) it can be constructed locally and is easy to maintain when the nodes move around, and 5) moreover, the communication cost of each node is bounded by a constant. Simulation results are also presented for studying its practical performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} constructing <b>spanners</b> <b>for</b> a given set of points that are tolerant for edge/vertex faults. Let S ae IR d be a set of n points and let k be an integer number. A k-edge/vertex fault tolerant <b>spanner</b> <b>for</b> S has the property that after the deletion of k arbitrary edges/vertices each pair of points in the remaining graph is still connected by a short path. Recently it was shown that for each set S of n points there exists a k-edge/vertex fault tolerant spanner with O(k 2 n) edges which can be constructed in O(nlogn+ k 2 n) time. Furthermore, it was shown that for each set S of n points there exists a k-edge/vertex fault tolerant spanner whose degree is bouned by O(c k+ 1) for some constant c. Our first contribution is a construction of a k-vertex fault tolerant spanner with O(kn) edges which is a tight bound. The computation takes O(nlog d Γ 1 n + knloglogn) time. Then we show that the same k-vertex fault tolerant spanner is also k-ed [...] ...|$|R
