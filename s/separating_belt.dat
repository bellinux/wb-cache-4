40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{assemblies}} of the plunger of the oil-industrial pump {{and of the}} piston of the drill pump. The purpose of the work: {{the improvement of the}} wearresistance and reliability of the piston - cylindrical bushing of the drilling pumps by the way of investigation and selection of method of strengthening of the piston core separation belt. The influence of parts of the pair piston - cylindrical bushing and the plunger assembly of pumps on the displacement of the parts operating surfaces has been studied. The selection of the effective method of strengthening of the piston core belt operating surface has been justified and realized. Offered has been the technical solution, improving the accuracy of the assembly of the oil-industrial pump plunger assembly. The technology of strengthening of the piston core <b>separating</b> <b>belt</b> operating surface has been developed and introduced in service. The new methods of strengthening of the piston drilling pumps have been introduced in Bakinsky machine plant. The technological process and a special device for the gas-flame piston coating have been introduced in the Bakinsky machine plant. The experimental batch of the pistons of the Y 8 - 6 M drilling pump with the strengthened surface of the sepatating belt, performed by the gas-flame spraying, has been manufactured and tested, which allowed to increase the service life of the pistons by more than two times. The field of application: the series manufacture of the assemblies of the drilling pump with strengthened separating belts of the piston core, performed by the gas-flame sprayingAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

It differs from the Ficht/E-Tec and Orbital direct injection systems because it uses a <b>separate,</b> <b>belt</b> driven, high-pressure, mechanical fuel pump to generate the pressure necessary for injection in a closed chamber. This is similar to most current 4-stroke automotive designs and fat pump systems.|$|R

50|$|Early {{tractors}} used belts or cables {{wrapped around}} the flywheel or a <b>separate</b> <b>belt</b> pulley to power stationary equipment, such as a threshing machine, buzz saw, silage blower, or stationary baler. In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).|$|R

Some geologists assign it to the Southern Veporic, the Gemeric unit, or even to the Eastern Carpathians. The Zemplinic is the only place of occurrence of the Precambrian rock in the Western Carpathians. They are composed of the paragneisses, amphibolites, and migmatites, together with Post-Hercynian Carboniferous and Permian conglomerates and thin beds of black coal.|$|R

5000|$|Being heavily {{based on}} the Mk 46 Mod 0, the Mk 48 Mod 0 {{features}} five MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails (one {{on top of the}} receiver, one {{on each side of the}} forearm/handguard, one under the handguard, and one on top of the barrel), an integral folding bipod, and a tripod-mounting lug. The weapon is fitted with the same fixed, polymer buttstock as the M249, although the metallic, collapsible buttstock from the [...] "Para" [...] model can be found in some models. The carrying handle, which had been removed from the Mk 46, was reintegrated on the Mk 48 to assist the replacement of hot barrels without use of other equipment, such as heat-resistant gloves; the handle can be folded down when not in use. As with the Mk 46, the Mk 48 Mod 0 does not have an M249-type magazine feed port, in order to save weight. The weapon can be fed from a loose <b>belt,</b> <b>separate</b> <b>belt</b> boxes, or clip-on ammunition pouches for 100 rounds.|$|R

25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own <b>separate</b> <b>belt,</b> making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|R
40|$|The mainly meta-volcano-sedimentary Vila Nova Group and {{associated}} granites constitute <b>separate</b> <b>belts,</b> which {{form part of}} a large paleoproterozoic (mainly rhyacian) province in the Guyana Shield of which northern Brazil forms a part, and the West African Craton. In Brazil the southwestern Serra do Ipitinga and Serra Tumucumaque-Serra do Navio belts have no obvious geometrical extensions in the Guyanas or Venezuela, and may represent deposits formed at penecontemporaneous passive continental margins and ocean floor spreading centres. To the Northeast the Serra Lombarda-Tartarugalzinho and Oiapoque belts are continuations of Guianese belts. In the former the igneous rocks have geochemical characteristics of suprasubduction environments. Belts in the Guyana Shield and West African Craton have many similar features. The megaprovince evolved in a number of stages, which may have started at about 2. 3 Ga, and continued with diminished activity after 2. 11 Ga. Both major juvenile additions and (possibly minor) reworking of earlier crust contributed to the growth of the province. The major transcurrent deformation, responsible for the present structure of the belts, probably occurred during the later stages of evolution of the province, but metamorphism and deformation are registered even in the oldest rocks.

40|$|Timing belt {{transmission}} {{is a key}} subsystem of international combustion engines. Faults in such belt systems lead to power loss, increased emissions and, in case of failure, may even cause severe damage to the whole engine. Hitherto, the physical condition of the belt has been assessed manually, which is both inconvenient and inaccurate. It {{is well known that}} driving belts emit noise according to parametrical conditions such as speed of rotation, tension, structural integrity, etc. The analysis of belt behaviour and subsequent diagnosis of potential failure should preferably be carried out using non contact methods and, as such, acoustic diagnostic stands out as a promising method. One added problem in the diagnosis process is the noise generated by the engine and the acoustic behaviour of the enclosure where the measurement is taking place. This study investigates new approaches to measuring and analysing the acoustic emission from a belt at different conditions inside an enclosure. Techniques employing a combination of microphones in directional near-field and omni-directional elsewhere are used in order to obtain a better signal. Transfer function measurement techniques are applied in order to <b>separate</b> <b>belt</b> noise from engine noise and the acoustic response of the enclosure. The method allows the extraction of useful diagnostic information about the condition of the belt and indicates areas for further research. ...|$|R
