This was {{the only}} way to obtain more exotic, highly useful {{equipment}} such as plastic explosives and antitank weapons such as the British PIAT. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance. Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors (Silent Unseen), 316 of whom were inserted into Poland during the war.|$|E

25|$|In the {{campaign}} of 217 BC, Hannibal had failed to obtain a following among the Italics. In the spring of 216 BC, he took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. Thus, by seizing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The Roman Senate authorised the raising of double-sized armies by the consuls Varro and Aemilius Paullus. By some estimates, the Romans raised a force as large as 100,000 men, though this figure cannot be completely validated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of stock out {{avoidance}} and market competition on corporate holding of finished goods inventories. We consider two adverse consequences of stock outs: immediate forgone profit and long-run loss of revenue arising from the shift of customers to more reliable <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Firms {{are more inclined to}} avoid stock outs with greater inventory if the potential for profit is greater. Other things equal, therefore, we expect inventories to be increasing in the profit margins of firms. In addition, the likelihood of lost revenue arising from the loss of disenfranchised customers depends upon the alternative <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> that are available. If there are good alternative <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> the prospect <b>of</b> long-term revenue loss is greater. The adverse consequence of stock outs is, therefore, influenced by market competition and we expect the relation between finished goods inventories and the market-power of firms to be negative. In empirical testing, we find evidence consistent with these predictions...|$|R
25|$|Weapons and logistics. The Samorian army {{did manage}} to acquire {{a large number of}} repeating rifles. Replacement and {{resupply}} however including ammunition, was a continuing problem. Freetown, under British rule in Sierra Leone, was an important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The French tried incessantly to cut this pipeline, and finally did in collaboration with the British. An attempt was made to manufacture guns indigenously, but quality was poor, although the African gunsmiths did succeed in rendering a workable breech mechanism, and in various repairs. Ammunition was also manufactured, and was so precious that after each battle, empty cartridge cases and even bullets were collected.|$|E

In this way, gas could be conveniently and inexpensively withdrawn during peak demand times. In 1931, Cities Service completed the nation's first long-distance high pressure natural gas transportation system, a 24-inch pipeline stretching some 1,000 miles from Amarillo, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{descriptions}} of the beauty, mild climate, and fertile soil of Norfolk Island in the South Pacific led the British government to establish a subsidiary settlement of the New South Wales colony there in 1788.

However, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807. The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.|$|E

25|$|From 1967 to 1993, {{almost all}} {{paclitaxel}} produced {{was derived from}} bark from the Pacific yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani; by 1987, the NCI had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for Phase II and III trials. While both {{the size of the}} wild population of Taxus brevifola and the magnitude of the eventual demand for taxol were uncertain, it was clear for many years that an alternative, sustainable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> of the natural product would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related Taxus species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the Pacific Northwest, paclitaxel was successfully extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.|$|E
25|$|National {{overview}} of water resources. Water resources are scarce in Burkina Faso. Water availability varies greatly between regions and seasons, {{as well as}} from year to year. In the South, average rainfall is as high as 1,200mm during a six-month wet season, while in the North the wet season lasts only three months and rainfall is only 300mm. The only rivers in the country that carry water all year around are the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) and the Nakambe River (White Volta), the other rivers carrying water only during the wet season. Building dams has been the most common way of storing water for the dry season, even though evaporation can reach 2,000mm/year thus causing substantial water losses from open reservoirs. A substantial portion of surface water resources is shared with neighboring countries. For example, the Nakambe River - the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> for the capital, Ouagadougou - and the Mouhoun River are shared with Ghana. Surface water resources vary between 8 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year in an average year and 4 BCM in a dry year. The lower figure corresponds to less than 300 cubic meters per capita and year, which is well below the level of 1,000 cubic meters per capita and year that is considered the threshold for “water stress”.|$|E
