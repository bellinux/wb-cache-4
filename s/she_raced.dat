25|$|Taking to {{the court}} after was Belgian Kim Clijsters and Swiss Martina Hingis in the last quarter-final to be contested, {{and one of the}} most {{anticipated}} match-ups thus far in the tournament. Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis at exactly the same stage before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 unforced errors, but began to find her game in the second set. <b>She</b> <b>raced</b> to a 5–2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6–4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2–0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been drained from her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two unforced errors less than the Belgian. The semi-finals will feature Maria Sharapova against Kim Clijsters.|$|E

25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her work cut out for her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as <b>she</b> <b>raced</b> out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E

She started a 40/1 outsider and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind the six-year-old Bendigo.

500|$|Harding went to {{bed early}} in the evening of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When she paused to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and <b>she</b> <b>raced</b> to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
