50|$|Brake {{specific}} {{fuel consumption}} (BSFC) {{is a measure of}} the fuel efficiency of any prime mover that burns fuel and produces rotational, or shaft, power. It is typically used for comparing the efficiency of internal combustion engines with a <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{numerical}} {{classification of}} a turbine is its specific speed. This number describes {{the speed of}} the turbine at its maximum efficiency with respect to the power and flow rate. The specific speed is derived to be independent of turbine size. Given the fluid flow conditions and the desired <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> speed, the specific speed can be calculated and an appropriate turbine design selected.|$|E
50|$|It is a three-axis design, with first, second, fifth, {{and sixth}} gears on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> behind {{and below the}} input shaft, and third and fourth gears are on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> in front of and above the input <b>shaft.</b> Both <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pinions drive a helical gear with a {{conventional}} differential. The clutch is mounted on a dual-mass flywheel to dampen vibrations on whichever <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is idle depending upon which gear is selected.|$|R
50|$|The {{input shaft}} drives an {{eccentric}} bearing {{that in turn}} drives the cycloidal disc in an eccentric, cycloidal motion. The perimeter of this disc is geared to a stationary ring gear and has a series of <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pins or rollers placed through {{the face of the}} disc. These <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pins directly drive the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> as the cycloidal disc rotates. The radial motion of the disc is not translated to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{sample testing}} device {{includes}} a motor, a gear reducer, and an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> coupled for rotation by the motor via the gear reducer. The sample testing device further includes a first device adapted {{to enable the}} <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to move linearly in a first direction substantially parallel with an axis of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and a second device coupled to the first device for enabling the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to move linearly in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The sample testing can further include a third device coupled to {{the first and second}} devices for enabling the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to translate linearly in a third direction substantially perpendicular to the first and second directions...|$|R
50|$|ESCs {{designed}} for boats are by necessity waterproof. The watertight structure is {{significantly different from}} that of non-marine type ESCs, with a more packed air trapping enclosure. Thus arises the need to cool the motor and ESC effectively to prevent rapid failure. Most marine-grade ESCs are cooled by circulated water run by the motor, or negative propeller vacuum near the drive <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b> Like car ESCs, boat ESCs have braking and reverse capability.|$|E
5000|$|The pushing-type {{propulsion}} {{units in}} Moskva and Sankt-Peterburg are each driven by two [...] electric motors in tandem, {{resulting in a}} total <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> of [...] In Vladivostok, Murmansk and Novorossiysk, the propulsion units are of pulling type, meaning that the propeller is facing forward, and the four propulsion motors are rated [...] each. Despite having a higher propulsion power of , the newer icebreakers are also referred to as [...] "16-megawatt icebreakers".|$|E
50|$|A {{turboshaft}} engine {{may be made}} up of two major parts assemblies: the 'gas generator' and the 'power section'. The gas generator consists of the compressor, combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more stages of turbine. The power section consists of additional stages of turbines, a gear reduction system, and the <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b> The gas generator creates the hot expanding gases to drive the power section. Depending on the design, the engine accessories may be driven either by the gas generator or by the power section.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Figure  8 that the {{spectrum}} of the intact gear only contains the frequencies of the input shaft, lay <b>shaft,</b> and <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> whereas the local defect excites the rotary frequency and its harmonic of the defect gear shaft.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input <b>shaft),</b> therefore the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the idler wheel.|$|R
50|$|A hydroviscous drive {{consists}} {{of one or}} more discs connected to the input shaft pressed against a similar disc or discs connected to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> Torque is transmitted from the input <b>shaft</b> to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> through an oil film between the discs. The transmitted torque is proportional to the pressure exerted by a hydraulic cylinder that presses the discs together.|$|R
5000|$|The Mitsubishi R2000 farm tractor is a {{rice field}} tractor {{that was in}} limited {{production}} {{in the early to}} mid 1970s. The power rating for Japanese tractors is taken from the PTO <b>shaft</b> <b>output,</b> and the R2000 is rated at 20 hp. The engine flywheel rating is 23 hp. These tractors are overbuilt for the originally intended purpose and many are still running today on small farms. The [...] "R" [...] series included 3 models: R1500, R2000, R2500. Red and silver is the original color of all three models with some being shipped the U.S. in the late 1970s painted blue and white.|$|E
50|$|The power P = Fu = Tω, where ω is {{the angular}} {{velocity}} of the wheel. Substituting for F, we have P = 2ρQ(Vi − u)u. To find the runner speed at maximum power, take the derivative of P with respect to u and set it equal to zero, = 2ρQ(Vi. Maximum power occurs when u = Vi /2. Pmax = ρQVi2/2. Substituting the initial jet power Vi = √(2gh), this simplifies to Pmax = ρghQ. This quantity exactly equals the kinetic power of the jet, so in this ideal case, the efficiency is 100%, since all the energy in the jet is converted to <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven <b>shaft</b> (<b>output),</b> but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{mechanism}} {{consisted of}} three moving parts, an input <b>shaft,</b> an <b>output</b> disk, and some sort of roller or disk between the two. Generally the input shaft was electrically driven and used some sort of governor to ensure it spun at a constant speed. The output was a metal disk on a shaft that was arranged {{at right angles to}} the input. That is, if the input shaft was vertically aligned, the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> would be horizontal, with the disk {{on the end of the}} <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> lying vertically beside the input.|$|R

40|$|The {{level of}} wire rope {{technology}} used in mine hoisting applications {{has a significant}} effect on the overall efficiency of the hoisting system. This paper discusses the effect that a reduction in rope mass per unit length and an increase in rope breaking strength can have on rock skip capacity and hence mine <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b> A 20 per cent reduction in rope mass per metre for a typical 48 mm hoisting rope, while maintaining the breaking strength, increases the skip’s capacity by circa 30 per cent at a suspended rope length of 3000 m. Such gains in <b>shaft</b> <b>output,</b> without any significant changes to the shaft or winder design, can have major implications for the feasibility of future deep mine projects. The technical challenge for rope manufacturers is how to get rid of 20 to 30 per cent of the rope mass while keeping the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity of the whole rope constant. CASAR are currently developing steel wire rope constructions where the steel IWRC has been replaced with high strength...|$|E

The new instantaneous phasor method originated by the author is applied for the evaluation of efficiency of induction motors installed in the field...|$|E
30|$|In the {{spectrum}} of the defect case shown in Figure  11, the frequency component of 10  Hz is the rotating frequency of the input shaft, whereas the predominant frequency of 6.5  Hz is the interference component inspired by other excitation in the gear chain, which covers the frequency components of the lay <b>shaft</b> and <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
40|$|A motor {{controller}} system uses a rotary sensor with {{a plurality of}} signal conditioning units, coupled to the rotary sensor. Each of these units, which {{is associated with a}} particular range of motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rates, generate a feedback signal indicative of the position of the motor s <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A controller (i) converts a selected motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rate to a corresponding incremental amount of rotational movement for a selected fixed time period, (ii) selects, at periodic completions of the selected fixed time period, the feedback signal from one of the signal conditioning units for which the particular range of motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rates associated therewith encompasses the selected motor <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotation rate, and (iii) generates a motor drive signal based on a difference between the incremental amount of rotational movement and the feedback signal from the selected one of the signal conditioning Units...|$|R
50|$|Many Powerglides {{share the}} same length, 27 spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> and {{transmission}} mounting as the THM 350; thus, the transmissions are easily interchangeable for owners wanting three speeds instead of two.

40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} {{promise to}} be an important source of low-carbon electrical energy, but produce output power which fluctuates at a low frequency. The usual solution is to use flywheel energy storage on the <b>shaft</b> <b>output.</b> This paper proposes a novel alternative which uses aggregation to smooth most of the power oscillation and a fast-response power electronics device, the D-STATCOM, to smooth out the residual change.

The measurement system that measures the driving duty applied to the powertrain system caused by mobility on roads consists of eight analog channels and two pulse channels, including the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> torques for the left and right sides. The data obtained from this measurement system can be used to introduce a new technology that produces the output torque of a torque converter and that can be applied to analyze the revolution counting for the endurance and road mobility in the front unit and represent the relative fatigue damages analysis technique and its results according to the driven roads through a cumulative fatigue method...|$|E

50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the crankshaft position sensor. Early AW4s used 21-spline <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline count.

40|$|It is a known {{fact that}} when {{operating}} at light load condition, the efficiency of induction motors can be improved by reducing the supply voltage. This paper investigates the optimal efficiency of split-phase motors when loaded below their horsepower rating. An accurate equivalent circuit model {{that takes into account}} stray load loss and rotational loss, in addition to core loss, is proposed for efficiency calculations. The model is used to determine optimal values of the source voltage for different <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> powers. The process involves solving a set of nonlinear equations at each load level. When neglecting rotational losses, however, the optimal solution becomes straightforward as this is reduced to constant power factor operation. The work is illustrated by both simulations and laboratory measurements on a commercial 1 / 3 hp motor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{algebraic}} scroll expander {{has been}} fabricated and {{tested in a}} R 134 a Rankine cycle with heat source of 20 kW. For the operating conditions of 20 ～ 26 bar and 90 ～ 93 ℃ at the expander inlet and 8 ～ 9 bar at the outlet, the expander produced the <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> power of about 0. 6 ～ 0. 7 kW in the operating speed range of 1500 ～ 2000 rpm. These correspond to the expander efficiency of 40 ~ 45 %. The volumetric efficiency increased with increasing of the expander speed, reaching to 80 % at 2000 rpm. Comparing to numerical simulation results, mechanical efficiency from the test data {{was found to be}} considerably low by as much as 30 %, indicating that reduction in the frictional loss should be made to improve the scroll expander efficiency.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{helicopter}} to function efficiently at zero flight speed is counterbalanced by a limitation to rather low forward flight speeds. An ability to fly efficiently at high speed would provide very significant improvements in rotorcraft productivity and economics. The implementation of such improvements would require {{the development of a}} suitable integrated power plant for both the vertical and horizontal flight modes. The engine should be a <b>shaft</b> <b>output</b> engine in the vertical flight mode. In the horizontal mode, the propulsor can be fan or propeller. A description is presented of a program concerned with the demonstration of a convertible turbofan/turboshaft engine. The program is nominally directed toward the demonstration of a propulsion system for an X-wing aircraft. However, the principles being investigated are applicable to any convertible turbofan/turboshaft engine application. At the current early stage of the program, no barrier problems have become apparent, and interesting possibilities for high speed rotorcraft flight are envisaged...|$|E
