5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans live {{in primary}} and old <b>secondary</b> <b>forests,</b> {{particularly}} dipterocarp forests and peat swamp forests. Both species {{can be found}} in mountainous and lowland swampy areas. Sumatran orangutans live at elevations as high as 1500m (4921ft), while Bornean orangutans live no higher than 1000m (3281ft). Other habitats used by orangutans include grasslands, cultivated fields, gardens, young secondary forest, and shallow lakes. Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all their time in the trees.|$|E
40|$|Studies in <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> in Latin America {{have largely}} been {{confined}} to terra firme lands. This paper reports on a study of dynamics of <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> and its interactions with land use for agriculture and utilization of primary forest in the floodplains of the Uyacali and Amazon rivers in Peru. This environment is marked by more fertile soils than generally found on terra firme lands. Floodplains soils may flood yearly or once every several years. Farmers grow combinations of crops on different agricultural sites, and under annual production and multi-annual regimes. <b>Secondary</b> <b>forest</b> {{plays an important role}} in this environment. The main trends in the process of formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> have been analysed through a survey among 218 farmers, collecting data on land use, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> management, and other economic activities. The results show that processes of <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> formation are influenced by advancing market access, changes in the dominant land type as a result of river floods, and population pressure when villages become older. As villages age farmer's holding tend to become smaller. While this happens private primary forest reserves are replaced by <b>secondary</b> <b>forest,</b> but total forest cover does not decline. The economic importance of <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> increases when these forests age, but improved market access seems to off-set this trend. The concept of frontier expansion, and the related change of the role <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> in the landscape, typical for colonization areas, does only partly apply to this environment...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the soil carbon dynamics between a pine plantation and a <b>secondary</b> <b>forest,</b> {{both of which}} originated from the same farmland abandoned in 1976 with the same cropping history and soil conditions, in the wet tropics in Puerto Rico from July 1996 to June 1997. We found that the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> accumulated the heavy-fraction organic carbon (HF-OC) measured by the density fractionation technique, more efficiently than the tree plantation did. Although {{there was no significant}} difference in total soil organic carbon (SOC) between the plantation (5. 59 0. 09 kgm 2) and the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> (5. 68 0. 16 kgm 2), the proportion of HF-OC carbon to the total SOC was significantly higher in the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> (61 %) than in the plantation (45 %) (Po 0. 05). Forest floor mass and aboveground litterfall in the plantation were 168 % and 22. 8 % greater than those in the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest,</b> respectively, while the decomposition rate of leaf litter in the plantation was 23. 3 % lower than that in the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest.</b> The annual mean soil respirations in the plantation and the <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> were 2. 32 0. 15 and 2. 65 0. 18 gCm 2 day 1, respectively, with a consistently higher rate in th...|$|R

5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi {{is known}} from four places on Madagascar, all below 80m (260ft) altitude, of which two {{are on the}} west and two {{on the east side}} of the island. Among the eastern {{collection}} sites, Kianjavato is a rural town surrounded by farmland and <b>secondary</b> <b>forests,</b> where P.raceyi were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a mistnet over a river, and Tampolo is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, Kirindy and Mikea, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle Hypsugo anchietae has also been recorded. The true distribution of P.raceyi is probably larger than that currently known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. <b>Secondary</b> <b>forests</b> dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, under {{conditions}} in which forest areas are being opened with increasing number of forest roads due to great need for forest resources, {{the need for a}} well-kept system of forest roads becomes a necessary prerequisite in the process of intensification of forest ecosystems management. Cadastre of primary forest traffic infrastructure on the territory of the Republic of Croatia has already been established, and now the need for <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> road cadastre arises. Development of <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> road cadastre methodology will make a great and important step in inventarisation of the entire <b>secondary</b> <b>forest</b> traffic infrastructure.

5|$|The pygmy slow loris has {{declined}} in numbers {{as a result}} of extensive habitat degradation throughout its range, including north-eastern Cambodia, the Yunnan Province of China, and Vietnam. In Yunnan province, nearly all primary evergreen forests have vanished and <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> have been heavily degraded; as of 2005, forest cover has been reduced by 42% since the mid-1990s. The use of defoliants, such as Agent Orange, during the Vietnam War and the ongoing clearing of forests in Vietnam have resulted in a considerable loss of habitat. As of 2003, the forest cover had been reduced to 30% of its original area, with only 10% of the remaining forest consisting of the closed-canopy forests preferred by the pygmy slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, <b>secondary</b> <b>forests.</b> Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E

25|$|This species breeds in upland to montane oak (Quercus) {{and other}} broadleaved forests and similar wooded areas in {{temperate}} to tropical southern Asia, from Pakistan, Central India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and southern China. Many populations are resident, but some Himalayan birds are partial migrants that winter in peninsular India sometimes even occurring in arid habitats. Other populations may make altitudinal movements but {{in parts of}} the eastern Himalayas such as Bhutan, they have been found to occur all year round, and can be found up to and above 2,000 m ASL. During the non-breeding season, they are seen in the plains and lower elevations (September to March in India) when they prefer well wooded areas of relatively mature <b>secondary</b> <b>forests,</b> abandoned plantations and overgrown gardens, usually near water and streams including wooded gorges.

25|$|Extensive logging of redwoods {{began in}} the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall. Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or {{waterways}} by oxen or horse. Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas. The introduction of steam engines allowed logs to be dragged through long skid trails to nearby railroads, furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees. This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock. After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area and was encouraged by tax law which exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested. Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding. This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to evaluate the spectral response of several vegetation physiognomies in the municipality of Maraba, Para, {{in relation to the}} reflectance in Landsat 7 ETM+ and to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Based on the videography, five types of vegetation physiognomies were identified: Upland <b>Forest,</b> Floodplain <b>Forest,</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>forest,</b> Babacu Forest and Grassland. Analysis of the digital number distribution of each physiognomy in each band were conducted and of their relations with NDVI. The results demonstrated that the spectral signature of each physiognomy is associated to the amount of vegetation cover, canopy architecture, dominant background and to the leaf angular distribution.

500|$|While {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{is found in}} both primary and {{secondary}} deciduous forests, they have lower population densities in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests.</b> This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter torpor during the dry season, especially for females, which tend to hibernate longer than males. In primary forests, they can maintain daily torpor or hibernation {{as long as their}} body temperatures remain below , but in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> that have fewer large trees, temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur's ability to maintain torpor for prolonged periods of time. [...] In addition, the gray mouse lemur in <b>secondary</b> <b>forests</b> tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests, as well as lower survival rates.
