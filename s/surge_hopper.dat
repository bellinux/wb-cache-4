50|$|Bomb liner {{material}} received from Plant 5 in mobile hoppers was emptied at an unloading station and elevated to a <b>surge</b> <b>hopper.</b> Material as needed was sent from the <b>surge</b> <b>hopper</b> through a jaw crusher {{and into a}} shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a <b>surge</b> <b>hopper</b> and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump. Uranium in the filtrate {{was sent to a}} precipitation tank and precipitated with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), in presence of phosphoric acid to form UAP (uranyl ammonium phosphate). The resulting slurry was filtered and the uranium bearing cake was introduced to a drying furnace. The dried UAP was sent to the refinery. In addition to the wet system described, several furnaces were installed in the plant for massive metal oxidation, pyrohydrolysis, drying, chip and sludge combustion, etc. Most of the furnaces can be used for more than one of the above operations.|$|E
50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a <b>surge</b> <b>hopper</b> that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a <b>surge</b> <b>hopper</b> that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E
40|$|The Mulled Coal {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} overcoming the adverse handling characteristics of wet fine coal without thermal drying. The process involves the addition of a low cost harmless reagent to wet fine coal using off-the-shelf mixing equipment. Based on laboratory- and bench-scale testing, Mulled Coal can be stored, shipped, and burned without causing any of the plugging, pasting, carryback and freezing problems normally associated with wet coal. The objectives of this project are to demonstrate that: The Mulled Coal process, which has been proven to work {{on a wide range of}} wet fine coals at bench scale, will work equally well in a commercial coal preparation plant. The wet product from a fine coal cleaning circuit can be converted to a solid fuel form for ease of handling and cost savings in storage and rail car transportation. A wet fine coal product thus converted to a solid fuel form can be stored, shipped, and burned with conventional fuel handling, transportation, and combustion systems. The Mulled Coal circuit was installed in an empty bay at the Chetopa Preparation Plant. Equipment has been installed to divert a 2. 7 tonnes/hr (3 tons/hr) slipstream of the froth concentrate to a dewatering centrifuge. The concentrated wet coal fines from the centrifuge dropped through a chute directly into a <b>surge</b> <b>hopper</b> and feed system for the Mulled Coal circuit. The Mulled Coal product was gravity discharged from the circuit to a truck or product discharge area from which it will be hauled to a stockpile located at the edge of the clean coal stockpile area. During the 3 -month operating period, the facility produced 870 tonnes (966 tons) of the Muffed Coal for evaluation in various storage, handling, and transportation equipment and operations. Immediately following the production demonstration, the circuit was disassembled and the facility was decommissioned...|$|E
5000|$|Bulk {{material}} handling. Belt feeders {{are typically}} used for handling fairly light, fine, abrasive, free flowing materials. Feeder units are typically placed under storage facilities such as silos, <b>surge</b> <b>hoppers</b> or load hoppers, {{and may be}} operated either horizontally or on an incline to save headroom. For such applications, belt width is governed {{by the size of}} the material being handled and required tons per hour.|$|R
40|$|Submerged {{granular}} hoppers exhibit {{an unexpected}} surge in discharge rate as they empty [Wilson et al. 2015]. With a more sensitive apparatus, {{we find that}} this <b>surge</b> depends on <b>hopper</b> diameter and also happens in air [...] - though the effect is smaller and previously unnoticed. We also find that the surge may be turned off by fixing the rate of fluid flow through the granular packing. With no flow control, dye injected {{on top of the}} packing gets drawn into the grains, at a rate that increases as the hopper empties. Thus we conclude that the surge is caused by a self-generated pumping of fluid through the packing. We successfully model this effect via a driving pressure set by the dilation of grains as they exit. This highlights a surprising and unrecognized role that interstitial fluid plays in setting the discharge rate, and likely also in controlling clog formation, for granular hoppers whether in air or under water.
