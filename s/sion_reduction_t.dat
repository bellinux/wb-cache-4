The introduction of the Lorenz template permitted a dimen- <b>sion</b> <b>reduction,</b> {{the definition of the}} one-dimensional Lorenz map and the use of symbolic dynamics to code its orbits. Meanwhile, Thurston’s geometrization theo- rem implies that all Lorenz knots can be classified as torus knots, satellites or hy- perbolic. Based on a list of hyperbolic knots presented by Birman and Kofman, we define three families of Lorenz knots, compute their hyperbolic volume using the Topology and Geometry software SnapPy and use the results to present conjectures concerning their hiperbolicity...|$|R

These markets entail new challenges to accounting practitioners. The aim of this paper is, on the one hand, {{to know how the}} financial statements are being affected by the obligations of companies to control and com- pensate their carbon emissions, by analyzing the different positions adopted by both regulatory organizations and com- panies in the practice; and, on the other hand, to analyze the content and specific problematic of accounting statements that report on emissions in physical terms. This paper considers the accounting treatment of new carbon assets and li- abilities which external information is not sufficiently regulated.

Total faradaic efficiency ~qHC for the generation of CH 4 and CzH ~ became a max imum at 1 O°C and reached about 65 %. Furthermore, ~c increased with increasing <b>reduction</b> <b>t</b> ime in strong contrast with the conventional potentiostatic electroreduction in wh ich ~c decreased drastically with the <b>reduction</b> <b>t</b> ime due to the poisoning effect of the products. It was proposed that some surface intermediate fo rmed by the interaction between COe and the thin oxide layer on a Cu electrode is finally reduced to CH ~ or C~H 4, depending on the anodic reactions taking place during the anodie period. In the preceding study, we proposed a new technique for clarifying the reduction mechanism ~ and effectively reduc-ing carbon dioxides to hydrocarbons 2 by a pulsed method. In the latter, a cathodic bias (Vc) and an anodic bias (VA) are periodically changed. By changing Vc, VA, and their periods (Tc and TA), the generation ratio of hydrocarbons to hydro-gen can be changed. Another advantage of the pulsed method is that the poi-soning of the electrode activity due to the deposition of reduction products uch as graphitic arbons can be totally avoided. This is probably due to the effect of anodic bias which will keep intermediates from being transformed t...|$|R

Finally, we design an optimal, sequential normalizing strategy for PTRSs.
