2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the <b>soil</b> <b>heating</b> it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{energy balance}} is an {{important}} tool for sustainable water management and for estimating crop evapotranspiration. Net radiation is converted to latent heat flux, sensible <b>heat</b> flux, and <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux at {{the surface of the}} earth. The <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux component is challenging to determine because of the high degree of variation in soil moisture and temperature within the soil profile. Surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux may be approximated using atmospheric and solar data but is more readily determined using <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements, which are typically made at a reference soil depth of 8 cm. However, the surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux occurring at any moment in time is actually not measured at the reference depth until some time later because of the travel time for that heat to reach the heat flux plate 8 cm below. This means there is generally a time lag in the <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement relative to the atmospheric measurements. Consideration of the time lag between the soil surface and the sub-surface could improve the accuracy of energy balance calculations. Accurate <b>soil</b> surface <b>heat</b> flux estimation is crucial for modeling of energy and water-related processes as well as for validating sensor-based ET measurement techniques. Numerical models have been developed to simulate both soil-heat and -water dynamics. The objectives of this study were to estimate surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux based on atmospheric data and <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements in the field and to investigate the <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux time lag using the HYRDUS- 1 D model. Atmospheric data were collected from an Eddie covariance tower in a vineyard, including evapotranspiration, net radiation, air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. Soil moisture was measured using a Hydra Probe and <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux was measured at 1. 5 - and 8 -cm with Tri-needle heat pulse probes. Preliminary results indicated a 2 - 3 hour time lag for <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements in saturated soil between 1. 5 and 8 cm depth.

40|$|The large <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes in hot desert {{regions are}} very {{important}} in energy balance studies. Surface energy balance (SEB) observations, however, reveal {{that there is an}} imbalance in Surface flux measurements and {{that it is difficult to}} isolate those flux measurements causing the imbalance errors. In this paper a new approach was tested focusing on a high temporal resolution of <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements at the surface. To determine if improved <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements could be obtained for a sandy desert, a standard <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux sensor was buried at the surface of a playa and covered with less than I mm of playa soil, as opposed to burial several centimetres deep. It was anticipated that this would permit direct surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements. A field campaign was carried out in September and October in 1997 and for the same period in 2000, in a sandy desert belt situated in Nizzana, NW Negev, Israel. The research was designed to examine the separate components of the SEB. The location was considered ideal since only the <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux and sensible heat flux are balanced by the net radiation. This new approach was compared to traditional <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurements. The resulting energy balance closure was found to be very good. The results suggest that this method could be used as a reference surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux measurement. Further examination of the energy balance closure is needed over a range of land surface types. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In addition, air temperature (Tair) may be a key variable in the modeling of G as suggested by the ANN application (r of 0. 83).

50|$|Enhancements for {{improving}} the effectiveness of SVE can include directional drilling, pneumatic and hydraulic fracturing, and thermal enhancement (e.g., hot air or steam injection). Directional drilling and fracturing enhancements are generally intended to improve the gas flow through the subsurface, especially in lower permeability zones. Thermal enhancements such as hot air or steam injection increase the subsurface soil temperature, thereby improving the volatility of the contamination. In addition, injection of hot (dry) air can remove soil moisture and thus improve the gas permeability of the soil. Additional thermal technologies (such as electrical resistance heating, six-phase <b>soil</b> <b>heating,</b> radio-frequency heating, or thermal conduction heating) {{can be applied to}} the subsurface to heat the soil and volatilize/desorb contaminants, but these are generally viewed as separate technologies (versus a SVE enhancement) that may use vacuum extraction (or other methods) for collecting soil gas.|$|E

Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of soil cover. As mentioned earlier, temperature greatly affects the rate of soil respiration. This may have the most drastic influence in the Arctic. Large stores of carbon are locked in the frozen permafrost. With an increase in temperature, this permafrost is melting and aerobic conditions are beginning to prevail, thereby greatly increasing the rate of respiration in that ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|Incoming {{radiation}} forcing at {{the land}} surface is partitioned among {{the components of}} the surface energy balance in varying proportions depending on the time scale of the forcing. Based on a land-atmosphere analytic continuum model, a numerical land surface model, and field observations we show that high-frequency fluctuations in incoming radiation (with period less than 6 h, for example, due to intermittent clouds) are preferentially partitioned toward ground heat flux. These higher frequencies are concentrated in the 0 – 1 cm surface soil layer. Subsequently, measurements even at a few centimeters deep in the soil profile miss part of the surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux signal. The attenuation of the high-frequency <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux spectrum throughout the soil profile leads to systematic errors in both measurements and modeling, which require a very fine sampling near the soil surface (0 – 1 cm).

In addition, the temporal calculation of the change in the heat storage term of the calorimetric method can further distort the reconstruction of the surface <b>soil</b> <b>heat</b> flux signal.
