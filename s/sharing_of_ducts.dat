30|$|Due to {{the effect}} <b>of</b> the <b>duct,</b> the {{slipstream}} pattern and aerodynamic characteristic <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor {{are different from the}} conventional open-type rotor. It can reduce the risk of component damage and enhance the operational safety. In addition, both the <b>duct</b> and rotor <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor can produce thrust. Thrust which is produced by the duct is due to negative pressure on the duct inlet, which contributes a maximum of 50  % to the total. Furthermore, the noise <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is lower than the conventional open-type rotor (Keys et al. 1991; Desjardins et al. 1991). Consequently, the analysis of the aerodynamic noise <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is the main topic for this paper.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{aerodynamic}} noise, aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor should be obtained first. Along with the development <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, many researchers have studied the aerodynamic characteristics of various types <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotors (Rajagopalan and Keys 1997; Bandoh et al. 1998; Vuillet and Morelli 1986). In recent years, the main method which investigates the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method. Among those CFD methods, momentum source method {{is one of the}} commonly used methods. The momentum source with functional relationship to the local flow conditions represents the spanning rotor in flow field and are added to the N-S equations by UDF procedure. Cao and Yu (2005) used it to solve the numerical simulation of turbulent flow around ducted tail rotor. The method not only can predict the flow field but also investigate the performance <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotors. Song et al. (2009) applied it to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor. To obtain the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, the author solved the N-S equation added by the source. The numerical solutions were verified by the experimental data, and some aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor were also discussed. Even though momentum source method is quite successful for the prediction of the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, detailed three dimensional flow features cannot be accurately predicted. Because of the approximation of the blade shape parameters, the accuracy of the momentum source method is still limited. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the accurate noise source information by using the momentum source method. In this work, a CFD method which is considered the blade shape parameters has been proposed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, and the method is based on moving reference frame (MRF) model instead of momentum source method.|$|R

Earth ducts typically require long tubes to cool the supply air to an appropriate temperature before entering the building. A fan is required to draw the air from the earth duct into the building.
