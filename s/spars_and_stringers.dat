2500|$|Before the A-12, {{titanium}} {{was used}} only in high-temperature exhaust fairings {{and other small}} parts directly related to supporting, cooling, or shaping high-temperature areas on aircraft like those subject to the greatest kinetic heating from the airstream, such as wing leading edges. The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium. Titanium is quite rigid and difficult to machine, which {{made it difficult to}} form into curves given available techniques. This made the construction of the leading edges of the wing and similar surfaces difficult to form. The solution was found by machining only small [...] "fillets" [...] of the material with the required shape and then glueing them onto the underlying framework which was more linear. A good example is on the wing; the underlying framework of <b>spars</b> <b>and</b> <b>stringers</b> formed a grid, leaving triangular notches along the leading edge that were filled with fillets.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of carbon}} fibre/epoxy {{laminates}} {{and other types}} of composites in aircraft and helicopters has increased greatly over the past decade. These applications include structural bonded joints and stiffener-skin bonded panels such as ribs, <b>spars</b> <b>and</b> <b>stringers.</b> A long-standing problem with bonded composite structural joints is the low strength and toughness of their bond-line, which makes them susceptible to bond-line cracking under the application of normal (through-thickness) tensile, in-plane secondary bending or impact loads. One promising through-thickness reinforcement method is z-pinning. Z-pins are thin metallic or fibrous rods inserted through the bonded region of a composite joint, and they act as fine nails which hold the adherends together by bridging tractions after the bond-line has fractured. The general aim of this PhD study is to investigate the structural properties and damage tolerance of z-pinned composite bonded joints. This PhD investigates two types of bonded carbon fibre/epoxy joints commonly used in aircraft (and other engineering) structural composites: T-shaped joints and single lap joints. Specifically, the PhD examines the influences of various parameters on the mechanical performance of bonded T-joints to optimise the z-pinning conditions. The parameters studied include the volume content, diameter and embedded length of the z-pins; the location of the z-pins in the joint; and the direction of the applied load. The PhD also investigates the mechanical performance of z-pinned lap joints, and in particular their creep and stress rupture properties as well as the creep toughening mechanisms. This thesis presents an experimental investigation into the efficacy of z-pins to improve the structural properties of bonded T-joints under an applied tensile (pull-off) load. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the effect of z-pin content on the strengthening and toughening of T-joints, and provides important analytical information and experimental data to optimise the z-pinning conditions for maximum structural performance. The study found that z-pinning significantly improves the mechanical performance of T-joints under different pull-off load angles, and when a pre-existing crack is present in the joint. Also, effects of z-pin reinforcement location and z-pin embedded length (i. e. joint thickness) were investigated experimentally and analytically. Lastly, this thesis presents a study into the creep properties, stress rupture and creep mechanisms of single lap joints reinforced with z-pins. The PhD thesis concludes with a summary of the major research findings, a discussion of future research directions into z-pinned composite joints, and the remaining challenges in the certification of z-pinned joints for use in primary aircraft structures...|$|E

40|$|Many {{engineering}} structures {{can be seen}} as multicomponent structures. Typical examples of such structures are aircraft wings and fibre-reinforced composites. The former are typically composed of skins, <b>spars,</b> <b>stringers</b> <b>and</b> ribs. The latter are composed by plies made of fibres and matrices. Models built by means of an arbitrary combination of different components lead to a component-wise (CW) analysis. The present chapter presents an innovative CW approach based on the one-dimensional Carrera unified formulation (CUF). The CUF has been developed recently, different classes of models are available and, in this work, Taylor-like (TE) and Lagrange-like (LE) elements were adopted. Different numerical examples are proposed, including aircraft structures, composite laminates and typical buildings from civil engineering. Comparisons with results from solid and shell finite elements are given. It is concluded that the present CW approach represents a reliable and computationally cheap tool which can be exploited for many types of structural analyse...|$|R

These data include information on the theoretical external surfaces of the airplane, the location of such elements of its design-force elements as <b>spars,</b> ribs <b>and</b> <b>stringers</b> of wing, etc. The basic geometry is the foundation for subsequent automated design of airplane and also for creation technological processes of its manufacture and use. New ways and methods of integrated forming in the environment of modern CAD systems have been proposed. They are based on extensive use of information technology databases, flexible performing alternative calculations and the correct implementation of the geometric modeling of technical objects in the environment of modern computer-aided design. OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets and CAD SolidWorks were taken to carry out related research. Database of aerodynamic profiles and basic geometry of the wing was set up in the environment of the first software package. Automated communication geometric wing database with other software for its design has been installed. The corresponding geometric relationship database wing and SolidWorks CAD has been implemented. This technique allows an automated way to create and analyze multiple design variants of the airplane wing. The specified method significantly improves the quality of created technical objects. The laboriousness of design work is also reduced. This is achieved by through automation of all design operations. Illustrative examples in the environment OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets and SoidWorks CAD are given in this article. Calculation formulas to populate of database fields are shown. Questions relationship base geometry of the wing and its strength, design, technology, manufacturing and operation are analyzed. The proposed technique can be used as part of the general methodology of complex automation of the aircraft throughout its life cycle.

40|$|The {{lifting system}} of a PrandtlPlane is {{a box in}} the front view, made of two swept wings set at {{different}} heights and of vertical wings at their tips; one or two fins connect the rear wing to the upper fuselage, and the front wing is clamped to the same; thus, the wing system is over-constrained, and the structural design becomes a challenge. In this paper, starting from a preliminary solution, an optimization procedure is applied to minimize the overall weight with the constraints of maximum allowable stress, stability of compressed structures, minimum aileron effectiveness, aeroelastic effects on load distribution and flutter. The system is approximated as beams with 54 elements. Two models of the wing section are presented: in the first, the wing section is approximated with three parameters (skin thickness, <b>spar</b> web thickness <b>and</b> <b>stringer</b> section total area) {{for a total of}} 162 degrees of freedom; in the second one, two other parameters are adjoined in any section (areas of two spar flanges) with a total of 270 d. o. f.

40|$|AbstractAutoclave prepreg {{moulding}} technique {{has been the}} traditionally used process for the manufacture of primary aircraft composite structures. Alternate processing technologies, which are cost effective and less energy intensive, are being explored by the industry. Techniques like liquid composite moulding, especially variants of {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} moulding (VARTM) processes have been successfully applied to realise large sized components albeit with minimum degree of cocuring. CSIR-NAL has developed a proprietary infusion process called âVacuum Enhanced Resin Infusion Technologyâ (VERITy) which can be used for large scale cocuring. The objective was to realise a co-infused and cocured wing test box consisting of bottom skin, <b>spars,</b> ribs, gussets <b>and</b> <b>stringers.</b> The challenge lies in the usage of appropriate tooling philosophy to suit the infusion process and control of flow characteristics in a complex preform with proper infusion strategy. A âRigidâFlexibleâ tooling concept was adopted so that the applied pressure is faithfully transferred by tools to the preform underneath for proper consolidation, without compromising on dimensional requirements. Infusion of resin into well compacted network of reinforcement with varying thickness is tricky and difficult because of the complex flow characteristics. Infusion strategy was worked out based on the experimental data as the flow simulation at such a level is equally challenging. Both parallel and series infusions were adopted for co-infusing the wing test box. Ultrasonic scan results show that the part was defect free vindicating tooling concepts and infusion strategies adopted...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{continues}} the work performed by Ferreira and Almeida {{on the topic}} of weight and cost reduction of composite multi-spar torsion-bending boxes. The goal is to find the influence of changes to the structural configuration on the resulting weight of said torsion-bending boxes. Using analytical methods, combined into the BoxSolver MATLAB-program, a large number of structural configurations, based on the vertical tail of the McDonnell Douglas DC- 10, are analysed and weight estimations produced. From the generated data the influence of buckling allowables, number of <b>spars,</b> <b>stringers</b> <b>and</b> ribs on the overall structural weight is determined. This research resulted in a fast, reliable and versatile tool for the preliminary design of wing-like structures, while finding trends in weight saving related to changes in structural configuration which could lead to more detailed and accurate weight estimations for future design efforts. It is concluded that for the case study performed on the DC- 10 vertical tail there was indeed a significant weight saving to be found by changing the structural layout. Furthermore it is recommended that the trends and methods for weight estimation found in this research are applied to other cases to confirm or fine-tune them.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for the civil aviation industry is the reduction of its environmental impact. Over the past years, improvements in performance efficiency have been achieved by simplifying {{the design of the}} structural components and using composite materials to reduce the overall weight. These approaches however, are not sufficient to meet the current demanding requirements set for a âgreenerâ aircraft. Significant changes in drag reduction and fuel consumption can be obtained by using new technologies, such as smart morphing structures. These concepts will in fact help flow laminarisation, which will increase the lift to drag ratio. Furthermore, the capability to adapt the wing shape will enable to optimise the aerodynamic performance not only for a single flight condition but during the entire mission. This will significantly improve the aircraft efficiency. The current research work has been carried out as part of the European Commission founded Seventh Framework Program called âSmart High Lift Device for the Next Generation Wingâ (SADE), which main aim is to develop and study morphing high lift devices. The authorâs investigation focused on developing a design concept for the actuation mechanism of a morphing leading edge device. A detailed structural analysis has been carried out in order to demonstrate its feasibility. In {{the first phase of the}} research the attention was directed on the preliminary design and analysis of the composite wing box. The parameters of the key structural components, such as skin, <b>spars,</b> ribs <b>and</b> <b>stringers</b> were set to satisfy the static stress and buckling requirements. Moreover, numerical and experimental studies were conducted to analyse the static failure and buckling behaviour of two typical composite wing structural components: a <b>spar</b> section <b>and</b> a web and base joint assembly. In the second stage of the research, a design for the morphing leading edge actuation mechanism was developed. The actuation system was designed in such a way that the target shape was reached with minimum actuation force demand. A geometrical nonlinear FE analysis was conducted to simulate the leading edge morphing deflection and ensure that structural strength requirements were satisfied. Furthermore, the behaviour of the skin integrated with the internal actuation mechanism was modelled under the aerodynamic pressure, at different flight conditions and gust loads, in order to prove that the proposed actuation system can compete with the conventional rigid rib. This study demonstrated that a feasible morphing leading edge design for a next generation large aircraft wing can be achieved. Developing the readiness of this technology will have a significant impact on aircraft efficiency and considerable contribution towards a more environmental friendly aviation.

The main objective of the present work is aimed at establishing optimum <b>stringer</b> <b>and</b> rib spacing <b>and</b> <b>stringer</b> cross-section for minimum weight of buckling design driven components using FEA. The problem is formulated with flat âskin-stringerâ and âskin-stringer- ribâ panels with different stringer cross sections viz. blade, hat, I and J. Parametric studies are executed with different stringer spacings, rib spacings <b>and</b> <b>stringer</b> cross sections to study the effect of these parameters on the weight of the structure using Composite (T 800 class+epoxy system) material through linear buckling analysis of the FE model. Simply supported boundary conditions are used on all four edges of the plate with compressive loading. The software tools used are Hypermesh as pre and post processor and Radioss as solver. Initially for all the stringer cross sections considered, stringer spacing is varied from 600 mm to 50 mm. It is found that the spacing below 120 mm is stabilizing the weight. Too small a spacing will increase the number of stringers with issues in fabrication without much benefit in terms of weight. With this view point, two stringer spacing configurations viz. 150 mm and 120 mm are considered for further study on the rib spacing for each of the stringer cross sections stated earlier.
