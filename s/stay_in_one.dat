5|$|In April 2003 JPMorgan sold One South Broad to {{real-estate}} investor David Werner for US$48 million. Ninety-percent {{occupied in}} 2003, One Broad Street's largest tenant was Wachovia. Wachovia had gained office {{space in the}} tower after merging with First Union Corporation, which had merged with CoreStates in 1998. In 2006 Wachovia re-negotiated its lease, which was set to expire in 2010. After looking at other potential space in Center City, Wachovia made a deal to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>One</b> South Broad and three nearby properties, the Witherspoon Building, Wells Fargo Building, and the neighboring Widener Building, until the 2020s.|$|E

5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the {{performance}} to be at his wife's side {{even though he was}} threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band did not always originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, Denver and St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast. The Comos decided road life was no place to try raising a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle to live in a non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote. The other Juste character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E

Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on Mars, just {{before the start of}} the invasion described in The War of the Worlds. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.|$|E
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Lombards in the migration period, from about 700 AD Lüneburg Heath belonged to the Duchy of Saxony, which was conquered by Charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the Frankish Empire. The resulting close control of the population and the Christianization meant that the rural settlements had to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place and could no longer move about freely. The land had to be farmed more intensively which led to the heathland spreading.|$|E

25|$|Most bridges {{are fixed}} bridges, meaning {{they have no}} moving parts and <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as Bailey bridges, are {{designed}} to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. Movable bridges are designed {{to move out of the}} way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their financial difficulties, many of her family members suffered from mental illness, her mother at times having delusions.

Some writers have speculated that Nation's mother, Mary, believed she was Queen Victoria because of her love of finery and social airs. Mary lived in an insane asylum in Nevada, Missouri from August 1890 until her death on September 28, 1893. Mary was put in the asylum through legal action by her son, Charles, although there is suspicion that Charles instigated the lawsuit because he owed Mary money.|$|E

25|$|Auburn's third eagle {{arrived in}} Auburn in November 1960 after being {{captured}} by a cotton farmer in Curry Station, Talladega County, Alabama {{who found the}} bird caught between two rows of cotton. The eagle was sent to Auburn by the Talladega County Agent along with a load of turkeys. It was first taken to the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house where it refused a cold chicken leg but made fast work of a live chicken. After a short <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the Wildlife Department's animal pens, the eagle was moved into a cage built by the Auburn's Delta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. This would begin a 40-year period where Alpha Phi Omega was the bird's primary caretaker.|$|E
25|$|Many insects can hover, or <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> {{spot in the}} air, {{doing so}} by beating their wings rapidly. The ability to do so, though, is complex; {{requiring}} the use of sideways stabilization {{as well as the}} lift necessary to overcome the force of gravity. The lifting force is caused by the downward stroke of the wings. As the wings push down on the surrounding air, the result reaction force of the air on the wings force the insect up. The wings of most insects are evolved so that, during the upward stroke, the force on the wing is small. Due {{to the fact that the}} upbeat and downbeat force the insect down and up respectively, the insect oscillates and winds up staying in the same position.|$|E
25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>one.</b> This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E
