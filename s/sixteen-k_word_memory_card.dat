50|$|The SD Association sets {{industry}} {{standards for}} SD <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{that define the}} next generation of <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> that allow product-makers to develop new products. This strategy has made the SD <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> the most widely used removable <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> form factor in the industry.|$|R
50|$|Recently, {{electronic}} {{devices such as}} digital cameras, MP3 players, cellular phones, etc., are required with larger capacity of storage to store data. A <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> such as a Micro SD card, a MMC card, etc., which has larger capacity of storage and a small size, is extensively used to expend the capacity of storage of the {{electronic devices}}. The data transmission between the electronic device and the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is through a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector mounted on a PCB of the electronic device for connecting with the <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector has an insulating housing; the insulating housing includes a receiving cavity for receiving the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> and a plurality of grooves for respectively receiving a plurality of terminals. One end of the terminal forms a soldering portion for being soldered to the PCB and {{the other end of}} each terminal forms a connecting portion for mating with the <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> A metallic cover couples with the insulating housing. The <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> is inserted and held in the receiving cavity of the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector for being used in storing various data and taken by the electronic device as a recording medium. If not in use, the inserted <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> can be pulled out from the receiving cavity of the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> connector.|$|R
50|$|Sideloading via a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> {{requires}} that the user {{have access to a}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> writer. Audio and video files can be written directly to the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> and then inserted into the mobile device.|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{is widely}} used in {{numerous}} electronic devices including tablet computers, cameras, mobile phones and multimedia devices. Like a USB drive, <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> are an inexpensive and portable persistent storage solution. Numerous manufactures are incorporating a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> interface into their product, allowing for a large array of confidential data to be stored. This research aimed to determine the sensitivity, type and amount of data that remained on second hand <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> post sale. In 2011, over an eight month period, 119 second hand <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> were randomly purchased from eBay Australia. The findings from the research show that individuals utilise <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> to store highly sensitive and confidential data, and as per similar previous studies, continually neglect to permanently destroy the data prior to sale...|$|R

50|$|When {{recording}} to a <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> {{the recording}} time depends only on {{capacity of the}} card. The GZ-MG555 uses full-size SDHC <b>memory</b> <b>cards.</b> One 4GB card can fit roughly 1 hour of video at highest quality setting. There are no limitations for using any of the recording formats when recording to a <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> has an 8 MB {{capacity and}} uses Sony's MagicGate encryption. This requirement prevented {{the production of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> by third parties who did not purchase a MagicGate license. <b>Memory</b> <b>cards</b> without encryption {{can be used to}} store PlayStation game saves, but PlayStation games would be unable to read from or write to the card - such a card could only be used as a backup. There are a variety of non-Sony manufactured <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> available for the PlayStation 2, allowing for a larger memory capacity than the standard 8 MB. However their use is unsupported and compatibility is not guaranteed. These <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> can have up to 128 MB storage space.|$|R

50|$|The PocketStation is a <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> {{peripheral}} by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation {{home video}} game console. Categorized by Sony {{as a combination}} of a <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> slot. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple Dreamcast <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> with no VMU {{features}} {{have been}} released. The cards therefore omit a display screen, input buttons, speaker and built-in clock. Some {{have the same}} 128 KB storage as the VMU, equivalent to 200 blocks, while others have multiple [...] "pages" [...] with each acting as a 128 KB <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> In the latter case, a button or switch allows the gamer to select the desired <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> This {{is due to the}} Dreamcast having a limit of 128 KB per individual <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|This slot will {{accommodate}} a Type-II CompactFlash device, provided there are Windows XP drivers {{for such a}} device.

50|$|The PlayStation 3 <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> Adaptor (CECHZM1) is {{a device}} that allows data to be {{transferred}} from a PlayStation or PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> to the PlayStation 3's hard disk. At launch, the device did not support transferring saved game files back to a <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> but upon {{the release of the}} PlayStation 3 system software version 1.80, the user is now able to transfer PS1 and PS2 game saves from the PS3 directly onto a physical <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> via the adaptor. PlayStation 2 saved game files can also be transferred between PlayStation 3 users via other current <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> formats. The device connects to the PlayStation 3's USB port on one end through a USB Mini-B cable (not included with adaptor, but it was included with the console itself), and features a PlayStation 2 <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> port on the other end. The adaptor works with every PlayStation 3 model, regardless of whether it is compatible with PlayStation 2 games or not. The adaptor was available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch. The <b>Memory</b> <b>Card</b> Adaptor was released on 25 May 2007 in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Originally console games had no {{additional}} storage memory for saving game related data. During the Nintendo Entertainment System's {{time on the}} market, battery backed cartridge games that could retain {{a limited number of}} game files were introduced. When the original PlayStation was released it included support for an external memory source, called a <b>memory</b> <b>card.</b> Its purpose was to store important information about the games, such as game states or scoring info. That <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> used a <b>memory</b> of type EEPROM. To support the growing use of these cards in normal game play and the different amounts of data to be saved, larger <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> were created. Other consoles also adopted the use of <b>memory</b> <b>cards,</b> such as the Sega Dreamcast, whose <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> was called the Visual Memory Unit or VMU. The Dreamcast’s memory unit was unique in that it had a monochrome LCD display, a D-pad, and two buttons. A large third party <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> market also sprung up, offering cards that were often much cheaper and larger than the official released <b>memory</b> <b>cards.</b> Some unique third party cards required extra software to access the cards, or possibly increase the data capacity by compressing the contained data.|$|R
5000|$|Secure Digital <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be used}} in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders via the MEAD-SD01 adapter. JVC camcorders {{that record}} in XDCAM EX format use Secure Digital <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> natively.|$|R
50|$|Some {{kinds of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> {{with their own}} USB {{functions}} do not need the card reader, such as the Intelligent Stick <b>memory</b> <b>card,</b> which can plug directly into a USB slot.|$|R
5000|$|Many AVCHD camcorders employ Secure Digital or [...] "Memory Stick" [...] <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> as {{removable}} recording media. Solid-state <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> offer rewritable {{storage in}} a compact form factor with no moving parts.|$|R
50|$|The JEIDA <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> {{standard}} {{was a popular}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> standard {{at the beginning of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> appearing on portable computers. JEIDA cards could be used to expand system memory or as a solid-state storage drive. Before the advent of the JEIDA standard, laptops had proprietary cards that were not interoperable with other manufacturers laptops, other laptop lines, or even other models in the same line.|$|R
