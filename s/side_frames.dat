5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull <b>side</b> <b>frames</b> could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E

25|$|SY Aurora was a barque-rigged steam yacht {{built by}} Alexander Stephen and Sons Ltd. in Dundee, Scotland, in 1876, for the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company. It was 165' long with a 30' beam. The hull {{was made of}} oak, {{sheathed}} with greenheart and lined with fir. The bow was a mass of solid wood reinforced with steel-plate armour. The heavy <b>side</b> <b>frames</b> were braced by two levels of horizontal oak beams. Her primary use was whaling in the northern seas, and she was built sturdily enough to withstand the heavy weather and ice that would be encountered there. That strength proved useful for Antarctic exploration as well, and between 1911 and 1917 she made five trips to the continent, both for exploration as well as rescue missions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different loads on the stress-strain state of the freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame,</b> {{as well as to}} {{evaluate the}} distribution of the stress fields {{in the design of the}} freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> supported through the horizontal surface and through the horizontal and inclined surfaces of the pedestal opening. Methodology. A volumetric finite element model of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> of ZK- 1 bogie of the freight car was designed. The forces under the current regulatory documentation for theoretical research were applied to the model, the stress arising in the model elements were determined. The static tests of ZK- 1 bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> were conducted; they allowed determining the stresses in the key points of the frame under the action of forces in accordance with the existing procedure of static tests of the freight car bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame.</b> To check the quality of the finite element model we determined the stress in the model under the action of forces corresponding to the static requirements. The corresponding coefficients were determined to match the stress obtained through theoretical studies and static tests. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of stress for dangerous sections of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> design were compared. Findings. The regulatory documentation for carrying out experimental research of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength does not fully take into account the load acting on the frame during its operation and that provided while assessing the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength theoretically. The strength evaluation of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> by the results of field tests only does not give a complete picture of the distribution of stress fields, as the provided sensor installation points do not cover most of the design elements with possible stress concentration. Originality. The loads applied to the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> during theoretical and experimental studies were compared to the loads acting during operation. The impact of use of inclined surfaces in the pedestal box opening was evaluated. Practical value. The obtained results allow the more accurate assessment of the three-piece bogie <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> strength, as well as allow you to choose the more preferred method of <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> support in the axle box...|$|R
30|$|After {{assembly}} of the bogie, {{the upper end of}} the lever-type damper fits closely with one side of the bolster. In application, the lever-type damper rotates by a slight angle around the pivot because of irregularities in the track, and thus only requires a small space for installation. In practice, cracks in the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> mainly occur on the top of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> pedestal and the brake chutes [18]. The lever-type damper is located on the side-frame spring seat, which, whilst it would slightly decrease the static strength of the spring seat, would not significantly weaken the fatigue strength of the <b>side</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R

The using zhuan 8 G (zhuan 8 AG) bogie in {{existing}} line whether can achieve {{the requirement of}} speed increased to 120 km/h, and what improvements and research became the railway sector need to face and solve importantly. Based on the experiment standard of new production and strengthened project, fatigue strength performance is studied on type zhuan 8 G (zhuan 8 AG) <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> used for some years when speed increases to 120 km/h. The static stress examination shows that the static strength of <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> is related to its structural design while {{has nothing to do}} with its using life. The fatigue test research indicates that the total state of used <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> is comparatively good, and the foreground used for 120 km/h is optimistic; and find that the corner of pile cap lower part(C position) is the weak site of <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> fatigue failure, the reason is closely related to the surface defect of this site. The recommendation is improving the quality requirements of this part of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> manufacturing technology and quality controlling document to eliminate the hidden dangers of fatigue source.

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{proposed}} to find methods of structural reinforcement of a <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> of a bogie {{in areas of}} stress concentration (the compound zone, {{the corners of the}} pedestal jaw opening, etc.), where, as the experience of operation shows, it is possible the emergence of fatigue cracks. It should avoid a significant increase in weight of the structure and does not cause ¬´overflow¬ª areas with a lot of stress from one portion of the structure to another. Methodology. The stresses in the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> are determined by finite element modeling. Firstly parts of structure that is subject to be strengthened are detected. At the next stage the possible ways of enhancement are developed (wall thickness increase, change of fillet radii, introduction of additional truss plate, etc.). After which according to the results of simulation the effectiveness of each method is evaluated. Amplification of individual sections of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> does not always lead to its hardening as a whole (stress decrease in one place often leads to stress increase in the other one). The further procedure is iterative in nature: best-case changes are entered {{in the design of the}} frame; weakened areas of construction again are revealed and so on, till to the achievement an acceptable level of safety. Findings. Directional iterative search allows finding a combination of local amplification that increasing significantly the strength of structure. Namely, radius of the transition from the column to the support surface and in the openings between the column and the inclined belt up to 40 and 50 mm are increased respectively; truss plate are added between the upper and lower shelf of Triangel guide and on the inner guide of jaw aperture; technological area of the aperture in the column is reduced by one-third. Due to the proposed stresses combination, voltages in construction were reduced by 41 %. Originality. The efficiency of the iterative search procedure of local amplifications combinations in design of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> that let significantly increase its strength without a significant increase in weight is presented by scientists. Practical value. Obtained results give the possibility to increase significantly the strength of the <b>side</b> <b>frame</b> in the three-piece truck without any noticeable change in its geometrical and mass characteristics...|$|R
