40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> for expensive, low-usage items that is operated by multiple decision makers. Each faces a Poisson demand process, {{and the joint}} <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> is controlled by a continuous-review base stock policy with full backordering. We consider penalty costs for backorders and holding costs for stock on hand. For this model, we derive structural properties of the resulting cost function. We use these to prove not only that it is cost e�ective to share one <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> with all parties involved, but also that collaboration (inventory pooling) can be supported by a stable cost allocation, i. e., {{the core of the}} associated cooperative game is non-empty. These results hold under optimized and under exogenously given base stock levels. For the former case, we further identify a stable cost allocation that would be easy to implement in practice and that induces players to reveal their private information truthfully...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) operates <b>stock</b> <b>points</b> {{all over the}} world. Resources expended for the physical distribution function at these <b>stock</b> <b>points</b> amount to millions of dollars per year. It is imperative that these <b>stock</b> <b>points</b> operate to provide higher productivity at lower costs.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedNavy Stock Points are vital links in the Navy's supply/ maintenance network; their performance {{has a direct}} impact on supply response time and operational availability of fleet equipment. One of the major functions performed at a <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> is the commercial acquisition of non-standard material. This thesis examines the production process at a Navy <b>Stock</b> <b>Point</b> that acquires non-standard material as a system and as a series of functional organizations. Three automated management control systems are employed at Navy Stock Points to facilitate the inventory control, material acquisition, and accounting processes involved in the commercial acquisition production process. Each of these control systems was independently designed to perform a specialized function within the <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> structure. This thesis discusses each system, UADPS-SP, APADE II, and IDA, their individual development and the interfaces between them. The main thrust of this thesis is to determine if the total logistic effort could be improved by integrating three independent systems into one production oriented system to better control the commercial acquisition of non-standard material at Navy Stock Points.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to evaluate the current Naval Supply Systems Command <b>stock</b> <b>point</b> productivity enhancement project known as Engineering the Workplace (EWP). It was found that EWP produce significant efficiencies in physical distribution work methods, employee performance, and material organization and flow. It was also found that EWP is an effective tool for training employees in efficient work methods, monitoring employee performance on a continuing basis, and providing managers with a quantitative decision making control mechanism {{that is based on}} objective performance measurement indices. The major conclusion is that EWP is an appropriate methodology to use in other functional areas of a <b>stock</b> <b>point.</b> An aggressively managed application of EWP throughout other segments of the NAVSUP community may significantly improve productivity.

40|$|Seven {{heuristic}} algorithms are discussed. Each can be {{used for}} production scheduling in an assembly network (a network where each work station has at most one immediate successor work station, but may have any number of immediate predecessor work stations), distribution scheduling in an arborescence network (a network where each warehouse or <b>stocking</b> <b>point</b> is supplied by at most one immediate predecessor <b>stocking</b> <b>point,</b> but may itself supply any number of immediate successor <b>stocking</b> <b>points),</b> and joint production-distribution scheduling in a conjoined assembly-arborescence network. The objective of each algorithm is to determine a production and/or product distribution schedule which satisfies final product demand and minimizes the sum of the average inventory holding costs and average fixed charges for processing (ordering, delivery, or setup costs), per period, over an infinite planning horizon. Exogenous demand for product is assumed to be deterministic, at a constant rate, and to occur only at "retail" facilities of the networks. On the basis of their performance in 11, 000 computer generated problems, the seven heuristic methods are compared {{with each other and with}} a dynamic programming algorithm. The results indicate that for most of the network structures considered, the best heuristic is the method of steepest descent; the second best is a simple extension of a method originally developed by Crowston, Wagner, and Henshaw. The improved myopic procedure of Graves and Schwarz performs very well for some particular types of structures. Surprisingly, two particularly naive heuristics also perform quite well in certain situations. In addition to the computer simulation experiments, we also discuss a simple computer-compatible algebraic notation scheme for identifying structure (facility interrelationships) within networks of the three types considered. production/scheduling, inventory/production: deterministic models, marketing: distribution...|$|R

30|$|Dynamics in the SC {{can arise}} from order oscillations, {{seasonality}} or minimum order quantities and {{may result in}} a bullwhip effect [50, 85]. Ensuring product availability at product launch can also create internal dynamics within an SC, especially if a significant proportion of demand is expected at or shortly after product launch and thus needs to be pre-produced and distributed thereby maintaining a short time to market [41]. This phenomenon is known as pipeline filling, which is defined as the production and distribution of a product prior to product launch in order to ensure sufficient product availability across all <b>stocking</b> <b>points</b> at the launch date, i. e., at a time when product demand is fostered by strong marketing campaigns [72]. During pipeline filling activities, all <b>stocking</b> <b>points</b> are filled with a major portion of the expected annual demand before the product is actually launched in the marketplace. In this early phase of the PLC, production capacity demand strongly differs from market demands of finished products. As a result, the capacity requirements or inventory levels during the more static maturity phase of the PLC can be up to 60  % lower than during the highly dynamic product launch phase (see Fig.  1).|$|R
