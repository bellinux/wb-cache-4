The neat weather-gray dwellings, shingled to the ground and brightened with door-yard flowers and creepers, straggled off into the boat-houses and fishing-huts on the shore, and the village seemed to get afloat at last in the sloops and schooners riding in the harbor, whose <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> rose higher to the eye than the town itself. The salt and the sand were everywhere, but though there had been no positive prosperity in Corbitant for a generation, the place had an impregnable neatness, which defied decay; if there had been a dog in the street, there would not have been a stick to throw at him.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a plane {{curve is}} a curve {{in a plane}} that may be either a Euclidean plane, an affine plane or a {{projective}} plane.

50|$|A {{smoothing}} plane or <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> {{is a type}} of bench plane used in woodworking. The {{smoothing plane}} is typically the last plane used on a wood surface. When used properly, it produces a finish that equals or surpasses that made by sandpaper. The smooth finish is the result of planing the wood off in strips, rather than by successive buffing and scratching.|$|E

50|$|The {{classical}} four-vertex theorem {{states that}} the curvature function of a simple, closed, <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> curve has at least four local extrema (specifically, at least two local maxima {{and at least two}} local minima). The name of the theorem derives from the convention of calling an extreme point of the curvature function a vertex. This theorem has many generalizations, including a version for space curves where a vertex is defined as a point of vanishing torsion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{smoothing}} plane is typically 8 to 10 inches long.

[...] The iron of the {{smoothing plane}} is generally sharpened straight across or with a slightly arched cutting edge (or at least with rounded corners) to prevent unsightly grooves from being gouged in the wood surface when it is planed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{differential}} geometry of curves, the osculating circle of a sufficiently <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> curve {{at a given}} point p on the curve has been traditionally defined as the circle passing through p {{and a pair of}} additional points on the curve infinitesimally close to p. Its center lies on the inner normal line, and its curvature is {{the same as that of}} the given curve at that point. This circle, which is the one among all tangent circles at the given point that approaches the curve most tightly, was named circulus osculans (Latin for [...] "kissing circle") by Leibniz.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate linear determinantal representations of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over various fields, and prove that any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a large field (or an ample field) admits a linear determinantal representation. Since local fields are large, any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a local field always admits a linear determinantal representation. As an application, we prove that a positive proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over Q, ordered by height, admit linear determinantal representations.

A jointer plane may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface.
