50|$|More <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are caught}} recreationally at the Mexican tourist mecca of Cabo San Lucas than {{anywhere}} else in the world. The local fishing banks and offshore grounds are fished by large fleets of local and American sport fishing boats. <b>Striped</b> <b>marlin</b> may be caught year-round in Cabo waters, but the heaviest concentrations seem to show up in late autumn, and good numbers stay around into the spring. On 9 Dec 2007 during the Mini, WCBRT team Reelaxe released a total of 330 <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> in the two-day tournament, setting another tournament record for a single team in two days, with a new record of 190 <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> in one day. The team consisted of Chris Badsey, Dave Brackmann, Steve Brackmann, Alex Rogers, Jose Espanoza, Mark Clayton, Saul Contrearus, and Dennis Poulton. The top angler was Reelaxe angler Jose Esponoza, with a personal best and tournament record of 59 released <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> in a single day. Prior to that, in November 2007, the crew of the sport fishing vessel Reelaxe, fishing on the Finger Bank, set a one-day catch record of 179 <b>striped</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Marlin {{fishing in}} New Zealand waters {{dates back to}} the turn of the 20th century. Some of the largest <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> over 400 lb, have been caught in New Zealand. The all-tackle <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> record of 494 lb is held here, and <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> of over 300 lb are caught in New Zealand waters every year. Some New Zealand anglers, often fishing in small trailerable boats, pursue <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> from Houhoura and the North Cape in the far north of the country to as far south as Gisborne, Raglan, and Napier in the south. Lure fishing is a popular fishing {{technique}} used by New Zealand marlin fishermen, with many good fish also being taken on live and rigged dead baits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>marlin</b> are one {{of three}} marlin species that appear in east African waters. Kenya has the most {{well-developed}} sport fishery in this region, and every year, boats from Malindi, Lamu, and Watamu in the north, as well as Shimoni in the south, have excellent <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing.|$|E
40|$|Billfishes area by cacth of tuna {{long line}} vessels in Indian Ocean. Billfish are consist of {{swordfish}} Xiphias gladius, black marlin Makaira indica, indo facific blue <b>marlin</b> Makaira mazara, <b>stripe</b> <b>marlin</b> Tetrapturus audax, indo facific sailfish Istiophorus platypterus and shortbill spearfish Tetrapturus angustirostris. Besides that, billfishes also have important economic value compared with tuna as an exsported {{species such as}} swordfish and marlin. To optimize the catch of billfishes in Indian Ocean, data and information of potential fishing ground, size and catch composition of this species are needed. The billfishes cacth composition collected in 2011 were dominated by 45 % swordfish, 20 % black marlin, 19 % blue marlin, 9 % short bill spearfish, 6 % sailfish and 1 %stripe marlin. The billfishes size range which were caught between 60 - 280 cm LJFL (Lower Jaw Fork Length). The sword fish average length was 150 cm, blue marlin 197 cm, black Marlin 189 cm, sailfish 150 cm,short bill spearfish 144 cm and <b>stripe</b> <b>marlin</b> 159 cm. From this observation, {{it was found that}} most of billfishes caught were in mature...|$|R

Petty tried to muscle past Pearson up high on the homestretch but came six feet short, with Allison hard on Pearson's trunk at the <b>stripe.</b> Coo Coo <b>Marlin</b> finished fourth after being briefly detained by Daytona police three days prior when a bar brawl accidentally swept up Marlin's wife Eula Faye.|$|R
50|$|Compared to <b>striped</b> {{or white}} <b>marlins</b> and sailfish, black marlins are more solid than their blue counterparts. They have a shorter bill and a rounder and lower dorsal fin. Black marlin may be {{distinguished}} from all other marlin species by their rigid pectoral fins, which, especially from a weight of around 150 lb (75 kg) or so, are unable to be pressed flat against their sides.|$|R

50|$|Tetrapurus albidus was the {{accepted}} name for white marlin until 2006. At this time Collette and his colleague's genetic testing suggested that white marlin and Indo-Pacific <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> should be {{classified in the}} genus Kajikia. Today, Kajikia albida and its close relative Kajikia audax (<b>striped</b> <b>marlin)</b> have been scientifically determined to be genetically distinct from the species in the genus Tetrapurus.|$|E
50|$|Black marlin {{are still}} found in Peruvian waters, {{but the main}} sport-fishing {{destination}} in the region nowadays is further north in Salinas, Ecuador. Black marlin are normally outnumbered in catch reports by the more prolific <b>striped</b> and blue <b>marlin,</b> but some big fish continue to be caught. The traditional method of sport fishing is trolling with natural baits, large ballyhoo being commonly used, while searching for finning fish.|$|R
50|$|Marlin fishing (also called billfishing) is {{considered}} by some game fishermen to be a pinnacle of offshore game fishing, due to the size {{and power of the}} four marlin species and their relative rareness. Fishing for marlin captured the imagination of some sport fishermen in the 1930s, when well-known angler/authors Zane Grey, who fished for black, <b>striped,</b> and blue <b>marlin</b> in the Pacific, and Ernest Hemingway, who fished the Florida Keys, Bahamas and Cuba for Atlantic blue marlin and white marlin, wrote extensively about their pursuit and enthused about the sporting qualities of their quarry.|$|R
50|$|Although Australia {{is known}} for its black, and more {{recently}} blue, marlin fishery, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> are often found in the subtropical waters of the vast island continent and are a popular target for Australian anglers. The country's largest interclub tournament is held at the Port Stephens area of New South Wales, and has produced several <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> records on ultralight and fly tackle. Larger <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> in the 250 to 300 lb-plus class often show up {{in the southern part of}} their range. Batemans Bay, Ulladulla and Bermagui are where fish of this class can be encountered. Live baiting, with such baits as slimy mackerel and skipjack tuna, and trolling artificial lures are the two most common techniques here, but many top crews have experienced success with fly-rod and light-tackle records using the bait-and-switch technique.|$|E

50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> Kajikia audax, is {{a species}} of marlin found in {{tropical}} to temperate Indo-Pacific oceans {{not far from the}} surface. It is a desirable commercial and game fish with a record weight (in 1982) of 190 kg and a maximum length of 4.2 m. The <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> is a predator that hunts during the day in the top 100 metres or so of the water column, often near the surface. One of their chief prey is sardines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are also}} fished from the Ecuadorian mainland. Salinas in the {{southern}} part of the country and Manta further north are the main sport-fishing bases in Ecuador. The cold Humboldt Current from the south meets the equatorial current along the Ecuadorian coastline, and when conditions are right, the combination of current, colour, and temperature breaks amass concentrations of baitfish that attract large <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> as well as larger blue and black marlin, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna.|$|E

50|$|Conventional live-bait {{trolling}} at {{slow speeds}} is also highly effective when concentrations of marlin can be located. Experienced skippers fishing from ports such as Bermagui {{on the south}} coast of New South Wales have {{in the recent past}} racked up scores of over 100 <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> per season fishing this relatively simple technique at the right time at the right place. Larger baits such as kahawai and skipjack tuna are often used for the large <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> of New Zealand.|$|E

Guides targeting marlin operate from the island of San Cristobal. The warmer [...] "wet" [...] season between December and June is best for higher numbers, but larger <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> (200 lb-plus range) are caught during the colder late summer months.|$|E
50|$|Lure fishing, {{live bait}} and switch-baiting are all used {{successfully}} for blue marlin in Australia. Blue marlin are targeted by some anglers {{and are also}} encountered whilst fishing for the more abundant <b>striped</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Mexican {{hot spots}} such as Cabo San Lucas and in Southern California, anglers cast live baits such as {{mackerel}} and caballito (scad) to <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> {{that may be}} sighted feeding or finning on the surface.|$|E
50|$|Marlin {{are part}} of the {{billfish}} family, of which 10 species are of the most interest to anglers: Atlantic and Pacific blue marlin, black marlin, white marlin, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> Atlantic sailfish, Pacific sailfish, longbill spearfish, shortbill spearfish, and swordfish.|$|E
50|$|The player {{controls}} {{a fisherman}} who is competing in a tournament. The objective in each {{round of the}} tournament is to catch the largest billfish.

50|$|Today, {{the main}} centres for fishing {{this area of}} the Pacific coast are further north, in Ecuador, and the fishery has shifted from the pioneer fishing {{locations}} inshore, where black marlin and swordfish were fished by presenting baits to sighted fish, to further offshore for blue marlin, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> and tuna. Salinas is the most well-known billfishing location, and seasonally offers good fishing for large <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> as well as blue marlin and other gamefish, such as bigeye tuna. The other popular blue marlin destination in the country is Manta, which is usually in season when Salinas is not. A large fleet of sport-fishing vessels operates from both towns. Blues in this area are known to reach large sizes, with the most notable capture being a 1014 lb fish boated by local angler Jorge Jurado which formerly held the IGFA 80 lb-class record.|$|E
50|$|A {{predator}} {{is usually}} a carnivore that hunts, kills and eats other animals. For example, a snake eating a mouse: the snake is considered the predator because it is consuming the mouse. In another example, a <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> is a predator. It lives in the Pacific Ocean and preys on sardines, also a Pacific animal. Similarly, various birds eat earthworms.|$|E
50|$|The waters {{surrounding}} White Island {{are well}} known for their fishing. Yellowtail kingfish abound all year round, and there is deep water fishing for hapuka and bluenose (a type of warehou) {{in the winter and}} blue, black and <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> and yellowfin tuna in the summer. A small charter fleet offering day trips and overnight or longer trips operates from the nearby port at Whakatane.|$|E
50|$|For {{more than}} 60 years, {{the waters of}} the Humboldt Current which sweep past Peru and Ecuador have been fished by sports fishermen. Renowned American anglers Michael Lerner and Kip Farrington visited Chile and Peru in the 1940s, and their {{encounters}} with record-breaking broadbill swordfish, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> and black marlin helped to bring the billfish fisheries of these subtropical Pacific waters {{to the attention of the}} international game-fishing elite.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, {{catch and}} release caught on slowly, with some pioneers {{practicing}} {{it in the}} 1960s, and the practice slowly became more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s. Catch and release is now widely used to conserve [...] - [...] and indeed is critical in conserving [...] - [...] vulnerable fish species like the large, long lived native freshwater Murray Cod and the prized, slowly growing, heavily fished Australian bass, heavily fished coastal species like Dusky Flathead and prized gamefish like <b>striped</b> <b>marlin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Black marlin fishing has {{traditionally}} conducted with rigged dead baits, both skipping and swimming. In the historic Cabo Blanco fishery, little blind trolling was done; instead, the billfish (<b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> black marlin, and swordfish) were sighted cruising or finning {{on the surface}} and baited. In the Cairns fishery, a wide variety of baitfish species are used successfully, including kawa kawa and other small tunas, queenfish, and scad. Baits range from 2 lb scad to dogtooth tuna and narrowbarred mackerel of 20 lb and more.|$|E
50|$|Drifting FADs are {{widespread}} in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean purse seine fisheries. They catch over 1 million tons of tuna (nearly one-third of the global tuna total) and over 100,000 tons of by-catch {{in the vicinity of}} FADs as of 2005. Skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, Bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and yellowfin Thunnus albacares tuna are the three primary tropical tuna species that FADs target. Other fish include albacore, dolphin fish, wahoo, blue marlin, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> mako shark, silky shark, whitetip shark, galapagos shark, mackerel, and bonito.|$|E
5000|$|White marlin feed on {{a variety}} of {{schooling}} baitfish, including sardine, herring, and other clupeoids; squid; mackerel; scad; saury; and smaller tuna-like fishes, such as frigate and bullet tuna. Like their close relatives the <b>striped</b> <b>marlin,</b> and sailfish, white marlin will often group together to corral schooling baitfish into a tight group for feeding purposes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as [...] "balling bait". When this occurs, it is common for two or more fish to be raised to the baits or hooked up simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to hunting, Hemingway {{was an avid}} fisherman and a great contributor {{to the development of}} the sport. He also contributed to the knowledge of Atlantic marine life. During his first visit to Cuba with Pilar, Hemingway hosted Charles Cadwalader, director of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural History and Henry Fowler, the Academy’s chief ichthyologist. These two scientists were in Cuba trying to determine the taxonomy of marlin species. They were attempting to determine if white, blue, black, or <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> were different species, or just color variants of the same species. As a result of their efforts on the boat, they reclassified the North Atlantic marlin variants.|$|E
50|$|Yellowfin tuna {{probably}} {{first came}} to the attention of sports fishermen when they appeared on the tuna grounds of Catalina Island, California, only a few years after pioneering fishermen invented the sport, targeting the Pacific bluefin tuna. These tuna were of the same species caught by commercial fishermen in Japan and the western Pacific, but the reason for their appearance was not known at the time. Later, warmer water species such as yellowfin tuna, dorado and <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> were found to enter southern California waters in seasons having favorable ocean conditions, particularly during the El Niño phenomenon, which brings warmer water up North America's western coast.|$|E
5000|$|The Fishing {{industry}} in Niue {{contributes to the}} local economy and is popular with visitors. It has been described in fishing media as the [...] "fisherman’s secret paradise". The island is rich in resources of Black, blue and <b>striped</b> <b>Marlin,</b> Skipjack, Yellowfin Tuna, Red Bass, Mahimahi, Sailfish, Wahoo and Giant Trevally. One of the notable charter boats operating is the Wahoo Fishing Charters, operated by Graham Marsh since 1983. The largest charter vessel on the island is the 7.5 m Horizon. Fishing on the island is considered a taboo on Sunday. Fresh fish caught is sold to restaurants such as Kaiika Restaurant in Alofi.|$|E
50|$|The United States has the world's largest {{saltwater}} {{fishing industry}} {{and along the}} entire length of the East Coast, from Key West to the Gulf of Maine, big-game anglers pursue a variety of tropical and temperate sportfish ranging from sailfish and dolphinfish in the Florida Keys to giant bluefin tuna in Massachusetts and in Canadian waters. The West Coast lacks the influence of the warm Gulf Stream current, and most big game species are mainly confined to California, a birthplace of the sport. Some of the same species that were fished for by the pioneers of the sport - Pacific bluefin tuna, broadbill swordfish and <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> - are still fished for today.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{blue marlin}} {{weighing}} over 1000 lb {{was caught in}} the Bay of Islands as early as 1968, <b>striped</b> <b>marlin</b> have traditionally been the main billfish species in the New Zealand fishery. However, Pacific blue marlin captures have increased in New Zealand over the last 10 years, and blue marlin are now consistently caught from along the eastern coast of the North Island. The Waihau Bay and Cape Runaway area is particularly well known for blue marlin. Blue marlin encountered in New Zealand tend to be of large average size with most averaging 300 to 500 lb. Larger specimens in the 600 lb-plus class are hooked and landed every year. Most New Zealand blue marlin are taken by lure fishing, {{with a wide variety of}} locally made and imported lures being popular.|$|E
