500|$|One of Hitler's <b>sub-goals</b> for the {{invasion}} of Russia was to win over Britain to the German side. He believed that after the military collapse of the USSR, [...] "within a few weeks" [...] Britain would be forced either into a surrender or else come to join Germany as a [...] "junior partner" [...] in the Axis. Britain's role in this alliance was reserved to support German naval and aerial military actions against the USA in a fight for world supremacy conducted from the Axis power bases of Europe, Africa and the Atlantic. On August 8, 1941, Hitler stated that {{he looked forward to}} the eventual day when [...] "England and Germany [...] together against America" [...] and on January 7, 1942, he daydreamed that it was [...] "not impossible" [...] for Britain to quit the war and join the Axis side, leading to a situation where [...] "it will be a German-British army that will chase the Americans from Iceland". National Socialist ideologist Alfred Rosenberg hoped that after the victorious conclusion of the war against the USSR, Englishmen, along with other Germanic nationalities, would join the German settlers in colonizing the conquered eastern territories.|$|E
30|$|The {{adjacent}} clusters/modules are merged {{based on}} the following procedure. A module score or a cluster score is defined for each module group in a workflow [45] based on distances of module element pairs contained in the module group. The workflow score {{is defined as the}} sum of the module group scores. A greedy strategy is adopted which merges two adjacent module groups with best workflow score. This process continues until only a predefined number of module groups remain. The adjacent cluster components are merged if these identified <b>sub-goal</b> nodes corresponding to the clusters are the same. A concept of role of macro action is applicable where this macro action satisfies a <b>sub-goal</b> and where a reward function may be used which is particular to the sub-topic <b>sub-goal.</b> The roles corresponding to the macro actions satisfies the same sub-topic or <b>sub-goal</b> role and have correlated topic models describing the connected event nodes present in the <b>sub-goal</b> or sub-topic cluster. This role can be interpreted as the semantic role or users of the same role having the same or similar “structural signatures” or users having a trusted group [41] role corresponding to the sub-topic cluster associated with tracking a particular topic or sub-topic or <b>sub-goal</b> of the story. All agents associated with a macro action may be interpreted as playing an informing role to the evaluating agent associated with the sub-topic <b>sub-goal</b> agent. As a consequence of merging of clusters, a hierarchical clustering of sub-topic <b>sub-goal</b> nodes is achieved where <b>sub-goal</b> nodes inferred from recursively defined merged clusters may indicate split or merge points in the goal topic or whole story description. Here a merging of clusters may aim at forming a merged cluster which have nodes in the merged cluster of similar Q values or Reward values as calculated from application of Eq.  16. The actions connecting the sub-topic <b>sub-goal</b> nodes of finally produced clusters are the macro actions on which the Q Learning procedure is re-applied. The distance measure defined on agent roles and trust links in combination with the reward based Q value approach produces a clustering where every cluster has nodes with same or similar agent roles [64].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{cooperation}} of several robots {{are needed for}} complex tasks. The cooperation methods for multiple robots generally require exact goal or <b>sub-goal</b> positions. However, {{it is difficult to}} direct the goal or <b>sub-goal</b> positions to multiple robots for the sake of cooperation with each other. Planning algorithms will reduce the burden for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent planning algorithm based on a random sampling method. This method doesn’t require the exact <b>sub-goal</b> positions nor the times at which cooperation occurs. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown by simulation results.

Though higher level, primary goals provide meaning and direction for a person, evaluating progress on that primary goal versus a <b>sub-goal</b> is risky. Study 1 was a 2 x 2 experiment in which framing level (<b>sub-goal</b> or primary goal) and feedback valence (success or failure) were manipulated for participants (n= 118) during a computer game. Positive mood and expectancy decreased and negative mood increased the most for those who received primary goal failure feedback. Study 2 was a short longitudinal study that took place over 8 weeks throughout which participants (n= 113) evaluated their progress on a primary goal (Grade goal) or <b>sub-goal</b> (Study hours goal). Success or failure varied naturally for individuals. When progress was lacking, the primary goal focus was associated with decreases in mood and expectancy.

Retrograde analysis of patterns generates pattern databases, starting with a simple definition of a <b>sub-goal</b> in a game and progressively finding all the pattern of given sizes that fulfill this <b>sub-goal.</b> Metaprogramming is based on similar concepts, but instead of generating fixed size patterns, it generates programs. Programs enable to represent knowledge in a more flexible way. However, they may take more time to use than pattern knowledge.

A global occupancy grid map of the environment is constantly updated, based on which a global frontier map is calculated. Then, a histogram based approach is adopted to cluster frontier cells and score these clusters based on their distance from the robot as well as the number of frontier cells they contain. In each stage of the algorithm, a <b>sub–goal</b> is set for the robot to navigate. A combination of distance transform and A * search algorithms is utilized to generate a plausible path toward the <b>sub-goal</b> through the free space. This way keeping a reliable distance from obstacles is guaranteed while searching for the shortest path toward the <b>sub-goal.</b> When such a path is generated, a B-spline interpolated and smoothed trajectory is produced as the control reference for the mobile robot to follow. The whole process is iterated until no unexplored area remains in the map. The efficiency of the method is shown through simulated and real experiments...|$|R
