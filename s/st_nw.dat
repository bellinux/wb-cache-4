25|$|Mayor Neil Goldschmidt {{took office}} in 1972 as a proponent of {{bringing}} housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University (between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside <b>St.,</b> <b>NW</b> Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).|$|E

50|$|Holley Mims (February 10, 1929 - January 13, 1970) was {{a highly}} {{regarded}} middleweight boxer during the 1950s and 1960s. His overall record 64-27-6 (13 KOs) meant that {{he spent much of}} his career ranked among the top ten boxers in the middleweight category. Among his notable fights was a loss to Rubin Carter in 1962, a fight that he took on one day's notice, having flown into New York City just prior the fight; Mims dropped Carter in round four. Because of the loss, Mims dropped out of The Rings list of the top-ten middleweights contenders. Holley fought Sugar Ray Robinson and lost. Some say Robinson only win by decision and that Mim's was the real winner. Mims was known for fast hands and quick punches. They fought at what was Turner's Area on 14th and W <b>sts</b> <b>NW</b> DC. Mims fought with a team that met around age 16 or 17 at the YMCA 12st between S and T <b>Sts</b> <b>NW.</b> Their team, Mims, Garland Edwards (whom Mims fought twice and won, once by split decision), Rocky Farrell, Arthur Bethea, Sam Jefferson. and many other notable boxers and athletes (Walter 'Tommy' Thompson, weightlifter) over the years, trained at Finleys Gym owned by Jim Finley, well known and loved in DC.Mims died of a kidney ailment at the age of 42.
