40|$|This project {{aimed to}} study the {{feasibility}} of making a thermoset <b>sandwich</b> injection <b>moulding</b> from a novel thermoset co-injection moulding system. Two thermoset polyesters, BMC and a powder coating, were used for all experiments. Flow and cure of those materials in a newly designed manifold system were studied and some thermoset sandwich injection mouldings have been produced. Despite producing novel co-injection mouldings using two thermoset materials together, {{the results showed that}} the existing system was not applicable for large-scale production of sandwich parts and needed some improvements. The experiments on the moulding materials and single injection of each material gave temperature windows and settings for the co-injection moulding. The results from all experiments indicated that temperature and the time of applying heat to a thermoset material were very important to its flow ability and formation. Especially when producing a <b>sandwich</b> <b>moulding,</b> adequate heat and time was necessary for the skin material to form a sufficient layer to cover the core material. Investigation of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>moulding</b> cross-sections showed that applying more core injection delay time could help to increase the skin thickness. Surface assessmenitn dicated that the surface quality was also improved when the skin layer was thicker. However, core break-through at the position opposite to the mould gate was found in all sandwich mouldings showing that the type of mould gate was also important. A central sprue gated mould used in these experiments was found to be not suitable for producing a sandwich component using this machine configuration. A new manifold design was proposed and was compared to the existing manifold designed by using a simulation software package from Moldflow. Thermoset single injection moulding simulation was used to help to understand the flow and cure of a thermoset material in both manifold designs. It was shown that the new manifold system design was an improvement on the existing one.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{indicate}} routes by which recycled engineering thermoplastics (ETP) can be upgraded using alloying techniques. Recycled ETP have often been subjected to long-term service-induced degradation, so that the residual properties of recycled ETP need to be improved. Recycled ETP are often commingled, containing incompatible components. Great effort is required to separate them. Polymer alloying techniques, such as compatibilization and toughening, are the primary tools used in this work for upgrading recycled mixed ETP. A compatibilizer is an important modifier for raising the interfacial strength in an incompatible polymer blend. An impact modifier is critical for retaining the impact strength of the polymer blends. A core-shell impact modifier functioned both as impact modifier and compatibilizer for recycled ABS/PC blends. Since many ETP contain functional groups, it was of interest to utilise reactive compatibilization techniques. Reactive compatibilizers containing maleic anhydride, epoxide and oxazoline functional groups were shown to be effective compatibilizers for ABS/PA-, ABS/PBT- and ABS/PET-blends. Co-continuous structures and corresponding fibrillar structures in fracture surfaces obtained at low deformation rates were observed and discussed. Commercial polymer blends {{can be used as}} compatibilizing agents for ETP recycling. Different types of blends based on five recycled ETP from dismantled Volvo cars, including ABS, ABS/PC (30 / 70) blend, PMMA, glass-fibre-reinforced PA and mineral-filler-reinforced PA, could be upgraded using small amounts of compatibilizers and impact modifiers. Toughness is an important material property. Different types of toughness measurements may give different or even contradictory test results. It is recommended that the toughness properties should be evaluated by two or more complementary methods. The J-integral method and the common Charpy impact test constitute such a pair. A recycled polymer may exhibit poor surface appearance and poor mechanical properties. Co-injection (<b>sandwich)</b> <b>moulding</b> employs two different materials forming a core-skin structure. The possibility of using recycled ETP as the core material in co-injection moulding was investigated. The interfacial strength is important for co-injection moulding products. Its influence on the impact strength was of particular interest in this work...|$|R

The measurements were recorded in absorbance operating under the following conditions: 32 scans, 4 cm(- 1) resolution, 300 to 4000 -cm(- 1) wavelength. The percentage of unreacted carbon double bonds (% C=C) was determined from the ratio of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1638 cm(- 1)) against an internal standard before and after the curing of the specimen: aromatic C-C (peak at 1608 cm(- 1)). For T (degrees C), the samples were created in a metallic <b>mould</b> (<b>2</b> -mm thickness, 4 -mm diameter) and photoactivated for 20 s.

The degree of conversion values varied from 35. 0 to 50. 0 % (100 to 1000 mW/cm(2)) for an argon laser and from 41. 0 to 49 % (100 to 1000 mW/cm(2)) for an LED.
