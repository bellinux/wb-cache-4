5000|$|A <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> is an {{electrical}} insulator {{that is designed}} to work in mechanical tension (strain), to withstand the pull of a suspended electrical wire or cable. They are used in overhead electrical wiring, to support radio antennas and overhead power lines. A <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> may be inserted between two lengths of wire to isolate them electrically from each other while maintaining a mechanical connection, or where a wire attaches to a pole or tower, to transmit the pull of the wire to the support while insulating it electrically. Strain insulators were first used in telegraph systems in the mid 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|A typical <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> is a {{piece of}} glass or {{porcelain}} that is shaped to accommodate two cables or a cable shoe and the supporting hardware on the support structure (hook eye, or eyelet on a steel pole/tower). The shape of the insulator maximizes the distance between the cables while also maximizing the load-bearing transfer capacity of the insulator.|$|E
50|$|Insulators must {{support the}} {{conductors}} and withstand both the normal operating voltage and surges due to switching and lightning. Insulators are broadly classified as either pin-type, which support the conductor above the structure, or suspension type, where the conductor hangs below the structure. The {{invention of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> was {{a critical factor in}} allowing higher voltages to be used.|$|E

50|$|Sequences {{of two or}} more {{strainer}} pylons are {{uncommon in}} a powerline because strainers require twice as many <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> as ordinary pylons. Longer wire sections thus reduce installation work and cost. Sequences of strainers are sometimes used at powerlines crossing valleys, or where the powerline runs a path with curves.|$|R
50|$|When {{the line}} voltage {{requires}} more insulation {{than a single}} <b>insulator</b> can supply, <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> are used in series: A set of insulators are connected to each other using special hardware. The series can support the same strain as a single insulator, but the series provides a much higher effective insulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>insulator</b> - A {{dead end}} or anchor pole or tower is used where a {{straight}} section of line ends, or angles off in another direction. These poles must withstand the lateral (horizontal) {{tension of the}} long straight section of wire. In order to support this lateral load, strain insulators are used. For low voltage lines (less than 11 kV), shackle insulators are used as strain insulators. However, for high voltage transmission lines, strings of cap-and-pin (suspension) insulators are used, attached to the crossarm in a horizontal direction. When the tension load in lines is exceedingly high, such as at long river spans, two or more strings are used in parallel.|$|E
50|$|Utility poles {{are buried}} {{in the ground and}} have {{sufficient}} strength to stand on their own; guys are only needed on some poles to support unbalanced lateral loads due to the utility wires attached to them or to resist ground movement. Guys are particularly needed on dead-end (anchor) poles, where a long straight section of wire line ends, or angles off in another direction. To protect the public against faults that might allow the cable to become electrified, utility guy cables usually have a ceramic <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> ("Johnny ball") inserted near the top, to ensure that any dangerous voltages do not reach {{the lower end of the}} wire accessible to the public. The lower end where the cable enters the ground is often encased in a length of yellow plastic reflector to make it more visible, so that people or vehicles do not run into it.|$|E

It is great significance for reducing its maximum electric field strength to avoid corona noise and to improve substation electromagnetic environment. Firstly double-joint <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> string fittings simulation model is given by use of ansys 14. 0, and the electric field is simulated and calculated according to the actual installation location of the related equipment. The construction for double-joint <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> string fittings is optimized to reduce the electric field value on basis of studying on the simulation significantly higher electric field points. The simulation results show {{increasing the number of}} equalizing shielding ring, for reducing the electric field strength of double-joint <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> string fittings, is more effective than increasing the diameter of equalizing shielding ring...|$|E
50|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>insulators</b> are {{typically}} used outdoors in overhead wiring. In this environment {{they are exposed}} to rain and, in urban settings, pollution. As a practical matter, the shape of the insulator becomes critically important, since a wetted path from one cable to the other can create a low-resistance electrical path.|$|R
50|$|Shackle {{insulator}} - In early days, the shackle insulators {{were used}} as <b>strain</b> <b>insulators.</b> But nowaday, they are frequently used for low voltage distribution lines. Such insulators can be used either in a horizontal position or in a vertical position. They can be directly fixed to the pole with a bolt or to the cross arm.|$|R
50|$|Pin {{insulators}} are one {{of three}} types of overhead insulators, the others being <b>Strain</b> <b>insulators</b> and Suspension insulators. Unlike the others, pin insulators are directly connected to the physical support compared to being suspended from the wire. Pin insulators are shaped to allow the secure attachment of the conducting wire and avoid it coming adrift. The wire is usually attached to the insulator by being wrapped around it or in other circumstances, fixed into grooves on the insulator itself.|$|R
40|$|Distribution line {{difficulties}} {{have occurred}} in the areas having heavy ash fall. We investigate how distribution line difficulties depend on an increase of the leakage current of the insulators caused by the volcanic ash fall. Methods for eliminating these problems are examined. The results of this inquiry are summarized as follows. (1) When the volcanic ash accumulates in the ribs within the insulators and becomes wet by rain, such as drizzle, the leakage current increases owing to the weakening of the insulator resistance of the insulator, besides involving the generation of a corona. Fluctuations of the leakage current also become larger. (2) The volcanic ash fall increases the leakage current {{in the case of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>insulator,</b> the high voltage cut-out base and the arrester but little leakage occurs in the case of the pin insulator． (3) A combination of the <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> with the anti-pollution insulator restrains the generation of a corona, even if the insulators are polluted by the volcanic ash fall. This combination enables us to limit the fluctuations of the zero-phase-sequence voltage and to diminish the service interruption problems caused by the operation of the circuit breaker. (4) The observation of a corona makes us presuppose that the potential gradient in the ribs of the <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> is large. Accordingly, it follows that in order to decrease leakage currents, the <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> should be lengthened in the inner-cylinder within the insulator, as well as in the anti-pollution insulator. (5) For contamination countermeasures, it is necessary to take into account not only the electric conductivity and the quantity of the volcanic ash but also their viscosity...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} to be hereinafter described {{relates to}} insulators and more particularly to strain insulators for wire antennas. It {{has long been}} common practice to use with antenna wires on airplanes the well known porcelain or ceramic insulator, the wire ends being looped through or about the insulator, and brought back and twisted about the wire to tie, anchor or securely attach or fasten the insulator to the antenna. The produces small wire-end surfaces or other small wire surfaces, where the wires are would or twisted, which under certain atmospheric conditions are favorable to corona discharges. When the corona discharge is produced on a place it frequently completely obscures, submerges or, in substance, blanks out the signals of the radio so that the radio set of the plane becomes, practically, useless. The atmospheric conditions conducive to such corona discharge are frequently encountered by airplanes, especially when flying at high altitudes. Obviously, it is extremely important that the radio sets of planes should function well under such adverse conditions. The main objects of the present invention are to overcome the above and other objections and provide a simple, efficient, and compact <b>strain</b> <b>insulator</b> which may be produced in quantity at low cost...|$|E
50|$|Dead-end {{and other}} poles that support lateral loads have guy-wires to support them. The guys always have <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> {{inserted}} in their length {{to prevent any}} high voltages caused by electrical faults from reaching the lower portion of the cable that is accessible by the public. In populated areas, guy wires are often encased in a yellow plastic or wood tube reflector attached to their lower end, {{so that they can}} be seen more easily, reducing the chance of people and animals walking into them or vehicles crashing into them.|$|R
50|$|Guy wires {{supporting}} antenna masts {{usually have}} <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> {{inserted in the}} cable run, to keep the high voltages on the antenna from short circuiting to ground or creating a shock hazard. Often guy cables have several insulators, placed {{to break up the}} cable into lengths unwanted electrical resonances in the guy. These insulators are usually ceramic and cylindrical or egg-shaped (see picture). This construction has the advantage that the ceramic is under compression rather than tension, so it can withstand greater load, and that if the insulator breaks, the cable ends are still linked.|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{insulators}} {{are made}} of multiple units, {{with the number of}} unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer creepage distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. <b>Strain</b> <b>insulators</b> must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.|$|R
50|$|The poles {{at the end}} of a {{straight}} section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called dead-end poles in the United States. Elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles. These must carry the lateral tension of the long straight sections of wire. They are usually made with heavier construction. The power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal <b>strain</b> <b>insulators,</b> either placed on crossarms (which are either doubled, tripled, or replaced with a steel crossarm, to provide more resistance to the tension forces) or attached directly to the pole itself.|$|R
5000|$|A random {{wire antenna}} usually {{consists}} of a long (at least one quarter wavelength) wire with one end connected to the radio {{and the other in}} free space, arranged in any way most convenient for the space available. Ideally, it is a straight wire strung as high as possible between trees or buildings, the ends insulated from supports with <b>strain</b> <b>insulators.</b> Typically it is made from number 12 or 14 AWG (1.6 to 2.0 mm diameter) copperclad wire. Folding the wire into a zigzag pattern to fit in a limited space such as an apartment or attic will reduce effectiveness and make theoretical analysis extremely difficult. (The added length helps more than the folding typically hurts.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{dead-end}} tower (also anchor tower, anchor pylon) is a fully self-supporting structure used in construction of overhead power lines. A dead-end transmission tower uses horizontal <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> {{and where the}} conductors mechanically terminate. Dead-end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a [...] "slack span" [...] entering the equipment, when the circuit changes to a buried cable, when a transmission line changes direction {{by more than a}} few degrees, or just once in a while to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse.Since {{dead-end tower}}s require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers, it is uneconomic to build a line with only self-supporting structures.|$|R
50|$|Dead-end towers {{are used}} at regular {{intervals}} in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a conductor failure. An in-line dead-end tower will have two sets of <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> supporting the lines in either direction, with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments. Dead-end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension, contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for unbalanced load. Dead-end towers may use earth anchor cables {{to compensate for the}} asymmetric attachment of the conductors. They are often used when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a railway line, river, or valley.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a single}} wood utility pole structure, a pole {{is placed in}} the ground, then three crossarms extend from this, either {{staggered}} or all to one side. The insulators are attached to the crossarms. For an [...] "H"-type wood pole structure, two poles are placed in the ground, then a crossbar is placed on top of these, extending to both sides. The insulators are attached at the ends and in the middle. Lattice tower structures have two common forms. One has a pyramidal base, then a vertical section, where three crossarms extend out, typically staggered. The <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> are attached to the crossarms. Another has a pyramidal base, which extends to four support points. On top of this a horizontal truss-like structure is placed.|$|R
5000|$|Electromagnetic fields {{from the}} antennas complicate {{the design of}} guys that support mast antennas. Conductive metal guy-wires whose lengths are near to quarter {{wavelength}} multiples of the transmitted frequency can distort the radiation pattern of the antenna. This also applies to guy wires of neighboring masts or metal structures situated nearby. To prevent this, each guy wire is divided by <b>strain</b> <b>insulators</b> into multiple sections, each segment non-resonant at the transmitted wavelength. Cylindrical or egg-shaped porcelain [...] "Johnny ball" [...] insulators (also called [...] "egg insulators") are usually used. Non-conductive guys of Kevlar fiber (Phillystran) or extruded fiberglass rod are frequently used to not disturb the radiation pattern of the antennas. The strength and low stretch properties of Kevlar fiber approaches that of steel. However, Kevlar is very susceptible to ultraviolet degradation so it is enclosed in a UV resistant plastic sheath.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electron {{mobility}} {{has been}} investigated theoretically in undoped double-gate (DG) MOSFETs of different channel architectures: a relaxed-Si DG SOI, a strained-Si (sSi) DG SSOI (strained-Si-on-insulator, containing no SiGe layer), and a strained-Si DG SGOI (strained-Si-on-SiGe-on-insulator, containing a SiGe layer) at 300 K. Electron mobility in the DG SSOI device exhibits high enhancement relative to the DG SOI. In the DG SGOI devices the mobility is strongly suppressed by the confinement of electrons in much narrower strained-Si layers, {{as well as by}} the alloy scattering within the SiGe layer. As a conse-quence, in the DG SGOI devices with thinnest strained-Si layers the electron mobility may drop below the level of the relaxed DG SOI and the mobility enhancement expected from the strained-Si devices may be lost.
