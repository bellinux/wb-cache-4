The reflux ratio was shifting slightly between the non-heat integrated and heat integrated rectifying columns to a final value of about 4.2 and 3.9 for the non-heat integrated and heat integrated, respectively. The vapor exiting the rectifier, containing an ethanol concentration of 92.5 %, is superheated to 130 °C and then fed to a molecular sieve for further dehydration.

In a another study, Kravanja et al.

Franceschin et al. [26] calculated the theoretical energy savings for a 2 G bioethanol plant utilizing rye straw with co-production of xylitol and found it to be 68 %. However, theoretical energy savings usually differ from the savings that are possible in a heat exchanger network in a real process.

Furthermore, many of the chemical process used in the production of commodity and specialty chemicals are characterized by many reaction steps with separations required between each step. The coupling of the reaction and separation steps has a significant impact on the recycle and separation system structures. A completely integrated hierarchical procedure has been developed for the conceptual design of vapor-liquid separation systems found in multiple reaction step processes. ^ A new decomposition procedure is presented for determining the general structure of the separation system for processes involving reactions which occur in vapor-liquid-liquid-solid phase mixtures. The interactions of the separation subsystems for; vapor recovery, solid recovery, and liquid separations are identified, including process recycles between subsystems. The vapor recovery system and distillation sequence are then synthesized, the dominant process design variables are identified, the size and cost of the process units are determined, and the economic potential is calculated. Alternatives can then be quickly compared and ranked. Design procedures have been implemented in an expert system environment for the synthesis of gas membrane, condensation (high pressure or low temperature), and complex distillation columns (sidestream, side rectifier, and side <b>stripper</b> <b>columns)</b> separations. ^ Finally, a procedure is presented for assessing the incentive for the combining of distillation systems in multiple step reaction processes. Dilute mixture separations generally represent the highest separation costs in the distillation system. The pooling of plant distillation separations can lead to better separations by reducing flow imbalances and dilute mixtures in the separation system feed. ^ A hybrid of object-oriented and rule-based techniques has been used in the development and implementation of the procedure in PIPII, a computer-aided design tool which can rapidly generate process flowsheet alternatives and estimate the optimum range of the process conditions. The hierarchical nature of the procedure quickly prunes the number of viable alternatives which must be examined for a given process.

40|$|Flue {{gas from}} a plant using fossil fuels {{contains}} CO 2. Thus power/process plants using fossil fuels contribute {{to climate change}} if CO 2 in flue gas is not captured. The process of CO 2 capture from flue gas is called „postcombustion‟ CO 2 capture. Existing plants may be retrofitted with this process to minimize CO 2 emission. Amine solutions are mostly used for this process to scrub the flue gas. Amine based CO 2 capture involves two-stage process. In absorber column flue gas containing CO 2 is scrubbed by amine solution to produce CO 2 -rich solution which is subsequently stripped off absorbed CO 2 by heating in a <b>stripper</b> <b>column.</b> The inlet flue gas to the absorber column must be ~ 40 0 C and hence needs cooling. On the other hand, subsequent stripping process needs significant heating. Thus process of post-combustion CO 2 capture has an energy penalty which reduces the overall efficiency of the plant. In this paper, waste heat recovered from the flue gas during its cooling before being introduced to the absorber is proposed to be utilized for partial supplement in subsequent heating in stripper. System layouts have been conceptualized and ASPEN Plus ® simulation results for three improved layouts are discussed for energy savings {{with respect to a}} base case process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{overall goal}} of this work was to show {{experimentally}} using a CO 2 capture plant of reasonable capacity the contributions of plant and solvent optimization to minimizing the steam requirement. Experimental studies were conducted in an optimized CO 2 capture pilot plant to evaluate the performance of RS- 1 solvent and 5 molar aqueous MEA. The first objective was to test a highly improved plant configuration that can minimize both the amine circulation rate and the steam requirements below the values {{reported in the literature}} for a desired CO 2 recovery. The second objective was to show the superior performance of RS- 1 relative to 5  molar MEA. Both these strategies were aimed at reducing the steam requirement without increasing the size or complexity of the CO 2 capture plant. The pilot plant used for the tests was the highly optimized multi-purpose technology development plant at the International Test Center for CO 2 capture which processes 186  Nm 3 /h of flue gas to produce CO 2 with a nominal capacity of 1 tonne per day. This plant has 12 -inch ID for the absorber and <b>stripper</b> <b>columns.</b> The inlet flue gas temperature was 40 ∘C while the CO 2 concentrations in the flue gas were 4 and 8 % based on exhaust gases obtained respectively from a natural gas turbine-natural gas boiler combination, and a natural gas boiler. The results show that for flue gas containing 4 and 8 % CO 2 for a 90 % recovery or absorber efficiency, the steam duties using our optimized plant configuration were respectively 2. 03 and 1. 43  kg steam/kg CO 2 for MEA as compared to industry and literature values based on conventional plant configuration in the range of 1. 9 to 2. 5  kg steam/kg CO 2 depending on the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas. When RS- 1 solvent was used, the steam duties using the optimized plant configuration were respectively 1. 74 and 1. 35  kg steam/kg CO 2 which showed improvements over the corresponding performance of 5 molar MEA. It was interesting to observe that with a completely modified and optimized process configuration, the heat duty using RS- 1 was 1  kg steam/kg CO 2.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades there has been an {{increasing}} interest in climate change and global warming. It is believed that one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect, that causes global warming, is anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. In the work that has been done on reducing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, research into carbon capture and storage is now of considerable importance. Today, {{one of the most promising}} near-term mitigating strategies is post-combustion capture and chemical absorption with amine solvents. The objective of the research described in this thesis has been to develop a robust and reliable simulation model of the chemical absorption capture process with 30 wt% MEA. The simulations were performed in Aspen Plus version 8. 6, and an inbuilt template, ENRTL-RK_Rate_based_MEA_Model, was used as a basis for the simulation model. The absorber and <b>stripper</b> <b>columns</b> were simulated separately using a rate-based model. Five different pilot campaigns were used in the absorber simulations, and four different pilot campaigns were used in the stripper simulations. The inbuilt template from Aspen Plus was used without any changes in the physicochemical package. However, during the absorber simulations, a kinetic constant from the literature was used to optimize the model performance. Flow rates, composition, temperatures and pressures of the inlet streams were used as inputs in the model, in addition to the reboiler duty in the stripper simulations. Analogous, flow rates, compositions and temperatures of the outlet streams from the simulations were compared with experimental data to verify the model s performance. In the evaluation of the simulation model, the absorption/desorption rate from the simulations was compared with the experimental values. In total, 103 experimental runs were simulated in the absorber part, and 78 experimental runs were simulated in the desorber part. When the absorber simulation model was modified using the kinetic constant from the literature, the overall average deviation, including all runs, was found to be 9. 8 % and the absolute average deviation was found to be 8. 5 %. In addition, the predictions of the temperature profiles were found to be accurate, within a 2 °C deviation from experimental measurements for almost all runs, except in one of the campaigns. The performance of the simulation model was therefore deemed satisfactory in the absorber part. In addition, all campaigns showed similar results, thus indicating consistency. In the desorber simulations, the performance of the simulation model was somewhat more variable, and several possible causes were examined in order to understand the predictions. The Aspen Plus template without any changes performed better than the modified model using a kinetic constant from the literature, and thus the template was used directly. The performance in three out of the four campaigns was satisfactory. When one outlier was disregarded, the average deviation was found to be below 7. 9 % and the absolute average deviation was found to be below 7. 6 % for all three campaigns individually. The overall average deviation and absolute average deviation including all 78 runs was found to be 16. 1 % and 14. 5 %. Also for the desorber part, the deviation in the temperature profiles was below 2 °C for almost all runs.

The thermally coupled system arranged with the side stripper shows some advantages in comparison with the thermally coupled system to which a side rectifier has been considered, because the former reduces the energy demanded by utilizing the traditional process, removing additionally the water produced in the chemical reaction avoiding the known azeotrope condition for this mixture, allowing a higher ethyl acetate compound production. A similar advantageous result has been observed in the case regarding the Petlyuk distillation column. Furthermore, this latter scheme turns out to be more a conveniently proposed system than the TCDS with the arranged side stripper given a lesser demanded energy.

40|$|Natural gas is {{consisting}} of gaseous mixture or hydrocarbon components and mainly contains methane. The gas from reservoir might also contain contaminants (acid gas) such as nitrogen (N 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulphur compounds. The natural gas should be purified from these contaminants {{in order to}} avoid health risk, environment risk and establish the standard specifications of natural gas. In this work, chemical absorption will be used as the method to separate the contaminants especially CO 2 from natural gas processing plant. Chemical absorption processes generally are characterized by highly heat of acid gas absorption and it is required a lot of heat for regeneration. Thus, amount of steam to supply to reboiler will increase as heat of regeneration increase thus increased production cost. The aim of this work is to improve the operation of <b>stripper</b> <b>column</b> to reduce heat of regeneration so that the removal of CO 2 from natural gas using amine absorption will be improved. Aspen Plus simulator is used as a tool to develop the column model. Several process parameters such as concentration, pressure and temperature are varied to determine the optimum process operation at minimum heat of regeneration. Based on the result obtained; the suitable range for each process parameters; DEA concentration, reboiler temperature and stripper pressure is in between 25 wt% and 35 wt%, 118 oC and 121 oC, 1. 5 bar and 1. 75 bar respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{progress}} is being made toward the contract objectives in our attempt to produce {open_quotes}Methyl Chloride via Oxyhydrochlorination of Methane. {close_quotes} Specifically, gains have been achieved in Task 1. 0 Catalyst Development and Separation Unit Operation Development and Task 5. 0 Evaluation of Packed Bed Technology. Task 4. 0 PDU Startup has been completed. A recent patent by Asahi Glass Company (JP 06340560) claims significant improvement in the OHC process {{through the use of a}} zirconia-alumina, support compared to the prior art of silica or alumina supports. A zirconia-alumina. support has been synthesized and impregnated with Cu/La/Li. This catalyst will be screened to test the claims of the competing patent. A new catalyst evaluation system is being sought to expand the capabilities of the OHC catalyst research. A ROTOBERTY reactor will allow proper evaluation of catalysts through measurement of intrinsic kinetics. It will also allow the present tube reactor to be converted for use in catalyst lifetime studies. The PDU brought chemical feeds on and produced methyl chloride completing Task 4. 0 PDU Startup. In order to accomplish this, however, the <b>stripper</b> <b>column</b> had to be replaced with new PFA-lined materials. With this new equipment in place, the PDU ran at 30 psig between 285 {degrees}C and 325 {degrees}C forming a product stream containing as much as 3 % methyl chloride. This analysis was performed by GC due to clouding of the FTIR windows almost immediately upon the introduction of chemical feeds to the unit. These are the initial stages of Task 5. 0 Evaluation of Packed Bed Technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the phenomena involved in CO 2 chemical absorption and solvent regeneration systems results in the necessity to develop reliable models to describe the steady state and the dynamic behavior of the process. In the present work, the modeling of the regeneration section of a post-combustion CO 2 -MEA system have been examined. A rigorous rate-based approach, considered as mandatory for a reliable description {{of this type of}} process, was applied, where the two-film theory with chemical reaction was used to describe the gas/liquid interfacial material and energy transfer occurring in the packed column. The column was modeled as a convective-reactive system, with appropriate energy and material balances for each component. Particular emphasis was given to the definition of the correct number of segments for the discretization of the packing height. The effect of the axial diffusion/dispersion was analysed by means of the evaluation of the material and thermal Peclet number, and the results showed a plug-flow like behavior. The influence of the backmixing due to the countercurrent was also taken into account by varying the number of segments up to the achievement of an asymptotic behavior, confirming the correctness of the results obtained by the evaluation of the Peclet numbers. The model was validated with experimental data from a pilot-plant facility and the reproduction of the experimental values was deemed acceptable. The more detailed discretization allows to better describe the internal fluxes of the <b>stripper</b> <b>column</b> and has important implications in the design and in the extension to transient systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{graphical}} design {{method is}} proposed for estimating {{the number of}} theoretical contact stages for ternary separation operations under conditions of nonideality. The required thermodynamic data are arranged for constant pressure operations to give the equilibrium relationship and enthalpies of the vapour and liquid mixtures. Graphical constructions are made on charts containing these data starting from material and enthalpy operating points, for which generalized formulae are given, valid for such separation devices as the rectifier, <b>stripper,</b> absorber, distillation <b>column,</b> with any number of feeds and/or side drawoffs. The method takes into account nonidealities arising from changing equilibrium constants and changing molal flow rates with composition, and is rigorous {{to the extent of}} the limit of readability of the chart. In general the usual algebraic computation for a theoretical stage is reduced to the construction of three straight lines. A discussion is given on the trial-and-error procedure involved in assigning proper terminal conditions to actual design problems for ternary separation operations from the viewpoint of analysis of variables. The condition existing at the feed plate is described in relation both to compositions of the streams in the adjacent sections and to the thermal condition of the feed. The graphical construction and the discussion on variables are illustrated with examples on the separation of liquid air, including the case of a double distillation column...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{program has}} been developed and used to study the condensate treatment process in a kraft pulp mill consisting of a <b>stripper,</b> a methanol <b>column</b> and a decanter. The simulations require rigorous models for vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium calculations. The Wilson equation and the NRTL equation (non random two liquids) {{have been used for}} these calculations New data were included in the flowsheeting program Aspen Plus for seven volatile compounds, to perform accurate calculations of both vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria. Simulations were compared with measurements on the industrial condensate treatment process and the results of the simulations were used to improve the process. By changing the position of the decanter in the process, the COD (chemical oxygen demand) content in the stripped condensate was decreased from 700 to 300 mg O- 2 /l. The effect of various process parameters, such as the vapor fraction after the stripper and the flow rate of secondary steam to both the stripper and the methanol column, on the quality of clean condensate were investigated. The design of the stripper and the methanol column was studied by calculating the optimal feed location for various numbers of trays in the columns. The results showed that the feed location in the methanol column would be more optimal if it were located higher up in the column (above tray 5 - 7) instead of above tray 10, which {{was the case in the}} industrial process investigated...|$|R
40|$|Identification of an {{industrial}} system is generally a costly and complex process. Making an identification procedure efficient enough {{is an ongoing}} demand. Typically, designing the excitation for ill-conditioned and directional systems is a challenging task. Tailor-made input excitation using process knowledge {{is one way to}} make the identification more efficient. The focus of this thesis is to develop a better identification process for multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems with proper design of input excitation signals. A distillation column simulator has been constructed as a testbed for the research. Data from a real-life distillation column system have been used for calibrating the simulator. In model-based control (e. g., model predictive control, MPC), the model quality has a critical effect on the performance of the controller. To construct a control-relevant model via identification, the system has to be excited adequately in all gain directions. In order to reduce the relative uncertainties associated with these gain directions, it is especially important to excite the system in the weak gain directions. In this study, we consider both designs by rotated signals as well as methods based on design in the frequency domain. We study multiple input design methods using basic signals like steps, PRBS, and sinusoidal signals with multiple frequencies and compare them through two case studies. The case studies are a 4 X 4 <b>column</b> <b>stripper</b> system and a 2 X 2 nonlinear distillation column system. As most of the previous studies have focused on 2 X 2 systems, a comparative study to choose the proper excitation for identification of an ill-conditioned system with more inputs and outputs (n n;n > 2) was chosen. Practically every system has physical limitations as well as limitations due to the operation of the process. A useful measure related to input limitations is the plantfriendliness of an input signal. Several parameters that characterize the plant-friendliness are calculated and compared for the designed inputs. These parameters depend only on the inputs, not the rest of the system. For the model identification, it is desirable that outputs are excited equally in all directions. We propose two different tools for analyzing the excitation of the outputs, namely, projections of the outputs along the gain directions and the determinant of the correlation matrix of the outputs. Both methods yield measures on how well-balanced the output distribution is. We show that experiments where the gain directions have been considered in the input design produce output data that are better balanced than output data produced by other designs. The models obtained from directional experiments perform better in cross-validation with data from other experiments than other models...|$|R
