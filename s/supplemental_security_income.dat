25|$|People {{with disabilities}} {{who do not}} have a work history and who receive <b>Supplemental</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Income,</b> or SSI, are {{enrolled}} in Medicaid as a mechanism to provide them with health insurance. Persons with a disability, including blindness or physical disability, deafness, or mental illness can apply for SSI. However, in order to be enrolled, applicants must prove that they are disabled {{to the point of being}} unable to work. In recent years, a substantial liberalization occurred in the field of individual disability income insurance, which provides benefits when an insured person is unable to work because of illness or injury (HIAA, p. 13).|$|E
25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the single}} most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the UK's version is part of National Insurance; the U.S.'s version is Social Security (SS)—specifically, several parts of SS including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and <b>Supplemental</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Income</b> (SSI). These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.|$|E

In addition, distrust of health care systems is a prominent feature of this population. In addition, distrust of health care systems is a prominent feature of this population. With these preexisting negative, disadvantaged conditions, changes in the health care system could further limit utilization of health/mental health services among this vulnerable population and result in unmet health care needs. The purpose of this study is to investigate what differences in perceptions of unmet health and/or mental health service needs among disables individuals with different racial/ethnic background in relation to their level of trust in their health care providers and identified barriers related to the unmet health/mental health services. Data were collected through a population based mail survey to Medicaid beneficiaries who received <b>Supplemental</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Incomes</b> (SSI) due to disability conditions other than head injuries. The final sample included 1151 adult Medicaid SSI recipients. The Trust in the Health Care Provider scale was used to measure participant 2 ̆ 7 s level of trust in their health care providers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the impact of the Arkansas Long-Term Care Demonstration Project upon Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 Medicaid {{expenditures}} and upon the clients it serves. A Retrospective Medicaid expenditure study component used analyses of variance techniques to test for the Project 2 ̆ 7 s effects upon aggregated expenditures for 28 demonstration and control counties representing 25 percent of the State 2 ̆ 7 s population over four years, 1979 - 1982. ^ A second approach to the study question utilized a 1982 prospective sample of 458 demonstration and control clients from the same 28 counties. The disability level or need for care of each patient was established a priori. The extent to which an individual 2 ̆ 7 s variation in Medicaid utilization and costs was explained by patient need, presence or absence of the channeling project 2 ̆ 7 s placement decision or some other patient characteristic was examined by multiple regression analysis. Long-term and acute care Medicaid, Medicare, third party, self-pay and the grand total of all Medicaid claims were analyzed for project effects and explanatory relationships. ^ The main project effect was to increase personal care costs without reducing nursing home or acute care costs (Prospective Study). Expansion of clients appeared to occur in personal care (Prospective Study) and minimum care nursing home (Retrospective Study) for the project areas. Cost-shifting between Medicaid and Medicare in the project areas and two different patterns of utilization in the North and South projects tended to offset each other such that no differences in total costs between the project areas and demonstration areas occurred. The project was significant ((beta) =. 22, p 3 ̆c. 001) only for personal care costs. The explanatory power of this personal care regression model (R(2 ̆ 72) =. 36) was comparable to other reported health services utilization models. Other variables (Medicare buy-in, level of disability, Social <b>Security</b> <b>Supplemental</b> <b>Income</b> (SSI), net monthly income, North/South areas and age) explained more variation in the other twelve cost regression models. ...|$|R
