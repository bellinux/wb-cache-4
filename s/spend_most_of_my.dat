She had no time, {{even if she had}} retained the will, to continue her work as an artist. With a faculty for entertaining handsomely and largely, with hosts of friends who would have clustered about her with loyal admiration, she remained the mistress of a narrow home and one more or less incompetent housemaid.

40|$|This {{article is}} about my {{personal}} {{experience in a}} doctoral program in the United States. After working ten years {{as a high school}} teacher in Hong Kong, I decided to quit my high school teaching career and to come back to school for my PhD—not because I no longer enjoy teaching; in fact I still do, but because I do not enjoy <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time with discipline and classroom management. So, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree so that I can teach college students. “I got admitted to a PhD program in the US. ” I excitedly said to my wife. She was thrilled to hear the good news. We started obtaining visas and told our three daughters about our forthcoming plan. Our adventure began when we moved to an unknown place in the US without even knowing...|$|R

In order to catch up, Poles will need to absorb the entire acquis of management theory and practice over {{a very short period of}} time.

I realized that for a researcher interested in management, it was indeed an unparalleled opportunity and one I simply could not miss.

40|$|Many {{students}} at American universities {{have trouble with}} technical writing. To help students over this trouble, we often use inefficient methods. These methods, like other aspects of graduate education, sometimes remind me of medieval apprenticeships. For example, I have known smart, capable teachers who were reduced to “teaching a student to write ” by taking that student’s first paper and rewriting it from start to finish. This booklet describes better methods. Instead <b>of</b> <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> “student time ” working on writing—teaching the same material to seniors, graduate students, and postdocs—I now prefer to teach writing to a group that meets weekly. Teaching a group uses my time more effectively, and working in a group shows students {{that they are not}} alone in their difficulties. The problems they have are problems that everyone has, and they see these problems even in published papers. But we do not emphasize problems; instead we emphasize useful principles and practices that students can learn to apply to their own manuscripts. • I emphasize principles that can be applied successfully by a beginning writer. Especially for students in science and engineering, a principle is easily applicable whe...|$|R

60|$|With these supernatural {{moonlight}} nights I {{finish the}} story of that dark time, albeit the darkness had not yet gone; to have recalled it and related it briefly as I could once in my life is enough. Let me now {{go back to the}} simile of the lost wretch struggling for life in the mangrove swamp. The first sense <b>of</b> having set <b>my</b> foot on a firmer place in that slough of fetid slime, of a wholesome breath of air blown to me from outside the shadow of the black abhorred forest, was when I began to experience intervals of relief from physical pain, when these grew more and more frequent and would extend to entire days, then to weeks, and for a time I would become oblivious <b>of</b> <b>my</b> precarious state. I was still {{and for a long time}} subject to attacks, when the pain was intolerable and was like steel driven into my heart, always followed by violent palpitations, which would last for hours. But I found that exercise on foot or horseback made me no worse, and I became more and more venturesome, <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time out <b>of</b> doors, although often troubled with the thought that my passion for Nature was a hindrance to me, a turning aside from the difficult way I had been striving to keep.|$|R
40|$|NASA is a {{household}} name {{in this day and}} age, known commonly as America's government-run powerhouse of innovation and space exploration. It is a common dream for students {{to be a part of}} NASA's workforce, but I did not realize that it was my dream until I found that I could not imagine working anywhere else. From August to December, I had the privilege of a co-op tour with NASA at the Johnson Space Center. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) first formed in the early hysteria of the Cold War, and in its early days it received enormous funding and political support. It was America's response to the Russian Sputnik, which was a not only a stark symbol of what was suddenly possible, but also of how far behind the United States had fallen in the race for technology. The political atmosphere in the world has since changed, but NASA's drive to push the boundaries of the impossible has not faded: NASA's primary mission has been exploration for the betterment of mankind, and it works towards that mission to this day. The specific NASA site that I worked in was by a coast near Houston, TX, at the Johnson Space Center (Figure 1). I was led on <b>my</b> first day <b>of</b> work to a building dedicated to Structural Engineering (Building 13), which was where I would be <b>spending</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time in the months to come.
