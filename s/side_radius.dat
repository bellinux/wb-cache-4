50|$|The next {{development}} in stylus form came {{about by the}} attention to the CD-4 quadraphonic sound modulation process, which requires up to 50 kHz frequency response, with cartridges like Technics EPC-100CMK4 capable of playback on frequencies up to 100 kHz. This requires a stylus with a narrow <b>side</b> <b>radius,</b> such as 5 µm (or 0.2 mil). A narrow-profile elliptical stylus is {{able to read the}} higher frequencies (greater than 20 kHz), but at an increased wear, since the contact surface is narrower. For overcoming this problem, the Shibata stylus was invented around 1972 in Japan by Norio Shibata of JVC, fitted as standard on quadraphonic cartridges, and marketed as an extra on some high-end cartridges.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the effects of intense and regular physical activity on locomotor system modifications. Tennis, with its unilateral solicitations, allows a more precise examination of specific localized development. Ten professional tennis players were compared with sedentary age-matched students. Muscular modifications were observed, mainly in the forearm circumference. The dominant side forearm circumference was 13 % larger than the opposite side. Asymmetry was less in the upper arm and insignificant in the thorax and vertebra. Deep modifications in bone mineral content (BMC) were investigated by isotopic techniques, based on differential photon attenuation in bone and soft tissue of the forearm. Bone density was markedly increased in professional tennis players. Even in the nondominant <b>side,</b> <b>radius</b> BMC was 1. 18 g HA/cm, 15 % higher than in sedentary control students. The difference was yet larger in the dominant mid-radius, reaching 1. 47 g HA/cm. The same differences were observed for the ulna and involved both cortical and trabecular bone. In the control group of sedentary students, no significant difference was noted between the two upper limbs. This study clearly demonstrates the positive correlation between exercise and bone mineralization. The precise mechanical constraints optimizing the favorable effect in the most efficient way should be studied. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy for heavy-ion {{collisions}} at RHIC and LHC is explored {{within the}} approach {{consisting of the}} hydrodynamics of perfect fluid followed by statistical hadronization. It is found that for the RHIC initial conditions the very same framework that reproduces the standard soft observables (including the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow, and the azimuthally-averaged HBT radii) leads to a proper description of the azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopic observables - {{we find that the}} azimuthal variation of the side and out HBT radii is very well reproduced for all centralities, while the out-side correlation is somewhat too large for non-central events. Concerning the dependence of the femtoscopic parameters on kT we find that it is very well reproduced for the out and <b>side</b> <b>radii,</b> and fairly well for the long radius. The model is then extrapolated for the LHC energy. We predict the overall moderate growth of the HBT radii and the decrease of their azimuthal oscillations. Such effects are naturally caused by longer evolution times. In addition, we discuss in detail the space-time patterns of particle emission. We show that they are quite complex and argue that the overall shape seen by the femtoscopic methods cannot be easily disentangled on the basis of simple-minded arguments.

Observing that a cyclic quadrilateral is split by a diagonal into two triangles with the same circumcenter and the same circumradius, the result follows, using the tools available to Brahmagupta. The expression for the diagonals (XII. 28) is a consequence. The shortcomings of earlier attempts at reconstructing Brahmagupta’s method are overcome by restoring the mathematical consistency of the text. This leads to a new interpretation of Brahmagupta’s terminology for quadrilaterals of different types...|$|R
