5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in draught to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rosyth to be further lightened, as her draught was still too deep {{to allow her to}} enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E

Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E

25|$|In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, {{ostensibly to}} find an American {{publisher}} for Atget's photographs. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. Her first photographs of the city were taken with a hand-held Kurt-Bentzin camera, but soon she acquired a Century Universal camera which produced 8 x 10inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed New York City with the diligence and attention to detail she had so admired in Eugène Atget. Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Zohra Daoud lived a high class life in Afghanistan. Her Father was Afghanistan’s U.S. educated {{surgeon and}} her mother came from a well-recognized family. She was raised around her {{personal}} cooks and maids in high-society Kabul. She was privileged, therefore she {{had no need to}} enter the pageant. As the pageant gained fame, she gained interest and entered the Miss Universe pageant. In Kabul, she made an impression on Television executives and radio hosts.

25|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also records {{a tradition}} of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah. This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also {{played an important role}} in the events of Hanukkah. The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E

[...] The Deutsche Werke in Kiel was awarded the contract, where the keel was laid on 6 May 1935. The ship was launched on 8 December 1936, after which fitting-out work was begun. The ship was completed in May 1938 and commissioned for sea trials on the 21st, under the command of Kapitän zur See (KzS) Erich Förste. The trials revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas. This caused flooding in the bow and damaged electrical systems in the forward gun turret. As a result, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the dockyard for extensive modification of the bow. The original straight stem was replaced with a raised [...] "Atlantic bow." [...] A diagonal cap was fitted to the smoke stack to keep the main mast free of smoke. The modifications were completed by September 1939, by which time the ship was finally fully operational.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved.
