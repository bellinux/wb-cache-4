40|$|The main {{goals of}} this thesis are to {{understand}} the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> mechanisms and parameters that influence the stability of proteins, to evaluate the excipients to stabilize protein formulations during scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying,</b> and to study the scalability of the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. For this study, lysozyme and myoglobin were used as model proteins. More specifically, the detailed aims are as follows: 1) to study the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters (i. e., pressure, protein solution and CO 2 flow rate, feed volume) {{without the use of}} organic solvents, in order to produce dried protein formulations with minimal residual water content in a single drying step, 2) to evaluate the scalability of the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process, 3) To gain fundamental insight into the effect of the CO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters at sub- and supercritical conditions (65 - 130 bar and 25 - 50 °C) on the stability of myoglobin, 4) {{to understand the}} effect of the CO 2 /water interface and pH shift on heme destabilization and aggregation in myoglobin solutions using a gas bubbling method at atmospheric conditions, 5) to evaluate the influence of pharmaceutical excipients on the stability of myoglobin in terms of heme binding and aggregation during scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} on <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of whey has significantly changed {{during the last}} 20 years.

50|$|Industrial scale <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> {{has been}} around since {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century. It can only be used to dry liquids, as they are sprayed into hot air of up to 575 °F. That way, the heated air mixes with the {{atomized}} liquid and evaporates the moisture within. The solids are recovered as powder. The most common application of <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> is powdered milk.

50|$|To make {{milk protein}} concentrate, whole milk is first {{separated}} into cream and skim milk. The skim milk is then fractionated using ultrafiltration {{to make a}} skim concentrate that is lactose-reduced. This process separates milk components according to their molecular size. Milk then passes through a membrane that allows some of the lactose, minerals, and water to cross through. The casein and whey proteins, however, will not pass through the membrane due to their larger molecular size. The proteins, lactose, and minerals that do not go through the membrane are then <b>spray</b> <b>dried.</b> Spray drying and evaporation further concentrate the remaining materials to form a powder. Depending on {{the purpose of the}} final product, different heat treatments can be used to process ultrafiltered or blended varieties of MPC.

5000|$|The {{application}} of the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> encapsulation technique is to prepare [...] "dehydrated" [...] powders of substances which {{do not have any}} water to dehydrate.

The technique was once used to remove water from food products; for instance, in the preparation of dehydrated milk. Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> causes thermal degradation, milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim milk powders are still widely produced using <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> technology around the world, typically at high solids concentration for maximum drying efficiency. Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.|$|R

50|$|For the {{production}} of aHVP, the proteins are hydrolysed by cooking with a diluted (15-20%) hydrochloric acid, at a temperature between 90 and 120 °C for up to 8 hours. After cooling, the hydrolysate is neutralised with either sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to a pH of 5 to 6. The hydrolysate is filtered to remove the insoluble carbohydrate fraction (humin) and then further refined. The source of the raw material, concentration of the acid, {{the temperature of the}} reaction, the time of the reaction, and other factors can all affect the organoleptic properties of the final product. Activated carbon treatment can be employed to remove both flavour and colour components, to the required specification. Following a final filtration, the aHVP may, depending upon the application, be fortified with additional flavouring components. Thereafter, the product can be stored as a liquid at 30-40% dry matter, or alternatively it may be <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> or vacuum dried and further used as a food ingredient.|$|E

Gallic acid, used as chemical marker, was quantified by HPLC in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders. Carrageenan-induced inflammatory and allodynic responses in the mouse paw were used as pharmacological models. Quantitative and qualitative differences among chemical composition of different herb parts were observed. The oral administration of leaves or leaves plus stems <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced allodynic effect (42 ± 5 and 54 ± 3 %, respectively). Additionally, the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves significantly reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema (35 ± 6 %). The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of roots, stems, or the mixture of leaves, stems and roots (100 mg/kg, p. o.) did not exhibit antiallodynic or antioedematogenic effect in the same model. In conclusion, differences in the chemical composition of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders from P. niruri are reflected in their in vivo pharmacological actions. Despite of a direct relationship of anti-inflammatory and antiallodynic effects with the gallic acid content had been observed, especially in the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves, the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders of leaves plus stems showed to be more effective, suggesting a synergic effect between their constituents...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed {{has been a}} concerning subject {{over the last few}} decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans.

However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma.
