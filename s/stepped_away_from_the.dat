25|$|This {{threat was}} {{underlined}} {{by the thousands}} of veterans from his army that filled their home field, chanting threats, and on occasion pointing pistols at opposition players during matches. One player told the British football magazine FourFourTwo that he was locked in a garage when his team played Obilić. Europe's football governing body, UEFA, considered prohibiting Obilić from participation in continental competitions because of its connections to Ražnatović. In response to this, Ražnatović <b>stepped</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> position of president and gave his seat to his wife Ceca. In a 2006 interview, Dragoslav Šekularac (who was coach of Obilić while Arkan was with the club) said claims that Arkan verbally and physically assaulted Obilić players were false. Ražnatović was a chairman of the Yugoslav Kickboxing Association. During this time Arkan was sponsored by British oil baron Ian Taylor.|$|E
25|$|Lou Saban {{replaced}} Weir as the Knights {{head coach}} in 1983. Saban had previously coached at Miami, Army, Northwestern, and in the AFL and NFL with the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots, {{to name just a}} few. In UCF's first Black and Gold Spring game held in 1983, the defense won 14–6. The Knights finished the 1983 season 5–6, including the team's first win over a Division I–AA opponent. Starting the 1984 season filled with optimism, the Knights were shaken by a 1–6 start. Following the disappointing beginning to the season, Saban <b>stepped</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program, and was replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Jerry Anderson. Saban had a 6–12 (.333) record during his tenure as the Knights head coach. Anderson finished out the year with the team in an interim position, with a 1–3 (.250) record.

25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly <b>stepped</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

2500|$|Controversy erupted {{during the}} third quarter of the Thanksgiving night game between the Steelers and Ravens, as Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin found himself in the path of Ravens {{returner}} Jacoby Jones during a Ravens kickoff return. Tomlin was watching the play on the stadium's big screen and was thus facing away from the play itself while standing with at least one foot in the field of play. Jones broke the return {{to the side of the}} field and was running up the sideline on which Tomlin was standing.

Shortly thereafter, Jones was tackled from behind at the Steelers' 27 yard-line. Some observers speculated that without Tomlin's interference Jones may have reached the endzone on the play. Tomlin was fined $100,000 by the league for the incident and the league held out the possibility that the Steelers might also be stripped of draft picks in the 2014 NFL Draft since Tomlin's actions [...] "affected a play on the field." [...] After the season concluded it was announced that no further penalty beyond Tomlin's fine would be assessed.|$|E
