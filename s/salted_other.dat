5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, and people have been bitten attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and <b>salted.</b> <b>Other</b> than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E

50|$|Similar to silver nitrate, silver {{perchlorate}} is {{an effective}} reagent for replacing halides ligands with perchlorate, which is a weakly or non-coordinating anion. The use of silver perchlorate in chemical synthesis has declined due to concerns about explosiveness of perchlorate <b>salts.</b> <b>Other</b> silver reagents are silver tetrafluoroborate, and the related silver trifluoromethanesulfonate and silver hexafluorophosphate.|$|R
