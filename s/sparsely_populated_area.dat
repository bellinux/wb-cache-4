5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} some {{problems}} {{in connection with}} the school situation of children from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> 515 pupils at the middle level of the 9 -year compulsory school ir. Västerbotten took part ir. the investigation. 200 of these we*-e children from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> according to the following definition: children having no friends of their own age except in their families closer than one kilometre from their homes. School performance was measured with standard tests in the subjects Swedish, mathematics, English and with marks in grade 6. School adjustment and maturity were measured with teacher estimates. The attitudes of the pupils to school, friends, home and leisure time were studied with questionnaire« in grades 3 and 6 and for the latter ones with a questionnaire in grade 7 as well. Children from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> obtained as good a result as other pupils on the standard tests. In B-schools, above all in grade 6, the children from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> tended to perform better than teir class-mates. Boys from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> obtained somewhat worse results in A-schools in grade 6. Girls performed better than boys throughout. The teacher's estimates of school adjustment and maturity favoured the group from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> compared with other pupils. The attitudes of the pupils to school and school work were somewhat more positive and stable in B-classes. When they reached the senior level of t. he 9 -year compulsory school the pupils from B-schools were more insecure in the school situation whereas they seemed less stressed by marks and competition than pupils from A-schools. Children from <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> have positive altitudes towards forming new contacts both at the middle level of the 9 -year compulsory school and in grade 7. The results indicate on the whole that both B-schools and life in <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> favour performance in school. The same is true of school adjustment and comfort {{in spite of the fact}} that children from this environment are considered to be a negative sample according to prevalent social group norms.

5|$|September 5, 1950– Hurricane Easy moves ashore near Cedar Key {{and later}} near Tampa Bay {{as a major}} {{hurricane}} after looping offshore. The hurricane causes locally heavy damage in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> totaling $3.3million (1950USD, $29.5million 2008USD). Due to its erratic motion, Easy drops heavy rainfall peaking at 38.7inches (983mm) in Yankeetown, which in turn causes 2indirect deaths from electrocution.|$|E
5|$|A rugged, <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> the Catlins {{features}} a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area,</b> no deaths {{were reported by}} the NHC. However, one boy was swept away in the Uxpana River and was thus reported missing. Due to flooding caused by the storm, three rivers in Veracruz overflowed their banks. Flooding from the storm also washed-out portions of two Mexico highways. Furthermore, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Overall, damage from the system was not widespread.|$|E

More than 1,000 homes were damaged in Guerrero, Michoacán, and Colima, as was 7,400 acres (30km²) of farmland. A flood on the Atoyac River washed away 500 homes in Guerrero, which prompted the evacuation of 2,500 people. A passenger train north of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, was derailed when it encountered washed-out roadbeds. The storm also caused power outages.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the college}} {{was founded in}} a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> with {{only a handful of}} nearby farmhouses, and it was an arduous stagecoach ride from Lansing, the College built four faculty houses {{in the first year of}} classes in 1857. One of these {{original}} faculty houses, Cowles House, still exists as the President's official residence, though only two walls and part of the foundation remain of the original construction. Ultimately, ten faculty homes were built on campus between 1857 and 1885. Besides Cowles House, one other survived and was moved into the city of East Lansing; the rest were demolished between 1922 and 1948 to make room for the north complex of residence halls and the Student Union, designed by Pond and Pond.|$|E

We focus on projections made for the Northern Territory of Australia, a jurisdiction in the north of the country, to assess the relative accuracy of projections over time. The results conclusively demonstrate the reduced accuracy of remote population projections. Nevertheless, the exercise of comparing and contrasting the accuracy of projections provides a useful lens for understanding demographic and other issues which necessitate that approaches for developing and utilising projections can and should be different in <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> We provide examples of alternative approaches to projections and the analysis of errors which researchers and analysts in <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> might apply to other jurisdictions...|$|R
5|$|At , Rwanda's {{population}} density is amongst {{the highest in}} Africa. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the {{population density}}. The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country. The only <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> {{of the country is}} the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east. Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million. Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development. According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000. Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000. The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990, to 16.6% in 2006; by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.|$|E
5|$|Edith {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September 14, the storm stalled while located just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. A mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of Louisiana, and made landfall on September 16 in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> 30 miles (48 km) east of Cameron with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana, and into a tropical depression over Mississippi. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September 18.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

40|$|Much effort {{presently}} {{goes into}} research regarding ‘sustainable cities’. This is reasonable {{in light of}} the globally rapidly increasing population in urban areas. Much less research is directed to understand how to achieve a more sustainable situation in rural areas, but a substantial number of the world population will live in <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> also in future. This study contributes to the understanding of environmental impacts and sustainability issues in <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> The island of Norderön in Jämtland, Sweden, is used as a geographically well-defined case study object. Activities on the island has been screened and green house gas emissions from these activities been estimated using LCA methodology.

5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl made {{landfall}} {{just south}} of the United States–Mexico border in mid-August2000, causing minimal damage. The second named storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl originated from a tropical wave near the African coastline. Tracking westward, the wave failed to organize substantially until entering the Bay of Campeche, at which time it developed into a tropical storm. Beryl rapidly deepened while in the Gulf of Mexico, and it initially was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane under favorable conditions for development. Instead, Beryl remained at moderate tropical storm intensity and failed to intensify any further. It made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as a weak tropical storm with winds of 50mph (85km/h) on August15 and dissipated over mountainous terrain shortly thereafter. One death was reported in Mexico due to drowning. Otherwise, no significant damage was reported associated with Beryl, as it affected a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After {{changing}} {{little in}} intensity {{for much of}} 6 November, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished. The storm moved due west through a small fetch of warmer waters, fueling the process of intensification over the next 42hours. Based on estimates provided {{through the use of}} the Dvorak technique, the JTWC assessed Gay to have attained its peak intensity as a Category5-equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph) early on November8. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240km/h (145mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. Additionally, the agency estimated the cyclone's central pressure to have decreased to 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Around 1800UTC, Gay made landfall over a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh. Upon coming ashore, the storm's eye was about 20km (12mi) wide, with gale-force winds within 95km (60mi) of the center. Now over land, Gay no longer had access to warm waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm less than 12hours after landfall. The storm continued to deteriorate while moving across India, before it completely dissipated over Maharashtra on 10 November.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a <b>sparsely</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area</b> of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
