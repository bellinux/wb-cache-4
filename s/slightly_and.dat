5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E

5|$|A short overlap carries SR57 {{traffic on}} the same roadway as SR60. The two routes head {{northeast}} through {{an arm of the}} San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR57 ascends <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E
5|$|Act III Le Chiffre tortures Bond {{in order}} to find out where Bond has hidden the cheque for his winnings, but Bond does not reveal where it is. After a fight between Bond and Le Chiffre's guards, Bond shoots and wounds Le Chiffre, saving Valerie in the process. Exhausted, Bond sits in a chair {{opposite}} Le Chiffre to talk. Mathis gets in between them and Le Chiffre grabs her from behind, threatening her with a concealed razor blade. As Le Chiffre moves towards the door with Mathis as a shield, she struggles, breaking free <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> Bond is able to shoot Le Chiffre.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the open {{waters of the}} South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10‑minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and 1-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China.|$|E

5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases <b>slightly,</b> <b>and</b> its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|By September25, Georges {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around {{the center of}} circulation. By September27, Georges reached an intensity of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> turned southeastward. Although {{the center of}} the storm was poorly defined at the time and located to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature. Later that day the storm curved towards the east while approaching Florida. At around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later that day, Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E

5|$|Construction from Brill to Oxford {{had not yet}} begun. Further Acts of Parliament {{were granted}} in 1892 and 1894 varying the {{proposed}} route <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> allowing for its electrification, but no work was carried out other than some preliminary surveying. On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line {{in preparation for the}} extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse sleepers, replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal sleepers. At around this time two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.|$|E

Henry recovered <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E

After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{begins at}} US62 in the hamlet of Conewango Valley, {{located in the}} northeastern corner {{of the town of}} Ellington. The route heads north-northwestward, {{paralleling}} a pair of train tracks, and shortly after enters the village of Cherry Creek, where it intersects County Route70 (CR70) and CR68, respectively. Known as Main Street, it bows out to the east <b>slightly,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently takes on a due north path as it heads through the town of Cherry Creek. A couple miles later, it reaches the hamlet of Balcom Corners (located in the town of Villenova), a community situated at the junction of NY83 and the western terminus of NY322. Here, NY83 turns westward toward the community of Hamlet, where it intersects with CR72.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due {{to the effect of}} a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up <b>slightly,</b> <b>and</b> from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa near Cape Verde, and despite semi-favorable conditions, the wave did not develop initially, due to embedded westerlies, which caused the wave to remain disorganized, despite having deep convection. Six days later, the wave had reached the Lesser Antilles, and split, the northern portion of the wave then developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen on October 16. The depression rapidly intensified to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane the next day, receiving the name Nana. Development increased <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> the system reached its peak intensity of 85mph (140km/h) that same day. Nana dissipated while heading southward on October 21.|$|E

While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back <b>slightly</b> <b>and</b> tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
