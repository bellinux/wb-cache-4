5|$|There are {{sections}} of the Temple known as Orders, each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular <b>skill,</b> <b>for</b> instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders {{can be understood as}} schools of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be the founder of the order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.|$|E

40|$|In this research, <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> {{sustainability}} are broadly {{conceived as}} including <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> social, {{economic and environmental}} sustainability – a triple bottom-line approach. Since 2009 Australian governments have been implementing an agreement that embeds <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability into vocational education and training, despite scant information about the actual levels of demand for, and supply of these skills. This study provides evidence on the actual depth and breadth of the take-up of these skills within Australian training organisations and workplaces. The demand studied in this research is that expressed by the primary consumers of Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) services, students who engage in VET studies, this is known in the literature as social demand for education. VET students and teachers responded to two survey instruments that explored the sustainability values, behaviours, learning and teaching of Australian apprentices, trainees and their teachers. The {{results of this study}} show ‘a social demand’ <b>for</b> <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability. In summary, the results show that: 	Apprentices, trainees and their teachers cared a great deal about social, economic and environmental sustainability; 	Supply was closely aligned to social demand <b>for</b> <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability so that demand <b>for</b> <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability from VET students was almost entirely met; 	There are important differences in the teaching, learning and utilisation of <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability that are related to gender and age; and 	In-class learning of environmental skills has increased over time and now slightly outweighs learning of these skills at work, however community learning of these skills outweighs both. The findings suggest that: 	Further action is required to embed green skills into the VET system, especially in the areas of energy efficiency and supply chains; 	The VET system {{plays an important role in}} supporting community cohesion and economic literacy, especially for women; 	It is important that social sustainability is properly considered in analysis informing VET policy; and 	Gender differences in values and behaviours and gender and age differences in learning <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability have important implications for the design of future <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability programs. VET students and their teachers have unique insights into the supply of and demand <b>for</b> <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability, and this viewpoint can contribute, now and in the future, to the further development of <b>skills</b> <b>for</b> sustainability in Australia...|$|R
25|$|Equalising of {{the mask}} is an {{essential}} <b>skill</b> <b>for</b> any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need to pinch the nostrils closed {{as part of their}} equalisation technique, and this must be allowed for in the design {{of the mask}} skirt.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} 20 weeks after a {{cotton-top}} tamarin is born, {{it is not}} fully capable of producing the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like chirps, but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first 20 weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps. This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired <b>skill</b> <b>for</b> offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.|$|E

Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at Constantinople, Louis was fêted and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with Penthesilea, mythical queen of the Amazons, by the Greek historian Nicetas Choniates. He added that she gained the epithet chrysopous (golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. Louis and Eleanor stayed in the Philopation palace just outside the city walls.|$|E

25|$|Sami is {{regarded}} as one of the fastest bowlers in cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164km/ph (101.9mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty speed measurements on the speed meter. He also once bowled a ball that clocked in at 162.3km/ph (100.8mph) against India, which would be the 'fastest ball' in the history of cricket. But despite his speed, he has been in and out of the national side for several times.

25|$|The Lost Souls skill {{system is}} based on a value {{assigned}} to each of the character's attributes, such as strength, dexterity, and charisma. The higher their attribute in a given area, more specialization points are available to allocate for a certain <b>skill.</b> <b>For</b> example, higher dexterity allows the user to allocate more specialty points to the use of swords. The more specialty points that are allocated for a certain skill, the faster the skill can be learned and improved. It also increases the maximum skill level the player can have for that particular skill. The intention of this is to allow for 'heroic' levels of capability to be achievable without the risk of a situation arising where everyone becomes equally, superhumanly capable at everything, since the system limits and promotes development of different skills at different times.|$|E

25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and <b>skill</b> <b>for</b> educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E
25|$|Once all the {{preparations}} are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from {{as many as}} eight different skills: one normal <b>skill</b> <b>for</b> each item, and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces how many more times that item can be used, as Riviera employs a Fire Emblem-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain amount of times before it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.|$|E
