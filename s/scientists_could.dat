As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} using heavy water {{was that it}} was scarce, and <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> not readily acquire the {{quantities}} required by a reactor. At Columbia University in the United States, Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd attempted to use graphite as a moderator instead. This turned out to be possible, but the graphite had to be very pure, as impurities, particularly boron, tended to absorb neutrons. On 2 December 1942, Fermi's team initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1. For the Manhattan Project, this was a crucial step towards the manufacture of plutonium in a reactor for use in an atomic bomb, but much larger reactors were required for mass production.|$|E
5|$|The first small bones {{belonging}} to Balaur bondoc consisted of six {{elements of the}} front limbs. Named specimens FGGUB R. 1580–1585, these were discovered in 1997 in Romania by Dan Grigorescu, but the morphology of the arm was so unusual that <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> not correctly combine them, mistaking them for the remains of an oviraptorosaur. The first partial skeleton was discovered in September 2009 in Romania, approximately 2.5 kilometers north of Sebeș, along the Sebeș river in the Sebeș Formation dating from the early Maastrichtian, and was given the preliminary field number SbG/A-Sk1. Later it received the holotype inventory number EME VP.313. The discovery {{was made by the}} geologist and paleontologist Mátyás Vremir of the Transylvanian Museum Society of Cluj Napoca who sent them for analysis to Zoltán Csiki of the University of Bucharest. The findings were described on August 31, 2010, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The 1997 specimens indicate an individual about 45% longer than the holotype; they were also found in a younger stratum.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the first Sphecomyrma fossils, there were no fossil records of any ants from Cretaceous amber and the oldest social insects at the time extended back to the Eocene epoch; the earliest known ant at the time was described from a forewing found in the Claiborne Formation in Tennessee. The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non-social wasps together. Such a link may shed light on the early origins of ants, but no fossils of any social insect existed before S. freyi was discovered, thus the early evolution of ants remained a mystery. Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil {{has been the subject of}} possible significance to the evolution of aculeate wasps and ants. A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus, with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps, of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin of ants. However, there were several problems: as the fossil was only a single wing, <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata.|$|E

25|$|In 1885, the Swiss Édouard Naville {{started the}} first {{excavations}} {{in the area}} around Tell-el-Daba. Between 1941 and 1942, Labib Habachi, an Egyptian Egyptologist first forwarded the idea that the site could be identified with Avaris. Between 1966 and 1969 and since 1975, the site has been excavated by the Austrian Archaeological Institute. Using radar imaging technology, its <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> identify in 2010 the outline of the city including streets, houses, a port, and a side arm of the River Nile passing through the city.|$|E
25|$|Despite these advances, it was {{not until}} Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann {{performed}} more advanced autoradiography experiments in 1965 that <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized dosage compensation.|$|E
25|$|Boas's {{stance against}} spying {{took place in}} the context of his {{struggle}} to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication American Anthropologist). When the National Academy of Sciences established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> assist the United States government prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas's rival, W.H. Holmes (who had gotten the job of Director at the Field Museum for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes.|$|E

30|$|The Holst Centre was envisioning and anticipating new {{application}} areas where their technology platform could show its advantage.

From my interactions with Aeneas Fletterman (TNO) {{who was responsible for}} a project to visualize future applications from the R&D activities in the Holst Centre [27]. Also, movement in promise requirement cycles: as promises become more specific and trajectories crystalize private actors also commit to the outcome.|$|R
25|$|All of the Society's {{publications}} now had {{a substantial}} international circulation; in 1973, for example, just 11% of institutional subscriptions were from the UK; 50% were from the USA. Contributions, however, were still mostly from British authors: 69% of Royal Society authors were from the UK in 1974. A Publications Policy Committee suggested that more overseas <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> be encouraged to submit papers if the requirement to have papers communicated by Fellows was dropped. This did not happen until 1990. There was also a suggestion to create a ‘C' journal for molecular sciences to attract more authors in that area, but the idea never materialised. The conclusion in 1973 was a general appeal to encourage more British scientists (whether Fellows or not) to publish papers with the Society and {{to pass on the}} message to their overseas colleagues; by the early 2000s, the proportion of non-UK authors had risen to around a half; and by 2009 it had passed 70%.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 Leloir {{ended his}} exile and {{returned}} to Argentina to work under Houssay at the Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de la Fundación Campomar, which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron Jaime Campomar. Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During {{the final years of}} the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in yeast as well as the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver; together with J.

It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, <b>scientists</b> <b>could</b> not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells.
