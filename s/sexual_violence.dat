5|$|Jolie has fronted a {{campaign}} against <b>sexual</b> <b>violence</b> in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing <b>Sexual</b> <b>Violence</b> Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation. Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End <b>Sexual</b> <b>Violence</b> in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, {{which resulted in a}} protocol endorsed by 151 nations.|$|E

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of <b>sexual</b> <b>violence.</b> Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that <b>sexual</b> <b>violence</b> was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on <b>sexual</b> <b>violence,</b> I have never seen anything like that, where <b>sexual</b> <b>violence</b> broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to <b>sexual</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) {{entered into}} force on 1 July 2002. The Statute enumerates {{a broader range}} of <b>sexual</b> and <b>violence</b> crimes than any {{previous}} instrument of international criminal law. Feminist activists involved in the negotiations for Rome Statute hoped that the inclusion of these crimes in the ICC's "formal rules" would ensure that, unlike in previous international tribunals, <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes would not go unpunished in the ICC. Against that backdrop, this thesis analyses the ICC's emerging practice on prosecution <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes. It asks: Have these crimes been prosecuted effectively in cases before the Court? Whose experiences of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> has the ICC Prosecutor focused on? And how have <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes been understood? Guided by these research questions, the thesis presents a detailed study of all twenty cases that came before the ICC between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2014. This study is based primarily on original empirical research, namely an examination of court records, and interviews with informants in the Office of the Prosecutor and relevant NGOs. The study shows that the ICC Office of the Prosecutor's approach to prosecuting <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes has evolved over time. <b>Sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes have comprised an increasing proportion of all charges before the Court, and the Office of the Prosecutor has become increasingly effective at analysing and prosecuting these crimes. However, attitudes and practices that hindered the prosecution of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes in the past have also hindered the prosecution of these crimes in the ICC, and the new crime of "gender persecution" has received virtually no attention in cases before the Court. Applying a feminist institutionalist approach to analyse these findings, the thesis concludes that legacies from the past have interfered with the prosecution of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes in the ICC. Nonetheless, feminist actors inside and outside the Court have worked strategically, to ensure that the ICC is starting to realise its potential as a tool for ending impunity for <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>violence</b> crimes...|$|R

40|$|The lecture {{series that}} led to this paper, “Gender-Effects: How Women create Technology of Tomorrow”, has an {{explicit}} focus on women. However, in this article in keeping with a relational approach to gender, we focus on men and masculinities, seen within the context of and gender power relations, and the diverse interrelations of men and masculinities with information and communication technologies (ICTs). This includes addressing to some of the shortcomings of contemporary studies of men and masculinities that neglect ICTs; the different kinds of social relations of men and masculinities to ICTS, in work, organizations, and social change more generally; and the implications of ICTs for sexualities and <b>sexual</b> <b>violences,</b> ending with the current case of online revenge pornography. As such, we seek to bring two areas of scholarship, critical studies on men and masculinities (CSMM) and studies of ICTs, into closer dialogue. We begin with a brief overview of academic debates in studies on men and masculinities without ICTs, followed by an examination of some aspects of the relations of men, masculinities and ICTs, with a final short discussion of the case of ICTs, sexualities, <b>sexual</b> <b>violences</b> and revenge pornography...|$|R
