Large-scale diversification could cause extremely disorderly depreciation of the dollar.

40|$|From a {{situation}} {{as late as}} 2008, when they were largely unfashionable, special drawing rights (SDR s) have become the centre of attention in discussions about a reformed international monetary system. The G 20 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have backed a significant additional allocation of SDRs, and China and the United Nations have suggested that this should be followed up with more substantial reforms that diminish {{the role of the}} dollar and enhance that of the SDR. These proposals would incorporate a <b>substitution</b> <b>account</b> that allows holders of dollars to swap them into SDR s, but they see this as only one step towards establishing an SDR -based system.

The mutation in nucleotide 209, which changes codon 70 from GAT to GGT, was found by sequencing a genomic clone and sequencing selected regions of DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. McGuire et al. compared the entire coding sequences for usual and atypical cholinesterases, and found no other consistent base differences. They described a polymorphic site near the C terminus of the coded region, but neither allele at this locus segregated consistently with the atypical trait.

The international monetary system (IMS) has come out of the crisis relatively unscathed, but is vulnerable to large-scale attacks on major currencies.

Their derived amino acid sequences and that previously determined for the PIF protein completely explain the electrophoretic phenotypes of the acidic proline-rich proteins (PRPs) Pa, Db, and PIF. Thus, the Cys substitution near Arg 106 in the Pa protein sterically interferes with proteolytic cutting at Arg 106 and {{accounts for the}} single-banded phenotype. In contrast, the Db and PIF proteins are proteolytically cut at Arg 106 and show a double-banded phenotype.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} selection pressures on evolution of HIV- 1 pol in 51 patients after switching to a new antiretroviral combination reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor therapy. Evolution of the protease (PR) and RT reading frames were analysed separately. Pairwise evolutionary distances (ED) were calculated between sequences from baseline and week 8 and between baseline and week 48 of protocol therapy. ED were calculated for all substitutions and for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions separately. At week 8 when HIV RNA reduction (selection pressure) was high, significantly more divergence in pol in both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions was found in patients with substantial RNA reduction (strong responders). Separate analyses of PR and RT revealed significantly greater ED in the RT (under selection pressure) of strong compared with nonresponders, whereas divergence between PR genes (not under selection pressure) {{did not differ in}} those two groups. Such differential evolution indicates that PR and RT were genetically unlinked and suggests recombination. The rapid increase of ED over the first 8 weeks was followed by only a minimal further rise by week 48, suggesting that selection of preexisting quasispecies accounted for the early changes. A disproportionally high number of synonymous <b>substitutions</b> <b>accounted</b> for the observed divergence and indicated that such genetic changes may not be completely silent...|$|R
