5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice <b>Samuel</b> <b>Alito,</b> in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
5|$|Like Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas {{was not a}} Catholic at {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Roman Catholic seminary, but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court. Shortly thereafter, <b>Samuel</b> <b>Alito</b> became the fifth on the Court, and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Roman Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court.|$|E

50|$|Joseph Anthony Greenaway Jr. (born November 16, 1957) is a United States Circuit Judge {{who sits}} on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and {{previously}} sat on the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

50|$|Roberts {{has been}} {{compared}} and contrasted to other court members by commentators. Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast him with the Rehnquist court. Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when Bush v. Gore is compared to Roberts' vote for the ACA. Roberts' judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas'. He wishes more consensus from the Court. Roberts' voting pattern is most closely aligned to <b>Samuel</b> <b>Alito's.</b>|$|R

What people see in front of them at the State of the Union is that federal government. And I would like them to see the judges too, because federal judges are also a part of that government.|$|R
