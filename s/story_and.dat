5|$|Final Fantasy XIII was {{positively}} received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, {{the game was}} praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its <b>story</b> <b>and</b> it was criticized for its highly linear structure. XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its <b>story</b> <b>and</b> characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the <b>story</b> <b>and</b> characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E

5|$|In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character’s {{background}} <b>story</b> <b>and</b> goes {{to great}} lengths to soften her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and anthropomorphic animals rather than her characteristic horror stories.|$|E
5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one <b>story</b> <b>and</b> not the other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one <b>story</b> <b>and</b> not the other– or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.|$|E

5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all <b>story</b> <b>and</b> sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of <b>story</b> <b>and</b> sequel rights {{was perhaps the most}} onerous aspect to Pixar and {{set the stage for a}} contentious relationship.|$|E

After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on telling a traditional love <b>story</b> <b>and</b> gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. Within {{the month of}} its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with {{the greatest number of}} sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, <b>story</b> <b>and</b> monster designs of Silent Hill 2, but criticized the controls as being difficult to use although much improved over its predecessor. Since its release, the game has appeared on several critics' top lists for its <b>story</b> <b>and</b> use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics as well as its soundtrack/sound design. Because of the success of Silent Hill 2, a sequel titled Silent Hill 3 was released in 2003.|$|E
