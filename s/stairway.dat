5|$|Structure 13 {{is on the}} {{southwest}} side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double <b>stairway</b> ascending from Plaza 1. This double <b>stairway</b> gave access to the first level of the temple structure only; from there, a wide single <b>stairway</b> continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a low platform that supported a perishable superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in 2008 {{revealed}} {{that one of}} these mounds was a temple pyramid with a well-preserved central <b>stairway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic <b>Stairway</b> 1 {{was located}} {{on the front of}} StructureA-14. The <b>stairway</b> was {{installed}} by king Ucha'an K'in B'alam of Dos Pilas to record Seibal's status as a vassal after its defeat by that city. The stones are no longer in situ, having been removed to the area of the camp of the old archaeological project.|$|E
40|$|Pedestrian flow {{takes place}} in {{confined}} environment on <b>stairways</b> {{under the influence of}} composition, direction of movement, and schedule of trains. During peak-period, alighting and boarding rate is quite high resulting in very high pedestrian movement from one platform to the other to catch the next train at interchange stations. The transfer of passengers from railway platforms through common undivided <b>stairways</b> becomes difficult, uncomfortable, and unsafe at times when pedestrian flow reaches the capacity level. Understanding of criteria defining quality of flow that affect the effectiveness of facilities like <b>stairways</b> in handling the pedestrian traffic is vital for planning and designing of such facilities to ensure the desired level of service as well as safety in case of emergency. The present paper is based on the study of pedestrian movement on <b>stairways</b> at busy suburban rail transit interchange station at Dadar in Mumbai, India. Pedestrian movements are captured through videography at two <b>stairways</b> and the effect of bidirectional movement on average walking speed is analyzed. The ascending flow in small proportion is found to be more influential in causing speed reduction on undivided <b>stairways.</b> The outcome of the study is useful for capacity and level of service analysis while planning and designing the transit station <b>stairways...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{one of the}} two {{remaining}} <b>stairways</b> from the street to the station was replaced with a lift, leaving only one exit in case of fire. The station now again has 2 <b>stairways</b> in addition to a lift.|$|R
5|$|In April–May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{a previously}} unknown inscription on a <b>stairway</b> at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on {{what is known as}} Hieroglyphic <b>Stairway</b> 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.|$|E

5|$|Structure 7, at the {{southwest}} side of Plaza C, is a ballcourt of similar dimensions to Structure 8. It was the ballcourt of the Xahil clan {{and may have}} been the older of the two ballcourts. Each end of the ballcourt had a projecting <b>stairway</b> and there was an additional <b>stairway</b> to the southeast. A tennoned head sculpture recovered from Plaza C may originally have been a ballcourt marker from this ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|The next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, {{a son of}} K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil. The {{early period}} of his rulership fell within Copán's hiatus, but later on he began a {{programme}} of renewal {{in an effort to}} recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple26, with the Hieroglyphic <b>Stairway</b> being reinstalled on the new <b>stairway</b> and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the <b>stairway.</b> K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.|$|E

50|$|This station affords {{a view of}} the Hell Gate Bridge and viaduct to the north, Triborough Bridge to the west, and the Grand Central Parkway (Interstate 278) and Astoria Boulevard underneath. These three {{structures}} {{forced a}} change in the station. The overpass to the far north exit was an addition because of the Triborough Bridge’s construction in 1936. The parkway forced relocation of the north exit <b>stairways</b> since the parkway was too wide for the original <b>stairways.</b> The southern <b>stairways</b> are original. The mezzanine has separate turnstile banks from each side with crossunders from the platform stairs.|$|R

5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access <b>stairway</b> {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access <b>stairway</b> from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|Group B is {{near the}} centre of the site, roughly {{equidistant}} between Group A (to the northeast) and Group C (to the southwest). The main plaza of Group B was at the northern end of the group and was enclosed by the ballcourt on the south side, a double pyramid on the east side and three platforms. A <b>stairway</b> with 28 steps descends the Group B retaining wall behind the northeast corner of the double pyramid, providing an access route towards Group D. On {{the north side of the}} group another <b>stairway,</b> with 18 steps divided into two flights, descends towards Group A.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on <b>Stairway</b> 13, resulting in a crush. <b>Stairway</b> 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on <b>Stairway</b> 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on <b>Stairway</b> 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on <b>Stairway</b> 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back {{when they heard the}} roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E
5000|$|Thadingyut, {{the seventh}} {{month of the}} Myanmar calendar, {{is the end of}} the Buddhist lent or Vassa. Thadingyut festival lasts for three days: the day before the full moon day, the full moon day and the day after the full moon day. Buddha descends from heaven on the full moon day itself. Buddha’s mother, Maya, died seven days after the Buddha was born and then she was reborn in the Trayastrimsa Heaven. In order to pay back the {{gratitude}} to his mother, Buddha preached Abhidhamma to his mother for three Lenten months. When he was descending back to the mortal world, Sakra-devanam-indra, the ruler of the Trayastrimsa Heaven, ordered all the saints and evils to make three precious <b>stairways.</b> Those <b>stairways</b> were made of gold, silver and ruby. The Buddha took the middle one with the ruby. The Nats (Deva) came along by the right golden <b>stairways</b> and the Brahmas from the left silver <b>stairways.</b> Buddhists celebrate Thadingyut to welcome the Buddha and his disciples by enlightening and festooning the streets, houses and public buildings with colored electric bulbs or candles, which represent those three <b>stairways.</b>|$|R
