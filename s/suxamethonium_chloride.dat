40|$|In vitro muscle {{contracture}} {{responses in}} swine susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) {{were similar to}} those found in muscle from humans susceptible to this anaesthetic complication, confirming the suitability of the pig as an animal model for studying MH. The results suggest that there are different degrees of susceptibility to MH. Whichever drug was used, there was some overlap in the contracture responses between susceptible animals and controls, suggesting that the most accurate way of identifying susceptibility to MH is to use a variety of chemical agents, the best of which seem to be halothane, caffeine, <b>suxamethonium</b> and potassium <b>chloride.</b> Thymol, which is used as a preservative in commercial preparations of halothane, potentiates halothane contractures, but it is not known if this is significant clinically. Individuals who are susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) have an underlying disease of muscle. The most precise means of identifying susceptibility to MH is pharmacological testing in vitro on muscle from the individual in question. Several different pharmacological tests are used...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} muscle pain was assessed in 150 males who underwent bronchoscopy using thiopentone and <b>suxamethonium</b> iodide or <b>chloride</b> for anaesthesia. In 50 patients tubocurarine 3 - 5 mg, diplacin 10 - 15 mg or kvalidil 10 - 15 mg was injected intravenously after the induction dose of thiopentone. In a further group of 50 patients neostigmine 0. 5 - 0. 75 mg was injected intramuscularly 20 - 30 minutes after bronchoscopy. The remaining 50 patients were not given either of these treatments and formed a control group. Six patients developed pain when non-depolarizing relaxants had been used compared with 29 in the neostigmine group and 40 in the control group. Whilst muscle pains following the use of suxa-methonium are not dangerous, they add appreci-ably to the patient's postoperative discomfort.

50|$|Rocuronium bromide (brand names Zemuron, Esmeron) is an aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker or {{muscle relaxant}} used in modern {{anaesthesia}} to facilitate endotracheal intubation by providing skeletal muscle relaxation, most commonly required for surgery or mechanical ventilation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenously}} administered calcium chloride on partial neuromuscular block produced by {{small and large}} doses of suxamethonium, tubocurarine and gallamine have been studied in dogs. Calcium chloride brought about an improvement in twitch tension, and this depression lasted for 5 - 15 minutes. The possible mechanisms of the block produced by small doses of suxamethonium. In {{the presence of a}} complete phase II block produced by <b>suxamethonium,</b> however, calcium <b>chloride</b> depressed the twitch tension, and this depression lasted for 5 — 15 minutes. The possible mechanism of the varying effects of calcium on different types of neuromuscular block are discussed and it is suggested that the depression of twitch by calcium in the presence of desensitiza-tion block may be due to a "membrane stabilizing action". It is possible that this observation may prove useful clinically in differentiating desensitization block from other varieties of neuromuscular block. The importance of calcium in synaptic trans-mission, particularly in neuromuscular trans-mission, is well recognized (Locke, 1894; Feng, 1936; Harvey and Macintosh, 1940; del Castillo and Katz, 1954 a, b). An anti-curare effect of ionic calcium was reported by del Castillo and Stark (1952). It is also known that calcium effectively antagonizes the myoneural blocking action of an excess of magnesium (del Castillo and Engbaek, 1954) and the neuromuscular block resulting from administration of such antibiotics as streptomycin, neomycin and kanamycin (Brazil and Corrado...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{observations}} of genetic variation in drug response {{date from the}} 1950s, involving the muscle relaxant <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> and drugs metabolized by N-acetyltransferase. One in 3500 Caucasians has less efficient variant of the enzyme (butyrylcholinesterase) that metabolizes <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> As a consequence, the drug’s effect is prolonged, with slower recovery from surgical paralysis. Variation in the N-acetyltransferase gene divides people into [...] "slow acetylators" [...] and [...] "fast acetylators", with very different half-lives and blood concentrations of such important drugs as isoniazid (antituberculosis) and procainamide (antiarrhythmic). As part of the inborn system for clearing the body of xenobiotics, the cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) are heavily involved in drug metabolism, and genetic variations in CYPs affect large populations. One member of the CYP superfamily, CYP2D6, now has over 75 known allelic variations, some of which lead to no activity, and some to enhanced activity. An estimated 29% of people in parts of East Africa may have multiple copies of the gene, and will therefore not be adequately treated with standard doses of drugs such as the painkiller codeine (which is activated by the enzyme). The first study using Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) linked age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with a SNP located on chromosome 1 that increased one’s risk of AMD. AMD {{is the most common}} cause of blindness, affecting more than seven million Americans. Until this study in 2005, we only knew about the inflammation of the retinal tissue causing AMD, not the genes responsible.|$|E

5000|$|The {{heritage}} of mivacurium and indeed its very closely related cousin, doxacurium chloride, {{harks back to}} the synthesis of numerous compounds following structure-activity relationships that drove researchers to find the ideal replacement for succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Both mivacurium and doxacurium are descendants of early vigorous attempts to synthesize potent non-depolarizing agents with pharmacophores derived from cross-combinations of the non-depolarizing agent, laudexium, and the well-known depolarizing agent, succinylcholine (<b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride).</b> Ironically, laudexium itself was invented by a cross-combination between the prototypical non-depolarizing agent, d-tubocurarine and the depolarizing agent, decamethonium. From the 1950s through to the 1970s, the present-day concept of a neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid onset and an ultra-short duration of action had not taken root: researchers and clinicians {{were still on the}} quest for potent but non-depolarizing replacements devoid of the histamine release and the dreaded [...] "recurarizing" [...] effects seen with tubocurarine and, more importantly, the absence of a depolarizing mechanism of action as seen with succinylcholine and decamethonium.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aggressive {{surgical}} {{removal of}} the primary tumour is the preferred treatment, but with tumour progression, some tumours cannot be completely removed surgically. Anaesthetics are administered to facilitate surgery. However, anaesthetics act as a potential factor in tumour recurrence or metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal breast cells and cancer breast cells were treated with different doses of muscle-relaxant anaesthetics. The effects on breast cancer cell invasion, adhesion and migration of these anaesthetics were then investigated using in vitro models. RESULTS: With increasing dose of rocuronium bromide and <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> CRS, the number of MCF- 10 A and MCF- 7 cells, but not that of MDA-MB- 231 cells, decreased. There was almost {{no difference in the}} number of cells when the three cell lines were treated with different doses of vecuronium bromide. The study also demonstrated that rocuronium bromide promoted the invasion, adhesion and growth of MDA- 231 cells, while <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> CRS had no effect. Interestingly, vecuronium bromide did not affect the motility and invasion of breast cancer cells significantly. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the effect of anaesthetics and their impact on tumour metastasis is important, thus using an appropriate aesthetic strategy could improve long-term survival in some patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of severe muscle pain following Caesarean section in 130 patients in which suxamethonium was used was 15. 7 per cent. Gallamine 20 mg prior to induction did not reduce the {{incidence of}} pain but resulted in technical difficulty which reduced the safety and effectiveness of the anaesthetic technique. It was concluded that the incidence of pains was not high enough to justify discarding the anaesthetic technique described. The use of non-depolarizing relaxants prior to induction as a method of reducing the incidence of pains following suxamethonium should be avoided in obstetric anaesthesia. Muscle pains are known to follow the use of and oxygen mixture in a closed circuit with carbon <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (Churchill-Davidson, dioxide absorption. 1954). Following complaints from some patients Churchill-Davidson (1954) and others (Foster, undergoing the operation of Caesarean section it 1960; Burtles and Tunstall, 1961) have adminis-was decided to investigate the frequency with tered a small dose of a non-depolarizing relaxant which these pains occurred and to decide if the to some patients prior to the injection of suxa-frequency and severity were enough to warrant methonium in an attempt to {{reduce the incidence}} the avoidance of suxamethonium in this operation, of muscle pains.

40|$|Sir,—Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be performed}} within 1 min after the injection of <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> i. v. Suxamethonium, however, has unwanted side-effects and may cause serious com-plications. With reasonable doses of non-depolarizing neuromus-cular blocking drugs, suitable conditions for tracheal intubation cannot be achieved in less than 2 - 3 min. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} vecuronhim, intubating doses of these drugs may have unwanted side-effects. In exploring various possibilities to farilimr rapid tracheal intubation, it was envisaged that this may be accomplished by the administration of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker in divided doses. The first, a "priming " dote, administered to awake patients should be large enough to cause moderate inhibi-tion of neuromuscular transmission, indirflt'Tig greater than 75 % occupancy of the endplate receptors (Paton and Waud, 1967), but small enough not to cause any unpleasant symptoms. The second, larger, "intubating " dose administered after the induction of anaesthesia would then rapidly increase receptor occupancy to 90 %, necessary for profound neuromuscular blockade (Paton and Waud, 1967). Subsequently it was established with vecuronium that the "priming " dose should be 15 - 20 % and the "intubating " dose 50 - 60 % of the customary dose (lOOugkg- 1) used to facilitate tracheal intubation and that the optimal time interval between the two doses should be 6 - 8 min.

40|$|Contractures {{induced by}} halothane, caffeine, <b>suxamethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and {{potassium}} chloride in malignant hyperpyrexia-susceptible (MHS) and control swine skeletal muscle preparations were temperature-dependent, but differed in their temperature response profiles. Increasing the temperatures from 20 °C to 37 °C increased drug-induced contractures in MHS muscle. At 5 °C drug-induced contractures were not inhibited by dantrolene sodium, deuterium oxide or glycerinanon in either MHS or control muscle. These observations give further {{support to the}} view that the abnormality in MHS skeletal muscle is associated with the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling. Malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) occurs in individuals who have an underlying disease of muscle (Denborough, 1980). A similar condition has been described in certain breeds of swine, including Landrace, Pietrain and Poland China breeds (Campion and Topel, 1975). In vitro studies on susceptible human (Moulds and Denborough, 1974) and swine skeletal muscle (Okumura, Crocker and Denborough, 1979) have shown that when MHS muscle is exposed to certain anaesthetic agents a contracture of the muscle occurs. This reflects the high myoplasmic calcium concentrations produced by the pre-cipitating agents, but the precise nature of the skeletal muscle abnormality remains to be identified. The initial report of enhanced contractures to caffeine in MHS human muscle was an important development in the pharmacological identification of the skeletal muscle abnormality (Kalow et al., 1970). Although halothane contractures were not observed in this investigation, later studies showed spontaneous contractures on exposure of MHS muscle to halothane (Ellis et al., 1972; Moulds and Denborough, 1972). This discrepancy was subsequently explained when halothane-induced contractures in MHS muscle were found to be temperature-dependent (Nelson, Bedell and Jones, 1975).

The infusion was discontinued either {{when there was}} no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded. Six additional patients received a 30 -mg i. v. bolus dose. Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score. The times to first fasciculation, twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates. Fasciculations in the six areas and the total fasciculation score were related directly to the rate of infusion. Total fasciculation scores in the 30 -mg bolus group and the 5 -mg s~l and 20 -mg s" 1 infusion groups were not significantly different. Muscle fasciculations are commonly observed as the earliest clinical sign of the onset of neuromuscular blockade following a bolus i. v. dose of suxametho-nium (Sch). Fasciculations are observed less con-sistently following the administration of Sch by slow i. v. infusion, i. m. injection or after pretreatment with a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant drug. This investigation was designed to study systematically the temporal and quantitative relationships between the rate of i. v. infusion of Sch muscle, fasciculations and the onset of neuromuscular blockade.
