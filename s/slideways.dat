5000|$|With the {{development}} of the horizontal stationary engine in the mid 19th century, the requirements were no longer to support a single heavy beam but now to provide accurate alignment between the cylinders and crankshaft of a medium-speed engine. These foundations were substantial, going down perhaps three-dozen courses of brickwork below the engine bed. Deep iron anchors were provided within the brickwork for the engine to be bolted down. Rough local stone was no longer rigid enough and so foundations were constructed of many layers of hard engineering brick, as this was cheaper and more easily available than a cut ashlar stone of equal rigidity. As these engine ran at faster speeds than the beam engines, their vibration could also be higher requiring a foundation that could withstand such. Alignment between <b>slideways</b> and crankshaft depended upon the original care with which the foundation had been built.|$|E
40|$|Coolants {{are widely}} used in {{industries}} for metal cutting operations. Though there are varieties of coolants available, {{the most widely used}} are water-soluble coolants because of their low cost and better heat dissipation compared to straight cutting oils. In the present investigation, amongst the various causes, which deteriorate the coolant, the role of hardness of water is primarily studied. Accordingly, water from different sources with varying hardness is considered and coolants are prepared from the same. The extent to which hardness can affect the performance of coolants is studied as a function of coolant lubricity in a reciprocating tribometer. Further, the effect of entry of coolants into lubricated machine tool <b>slideways</b> is also assessed by evaluating the mixture of coolant and lubricating oil for its frictional behavior. This is important from assessing the impact of the mixing of coolant and lubricating oil on machine tool <b>slideways</b> with regard to positioning exactness and stick slip behavior of <b>slideways</b> in terms of coolant-lube compatibility...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} surface texture on the {{tribological}} properties of <b>slideways</b> were investi-gated experimentally. The authors designed an experimental apparatus for evaluating textured surfaces using specimens of a practical size (82 mm × 82 mm) considering the <b>slideways</b> used for machine tools which {{are one of}} the application fields for their research. The evaluated textures were dimple and groove textures, and their diameters and widths varied from 50 µm to 1 mm. The textures were processed by sandblasting as {{it is one of the}} alternative methods applied in industry. For comparison with the conventional textures, scraped surfaces were also evaluated. The friction coefficient and the film thickness were measured under the conditions of plane con-tact, and lubricating with the oil to clarify the effects of the textured pattern. The experimental results showed that the friction coefficient of the textured surfaces was smaller than that of the flat surfaces in the mixed lubrication regime. Regarding the mechanisms of friction reduction by texture types, the authors think that the dimples played the role of oil reservoir, and the parallel grooves prevented side leakage of the lubricating oil...|$|E

A typical configuration for a superprecision instrument slideway using PTFE pads and a Zerodur counterface is shown to exhibit around 200 -nm sliding hysteresis. Moreover, this value is strongly dependent on the total load on the bearing system. The pattern of dependence is consistent with an established model of contact under oblique forces, although the materials conditions at the interface are much more complex than those assumed in that model. Full isolation of these properties is not possible with the present experiments, but they indicate that die shear modulus of the interface layer is more than ten times greater than that of bulk polymer.

This {{abstract}} {{presents the}} development of an ultra-precision motion controlled positioning stage for nanometer positioning over a working volume of 50 mm × 50 mm × 4 µm at an accuracy of better than 10 nm that is traceable to the national standards. The positioning stage is designed to use various probing systems to perform “pick and place ” manipulations and scanning of large specimens, including biological. The system is comprised of a two-axis, long-range stage and a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) short-range stage. The long-range stage is responsible for coarse motions of up to 50 mm, while the short-range stage is responsible for correcting positioning errors generated by the long-range stage to achieve nanometer level accuracies. The system will be housed in a vacuum chamber operating at a vacuum pressure of better than 10 - 3 Torr. The vacuum chamber is also designed to act as an environmental chamber where different gases can be used depending on the measurement task. The initial results of the fully developed positioning stage will be presented at the conference.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} uncertainty evaluation for axi-symmetric measurement machines which is compliant with GUM and PUMA methodologies. Specialized measuring machines for the inspection of axisymmetric components enable the measurement of properties such as roundness (radial runout), axial runout and coning. These machines typically consist of a rotary table {{and a number of}} contact measurement probes located on <b>slideways.</b> Sources of uncertainty include the probe calibration process, probe repeatability, probe alignment, geometric errors in the rotary table, the dimensional stability of the structure holding the probes and form errors in the reference hemisphere which is used to calibrate the system. The generic method is described and an evaluation of an industrial machine is described as a worked example. Type A uncertainties were obtained from a repeatability study of the probe calibration process, a repeatability study of the actual measurement process, a system stability test and an elastic deformation test. Type B uncertainties were obtained from calibration certificates and estimates. Expanded uncertainties, at 95 % confidence, were then calculated for the measurement of; radial runout (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 7 µm with a lever probe); axial runout (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 5 µm with a lever probe); and coning/swash (0. 44 arc seconds with a plunger probe or 0. 60 arc seconds with a lever probe) ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{was carried out in}} the School of Engineering Science, University of Warwick, between October 1984 and October 1987. Chapter 1 contains a review of recent developments in instrumentation that require both manipulation and measurement over the range 0. 1 - 100 nm. The instruments considered are the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM), Stylus techniques, X-ray interferometry and x-ray microscopy. The rest of the thesis presents the design and assessment of a novel STM incorporating an X-ray interferometer, an ultra-high precision stylus measuring instrument and an x-ray microscope two axis specimen translation stage. Chapters 2 and 3 present an assessment of different mechanisms for the production of rectilinear motions having parasitic errors of better than mm. Theoretical and experimental investigations into monolithic parallel spring systems based on a notch type hinge and long range <b>slideways</b> based on a polymeric bearing sliding on a polished glass prism are presented. Optimisation of a soleniod magnet force transducer is presented as a drive technique for the former device, whilst a mechanically non-influencing feedscrew drive is described for the latter system. A stylus based measuring instrument, called "Nanosurf 2 ", that incorporates the polymeric slideway is presented in chapter 4. The performance of this system has been assessed and the results are presented in the following chapter. The linearity and accuracy of an electromagnetically driven, single crystal silicon, monolithic spring make it a suitable for use as the translation mechanism in a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope. Consequently, a three-axis spring has been constructed to generate the translations required for imaging. An X-ray interferometer is built into the probe axis to facilitate absolute calibration. This work is preceeded by an investigation into the generation of complex shapes in this brittle material. Finally, the current status of this work is reported with the presentation of initial experimental results...|$|E
30|$|Scenario 1 {{consists}} of the basic coolant obtained from a lathe machine after 6 months of usage. Scenario 2 {{consists of}} the basic coolant mixed with 10 % of tramp oil. The amount of tramp oil in the effluent waste {{was found to be}} between 1 % and 16 % [18]. Tramp oil originates as lubrication oil seeping out from the <b>slideways</b> and washing into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which the steel supplier coats the bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases, it {{can be seen as a}} film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating specks of oil. A tramp oil level above 2 % could cause health issues due to emulsification [18]. Scenario 3 {{consists of the}} basic coolant mixed with 10 % oil and around 10 g of ferrous material chips in near-powdered form [19]. Generally the effluent waste from a grinding machine includes minute particles of iron and worn-out or burnt-out abrasives from the wheel, which are difficult to segregate from the used coolant. The complexity of the fluid is compounded by contamination from a combination of substances from the manufacturing process, such as tramp oils, hydraulic fluids, and particulate matter from the machining operations [19]. Scenario 4 consists of 10 % sludge mixed with the basic coolant. Sludge is a heavy residue that lies at the bottom of the sump or in a drum where the used coolants are stored before disposal. Microorganisms such as bacteria tend to multiply and grow in the sludge that is present in the effluent waste. Scenario 5 consists of the basic coolant mixed with 10 % sludge and 2 % solvent. Solvents are used to clean and degrease the finished goods and even certain machine parts after the machining operation. The effluents, in combination with oil and grease, can form a toxic substance for the aquatic organisms [8].|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of a machine}} tool is the limiting factor in the {{accuracy of}} finished parts. Errors in the machine tool motion produce a one-to-one error correspondence in the final workpiece. These errors in motion are caused by geometric errors of the structural elements and by thermally-induced errors caused by the machining process itself. It is impossible to completely eliminate errors by design and/or manufacturing modifications. Even a small geometric error of one machine element will be amplified at the cutting tool by the long travel ranges of the slides and the tool offsets. Mechanical design cannot eliminate thermally-induced errors because of continuous heat generation by drive motors, friction in <b>slideways,</b> spindle and leadscrew bearings and the cutting tool-workpiece interface. ^ Rather than attempting to eliminate errors, this study provides a methodology for predicting errors and compensating for them in real-time, thus improving the accuracy of machined workpieces. A general mathematical model is developed, determining the total error at the cutting tool tip contributed by the errors of each machine elements and their thermally-induced variations. Homogeneous coordinate transformations for each element of the machine tool are employed. In order to predict each error component, a methodology for the machine tool error calibration is determined. A flexible and modular software compensation system is developed based on the models created in the methodology. The compensation system predicts the errors of the machine tool {{using a combination of}} data taken from various sensors on the machine tool and established error relationships. ^ Finally, the methodology is implemented on a two-axis turning center. The predictions for geometric and thermally-induced errors for this machine are generated using least squares curve fitting techniques on the error data. A single-board microprocessor-based system translates errors into servo counts, which are injected into the machine tool controller in real-time. ^ To demonstrate the validity of the model and methodology, cutting tests were performed under transient thermal conditions on a computerized numerical control (CNC) turning center. Accuracy enhancements of up to 20 times were obtained. ...|$|E
