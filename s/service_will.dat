5|$|Waterspouts {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft, aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports.

5|$|The first WMATA budget which {{contained}} funds for operating the Green Line was proposed in December 1989. The budget presumed a December 1, 1990, opening for the Mt. Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations, and requested funds {{to test the}} soon-to-open Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station. The budget also projected that the Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to the Anacostia Station would open in 1991, and that new Metrobus <b>service</b> <b>will</b> be added in Prince George's County to bring commuters to the new station.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the opening}} of Phase 1, {{ridership}} on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016. The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 {{by the end of}} January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening. By May 15, Second Avenue ridership had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue ridership in January. Because of the increasing demand, Q <b>service</b> <b>will</b> be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one uptown trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip will return southbound in the evening in Q service.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or <b>service</b> <b>will</b> increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO beginning with season 46, which premiered on January 16, 2016. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix; on August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; the <b>service</b> <b>will</b> remain in operation, likely with its offerings reduced to a slate content available for free or serving as a portal for Sesame Streets website. The deal came in the wake of cutbacks that had affected the series in recent years, the changing viewer habits of American children in the previous ten years, and Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been committed to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T <b>service</b> <b>will</b> operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in <b>service</b> <b>will</b> decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E

5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local <b>service</b> <b>will</b> continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E
