25|$|In January 2012, David Kenny {{took over}} as chief {{executive}} officer of The Weather Channel, replacing former AOL executive Mike Kelly, who had been appointed as the company's CEO in the summer of 2009. Although all operations, <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> and marketing and the bulk of employees are located in the headquarters in Atlanta, Kenny declined to move there, and continues to live and work from his home in Boston, visiting Atlanta once or twice per quarter. This is counter to general company policy which discourages telecommuting for the majority of employees. Later in 2012, The Weather Channel's holding company changed its name from The Weather Channel Companies to The Weather Company. The company also purchased competing weather service and website Weather Underground the same year. On March 10, 2015 Verizon FiOS dropped The Weather Channel and WeatherScan for their rival, AccuWeather.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Global Insights {{research}} found that modern retailers such as Walmart create jobs directly, indirectly and by induced effects. In Dallas-Fort Worth {{area of the}} United States, {{with a population of}} about 2 million people, Global Insights found that Walmart alone had helped create about 6,300 new net jobs with an average salary of over $21,000 each. For India's urban population of over 400 million, an average salary of less than $2,100 per year, this scales to over 12 million new jobs. Other multi-brand retailers, such as Mitsukoshi of Japan, employ a much higher number of <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> employee per store, than Walmart, to suit local consumer culture. The Global Insights study also found that the modern retail such as Walmart were a key contributor in creating new net jobs and maintaining low consumer price inflation rates from 1985 to 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Customer {{service is}} the [...] "sum of acts and {{elements}} that allow consumers to receive {{what they need}} or desire from [...] retail establishment." [...] It is important for a sales associate to greet the customer and make himself available to help the customer find whatever he needs. Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service {{in the case of}} vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and specialty stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.|$|E

2500|$|Privishing (private {{publishing}}) [...] is {{a modern}} term for publishing a book in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the public. The book, while nominally published, {{is almost impossible to}} obtain through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be special-ordered and will have a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusals to reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as [...] "killed". Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute breach of contract, censorship, or good business practice (e.g., not printing more books than the publisher believes will sell in a reasonable length of time).|$|E
2500|$|According to {{aerospace}} publication Flying Magazine, {{while the}} TBM 700 had rapidly proved popular {{on the market}} and a good aircraft on its own merits, the services and support facilities SOCATA provided for the aircraft were an initial point of weakness. Early on, customers were often faced with lengthy delays in acquiring spare parts and other services; negative feedback on the after <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> for the TBM 700 has been attributed as the cause of a downturn in sales during the 1990s. SOCATA, recognising the critical importance of an effective support infrastructure, decided to invest heavily in improving worldwide support for the type; instead of being solely reliant upon third parties and partnership arrangements with other companies, the firm developed their own facilities. SOCATA opened its own service center in Florida, as well as establishing a network of distributors capable of both sales and services for the TBM 700. Consequently, during the late 1990s, sales of the type within the North American market rose dramatically.|$|E
