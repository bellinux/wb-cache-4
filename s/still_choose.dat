5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{students}} are enrolled into their respective faculties, they may <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> a lecture from another faculty. The lectures are divided into three categories, A (obligatory), which a student of a given field has to pass; B (facultatory), certain number of which a student has to pass in order to collect enough ECTS-credits; and C (facultatory) which a student may choose to appeal his interest in a different field. Therefore it is possible, for example, for a Law Faculty graduate to have strong knowledge of Biochemistry, if he decides for the C lectures of Faculty of Science.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{has one of}} {{the lowest}} rate of female {{employment}} in all of Latin America, but women's workforce participation has steadily increased over the years. As of 2014, the employment rate of women was 51.7%. Despite the fact that 47.5% of students in college are women, many <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to be homemakers rather than join the workforce. A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on female labor force participation. The low number of women entering the labor force causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training. In Chile, poorer women make up a smaller share of the workforce. A 2004 study showed that 81.4 percent of women worked in the service sector.|$|E
25|$|Arrow's death-of-a-candidate example (1963, page 26) {{suggests}} that the agenda (the set of feasible alternatives) shrinks from, say, X = {a, b, c} to S = {a, b} because {{of the death of}} candidate c. This example is misleading since it can give the reader an impression that IIA is a condition involving two agenda and one profile. The fact is that IIA involves just one agendum ({x, y} in case of pairwise independence) but two profiles. If the condition is applied to this confusing example, it requires this: Suppose an aggregation rule satisfying IIA chooses b from the agenda {a, b} when the profile is given by (cab, cba), that is, individual 1 prefers c to a to b, 2 prefers c to b to a. Then, it must <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> b from {a, b} if the profile were, say: (abc, bac); (acb, bca); (acb, cba); or (abc, cba).|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} Georgia Arch {{which sits}} on the edge of North campus was installed in 1864. It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the University. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a diploma from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to graduation commencement were to said to never graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from Boston, Georgia and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn's professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.|$|E
25|$|The Gold Coast 600 was {{introduced}} in 2009 after the American IndyCar Series elected not {{to return to the}} Surfers Paradise circuit that year. The A1 Grand Prix series was scheduled to fill the void left by IndyCar, however the owners of the series went into liquidation in June 2009 and, as a result, the A1 Grand Prix cars were withdrawn from the event. In order to compensate for this, Supercars introduced a new four-race format, with two 150km races held on each day. In 2010 the format changed to include two 300km races and it became a two-driver event. To restore the event's previous international flavour, each team was required to have at least one co-driver with an 'international reputation' (that is, they were recognised for exploits in motorsport outside of Australia). In 2011 and 2012, all entries required an international co-driver. In 2013 the international co-driver rule was dropped, due to a number of incidents during the 2012 event and the formation of the Endurance Cup, but teams could <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to employ an international driver for the endurance races.|$|E
25|$|Many tattoos {{serve as}} rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of {{religious}} and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.|$|E

500|$|When silver {{prices rose}} {{relative}} to gold {{as a reaction}} to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) Andrew Johnson, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the Act of 1853 lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to have silver struck into dollar coins, but since there was more than a dollar's worth of silver in a dollar coin, it was more profitable to sell the bullion to manufacturers and jewelers. [...] So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the gold standard.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, it was {{announced}} that open auditions would be held for three new roles to be introduced in Glee second season. They were open to amateurs and professionals aged sixteen to twenty-six, and were intended to be the subject of a multi-part television special, set to air in the lead-in to the second-season premiere in fall 2010, with the new cast members revealed in the first episode. Murphy commented: [...] "Anybody and everybody now has a chance to be on a show about talented underdogs. We want to be the first interactive musical comedy on television." [...] On June 22, 2010, Josef Adalian of New York magazine revealed that the reality show would not go ahead, due to Murphy's desire to concentrate on the main series, and fear that the distraction of the reality show may damage Glee. Adalian reported that the production team would <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> several winners from the entrants and invite them to appear on Glee for at least one episode. In June 2010, it {{was announced}} that Oxygen would host a reality series set to air in June 2011, featuring performers competing for a spot on Glee. The Glee Project started airing on June 12, 2011, and the final episode was broadcast on August 21, 2011.

2500|$|In Argentina, {{normally}} {{only one}} family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries.

Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their birth family names instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some <b>still</b> <b>choose</b> to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining [...] "de" [...] and her husband's surname to her own name.

He also said he would put industry on a war footing tomorrow as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: [...] "He says he would mobilise tomorrow.
