5|$|Pernick and Wilder {{highlight}} eight major {{clean technology}} sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the <b>smart</b> <b>grid,</b> mobile applications, and water filtration. Six major forces, which {{they call the}} six C’s, are pushing clean technology into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and <b>smart</b> <b>grid</b> technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} challenges part of {{the shift}} of paradigm {{taking place in the}} way we produce, transmit and use power related to what is known as <b>smart</b> <b>grids.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore present initiatives to establish <b>smart</b> <b>grids</b> as a sustainable and reliable power supply system. We argue that <b>smart</b> <b>grids</b> are not isolated to abstract conceptual models alone. We suggest that establishing sustainable and reliable <b>smart</b> <b>grids</b> depend on series of contributions including modeling and simulation projects, technological infrastructure pilots, systemic methods and training, and not least how these and other elements must interact to add reality to the conceptual models.
