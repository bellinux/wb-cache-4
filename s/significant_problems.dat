According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England. Jaywick has <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> {{estimating the}} number of riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, {{referred}} to as the Brezhnev Era, covers the period of Leonid Brezhnev's rule of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This period began with high economic growth and soaring prosperity, but gradually <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> in social, political, and economic areas accumulated, so that the period is often described as the Era of Stagnation.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas. Other <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> include overcapacity; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years, prompted by the growth of low-cost carrier passengers, has put intense stress on the aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team also had <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> with {{the scenes in}} the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the {{production team}} used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the purpose that the audience would not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|Although the Coffins {{had little}} money, their life with Alice's upper-class {{relatives}} gave Marian an almost aristocratic upbringing that {{introduced her to}} high society on the East Coast and enabled her to make social connections that were to be extremely valuable in later life. However, she received almost no formal education, a deficiency that caused <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> for her in her college years. She was instead tutored at home, where she also enjoyed the benefits of exposure to fine art and music and became an accomplished horse rider.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E

5|$|Post-flight {{inspection}} of the thermal protection system tiles found seven major debris impacts and forty-nine minor impacts, of which three and twenty-six respectively were on the orbiter's underside. This was the lowest incidence of major tile damage until at least STS-74, and compares very favorably with the program average of twenty-three major impacts to the underside. It was the first Shuttle flight with no <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> reported for the thermal protection system. Three windows {{were removed from the}} orbiter due to pitting and hazing.|$|E
5|$|Street {{crime was}} {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became <b>significant</b> <b>problems.</b> Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> with the casemate guns early on, however. They were {{equipped}} with hinged plates {{that were designed}} to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although <b>significant</b> <b>problems,</b> fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|The F-111 program {{experienced}} <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> {{during the}} late 1960s. As a result of delays {{to the development of}} the RF-111 reconnaissance variant of the F-111, of which Australia had ordered four, the RAAF considered purchasing eight RF-4C or RF-4E reconnaissance aircraft and two tankers in early 1968. The Air Force and government eventually concluded that it was too early to make a decision on this matter, and no action was taken. The RAAF accepted all 24 F-111Cs at a ceremony held at Fort Worth, Texas, on 4September 1968. At this time the F-111 program was in crisis owing to technical problems with the design of the aircraft's wing assembly, and all F-111s were grounded after an American F-111 crashed on 23September. Subsequent testing revealed further problems with F-111 components not meeting their intended lifespan, and the Australian aircraft were placed in storage at Fort Worth until these flaws could be rectified. The RAAF subsequently evaluated the F-4E PhantomII, Blackburn Buccaneer, LTV A-7 Corsair II and Grumman A-6 Intruder as possible replacements for the F-111. Only the F-4E was considered to come close to meeting the RAAF's requirements, though its relatively short range and lack of terrain-following radar and electronic countermeasures were considered problematic.|$|E

5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E
5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} {{soundness}} of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under contract by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} aerodynamics testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed <b>significant</b> <b>problems</b> with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E
