50|$|Let {{one study}} {{with the help of}} {{circular}} flow of income how flow of goods and services between households and firms is balanced by flow of factor payments made in exchange of them. Consider the circular flow of income in a two-sector economy where there is no government, no capital market, and no foreign <b>sector.</b> <b>Households</b> own all the factors of production: land, labor, capital. These factors of production are sold to the firms to produce goods and services through factor markets. Firms make use of these resources and provide goods and services to the household through product markets. However the exchange of goods and services and factors of production takes place {{with the help of the}} financial flows that move in the reverse direction. As the households purchase goods and services from firms it is their consumption expenditure which in turn becomes income or profits for the firms. On the other hand, when firms buy factors of production from the households they pay factor payments in the form of wages, rent, interest.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{proposed}} solutions to solving issues {{within the realm of}} maternal health care is the inclusion of membership in community-based health insurance plans (CBHI). CHBI schemes are voluntary, non-profit health insurance schemes organized and managed at the community level. In developing nations, CBHI plans are seen as a mechanism to meet health-financing needs of rural informal <b>sector</b> <b>households.</b> CHBI has been incorporated into the national health financing strategy in Senegal. CBHI increases facility-based maternal health services by reducing direct payments, thus facilitating timely use of healthcare. It is beneficial in guarding households against unpredictable and potentially catastrophic medical fees associated with pregnancy-related complications. It can also increase women’s interaction with the formal health care sector through its coverage of non-maternal health services. The most important element is the inclusion of maternal health care in any CBHI benefits package, which makes the most significant difference. CBHI plans can increase the demand for and quality of maternal care though requiring certain standards in contracts with health facilities. However, membership in a CBHI scheme is not always sufficient in influencing maternal health behaviors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> finds itself in a net lending or net borrowing situation and to analyse the situation. Research was done against the background of the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As suggested by the 1993 SNA, the net lending situation of the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> was calculated in the capital account of the <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> It became clear that the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector’s</b> saving is in excess of its capital formation, although both components indicated a slight declining trend over the past almost thirty years. Current economic literature was used in focusing on <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving and capital formation definitions, categories, motivations and determinants. International situations with regards to saving and capital formation were also compared with that of South Africa, putting the South African situation into perspective. An econometric analysis of net household saving in South Africa for the period 1991 to 2002 indicated five factors that significantly influenced <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving over the period. The five factors comprise the income from property, the twelve-month fixed deposit rate, current taxes on income and wealth, compensation of employees and total private consumption expenditure. Making use of further data sets, it became clear that the South African government <b>sector</b> uses the <b>household</b> <b>sector’s</b> excess saving to finance increased current expenditure and does not channel these excess funds towards increased capital formation that would be beneficial for long-term economic growth. This study therefore suggested that the South African <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> should be encouraged to act entrepreneurial, which will lead to increased levels of capital formation, that will in turn contribute to long-term growth, and that can be financed by the current excess saving levels of the <b>household</b> <b>sector.</b> Increased capital formation will lead to increases in productivity and income. This will then enable the <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> to raise its level of saving, that again can be used to finance increased levels of capital formation. The five factors that tested significantly influencing <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving in South Africa, were linked to possible policy as well as other initiatives aimed at encouraging <b>household</b> <b>sector</b> saving and capital formation in South Africa. This study concluded by briefly discussing three initiatives currently encouraging and promoting the importance of saving in South Africa. Prof. A. E. Loot...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} money, whose value depends on {{the functioning of the}} intermediary <b>sector.</b> <b>Households</b> receive productive opportunities, which they can finance by receiving credit from intermediaries or by saving through outside money or deposits with the intermediaries (inside money). Intermediation involves risk-taking, and intermediaries ’ ability to lend is compromised when they suffer losses. In busts, credit and inside money shrink, and the value of outside money increases, causing deflation that hurts borrowers. The money multiplier is determined endogenously. By reducing interest rates in busts, the monetary authority increases the value of longterm bonds, recapitalizing the intermediary sector and satisfying household demand for savings. While this policy helps the economy ex-post, ex-ante it may lead to excessive risk-taking by the intermediary sector. ...|$|E
