She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former Marine Force Recon. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his merchant seaman union dues are in arrears he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper (Willie C. Carpenter) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.|$|E
500|$|As in {{all other}} episodes of The X-Files at that point, the casting process took eight days. Megan Leitch, the woman who portrayed Samantha Mulder, did {{according}} to Frank Spotnitz a [...] "phenomenal job". Leitch returned to The X-Files {{over the years to}} portray Samantha or one of her many clones. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> lines, which she felt were [...] "very hard" [...] and [...] "specific." [...] Actor Darren McGavin, star of , was originally sought {{to play the role of}} Bill Mulder, but was unable due to his work schedule. The role was ultimately played by Peter Donat.|$|E
500|$|Carter later {{explained}} that humorous episodes {{were important to}} the show, especially during the [...] "pitch-black" [...] ninth season. He reasoned [...] "there are the downbeats, and then you need the relief in the tension." [...] The name Vicki Burdick came from {{a high school student}} Chris Carter knew. Carter felt that he needed to kill the character [...] "all out of fondness." [...] Before casting Ellen Greene, Carter had first spotted her on the movie, The Little Shop of Horrors both in [...] "New York and Los Angeles." [...] The first scene shot for Greene's character took a [...] "long day". Carter called her a [...] "trouper" [...] and said she was open to the direction he gave her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> information to remember, which made the scene even more difficult. The set for that scene was created by Tim Stepeck who was the set decorator during the ninth season. Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, [...] "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary. Like physics united theory, all of that." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2004 interview, Simpson {{said that}} when she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

6000|$|As for the repertory, {{the young}} man went on, the most {{beautiful}} girl {{in the world could}} give but what she had. He explained, after their visitor sat down again, that the noise made by Miss Rooth was not exactly what this admirer appeared to suppose. Sherringham had seen the house the night before and would recognise that, though good, it was very far from great. She had done very well, it was all right, but she had never gone above a point which Dashwood expressed in pounds sterling, to the edification of his companion, who vaguely thought the figure high. Peter remembered that he had been unable to get a stall, but Dashwood insisted that [...] "Miriam" [...] had not leaped into commanding fame: that was a thing that never happened in fact--it happened only in grotesque works of fiction. She had attracted notice, unusual notice for a woman whose name, the day before, had never been heard of: she was recognised as having, for a novice, extraordinary cleverness and confidence--in addition to her looks, of course, which were the thing that had really fetched the crowd. But she hadn't been the talk of London; she had only been the talk of Gabriel Nash. He wasn't London, more was the pity. He knew the esthetic people--the worldly, semi-smart ones, not the frumpy, sickly lot who wore dirty drapery; and the esthetic people had run after her. Mr. Dashwood sketchily instructed the pilgrim from Paris as to the different sects in the great religion of beauty, and was able to give him the particular [...] "note" [...] of the critical clique to which Miriam had begun so quickly to owe it that she had a vogue. The information made our friend feel very ignorant of the world, very uninitiated and buried in his little professional hole. Dashwood warned him {{that it would be a}} long time before the general public would wake up to Miss Rooth, even after she had waked up to herself; she would have to do some really big thing first. They knew it was in her, the big thing--Peter and he and even poor Nash--because they had seen her as no one else had; but London never took any one on trust--it had to be cash down. It would take their young lady two or three years to pay out her cash and get her equivalent. But of course the equivalent would be simply a gold-mine. Within its limits, however, certainly, the mark she had made was already quite a fairy-tale: there was magic in the way she had concealed from the first her want of experience. She absolutely made you think <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it, more than any one else. Mr. Dashwood repeated several times that she was a cool hand--a deucedly cool hand, and that he watched her himself, saw ideas come to her, saw her have different notions, and more or less put them to the test, on different nights. She was always alive--she liked it herself. She gave him ideas, long as he had been on the stage. Naturally she had a great deal to learn, no end even of quite basic things; a cosmopolite like Sherringham would understand that a girl of that age, who had never had a friend but her mother--her mother was greater fun than ever now--naturally would have. Sherringham winced at being dubbed a [...] "cosmopolite" [...] by his young entertainer, just as he had winced a moment before at hearing himself lumped in esoteric knowledge with Dashwood and Gabriel Nash; but the former of these gentlemen took no account of his sensibility while he enumerated a few of the elements of the [...] "basic." [...] He was a mixture of acuteness and innocent fatuity; and Peter had to recognise in him a rudiment or two of criticism when he said that the wonderful thing in the girl was that she learned so fast--learned something every night, learned from the same old piece a lot more than any one else would have learned from twenty. [...] "That's what it is to be a genius," [...] Peter concurred. [...] "Genius is only the art of getting your experience fast, of stealing it, as it were; and in this sense Miss Rooth's a regular brigand." [...] Dashwood condoned the subtlety and added less analytically, [...] "Oh she'll do!" [...] It was exactly in these simple words, addressed to her, that her other admirer had phrased the same truth; yet he didn't enjoy hearing them on his neighbour's lips: they had a profane, patronising sound and suggested displeasing equalities.|$|E
