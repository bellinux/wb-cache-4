25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot to look down at the instrument panel. Technically, it measures <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle,</b> not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle</b> to zero.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle</b> led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the vertical stabilizer separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle</b> to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the vertical stabilizer's structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental and numerical investigation to determine aerodynamic characteristics in terms of lift, drag, side force, pitching moment, yawing moment and rolling moment coefficients for 65 -deg delta and 65 / 40 -deg double-delta wings at various pitch and <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles.</b> The study was carried out due to scarcity of such data in literature. The experimental tests were conducted at the KFUPM low-speed wind tunnel facility whereas the numerical tests were performed using the commercial CFD software FLUENT. Results for zero <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles</b> from both experiments and numerical predictions were compared with experimental data found in literature {{as well as to the}} theory of Polhamus. The comparison of force and moment data, surface pressure coefficient distribution and vortex breakdown location show good agreement with experiments and CFD predictions found in literature as well as theoretical calculations at zero <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles.</b> Experimental and computational results for non-zero <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles</b> at various pitch angles were then determined and have been reported in this study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a study about split drag flaps as control surfaces to generate yawing motion of a blended wing body aircraft. These flaps are attached on UiTM’s Blended Wing Body (BWB) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Baseline-II E- 4. Deflection of split drag flaps {{on one side}} of the wing will produce asymmetric drag force and, as consequences, yawing moment will be produced. The yawing moment produced will rotate the nose of the BWB toward the wing with deflected split drag flaps. The study has been carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics to obtain aerodynamics data with respect to various <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles</b> (β). The simulation is running at 0. 1 Mach number or about 35 m/s. Results in terms of dimensionless coefficient such as drag coefficient (CD), side force coefficient (CS) and yawing moment coefficient (Cn) are used to observe the effects of split drag flaps on the yawing moment.

The <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle</b> β is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the xw,yw-plane, which describes {{whether there is a}} lateral component to the aircraft velocity, also known as sideslip. The angle of attack α is the angle between the xw,yw-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.|$|E
40|$|The flow angles {{calibration}} of air-data {{systems is}} based on the availability of high-accuracy reference measurements of angle-of-attack and <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles.</b> Typically, these are obtained by auxiliary sensors directly providing the reference angles (e. g., nose-boom vanes) or by analytically reconstructing them using calibrated airspeed measurements and inertial data. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the reference data for the flow angles calibration are obtained by inertial measurements only. The methodology, aiming to lower the development costs of advanced aircrafts, is developed and validated with reference to the triple-probe air-data system of a Piaggio Aerospace Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial System. Specific flight tests are carried out for the calibration process, by defining maneuvers that reduce flight time and facilitate the calibration itself. The technique is made of two steps: first, the aloft wind speed is estimated, and the angle-of-attack and <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles</b> are reconstructed; next, the reference data are used to define the calibration polynomials via least-mean squares approximation. The approach effectiveness is presented and discussed with reference to flight tests with three different configurations of flaps extension, by comparing the calibrated results with the data coming from high accuracy nose-boom vanes...|$|R
