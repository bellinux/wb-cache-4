5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} working the night <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E
5|$|John F. Tierney {{was born}} September 18, 1951, in Salem, Massachusetts. His mother, Doris H. (née Gelineau) Tierney, was a Salem native who worked a split <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> the New England Telephone Company, where she {{remained}} for 42 years. His father, Albert R. Tierney, was a bookkeeper for Nabisco {{and a local}} fuel company. Tierney {{was one of three}} children, along with his brother Michael A. and sister Catherine. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of half French-Canadian and half Irish ancestry. He moved with his family to his grandmother's home when he was five years old. He began working at the Kernwood Country Club in Salem as a caddie when he was 8 and soon adopted a paper route. He later attended Salem High School. When he was young, Tierney campaigned for his uncle, a Peabody ward councilor, and he ascribes his political interest in part to this experience.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa DeSimone had been working as a {{part-time}} barmaid in the Tom Tackle public house (now called The Encore public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton. By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at the pub {{for less than a}} month, working two evenings each week, partly to widen her social circle and partly to supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discothèque was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving DeSimone's Ford Escort in the pub car park.|$|E

5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|Toyah argues with Leanne's half-sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), for not {{passing on}} a message about {{starting}} a <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> the pub, but {{they agree to}} call a truce. Peter leaves cigarettes at Leanne's flat and Toyah tries to take the blame but Simon is forced to cover for her. Simon later tells Eva who blackmails Toyah: stop Peter from shutting down Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) factory or Eva will tell Leanne about Peter and Toyah. Peter agrees to Eva's demands and they continue their affair. Toby returns in January 2017 and demands Toyah sign a paper to destroy their frozen embryos. Toyah is reluctant and after a heart to heart, they kiss. However, Toyah {{makes it clear that}} she doesn't love Toby and is staying with Peter, causing Toby to lash out and leave. Peter learns what has happened and decides to drop off Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles), making Toyah jealous. They later make up and Leanne catches Peter and Toyah kissing. During a heated argument, Leanne disowns Toyah and refuses to talk to her again, despite her efforts. Leanne forgives Toyah after she helps deliver baby Oliver in a lift after it breaks down.|$|E

25|$|Except in Cornwall, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of place-names in England are easily etymologised as Old English (or Old Norse, due to later Viking influence), demonstrating the dominance of English across post-Roman England.

25|$|The {{strategy}} <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> first {{seemed to}} be working, because sales of the redesigned 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors improved, even as AMC's overall production decreased from the record level achieved in 1963. However, corporate earnings per share were a meager 27 cents per share, the lowest since AMC made its famous compact car comeback in 1958. Investors received a message of the changing fortune of the automaker when the company's 1966 annual financial report was delivered in a plain brown wrapper, instead of the previous year's glossy cover.|$|E
25|$|For its {{transmission}} speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than}} double that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter {{does not need to}} use a linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E
25|$|These {{excursion}} limits imply {{a significant}} change in gas load in all tissues for a depth change of around 15m for 6 to 8 hours, and experimental work has shown that both venous blood and brain tissue are likely to develop small asymptomatic bubbles after a full <b>shift</b> <b>at</b> both the upward and downward excursion limits. These bubbles remain small due to the relatively small pressure ratio between storage and excursion pressure, and are generally resolved by the time the diver is back on shift, and residual bubbles do not accumulate over sequential shifts. However, any residual bubbles pose a risk of growth if decompression is started before they are fully eliminated. Ascent rate during excursions is limited, to minimize the risk and amount of bubble formation.|$|E
