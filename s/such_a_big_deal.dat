500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E

In Kerambit’s native country, though, the lyrics and content are stringently banned and contested by the country’s Parliament. In his strongest showing of support, Kerambit prematurely claimed victory for Reformasi in the Malaysian General Election of 2008 three years before Anwar Ibrahim would win the Permatang Pauh by-election with a majority vote, returning him to Parliament {{as leader of the}} Malaysian opposition. The proclamation came in his “Reformasi Freestyle.” It is perhaps Kerambit’s most spirited recording, and one in which he continually switches between a Bahasa Melayu flow and a more traditional, American hip-hop diction. In it, he exclaims, “Kerajaan Mati, Reformasi!” (Die Government, Reformation!). The song’s Indian-flavored beat, given to Kerambit by a Cleveland DJ, later wound up on 50 Cent's “Get Down” track from DJ Whoo Kid’s G-Unit Radio 22: Hip-Hop is Dead mixtape. Kerambit believes performing “Reformasi” or many of his other MA2 recordings in Malaysia would result in his immediate arrest under the Internal Security Act without trial.|$|R

[...] The announcement came two months {{before the end of the}} hosting of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the gay adoption issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.|$|E

We can enrich up to 100%... But we never had the intention and {{we do not have the}} intention to do so, unless we need (to)."

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
