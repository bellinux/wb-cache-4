40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeDifferent denture {{cleaning}} {{methods have}} different effects. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the efficiency of six different denture cleaning methods to remove Candida albicans that had accumulated on denture-based materials. Materials and methodsWe generated 140 identical acrylic resin specimens and <b>soaked</b> them <b>in</b> a suspension of C albicans. The reduction in microorganism counts after application of the different denture cleaning methods was calculated. Six cleaning methods were evaluated: a mechanical method of brushing with a toothbrush, a chemical method of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, a combined method of brushing and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, a chemical method of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution, irradiation in an ultraviolet (UV) -light e-box, and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> distilled water. The effectiveness of the denture-cleaning methods in reducing C albicans was evaluated following a single cleaning event. ResultsThe denture cleaning techniques had considerably different efficacies in reducing C albicans. There was no significant difference among the effectiveness levels of cleaning by brushing, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, or a combination of both in removing C albicans. Similarly, the effectiveness levels of <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution or irradiation in a UV-light e-box were statistically similar. ConclusionCompared to other methods, brushing, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial cleansing tablet solution, or a combination of both methods can significantly reduce the adherence of C albicans to denture samples. Compared to <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> distilled water, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a commercial mouthwash solution or irradiation with UV-light had more significant cleaning effects, but these methods were not as effective as the aforementioned three methods...|$|R

A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was conducted to}} determine the suitable methods for enhancing germination of Ziziphus spina-christi (Linn.) seeds of two different provenances (Um-Syala and Nyala). Five seed treatments were used, namely, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> sulfuric acid (98 % and 40 %); <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> tap water; plunging in boiling water followed by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> tap water; boiling in water followed by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> tap water; and mechanical scarification. The results indicated that sulfuric acid treatments gave the highest germination (P£ 0. 05), followed by seed gun scarifier, while water treatments (tap and boiling) did not enhance germination compared to untreated seeds. For both provenances, boiling in water for 5 or 10 minutes was lethal. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to observe the effects of Oil Palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) particles pre-treatment on properties of binderless particleboard (BP) using oxidation treatment. The pretreatment of EFB particles were <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> cold water for 48 hours, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot water 100 ??C for 30 minutes and 60 minutes, steaming for 60 minutes, and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 1 % for 60 minutes. As a comparison, produced BP from particles without pre-treatment. The air dried particles were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide 15 % based on particle dry-weight, and ferrous sulphate 7. 5 % based on weight of hydrogen peroxide. The board which manufactured was 30 cm x 30 cm x 0. 7 cm with target density was 0. 75 g cm- 3. The results showed that the best dimensional stability was found at <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot water for 60 minutes, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE) obtained <b>in</b> <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot water for 30 minutes and BP without pretreatment for Modulus of Rupture (MOR). All of mechanical properties of BP were not meet the JIS A 5908 2003; therefore it need further study to overcome this problem. Generally, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot water was the best pre-treatment in the manufacture of BP from EFB...|$|R

5|$|Ancient Chinese Buddhist {{accounts}} from the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an arhat Indian Buddhist missionary {{by the name}} of Madhyântika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye.|$|E

An ambush by Hayes' men brought the Confederate pursuit to a halt. Powell's cavalry brigade was used to drive the Confederates back. Crook was ordered to retreat north across the Potomac River, and the Confederates reoccupied Martinsville (in addition to controlling Winchester). While most of Averell's division camped at Hagerstown, Maryland, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry guarded a river crossing near Shepherdstown, West Virginia.|$|E

5|$|The sinew, <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> animal glue, is then laid {{in layers}} {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E

In the Palestinian culture, coffee and tea is traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while juice is served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E

In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E

5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Maya warfare {{was not so}} much {{aimed at}} {{destruction}} of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E

5|$|On the {{collapse}} of the Tsarist regime in February 1917, Olga's sister-in-law left Pavlovsk with her family, but Olga stayed, soon to be almost alone except for a single young domestic named Anna Egorova. (After the Revolution, Egorova entered the service of Prince Christopher of Greece and became the governess of his son, Michael.) Short of food, the two women were limited to eating a little dry bread <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> poor quality oil. Their safety was far from assured, and {{a few days after the}} October Revolution, Bolsheviks invaded and ransacked the palace. Olga was physically unharmed. She accepted the need to leave Russia, but the Bolsheviks refused to let her go and diplomatic help from Greece was not forthcoming in the aftermath of the National Schism. In June, Constantine had been deposed and exiled to Switzerland. As the Allies did not wish to establish a Greek republic or see Crown Prince George succeed his father, Constantine was replaced on the throne by his second son, Alexander, who was thought to be more favorable to the Allies and more malleable than his older brother. Venizelos held power and the supporters of the deposed king were arrested or executed.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E
