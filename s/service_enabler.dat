In this model, each product {{is equipped with}} an Intelligent Data Unit that connects to a regional back-end <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> over the Communication Support Infrastructure (e. g. Internet) for lifecycle data transmission. An Intelligent Data Unit is a hardware device that consists of sensors, a controller, memory and data communication interface, which can be embedded into the product to acquire the lifecycle data. A <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> is a software agent that receives the lifecycle data, and uses it to enable services and provide useful information and knowledge. The analysis and design of a <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> is described, and a prototype <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> is developed. It has been demonstrated in field trials that intelligent products built in this way can enable suitable product-related services...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} ageing of population {{has turned the}} mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into a prevalent disease suffered by elderly. Consequently, the spatial disorientation has become a significant problem for older people and their caregivers. The ambient-assisted living applications are offering location-based services for empowering elderly {{to go outside and}} encouraging a greater independence. Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> introduced contribute to “context-awareness” paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the system architecture for a terminal-based location <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> in the 3 rd Generation (3 G) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). A location <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> provides {{data about the}} geographical position of mobile terminals to requesting clients. Since location data {{can be regarded as}} a type of presence information, we propose an architecture that builds on the IMS presence specifications. We show that several mechanisms for processing presence like notification handling, access control and privacy management apply to location data as well. It is therefore possible to reuse {{a large part of the}} IMS presence infrastructure. Based on the observation that the processing of trigger conditions for location information and creating notification messages should be done in the terminal itself, we propose a terminalbased location enabler. The terminal uses a built-in method to determine its geographical position such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) module. We argue that the proposed architecture scales better and is more accurate, efficient and cost effective than current network-based location enablers. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem of {{efficiently}} revoking certificates of malicious and compromised nodes in vehicular networks. As in previous work, our focus is making sure that vehicles receive the new list of revoked certificates (CRL) before they can be compromised. Unlike previous solutions, our work revolves around the idea of making use of existing capabilities offered by mobile network operators to improve the efficiency of the distribution of the CRL. Our proposed solution gathers positions and headings of vehicles using a location <b>service</b> <b>enabler.</b> Based on that information, the infrastructure can decide when and in which areas to broadcast the incremental CRL using any of the existing technologies such as the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS). Our simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms existing solutions based on the use of Road-side Units (RSUs) for disseminating CRLs. The improvement in terms of distribution delay and number of compromised nodes is noticeably better as the density of vehicles decreases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) has {{proposed}} the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{as a key}} element in the nextgeneration network (NGN) converged architecture supporting multimedia services. Extending the IMS towards provisioning support for location based services (LBS) will enable enhanced services and offer new revenues to the system. However, conveying location information in the IMS and connecting the IMS with a real positioning system are still open issues. This paper presents the design and implementation of an IMS Location Server (ILS) integrating IMS with a positioning system. From the IMS perspective, the ILS serves as a <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> for LBS. Considerable work has been done by the IETF in the area of location information transport based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This paper proposes some improvements in this area. In order to demonstrate proof-ofconcept in enhancing IMS-based services, a Location-aware Push-to-Talk (LaPoC) prototype service has been developed. The service has been integrated and tested with the Ericsson Mobile Positioning System (MPS). The paper also gives the results of performance measurements including traffic load analysis and session establishment time. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{range of}} {{multimedia}} contents and services on the Internet, {{the diversity of}} terminals, and the heterogeneity of network technologies make it less and less feasible and rather costly for providers to prepare contents and services in advance in all conceivable formats. There {{is a need to}} incorporate dynamic adaptation management into existing multimedia content/service delivery networks. We propose an Adaptation Management Framework (AMF) that provides architectural and functional support allowing dynamic and autonomous content/service adaptation without introducing additional complexities to the actual content/service provider or the user. The AMF provides functionalities needed in such an automated adaptation process, including context representation, adaptation decision making and adaptation operations selection across heterogeneous entities and platforms. It alleviates the complexity of those tasks using ontology representation formalism and knowledge-based processing techniques. It deploys itself as well as associated third-party applications, such as adaptation tools, as Web Services to enhance the interoperability among different entities. The AMF can be plugged into content/service delivery networks as an adaptation engine and serves as an invisible <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> for ubiquitous content/service delivery...|$|E

40|$|The 3 GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is {{currently}} {{expected to provide}} the basic architecture framework for the Next Generation Network which will bridge the traditional divide between circuit-switched and packet-switched networks and consolidate both sides into one single network for all services.

40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} {{is a new}} {{and emerging}} technology. The concept of pervasiveness and its deployment into reality are still not well aligned. This is because the vision of pervasiveness is a highly complex area that encompasses {{a large number of}} issues. The real vision of pervasiveness will never become a reality if everyone involved needs to repeatedly address all the issues involved in the concept. This paper focuses on the DAIDALOS Pervasive Service Platform (PSP) as an enabler of pervasive services. DAIDALOS is an EU Framework Programme 6 Integrated Project with 46 multinational partners from both the industry and academia. The paper details the strategy employed in DAIDALOS to facilitate Service Providers to offer pervasive services on top of the PSP. It argues that pervasiveness should be provided to Service Providers as part of the platform, instead of requiring pervasiveness to be totally embedded in the services themselves. This approach consequently opens up the service provision market to more players, driving the idea of a truly pervasive world. The paper gives an overview of the DAIDALOS platform as a pervasive <b>service</b> <b>enabler,</b> detailing how it facilitates pervasiveness by removing most of the work from the Service Providers themselves...|$|E

The fundamental objective of this thesis is to capture context information and make it accessible to mobile applications via a service platform by horizontalising access to a common wireless sensor network (WSN) space. In this thesis a design of an end-to-end system integrating WSN into a communication and service platform is described. More specifically, the work designs and specifies a WSN protocol stack architecture and investigates several clustering algorithm as protocol elements, as well as specifying how WSN can be integrated into next generation mobile networks and the IP multimedia service platform (IMS). There are 3 main components to the end-to-end system, the WSN protocol stack architecture, the gateway architecture and a context <b>service</b> <b>enabler</b> {{as part of the}} service platform. Each component is specified to a high level of detail and a test bed implementation shows the proof of concept, autonomously collecting context information from WSN.
