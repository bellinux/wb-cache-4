40|$|Existing {{classification}} of the Croatian seaports {{does not fit}} the level and {{meet the needs of}} the economic development of the Republic of Croatia, particularly after the Republic of Croatia joined the European Union.

Therefore, modernisation of the basic {{classification of}} ports in the Croatian legislation is suggested. Basic categorization of ports should be as follows: public <b>service</b> <b>ports,</b> private <b>service</b> <b>ports</b> and private ports for private needs of an entrepreneur. </p...|$|R

As an extended logistic model, Lotka-Volterra model is applied to study the competitive co-evolution and mutually beneficial co-evolution of enterprises in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. This paper simulates the co-evolution of enterprises in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem by using MATLAB programming. The simulation results show that the breadth of the niche of the enterprises is changing with the change of the competition coefficient and the coefficient of mutual benefit in the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem. Based on that, some proposals are put forward to ensure the healthy and orderly development of the <b>port</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem...|$|R
