5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter <b>solar</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
25|$|The louvres on {{the south}} façade alter its {{consistency}} and appearance when some are open and others are closed. They stop excessive passive <b>solar</b> <b>gain.</b> Ultraviolet light hits the glass and is changed to infrared which generates heat through radiation creating overheating.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

This paper illustrated some of these evolutions regarding internal and <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> through dynamic simulations.

2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} {{double-glazed}} windows transmit heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E
2500|$|Situated in {{the centre}} of the square is a Costa Coffee {{designed}} by Piers Gough. Constructed of glass and steel, it has an [...] "eye-shaped" [...] footprint. The structure consists of a tubular steel frame which is glazed. The vertical structural columns meet the roof members which cross over at a ridge. This forms two canopies which mirror the footprint of the building. Forty people can be seated in the [...] by [...] cafe, with 100 also able to sit outside. The glazing consists of double glazed units with a white dot fritted outer pane. This reduces glare and <b>solar</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The central atrium was {{completely}} glazed behind deep concrete balconies; this arrangement {{was to make}} it conducive to study. Although there was good natural light, the design was an early recognition of <b>solar</b> <b>gain</b> and the damage it can cause to books. The large windows of the reference library face inwards to reduce traffic noise from the Inner Ring road. On the outside the windows were high level narrow strips with black anodised window frames. The space below the central atrium of the library was designed to define a civic square with gardens, pools, waterfalls and fountains, and potentially to form an open-air exhibition space. Six pools were {{to be placed in}} and around this square. Madin also designed the semi-circular amphitheatre around the Chamberlain Memorial in Chamberlain Square to frame the entrance to the library and the new civic square.|$|E
40|$|ETFE {{membranes}} {{are generally}} used in architecture for large roofing and façade systems, {{because of their}} transparency and lightness compared to glass alternatives. Multilayer ETFE panels are used to improve single membrane systems performances, reducing thermal losses, {{by the use of}} an air gap between two or more ETFE foils, generally serigraphed or surface treated to reduce <b>solar</b> <b>gains.</b> Surface temperatures and global solar radiation strongly affects mean radiant temperature (MRT), and comfort perceived by a user facing a transparent envelope as well as <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> strongly influences primary energy use for cooling in summer conditions. In the following paper an alternative dynamic <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> mitigation strategy is presented and applied to a double layer, non-cushions, ETFE panel for façades. We measured the effectiveness of a water spray system located in the air-gap between the parallel ETFE foils and used to reduce surface temperatures and solar access depending on different summer solar radiation values and outdoor/indoor air temperature conditions. Systems alternative with different in nozzle dimension, water spray geometry and water consumption were already tested to evaluate the best compromise between <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> reduction and water use. The results are preliminary but we noticed that a reduction up to the 10 % of the total <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> could be achieved as well as a reduction of 10 °C of surface temperature.

40|$|<b>Solar</b> energy <b>gains</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} aspects in the design of very low energy buildings like passive houses. An optimization of <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> reduces the required heating demand, however too high <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> can lead to overheating issues. Most methods for building energy ratings and building energy certificates use a monthly balance based calculation procedure. Also the current methodology for passive house assessment and certification is a monthly balance based one. To incorporate shading by fixed elements as an influence on <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> into those methods, some simplifications are necessary. This paper discusses the current implementation of the shading calculation in the passive house verification method. Based on comparison tests of the current method with an advanced shading calculation method shortcomings of the existing method are discussed. It is shown that the current algorithms for static calculation sometimes give erroneous and unreliable results. The impact on the different assessment criteria, energy demand and loads as well as overheating, exceeds acceptable margins of error...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of a fenestration system during the cooling season is based on heat gains by temperature difference and solar radiation, characterised by thermal transmittance (U-value) and <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain</b> coefficient, respectively. While U-value testing and calculation methods have been long established, <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain</b> coefficient has been evaluated only by calculation under {{the lack of any}} established testing method. However, calculation alone cannot yield exact <b>solar</b> heat <b>gain</b> coefficient values for various types of fenestration.

40|$|Shading {{provision}} {{should be}} considered {{as an integral part of}} fenestration system design for commercial and office buildings, in order to balance daylighting requirements versus the need to reduce <b>solar</b> <b>gains.</b> Utilization of day-light in buildings may result in reduction in electricity consumption for lighting but also in high cooling demand if excessive <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> are admitted in the working space. Moreover, visual comfort should be ensured especially for pe-rimeter office spaces. Shading devices can con-trol <b>solar</b> <b>gains</b> and simultaneously allow ade-quate daylight to the interior. In this paper, the simultaneous effects of shading device proper-ties and control on building cooling demand are evaluated using a coupled lighting and thermal simulation module. The interactions between cooling and lighting energy use in perimeter spaces are analyzed as a function of window-to-wall ratio and shading parameters. Roller shades are used as an example. Shading device type, properties and control have a significant impact on building cooling demand. An integrated ap-proach for dynamic operation of fenestration systems in conjunction with controllable electric lighting systems could lead to minimization of energy consumption for cooling in perimeter spaces, depending on climatic conditions and orientation. 1...|$|R
