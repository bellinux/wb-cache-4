However, before opening the 2 nd stage of the Gyeongbu high speed rail-road, there was an opportunity for field tests and measurements of the bridge with <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> speed(from 170 km/ h to 315 km/h). The measured responses were compared with the results of a developed bridge/train interaction analysis.

50|$|Institutionally, the {{national}} regulatory framework is vertically implemented through a four-tier management system i.e., national, provincial, municipal and county levels. The latter three levels are governed directly by their corresponding authorities {{in terms of}} both finance and personnel management, while SEPA is only responsible for their substantial operation. The enactment of the various environmental laws, instruments and regulations through the last two decades was paralleled by a <b>stepwise</b> <b>increase</b> of the bureaucratic status and capacity of these environmental authorities. For instance, the NEPA was elevated via the National Environmental Protection Bureau to the National Environmental Protection Agency (in 1988), and in 1998 it received ministerial status as SEPA. By 1995, the ‘environmental state’ of China had got over 88,000 employees across China and by 2004 it had grown to over 160,000 employees. According to Jahiel (1998: 776 cited in Carter et al., 2007) on this environmental bureaucracy: ‘‘the past 15 years has seen the assembly of an extensive institutional system nation-wide and the increase of its rank’’.|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} new approach, a biofilm-type {{wastewater}} treatment reactor was constructed to treat synthetic wastewater under <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> doses of STM (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 25 and 50  mg L− 1) {{over a period}} of 618  days, with a control system (no antibiotics) operated in parallel. Streptomycin {{is one of the first}} broad-spectrum antibiotics to be utilized for the control of infectious human and plant diseases. Although STM resistance mechanisms have been proposed in many clinical bacteria, plant and animal pathogens (De Leon Door et al. 2013; Sundin et al. 1995; Sundin 2002; Um et al. 2016), the resistance spectra in wastewater communities are still poorly understood. In additions, the culture-based wastewater bacterial responses against <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> doses of STM have not been studied. In this study, wastewater bacterial strains were isolated from six different STM exposures, and the impacts of antibiotic concentrations on wastewater bacterial diversity and the characteristics of antibiotic resistance were assessed using bacterial enrichment method, sequencing and, MIC assay. The presence and distribution of 11 antibiotic genetic determinants from individual wastewater bacterial isolates were determined by the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results of this new culture-based <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> STM approach will enable us to better understand the risks accompanying antibiotic wastewater treatment.|$|R

30|$|We also {{observed}} high prevalence of a non-STM resistance gene aacA 4 among the isolates harvested from the STM reactor exposure by involving <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> doses of STM (0 – 50  mg L− 1). According to previous research, aacA 4 is an amino glycoside gene that encodes the enzyme, amino glycoside 6 ′-N-acetyl transferase (AAC(6 ′)-IbC) and confers {{resistance to antibiotics}} such as tobramycin, gentamycin and kanamycin (Nemec et al. 2004; Sacha et al. 2012). In the present study, however a prevalence of the aacA 4 gene was observed among 82.5 % of STM isolates, equal to the prevalence of STM resistance genes strA, strB, aadA and aadE (15 – 82.5 %). It is unclear, whether increased doses of STM modified the aacA 4 gene to encode STM-modifying enzymes or if it accelerated an unknown STM resistance mechanism. Further research is required to clarify this as well as antibiotic risk assessment in WWTPs. In conclusion, our present work reveals that the wide bacterial diversity among the indigenous bacteria from WWTPs exposed to long-term <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> doses of STM could become an enhanced and stable reservoir {{for the development of}} STM resistance. Here we concluded that <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> doses of antibiotics will expose a number of unanswered questions related to antibiotic resistance among the wastewater bacterial community. We therefore suggest that the current new approach could apply and extended in future studies to better understand the risk assessment of WWTPs.|$|R

A high cell density of 2. 65 g L- 1 (batch culture) or 2. 74 g L- 1 (fed-batch culture) was obtained, and total astaxanthin production in the fed-batch culture (64. 36 mg L- 1) was about 20. 5 % higher than in the batch culture (53. 43 mg L- 1). An unstructured kinetic model to describe the microalga culture system including cell growth, astaxanthin formation, as well as sodium acetate consumption was proposed.

To derive outcome-driven thresholds for the 24 -hour ambulatory PP, we analyzed 9938 participants randomly recruited from 11 populations (47. 3 % women). After age stratification (< 60 versus ≥ 60 years) and using average risk as reference, we computed multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) to assess risk by tenths of the PP distribution or {{risk associated with}} <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> (+ 1 mm[*]Hg) PP levels. All adjustments included mean arterial pressure. Among 6028 younger participants (68 [*] 853 person-years), the risk of cardiovascular (HR, 1. 58; P= 0. 011) or cardiac (HR, 1. 52; P= 0. 056) events increased only in the top PP tenth (mean, 60. 6 mm[*]Hg). Using <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> PP levels, the lower boundary of the 95 % confidence interval of the successive thresholds did not cross unity. Among 3910 older participants (39 [*] 923 person-years), risk increased (P≤ 0. 028) in the top PP tenth (mean, 76. 1 mm[*]Hg). HRs were 1. 30 and 1. 62 for total and cardiovascular mortality, and 1. 52, 1. 69, and 1. 40 for all cardiovascular, cardiac, and cerebrovascular events. The lower boundary of the 95 % confidence interval of the HRs associated with <b>stepwise</b> <b>increasing</b> PP levels crossed unity at 64 mm[*]Hg. While accounting for all covariables, the top tenth of PP contributed less than 0. 3 % (generalized R(2) statistic) to the overall risk among the elderly.

An unstructured kinetic model to describe the microalga culture system including cell growth, phycocyanin formation, as well as glucose consumption was proposed.
