40|$|Objective: Primary {{stability}} has a {{major impact}} on the long term success of dental implants and the loading concept. However, non-invasive quantification does not exist. Recent data on resonance frequency analysis (RFA) of implants, a non-invasive, in vivo technique seems to be promising. Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the correlation of resonance frequency values and torque values of <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> and non-self-tapping dental implants and their different primary stability. Design: A group of 263 patients were treated with a total of 602 dental implants: 408 conical formed, non-self-tapping Ankylos® implants and 194 self-tapping Camlog® implants. The maximum insertion torque during implant placement was recorded. Resonance frequency was measured as the implant stability quotient (ISQ) once immediately after insertion and twice three months later. Results: After one year nine failures were observed (1. 5 %). Torque values of the non-self tapping implants were significantly higher than those in the <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> group (p= 0. 023). Resonance frequency values did not show differences between these two groups (p= 0. 956). Nevertheless, a correlation between ISQ values after implantation and three months after implant placement has been found (r= 0. 712; p< 0. 001). Within the implants systems, no correlation between insertion torque and resonance frequency values was observed (r= 0. 305; p= 0. 005). Conclusion: Our study indicates that ISQ values obtained from different implant systems are not comparable. The resonance frequency analysis seemed not to be suitable for evaluation of implant stability used as the only method. Higher insertion torque of the non-self tapping Ankylos® implants appeared to confirm higher clinical primary stability...|$|E
40|$|Computer aided joint {{replacement}} surgery {{has become}} very popular during recent years and is being done in increasing numbers all over the world. The accuracy of the system depends to a major extent, on accurate registration and immobility of the tracker attachment devices to the bone. This {{study was designed to}} asses the forces needed to displace the tracker attachment devices in the bone simulators. Bone simulators were used to maintain the uniformity of the bone structure during the study. The fixation devices tested were 3 mm diameter self drilling, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> threaded pin, 4 mm diameter <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> cortical threaded pin, 5 mm diameter <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> cancellous threaded pin and a triplanar fixation device ‘ortholock’ used with three 3 mm pins. All the devices were tested for pull out, translational and rotational forces in unicortical and bicortical fixation modes. Also tested was the normal bang strength and forces generated by leaning on the devices. The forces required to produce translation increased with the increasing diameter of the pins. These were 105 N, 185 N, and 225 N for the unicortical fixations and 130 N, 200 N, 225 N for the bicortical fixations for 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins respectively. The forces required to pull out the pins were 1475 N, 1650 N, 2050 N for the unicortical, 1020 N, 3044 N and 3042 N for the bicortical fixated 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins. The ortholock translational and pull out strength was tested to 900 N and 920 N respectively and still it did not fail. Rotatory forces required to displace the tracker on pins was to the magnitude of 30 N before failure. The ortholock device had rotational forces applied up to 135 N and still did not fail. The manual leaning forces and the sudden bang forces generated were of the magnitude of 210 N and 150 N respectively. The strength of the fixation pins increases with increasing diameter from three to five mm for the translational forces. There is no significant difference in pull out forces of four mm and five mm diameter pins though it is more that the three mm diameter pins. This is because of the failure of material at that stage rather than the fixation device. The rotatory forces required to displace the tracker are very small and much less that that can be produced by the surgeon or assistants in single pins. Although the ortholock device was tested to 135 N in rotation without failing, one has to be very careful not to put any forces during the operation on the tracker devices to ensure the accuracy of the procedure. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNeuropathological {{studies in}} Huntington disease (HD) have {{demonstrated}} neuronal {{loss in the}} striatum, {{as well as in}} other brain regions including the cortex. With diffusion tensor MRI we evaluated the hypothesis that the clinical dysfunction in HD is related to regionally specific lesions of circuit-specific cortico-basal ganglia networks rather than to the striatum only. We included 27 HD and 24 controls from the TRACK-HD Paris cohort. The following assessments were used: self-paced tapping tasks, trail B making test (TMT), University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT), and apathy scores from the problem behaviors assessment. Group comparisons of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity and correlations were performed using voxel-based analysis. In the cortex, HD patients showed significant correlations between: (i) <b>self</b> paced <b>tapping</b> and mean diffusivity in the parietal lobe at 1. 8 Hz and prefrontal areas at 3 Hz, (ii) UPSIT and mean diffusivity in the parietal, and median temporal lobes, the cingulum and the insula, and fractional anisotropy in the insula and the external capsule, (iii) TMT B and mean diffusivity in the white matter of the superior frontal, orbital, temporal, superior parietal and post central areas, and (iv) apathy and fractional anisotropy in the white matter of the rectus gyrus. In the basal ganglia, we found correlations between the <b>self</b> paced <b>tapping,</b> UPSIT, TMT tests, and mean diffusivity in the anterior part of the putamen and the caudate nucleus. In conclusion, disruption of motor, associative and limbic cortico-striatal circuits differentially contribute to the clinical signs of the disease.

40|$|This paper {{studied the}} {{behavior}} of the connections in the composite Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) system. The PSSDB is a light weight composite panel comprised of a profiled steel sheet PSS and cement board as dry board connected together by either mechanical fasteners or by epoxy adhesive resin. Ten push-out specimens with different size, shape, thickness of dry board, and types of connections were carried out. The ultimate load, the load slip relationship, and modes of failure were observed. The results showed that the samples connected by epoxy adhesive resin can sustain load greater than that connected by mechanical fasteners up to 76 %, and the ultimate load affected by the thickness of dry board. The capacity of connecter (<b>self</b> drilling-self <b>tapping</b> screw with 4. 2 mm diameter) is about 1. 736 kN/screw. This value increased by about 20 % with the increase in dryboard thickness to double (from 8 mm to 16 mm). The Ultimate load sustained by the specimens connected by using epoxy adhesive resin is about 37 kN/m and 137 kN/m for the DB connected to ribs and trough sides of PSS, respectively. These values increased by about 14 % with the increase in dryboard thickness to double...|$|R

30|$|A small {{longitudinal}} skin incision just {{distal to}} the tibia-femur joint was made. The tibia/femur head was exposed subperiosteally and an osteotomy {{performed with the}} delicately placed pilot drill over the entry point and lightly pumped up and down under copius saline irrigation just to enter the cortical bone for the MDIs. This was used for initial bone drilling to depth of 0.5  mm. The 3 M™ESPE™ MDI (size 1.8  mm[*]×[*] 10  mm) vial was opened and {{the body of the}} implant was firmly grasped with a sterilized locking pliers. The titanium finger driver was attached {{to the head of the}} implant. The implant was transferred to the site and rotated clockwise while exerting downwards pressure. This began the <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> process and was used until noticeable bony resistance encountered when it touched the lower cortical plate. The winged thumb wrench was used for driving the implant deeper into the bone, if necessary. All the animals received one MDI on the head of each tibia or femur.

40|$|BackgroundWound healing events after implant {{placement}} {{will vary}} according to the extent of the necrotic zone. PurposeThe goal {{of the present study was}} to evaluate bone healing around titanium implants with a novel apical chamber design. Materials and MethodsTitanium implants grade 4 were turned with different apex design. Control implants had a <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> design with centric cutting grooves. Test implants exhibited eccentric cutting grooves interconnected by a hollow chamber. A total of 60 implants were installed in the femur/tibia of 10 rabbits for histological analysis. ResultsAfter 1 week, immature bone formation started at the cortical level of the test implants associated to scalloped contours indicative of bone resorption. Control implants failed to show new bone formation, and the space within the threads was filled mainly by red blood cells and surgical debris. Bone contact values showed no difference after 1 week, and significant higher values for test implants showed likewise after 4 weeks compared with control implants in the tibia.

50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, <b>tapping,</b> <b>self</b> drilling screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R
40|$|Psychomotor {{disturbances}} in bipolar disorder are {{an expression of}} alterations in volition, cognition, emotion and motor control. While psychomotor disturbances remain a classic hallmark of severe mood disorders, there is limited knowledge about its mediators and neural correlates. The general aim of this thesis was to obtain {{a better understanding of}} psychomotor {{disturbances in}} bipolar disorder. Our specific objectives were to investigate whether symptoms of psychomotor disturbances in bipolar depression relate to neural activation in frontal-striatal networks that mediate motor function, whether there is a differential activation within these frontal-striatal motor networks between depressed patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls, and whether morphometric changes in the basal ganglia and thalamus are associated with clinical variables in euthymic bipolar disorder that may predict impairments in psychomotor function. In paper I, we validated a self rating scale with respect to established observer rating scales. In a post-hoc analysis we found a psychomotor factor that we investigated further with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in paper II and III. In paper II, we investigated motor execution in patients with bipolar depression. We used task based fMRI to investigate whether <b>self</b> paced finger <b>tapping</b> would reveal any differences in neural activation between groups, and whether neural activation at different levels in the frontal-striatal motor loop is predicted by the functional deafferentiation theory - framework used to explain slowed movement in Parkinson’s disease. We could not confirm our hypotheses. In paper III, we investigated different parts of the production of voluntary movement using fMRI and a motor imagery task. We found significant between-group differences in medial parieto-occipital regions during motor imagery and all other tasks, and in cortical motor areas during motor execution. We also found decreased activations in motor regions when there was an increase in psychomotor disturbances. In paper IV, we investigated whether tests of psychomotor function were associated with morphometric change in the basal ganglia or thalamus. We could not confirm our hypothesis. However, we found significant between-group differences {{in the shape of the}} right putamen in the absence of impaired psychomotor function. Shape differences were located in regions connected to frontal executive regions and motor areas. In paper V, we investigated morphometric differences in a subgroup of bipolar disorder characterized by greater impairment of psychomotor function in their euthymic phase. We also investigated clinical variables associated with disease expressions, and the effect of antipsychotic treatment, on morphometric change. We found that antipsychotic medication, the number of manic episodes and duration of illness were associated with local shape changes in the basal ganglia. In summary, we found that psychomotor disturbances may be considered both a symptom and a sign, and that the neural signature of these appear to involve both structural and functional alterations in brain regions of frontal-striatal networks...|$|R
40|$|The Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) {{system is}} a thin-walled, {{lightweight}} composite structure consisting of Profiled Steel Sheeting connected to dry boards by means of self drilling, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> screws and is a structural load bearing system.

It is a square section with window opening section at 1200 mm x 1200 mm and symmetrically positioned {{in the center of the}} specimen. The study is based on the concept that the load bearing capacity of the composite wall is derived from the individual components, namely the profiled steel sheeting, dry board and the interaction between these two. Therefore, an analytical method is essential to predict the behaviour of the PSSDB system as walling unit with window opening. A linear finite element model has been developed to predict the full range of behaviour of PSSDB panel. LUSAS (1999), a finite element package (LUSAS version 13. 4) has been employed for this purpose.

A 3. 5 -mm, fully threaded, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> bone screw (stainless steel from Pelvic Set Synthes). The length of the screw varies between 100 mm and 120 mm, depending on the fracture location and pattern. Results: All fractures united within an average time to union of 8. 2 weeks. In all patients the average time to full weight bearing was 6. 8 weeks, whereas that in patients with isolated lat eral malleolus fractures was 4. 5 weeks. There were no deep wound infections or complaints of painful hardware. At latest follow-up, functional results were excellent in, 25 patients (54. 3 %) good in 20 (43. 5 %), fair in (2. 2 %). Conclu sion: If reduction of the lateral malleolus fracture can be obtained in a closed fashion (with the aid of an image x-ray intensifier), we believe that fixation may be performed with an axial screw percutaneously. This technique is quick, safe and easy to do with less complication. </p...|$|E

Nowadays, construction no longer depends on current systems such as using timber bases and reinforcement concrete structures There are many problems with the current techniques such as high costing, low quality, and long construction time. One of the viable solution is to employ Industrialised Building System (IBS) which is a more efficient construction technology. Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB) is one type of Industrialised Building System (IBS). The PSSDB is a composite system that comprises of two main components which are profiled steel sheeting (PSS) and dry board (DB). They are attached by self drilling and <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> screws.

The results from this study have two parts which are effect of dry board from different thickness and effect of the screw. The result show that the Pnmaflex that has 9 mm of thickness has higher screw stiffness (0. 46 kN) than Primaflex that has 6 mm of thickness (0. 40 kN). Moreover, the result of an effect of the screw, the screw is easy to fail when the thickness of Primaflex is 6 mm more than Primaflex 9 mm.

40|$|Abstract Background: A spiral implant is a conical {{internal}} helix implant with {{a variable}} thread design which confers the characteristic of self drilling, <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> and self bone condensing. Reports have reported {{the effectiveness of}} this type of implants in several clinical situations. However, because there are no reports that specifically focus on {{one of the biggest challenges}} in oral rehabilitation, i. e. the full arch rehabitation, it was decided to perform a retrospective study. Materials and Methods: The study population was composed of 23 patients (12 females and 11 males, median age 57 years) for evaluation and implant treatment between January 2005 and June 2009. 206 Spiral family implants (SFIs) were inserted with a mean post loading follow-up of 23 months. Several variables were investigated: demographic (age and gender), anatomic (maxilla and mandible, tooth site), implant (type, length and diameter), surgical (surgeon, post-extractive, flapless technique, grafts) and prosthetic (implant/crown ratio, dentition in the antagonist arch, type of loading and CT planning) variables. Implant loss and peri-implant bone resorption were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate test were performed. Results: Survival and success rates were 97. 1 and 82. 5 %, respectively. Only implant length and implant/crown ratio were statistical significance in determining a better clinical outcome. Conclusion: In conclusion, SFIs are a reliable tool for most difficult cases of oral rehabilitation. No differences were detected among implant type. Length and implant/crown ratio can influence the crestal bone resorption with better result for longer fixtures and an higher implant/crown ratio. In addition banked bone derived from living donors can be used to restore alveolar ridge augmentation without adverse effects. Finally, flapless and CT-planned surgery did not significant increases the clinical outcome in most complex rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen an {{increasingly}} rapid development {{in the field of}} construction due to an initiative from the government to boot the economy and enhance the standard of living. However, these rapid changes result in many delayed and non-completion projects. Due to these matters, there is an extremely hih number of lost and cost in terms of wastage and pollution. One effective solution Is to implement the Industrialized Building System (IBS) such as the Profiled Steel Sheeting Diy Board (PSSDB). PSSDB is a composite structural panel consists of three elements which are the dry board, steel sheeting and <b>self</b> <b>tapping</b> screw as connection. It {{can be used as a}} wall, roof or floor panel. This research studies the effect of dry -board thickness on the overall-floor panel stifThess. -Two -different thicknesses of Primaflex dry board; 6 mm and 9 mm, were used whilst the Peva 45 profiled steel sheeting thickness was maintained at 0. 8 mm. Bending tests were performed to identify the thickness that contributed to the higher stiffness of the floor panel. From the result, the maximum load for 6 mm and 9 mm boards are 24. 51 kN/m 2 and 27. 2 kN/m 2 respectively. The stiffness of the panels was also determined from the slope of the load versus the deflection graph. The stiffness value for the 6 mm board is 85 kNm 2 /m. In comparison, the stifffiess value of 9 mm Primaflex dry board is 89 kNm 2 /m. It can be concluded that the thicker the dry board, the stiffer the floor panel will be.

Due to the production cost there are years between each time a new Francis model is bought. The Tokke Francis model at Waterpower laboratory, was given from the industry after they had run model tests in the laboratory when design- ing the Tokke prototype. In order to give the students at the Waterpower laboratory an opportunity to design their own turbines and test, the production cost must be significantly reduced. To be able to do that, new designs need to be developed and new production method used. The objective of this thesis is to carry out a new mechanical design of a Francis model runner and evaluate different mechanical designs of guide vanes and stay vanes. The new alternative designs were made with a combination of standard production methods and material, and new plastic materials from rapid prototyping such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and rapid CNC machining. To carry out the new mechanical runner design, the MATLAB design software Khoj was used. From Khoj two sets of streamlines were generated, one set for the sucction side and one for the pressure side. Then the streamlines were imported into the CAD program PTC Creo Parametric and a 3 D-model of the design was made. Two test pieces in a polyamide material was made using selective laser sintering.
