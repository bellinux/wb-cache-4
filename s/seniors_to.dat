Undergraduates enrolled in The Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned {{research in the area}} of a sponsoring faculty member.

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise <b>seniors</b> <b>to</b> end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for Medicare were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.|$|E
5|$|Williams, a 29-year-old Liverpool {{businessman}} and promoter, had sent his leading group, Derry and the Seniors (later known as Howie Casey and the <b>Seniors)</b> <b>to</b> Hamburg, {{where they were}} enjoying success, and wanted to send an additional group. He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams' offer down, as did Gerry and the Pacemakers. Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but {{said that he was}} not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the patrol}} boats of Squadron One were an {{essential}} part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970. Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use. The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required <b>seniors</b> <b>to</b> be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.|$|E

25|$|Cato Institute has {{expressed}} {{concerns that the}} U.S. government has restricted the freedom of Medicare patients to spend their own money on healthcare, and has contrasted these developments with the situation in Canada, where in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province of Quebec could not prohibit its citizens from purchasing covered services through private health insurance. The institute has urged the Congress to restore the right of American <b>seniors</b> <b>to</b> spend their own money on medical care.|$|E
25|$|The Senior Project is {{a program}} that began at Uni in the Spring of 2014. The project was {{developed}} by Assistant Director of Student Life Karl Radnitzer, who got the idea from a similar program at New Trier High School in Winnetka, IL. The project's goal is to allow second semester <b>seniors</b> <b>to</b> explore interests in a more career-oriented way than they would in a typical classroom setting. The project connects students with mentors in the Champaign-Urbana community who can help them explore their academic interests outside of the school building. Students come up with ideas for projects and submit them for approval to a Senior Project committee. If a project is approved, students then spend their second semester doing work for their project around three times a week. Students have worked in various labs at the University of Illinois, at the Crisis Nursery, at Carle Hospital, and at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E

25|$|The third Conservative {{budget was}} tabled on February 26, 2008. The {{government}} announced {{there would be}} little to no new tax breaks as major tax cuts took place in the economic update during the fall of 2007 in anticipation of economic slowdowns in 2008. It was to be the last budget of the Conservative government's first term in office. Among the key announcements was {{the creation of a new}} $5000/year tax-free savings account (TFSA), funding for troubled manufacturing and forestry industries, a new Student Grant Program, higher defense spending, $500 million for transit and infrastructures and $400 million for hiring new police officers. The TFSA was touted as a badly needed addition to the Canadian tax system as it did not make sense for low income earners and <b>seniors</b> <b>to</b> make use of existing savings programs with tax incentives, such as RRSPs. In contrast, the TFSA could be used by such demographics to enjoy savings with tax benefits.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Scarborough's population is between 25 and 64 years old. 52% fell into that [...] "working age" [...] {{during the last}} major survey, which also found 21% of Scarborough's population was 14 years old or younger, 15% were between 15 and 24, while senior citizens aged 65+ made up the remaining 12%. Like the rest of Canada, Scarborough's population is aging. It is projected that close to 30% of Scarboourgh residents will be senior citizens by 2041.

50|$|The modern-day {{seniority}} {{system of}} the United States commissioned officer corps operates on two different levels. For officers of different ranks, seniority is simply determined by who holds the highest rank. For instance, Army colonel is <b>senior</b> <b>to</b> captain and captain <b>senior</b> <b>to</b> lieutenant. Seniority extends across services as for instance major in the Army is <b>senior</b> <b>to</b> captain in the Air Force while commander in the United States Navy is <b>senior</b> <b>to</b> both. For officers in the same rank or paygrade, seniority {{is determined by the}} date of whom assumed their rank earlier. If officers of the same grade have the same date of rank, then seniority is determined in order by the officer's previous rank's date and so forth. If all promotion dates of ranks are the same, seniority is then determined on order of: previous active duty grade relative seniority (if applicable), total active commissioned service, and finally, total federal commissioned service or date of appointment as a commissioned officer. The secretaries of each service may establish further seniority rules if applicable.|$|R
