The reactor system, {{referred to as a}} Supernatant-Recycling Settler Bioreactor (SRSB), consisted of a cylindrical upflow reactor and a separate aeration vessel. The reactor was equipped with an internal settler and packing material (structured corrugated PVC sheets) to facilitate both cell retention and the settling of the formed elemental sulfur. The supernatant from the reactor was continuously recirculated through the aerator. An inlet thiosulfate concentration of 100 mmol l − 1 was used. The reactor system was fed with 89 mmol l − 1 d − 1 thiosulfate reaching 98 to 100 % thiosulfate conversion with an elemental sulfur yield of 77 %. Ninety-three percent of the produced sulfur was harvested {{from the bottom of the}} reactor as sulfur sludge. The dry sulfur sludge contained 87 % elemental sulfur. The inclusion of an internal settler and packing material in the reactor system resulted in an effective retention of sulfur and biomass inside the bioreactor, preventing the oxidation of thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfate in the aerator and, therefore, improving the efficiency of elemental <b>sulfur</b> formation and <b>recovery.</b> Keywords: Thiobacilli, thiosulfate, thiosulfate-oxidizing reactor, sulfur production, wastewate...|$|R

By the results of reaction kinetics using iodometric titration it was determined that redox reaction between cefadroxil and potassium hydrogenperoxomonosulfate is quantified and a stoichiometric: 1 mol of cefadroxil is per 1 mol of potassium hydrogen. Quantitative oxidation of Sulfur atom was finished in the time that is less than 1 min.

40|$|Sulfur Extended Asphalt Modifier (SEAM) {{in solid}} pellet form is {{currently}} being marketed as an additive for hot asphalt mixtures. Typically 40 % of the bitumen phase in the asphalt mix can be replaced by SEAM using conventional mix design and production techniques. A number of full scale trials using SEAM {{have been reported in}} the literature, and except for some concerns regarding rutting and moisture resistance, it appears that overall the SEAM modified mixes have the potential for improved mechanical performance compared to conventional asphalt. The objective of this paper is to examine issues that surpass pure analysis of mechanical characterisation of asphalt mixes incorporating SEAM. The paper contains a brief overview of <b>sulfur</b> production, <b>recovery</b> processes and the global sulfur supply. It also highlights the fact that the sulfur industry is different from many other important modern mineral industries in that the disposal of surplus production of sulfur is becoming a more important issue than that of how to maintain sustainable production. To enable the reader to appreciate why in a SEAM modified asphalt excess sulfur crystallize out of the bitumen phase into the voids system, a cursory introduction to elemental sulfur allotropes and their thermodynamic stabilities in the solid and liquid states is also included. As SEAM technology is aimed at encapsulating large amounts of sulfur in asphalt mixes, a section is dedicated to examining the microbial oxidation of inorganic sulfur, its potential effects on bioleaching of polluted sediments and the relation between oxidised sulfur and the toxicity of mercury in aquatic systems. During the production stages of SEAM asphalt mixes, the sulfur component will convert from the solid into the liquid phase which requires careful thermal management to control gaseous emissions. As a consequence, this paper includes a general review of exposure limits for sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide emissions and their short and long term health effects on healthy and asthmatic individuals. Finally, the potential for metal corrosion in the presence of elemental sulfur is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Thus far, {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) {{have been used}} to convert carbon-based substrates to electricity. However, sulfur compounds are ubiquitously present in organic waste and wastewater. In this study, a MFC with a hexacyanoferrate cathodic electrolyte was used to convert dissolved sulfide to elemental sulfur. Two types of MFCs were used, a square type closed to the air and a tubular type in which the cathode compartment was open to the air. The square-type MFCs demonstrated a potential-dependent conversion of sulfide to sulfur. In the tubular system, up to 514 mg sulfide L- 1 net anodic compartment (NAC) day- 1 (241 mg L- 1 day- 1 total anodic compartment, TAC) was removed. The sulfide oxidation in the anodic compartment resulted in electricity generation with power outputs up to 101 mW L- 1 NAC (47 W m- 3 TAC). Microbial fuel cells were coupled to an anaerobic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, providing total removals of up to 98 % and 46 % of the sulfide and acetate, respectively.

40|$|Ideas {{introduced}} by Vaniman, Pettit and Heiken in their 1988 Uses of Lunar Sulfur are expanded. Particular attention {{is given to}} uses of SO 2 as a mineral-dressing fluid. Also introduced {{is the concept of}} using sulfide-based concrete {{as an alternative to the}} sulfur-based concretes proposed by Leonard and Johnson. Sulfur is abundant in high-Ti mare basalts, which range from 0. 16 to 0. 27 pct. by weight. Terrestrial basalts with 0. 15 pct. S are rare. For oxygen <b>recovery,</b> <b>sulfur</b> must be driven off with other volatiles from ilmenite concentrates, before reduction. Troilite (FeS) may be oxidized to magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and SO 2 gas, by burning concentrates in oxygen within a magnetic field, to further oxidize ilmenite before regrinding the magnetic reconcentration. SO 2 is liquid at - 20 C, the mean temperature underground on the Moon, at a minimum of 0. 6 atm pressure. By using liquid SO 2 as a mineral dressing fluid, all the techniques of terrestrial mineral separation become available for lunar ores and concentrates. Combination of sulfur and iron in an exothermic reaction, to form iron sulfides, may be used to cement grains of other minerals into an anhydrous iron-sulfide concrete. A sulfur-iron-aggregate mixture may be heated to the ignition temperature of iron with sulfur to make a concrete shape.

However, {{little is known about}} the impact of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the microbial functional structures in these systems. We used a high throughput tool (GeoChip) to evaluate the microbial community structures in a biological desulfurization reactor under micro-aerobic conditions (DO: 0. 02 - 0. 33 mg/L). The results indicated that the microbial community functional compositions and structures were dramatically altered with elevated DO levels. The abundances of dsrA/B genes involved in sulfate reduction processes significantly decreased (p < 0. 05, LSD test) at relatively high DO concentration (DO: 0. 33 mg/L). The abundances of sox and fccA/B genes involved in sulfur/sulfide oxidation processes significantly increased (p < 0. 05, LSD test) in low DO concentration conditions (DO: 0. 09 mg/L) and then gradually decreased with continuously elevated DO levels. Their abundances coincided with the change of sulfate removal efficiencies and elemental sulfur (S- 0) conversion efficiencies in the bioreactor. In addition, the abundance of carbon degradation genes increased with the raising of DO levels, showing that the heterotrophic microorganisms (e. g., fermentative microorganisms) were thriving under micro-aerobic condition.

40|$|CG- 4 H 2 S adsorbent, an {{iron oxide}} based solid, has high sulfur {{capacity}} (20 - 25 % w/w) and thus finds favor in users’ eyes in North America. This product, imported from CLEAN Catalysis and Purification Technologies Development Company in Shanxi Province, China, {{is now being}} used in gas processing companies in Alberta, Canada and Texas, USA. However, due to the elemental sulfur deposition on the adsorbent, the recovered sulfur capacity by regeneration is only about 1 / 3 as that of fresh adsorbent. This limits the adsorbent use to be once, which results in higher operating cost due to the frequent changeover and cost for landfills. The problem of sulfur deposition is also the limitation to the utilization and regeneration of other desulfurization adsorbent or catalyst. This study developed a process to recover the sulfur capacity of CG- 4 adsorbent by ammonia leaching to remove elemental sulfur. The leaching was conducted in a stainless steel cylindrical reactor at room temperature and a pressure higher than the vapor pressure of liquid ammonia. The leaching process does not deleteriously change the physical strength, but improve the properties of surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. The new regeneration process is able to recover over 90 % sulfur capacity in the first adsorption-regeneration cycle. The <b>sulfur</b> capacity <b>recovery</b> declined when CG- 4 had been leached {{for more than one}} time. Nonetheless, even after the third time leaching, the sulfur capacity was recovered by 60 %. The conditions of leaching process were optimized in a laboratory-scale experiment.

The separation of solid wash-offs and liquid ammonia was simply fulfilled by depressurizing the leaching vessel and vaporizing the ammonia. CG- 4 adsorbent is verified capable of at least three times reuses, which results in 60 % reduction in disposal amount per unit H 2 S being treated.

A comprehensive analysis of functional diversity, structure and metabolic potential of microbial communities was examined in two models by using functional gene array (GeoChip 2. 0). GeoChip data indicated that diversity indices, community structure, and abundance of functional genes were distinct between two models. Diversity indices (Simpson's diversity index (1 /D) and Shannon-Weaver index (H')) of all detected genes showed that with elevated influent loading rate, the functional diversity decreased in ISDD model but increased in DSR model. In contrast to ISDD model, the overall abundance of dsr genes was lower in DSR model, while some functional genes targeting from nitrate-reducing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (NR-SOB), such as Thiobacillus denitrificans, Sulfurimonas denitrificans, and Paracoccus pantotrophus were more abundant in DSR model which were highly associated with the change of S- 0 conversion rate obtained in two models.

40|$|One of {{the unique}} {{advantages}} of SOFCs over other types of fuel cells {{is the potential for}} direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels (it may involve internal reforming). Unfortunately, most hydrocarbon fuels contain sulfur, which would dramatically degrade SOFC performance at parts-per-million (ppm) levels. Low concentration of sulfur (ppm or below) is difficult to remove efficiently and cost-effectively. Therefore, knowing the exact poisoning process for state-of-the-art anode-supported SOFCs with Ni-YSZ cermet anodes, understanding the detailed anode poisoning mechanism, and developing new sulfur-tolerant anodes are essential to the promotion of SOFCs that run on hydrocarbon fuels. The effect of cell operating conditions (including temperature, H{sub 2 }S concentration, cell voltage/current density, etc.) on <b>sulfur</b> poisoning and <b>recovery</b> of nickel-based anode in SOFCs was investigated. It was found that sulfur poisoning is more severe at lower temperature, higher H{sub 2 }S concentration or lower cell current density (higher cell voltage). In-situ Raman spectroscopy identified the nickel sulfide formation process on the surface of a Ni-YSZ electrode and the corresponding morphology change as the sample was cooled in H{sub 2 }S-containing fuel. Quantum chemical calculations predicted a new S-Ni phase diagram with a region of sulfur adsorption on Ni surfaces, corresponding to sulfur poisoning of Ni-YSZ anodes under typical SOFC operating conditions. Further, quantum chemical calculations were used to predict the adsorption energy and bond length for sulfur and hydrogen atoms on various metal surfaces. Surface modification of Ni-YSZ anode by thin Nb{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } coating was utilized to enhance the sulfur tolerance. A multi-cell testing system was designed and constructed which is capable of simultaneously performing electrochemical tests of 12 button cells in fuels with four different concentrations of H{sub 2 }S. Through systematical study of state-of-the-art anode-supported SOFC button cells, it is seen that the long-term sulfur poisoning behavior of those cells indicate {{that there might be a}} second-stage slower degradation due to sulfur poisoning, which would last for a thousand hour or even longer.

40|$|The South African {{coal mining}} {{industry}} generates {{large volumes of}} coal ultrafine waste (< 150 microns) each year, with a significant amount being dumped in tailing slurry dams. These slurry dams {{have been associated with}} prolonged pollution and loss of valuable resources. In the two stage flotation process developed at the University of Cape Town, froth flotation is used to both recover coal (stage 1) and remove pyritic sulfur (stage 2) from ultrafine coal waste, resulting in three outputs streams: a saleable coal product, a small volume sulfide-rich stream, and a reduced volume sulfide lean tailings stream. Pre-disposal removal of sulfide <b>sulfur</b> and coal <b>recovery</b> by means of froth flotation is aimed at effectively removing the acid rock drainage (ARD) risk associated with sulfide bearing waste s and at recovering valuable resources respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this process for a number of coal waste types on a laboratory-scale, with results indicating {{that it is possible to}} recover large quantities of useable coal whilst generating a tailings waste stream with a reduced sulfur content and negligible ARD risk. An order of magnitude financial model for a fictitious plant has also been developed, and applied to demonstrate the economic viability for s elected case studies. To date, however, studies on the environmental viability of the process have only focused on the ARD mitigating potential of the two-stage flotation process and little attention has been given to the systemic environmental implication s of the process such as the energy and reagent usage. The research study therefore aims to evaluate the environmental burdens and benefits of the two-stage flotation process, particularly from a South African context, and to compare the environmental performance to the conventional disposal of untreated coal ultrafines. Furthermore, this project aims to establish which stages along the process contribute the most to the environmental burdens of the process and how the variations of the input parameters affect the overall environmental performance of the proposed process. To this end, a life cycle inventory of inputs and outputs was compiled on the basis of the empirical results derived from a previous laboratory-scale case study conducted on a sample of an acid generating ultrafine coal waste from the Waterberg region. Experimental results from the case study, which entailed two-stage flotation (using Naflote 9858 as a coal collector and xanthate (SIBX) as a sulfide collector in stages 1 and 2), and detailed characterisation of the feed and desulfurised tailings, was supplemented with literature information and data from mass and energy balance calculations for a fictitious plant. An environmental impact analysis was subsequently conducted using a combination of Life Cycle Impact Assessment and risk-based impact assessment techniques and criteria. The impact categories selected included climate change, terrestrial acidification, fossil fuel depletion, natural land transformation, aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk, aqueous acidification, salinity and consumptive water footprint. Aquatic water pollution risk, drinking water quality risk and aqueous acidification impact indicators were calculated by summing up risk potential factors for the constituents of the final disposed waste streams. The rest of the impact categories were calculated by multiplying the inventory result with a characterisation factor developed from impact assessment models The case study results indicated that the simple mentation of the two-stage flotation process results in a notable decrease in eco-toxicity, salinity, consumptive water footprint, metal toxicity, aqueous acidification, fossil fuel depletion and natural land transformation impacts. However, the results al so indicated an increase in atmospheric related impacts (climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts), which has been attributed to the additional energy consumption associated with the two-stage flotation process and the production processes associated with the flotation reagents. Analyses of the process contributions to the individual impact categories for the two-stage flotation process revealed the climate change and terrestrial acidification impact categories to be dominated by the electricity production process and the flotation reagents production process. The sensitivity analyses revealed a higher dependence of the fossil fuel depletion impact category on the percentage coal yield than the electricity consumption of the foreground process. Furthermore the sensitivity analyses indicated a strong dependence of the climate change and terrestrial acidification impacts on the electricity consumption and the SIBX dosage in the foreground process. In the South African context, implementation the two-stage flotation process would result in a significant recovery of coal (approximately 1. 2 million tonnes for every 4 million tonnes dry coal ultrafines lost per annum) and a sulfide-rich product which can be utilised for electricity production and sulfuric acid production respectively, hence promoting resource efficiency. Although higher than in the case of conventional land disposal, the energy used in the two-stage flotation process is infinitesimal compared to the energy recovered in the process through the generation of additional coal, and results in only a 0. 025 % increase in the annual greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of the two-stage flotation would also result in reduced water losses in comparison to conventional land disposal, which is beneficial in the South African context as South Africa is a water scarce region. Lastly whilst the implementation of the two-stage flotation process would result in the reduction of water related impacts associated with acidification, salinization and metal pollution, it might pose a further threat to aquatic life if the xanthate salt reagents are emitted to local water sources. The limitations of the study were mainly associated with the quality of the input and output data, the impact categories and the system boundary and scenario development. The multiple sources of information and the variations in literature of the energy input estimates were noted as a source of uncertainty. The lack of characterisation factors for some of the substances in the system as well as the exclusion of the possibility of utilization of the sulfide-lean stream were also part of the limitations associated with the study. Recommendations for future work include improving the environmental assessment by incorporating various case studies and by incorporating downstream processing as well as optimizing the two-stage flotation process by using less energy and by using less toxic flotation reagents...|$|R
