5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown {{over the last two}} hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Ludwig von Mises' {{insistence on}} methodological dualism was a {{reaction}} against “the ‘methodological monism’ preached by behaviorists and positivists who <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> basic <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> approach human behavior and social phenomena differently from the way natural scientists approach molecular behavior and physical phenomena.” ...|$|R
50|$|In May 2000, {{more than}} 22 years after {{resolution}} 425 was passed, Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon. Prior to the withdrawal, opposition voices inside Israel pressured {{the government to}} withdraw from Lebanon, as they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> valid <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> stay there and sustain Lebanese attacks.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands, Immanuel's Veins was not {{published}} {{because it was}} deemed by the Dutch publisher to be 'too sensual'. Dekker defended his novel by saying it was no more sensual than the Song of Solomon in the Bible. His American publisher, Thomas Nelson, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> publish the novel, and it was released in America on schedule.|$|R
5|$|Most Spanish Americans <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{recognize}} a rump government that {{was under the}} threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began {{to work for the}} creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and Río de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> hand it over to someone {{who had not been}} involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> concede priority {{in the south to}} the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
50|$|President Ma Ying-jeou {{addressed}} the students on November 13, 2008, saying that, while he {{believed there was}} room for improvement in Wang Cho-chiun and Tsai Chao-ming's handling of public assembly issues, he <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for them <b>to</b> step down.|$|R
5000|$|Schoen {{was away}} so instead {{it went to}} the undersecretary, Stemrich, who read it but passed it without comment to Reinhold Klehmet. Klehmet {{interpreted}} his instructions as meaning he should only correct any errors of fact but not otherwise comment. It was returned to Bülow, still unread, <b>to</b> Wilhelm, who <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> publish. It duly appeared in print and caused a storm. In the interview, Wilhelm expressed many controversial and offensive opinions: ...|$|R
6000|$|Rowland {{felt that}} his {{irritation}} had not subsided, and {{he himself had}} no taste for saying disagreeable things. Nevertheless he <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> sufficient <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> forbear uttering the words he had had on his conscience from the beginning. [...] "We must {{do what we can}} and be thankful," [...] he said. [...] "And let me assure you of this--that it won't help you to become entangled with Miss Light." ...|$|R
5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E
5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E
5000|$|As editor-in-chief, in August 2013 Rusbridger {{took the}} {{decision}} to destroy hard drives containing information leaked to The Guardian by Edward Snowden, rather than comply with a government demand {{to hand over the}} data. An alternative action was agreed and {{in the presence of the}} authorities the drives were destroyed, Rusbridger described performing the task as [...] "slightly pointless". [...] "Given that there were other copies, I <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> destroy this material ourselves." ...|$|R

2500|$|According to Sondheim, the {{producer}} Cameron Mackintosh asked for {{changes for the}} 1987 London production. [...] "I was reluctantly happy to comply, my only serious balk being at his request that I cut [...] "The Road You Didn't Take" ... I <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> try new things, knowing we could always revert to the original (which we eventually did). The net result was four new songs...For reasons which I've forgotten, I rewrote [...] "Loveland" [...] for the London production. There were only four showgirls in this version, and each one carried a shepherd's crook with a letter of the alphabet on it." ...|$|R

25|$|The Tour {{was first}} {{followed}} only by journalists from L'Auto, the organisers. The race was founded to increase sales of a floundering newspaper and its editor, Desgrange, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> allow rival publications to profit.|$|E
25|$|In public comments, Selig said he <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> reconsider Rose's punishment; however, in March 2003, Selig {{acknowledged}} that he was considering Rose's application, leading to speculation that Rose's return might be imminent. Ultimately, however, Selig took no action.|$|E

But I told you about this before--" ...|$|R
25|$|Latifa Elnadi {{was born}} on 29 October 1907 into middle-class family of Cairo. After {{completion}} of her primary education, {{it was expected that}} she would marry, becoming a housewife and mother. Her father, who worked for the government printing office, Matbaa Amiriya, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for ElNadi <b>to</b> pursue secondary education. Her mother encouraged her to attend the American College with its modern curriculum and focus as a language school.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to feminists' disagreements over Boobquake and Brainquake, some asked, [...] "Why not both?". Melody Moezzi, for example, {{writing for the}} blog of Ms., <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for there <b>to</b> be any conflict between the two events. Moezzi believed {{that there should be}} no problem with having multiple means of discrediting [...] "the leaders of the so-called Islamic Republic of Iran", and suggested that women participate in both events.|$|R
25|$|Discussion and {{adoption}} of Tongyong Pinyin, {{like many other}} initiatives in Taiwan, quickly acquired a partisan tone turning on issues of national identity: Chinese vs. Taiwanese identity. Officials who identified most strongly with the nation itself, such as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allied parties, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> adopt Hanyu Pinyin just because Mainland China and the UN had. If Tongyong Pinyin more adequately met the nation's needs, they saw this as ample justification for Taiwan to adopt it. Officials who identified more strongly with Chinese culture, such as the Kuomintang (KMT), <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> introduce a new system unique to Taiwan if Hanyu Pinyin had already gained international acceptance. Each side accused the other of basing its preference on anti-China or pro-China sentiment rather than an objective discussion of community goals.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} any {{offer at}} that stage of Sainsbury's recovery was likely to undervalue the business, and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated {{for the benefit of}} existing investors.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{defeated}} Chinese soldiers escaped to Amoy (Xiamen, 廈門) in mainland China or to Tai-wan-fu on junks and fishing boats {{under cover of}} darkness, though a number of soldiers were caught and {{handed over to the}} victorious French by the inhabitants of the Pescadores, who <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between two equally unwelcome sets of intruders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{efforts to}} control Afghanistan were further {{weakened}} by the British government in India. Dismayed at the costs of maintaining the large garrison in Kabul, it discontinued the periodic subsidies (essentially bribes) that had {{been paid to the}} various tribes in the region around Kabul and the Khyber Pass to keep the peace. Once these ended, the tribes <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> more <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> remain loyal to the British-supported regime. Macnaghten dismissed warnings from his officers, writing to his superiors in India that [...] "this is the usual state of Afghan society". As {{the spring and summer of}} 1841 progressed, British freedom of movement around Kabul became increasingly restricted.|$|R
50|$|Marshall then {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issues, {{and the argument}} of the Solicitor General that {{the section of the}} Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. First, Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. He <b>saw</b> of <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> begin now, especially since he did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce. In a 6-3 decision, Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non-Indians.|$|R
5000|$|Tre {{was very}} {{critical}} of Rorys performance, and was shown to have little respect for his leadership. Although Sir Alan warned Tre about his behaviour, stating that he [...] "did not know when to back down", he did not hold him responsible for the loss, and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> at all <b>to</b> keep Rory, who {{found it difficult to}} defend himself in the boardroom. By contrast, Tre had to be explicitly told to keep quiet to let Rory speak.|$|R
25|$|In 1868 he was {{appointed}} as the British consul in Damascus, an ideal post for someone with Burton's knowledge {{of the region and}} customs. However Burton made many enemies during his time there. He managed to antagonise much of the Jewish population of the area because of a dispute concerning money-lending. It had been the practice for the British consulate to take action against those who defaulted on loans but Burton <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue this practice and this caused a great deal of hostility.|$|E
25|$|The Presbyterian Church was {{not happy}} with the {{proposal}} to start the school. Aspinall became the guarantor, advancing the capital required, while the possibility of starting the school was still a matter of bitter contention within the Church hierarchy. Thus Scots opened as a private enterprise. Once the school was established and functioning, the Church Assembly <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue to oppose the idea of the school. In 1906 Aspinall sold the college to the Church for seven thousand pounds and so it became part of the Presbyterian education system in New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|In 971 the new Fatimid Caliphate {{entered the}} scene. With newly found zeal, the Fatimids took Egypt, Palestine, {{and much of}} Syria from the {{powerless}} Abbasids, who were beginning {{to have their own}} Turkic problems. Having defeated their Islamic opponents, the Fatimids <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> stop at Antioch and Aleppo, cities {{in the hands of the}} Christian Byzantines, making their conquest more important. A failed attack on Antioch in 971 was followed up by a Byzantine defeat outside of Amida. However, John I Tzimiskes would prove to be a greater foe than Nikephoros. With 10,000 Armenian troops and other levies he pushed south, relieving the Imperial possessions there and threatening Baghdad with an invasion. His reluctance to invade the Abbasid Capital, though poorly defended and demoralized, remains a mystery.|$|E

5000|$|After her {{graduation}} from U.P., del Mundo {{was offered a}} full scholarship to any school in the United States for further training in a medical field of her choice by President Manuel Quezon. She accepted the offer and chose to go to Harvard, arriving at Harvard Medical School in 1936. She was unwittingly enrolled in Harvard Medical School, an institution which did not yet then admit female students. As recounted in her official Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation biography: [...] Mundo humorously relates that when she arrived in Boston {{and went to the}} dormitory assigned her in a letter from the director of the hospital housing, much to her surprise she found herself in a men's dorm. Unknowingly the Harvard officials had admitted a female to their all-male student body. But because her record was so strong the head of the pediatrics department <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> accept her. Thus, upsetting Harvard tradition, she became the first Philippine woman and the only female at the time to be enrolled at the Harvard Medical School.|$|R
2500|$|In the 2007 Ontario provincial {{election}} the CAW as a union again endorsed strategic voting. [...] Hargrove, however, again {{went further}} to slam both the NDP and its leader, Howard Hampton. [...] He told {{the editorial board}} of the Toronto Star that the NDP had [...] "lost complete touch" [...] with the people of Ontario and that he <b>saw</b> [...] "absolutely <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> vote NDP." [...] Hargrove then went on to lavish praise on the Ontario Liberals, claiming the party had been [...] "more left than the NDP over the last four years" [...] and predicting left-leaning voters would vote Liberal in the upcoming election. The Ontario Liberal Party ultimately won a second consecutive majority government.|$|R
