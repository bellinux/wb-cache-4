Though the drama lasted over an hour, the adult hogs were recaptured unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Favio, {{flooding}} swept over Mozambique weeks earlier, forcing 163,000persons to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter.</b> The floods started in late December2006 when the Cahora Bassa Dam overflowed its banks. The floods escalated in February2007 when the Zambezi River broke its banks, flooding the surrounding areas in Mozambique. A total of 80,600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia provinces on February14. Twenty-nine people were confirmed dead due to the pre-Favio flood.|$|E

5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated {{many of the people}} who remained, taking them to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Arlene brought significant rainfall {{to parts}} of Central America, killing three people and triggering widespread flooding and landslides.

At least 22people in Mexico were killed by Arlene. Elsewhere, rainfall from the storm alleviated ongoing drought conditions in southern Texas and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Angela caused {{severe damage}} in the Philippines. It is {{estimated}} that 119 people perished, and 192 more were injured. Additionally, 	28 remained missing following the storm. In total, 219,178 people, or 39,095 families, were affected by the cyclone. About 33,309 homes sustained some degree of damage. The typhoon's intense winds and heavy rainfall triggered flooding and damaged crops. The hardest-hit areas were in the Cagayan province. Overall, the storm left approximately $8 million (1989 USD) in damage across the region. The same area was impacted by Typhoon Sarah in September. Angela forced thousands of residents to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> in evacuation centers.|$|E

Around 40% of the city's crops were wiped out.

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E

5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their {{blankets}} and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E
5|$|The Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began on 6 April. The bombing of Belgrade forced {{the government to}} <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> outside the city. From here, King Peter and General Simović planned to leave for exile. Maček, refusing to leave the country, resigned on 7 April and designated Juraj Krnjević as his successor. Maček returned to Zagreb. Three other ministers also refused to leave Yugoslavia: Ivan Andres and Bariša Smoljan of the HSS and Kulenović of the JMO. The government met on Yugoslav soil {{for the last time}} on 13 April near Pale. From here they travelled to Nikšić where they were flown out of the country to Athens.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{arose from}} the Third Mithridatic War being fought between Roman Republic and Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose {{daughter}} Cleopatra was married to Tigranes. Mithridates fled to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> with his son-in-law, and Rome invaded the Kingdom of Armenia. Having laid siege to Tigranocerta, the Roman forces fell back behind a nearby river when the large Armenian army approached. Feigning retreat, the Romans crossed at a ford and fell on the right flank of the Armenian army. After the Romans defeated the Armenian cataphracts, the balance of Tigranes' army, which was mostly made up of raw levies and peasant troops from his extensive empire, panicked and fled, and the Romans remained {{in charge of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|The predators of the {{tilefish}} {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish. Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish, but no evidence is seen of free-swimming tilefish {{being attacked by}} dusky sharks or sandbar sharks. The one listed predator for the tilefish is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or <b>seek</b> <b>shelter,</b> and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, {{large-scale}} search and rescue operations took place in the affected areas. A major disaster declaration was signed by President Bill Clinton the following day (May 4), allowing for the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. In light of the fatalities that occurred under highway overpasses, the notion of them being safe areas to <b>seek</b> <b>shelter</b> was dismissed, and they were from then on considered {{to be one of the}} most dangerous places to be during a tornado. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. In May 2013, similar areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track were again devastated by an EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area.|$|E
