40|$|Magistrsko delo skuša raziskati problem večnaglasnic v slovenščini z vidika splošnih fonoloških teorij. Zanimalo me je, ali obstaja razlika med tvorjenkami, za katere velja, da imajo več naglasov, in med tvorjenkami, za katere velja, da imajo en sam naglas. Raziskava je pokazala, da ni statistično značilnih razlik v trajanju in vrednostih formantnih frekvenc samoglasnikov, ki naj bi bili naglašeni, in samoglasnikov, ki naj ne bi bili. Lastnost, ki najjasneje ločuje naglašene samoglasnike od nenaglašenih, je daljše trajanje prvih. Pokazalo se je, da lahko glede na povprečne razlike v trajanju primerjanih samoglasnikov analizirane tvorjenke razvrstimo v tri različne skupine: tvorjenke s korenom v prvem delu, tvorjenke s predpono in tvorjenke s prevzeto sestavino. Analiza je potrdila, kar je pred tem ugotavljal že Jurgec (2007) : število naglasov in prominentnost sta odvisna od fonološke in morfološke zgradbe besed. Zloženke oz. tvorjenke s korenom in tvorjenke s prevzeto sestavino v prvem delu so dvo- ali večnaglasne, medtem ko so tvorjenke s predpono bodisi dvonaglasne bodisi enonaglasne.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Hungarian has initial primary <b>stress.</b> As for <b>secondary</b> <b>stress,</b> Varga (2000) distinguishes {{the following four}} types: 1. first syllable of the second member of a compound 2. first syllable of a deaccented word 3. first syllable of a polysyllabic function word 4. odd non-initial syllable of a non-compound stressed for metrical reasons The first three types of <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> are determined by morphological and/or syntactic factors, while the fourth type is purely phonological. In this paper, the term <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> always refers to the fourth, phonological type of stress. The assignment of <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> in Hungarian {{is far from being}} consensual. The most widely cited view, originating from (Hayes, 1995 : 330), citing Kerek (1971), is that the language displays a very basic quantity-insensitive left-to-right trochaic foot assignment, i. e., that <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> falls on every odd-numbered syllable...|$|R
50|$|Stress is not {{generally}} distinctive, but assigned by rule. Polysyllabic words receive primary {{stress on the}} first syllable, with <b>secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> tending to occur on alternate syllables thereafter; this rhythm may be broken by {{the structure of the}} word, so that there are sometimes three-syllable stress groups.|$|E

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> are {{apparent}} in words {{of more than}} two syllables and, in cases of shifting stress, can be added at the beginnings of words to reduce lapses (several adjacent syllables without any stress).

50|$|Stress in Finnish is non-phonemic. Like Hungarian and Icelandic, Finnish always {{places the}} primary {{stress on the}} first {{syllable}} of a word. <b>Secondary</b> <b>stress</b> normally falls on odd-numbered syllables. Contrary to primary <b>stress,</b> Finnish <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> is quantity sensitive. Thus, if <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> would normally fall on a light (CV.) syllable but {{this is followed by}} a heavy syllable (CVV. or CVC.), the <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> moves one syllable further ("to the right") and the preceding foot (syllable group) therefore contains three syllables. Thus, omenanani ("as my apple") contains light syllables only and has primary stress on the first syllable and secondary on the third, as expected: ómenànani. On the other hand, omenanamme ('as our apple') has a light third syllable (na) and a heavy fourth syllable (nam), so <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> falls on the fourth syllable: ómenanàmme.|$|R

5000|$|After we {{find the}} alliterative syllables in the two half-lines, we can assign stress {{according}} to their position and length of the syllables. This stress, or arsis, is usually placed on a syllable containing a long vowel. The stressed syllables are ordered along the same basic hierarchy of the alliteration; it is very rare that a stressed syllable would be a preposition or pronoun. Words such as God, King, and proper nouns, are very frequently stressed. [...] After we apply stresses to the appropriate syllables, we must find the unstressed and secondary-stressed syllables. The unstressed, or thesis, syllables are usually short, and frequently on the words that are lower in the hierarchy. <b>Secondary</b> <b>stresses</b> occur {{in only a few}} types of lines, and are usually only on the second part of a compound word.|$|E
50|$|In words {{where the}} primary stress {{falls on the}} third {{syllable}} or later. Here it is normal for <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> to be marked {{on one of the}} preceding syllables (which cannot normally be the one immediately preceding the primary stress). For example, interjection and evolution, which have their primary stress on the third syllable, consequently take <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> on their first syllables; organization and association both have primary stress on the fourth syllable, but have <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> on the first and second syllable respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{stress on}} a Niuean word is nearly {{always on the}} penult (second-to-last syllable), though multi-syllable words ending in a long vowel put primary stress on the final long vowel and <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> on the penult.

5000|$|Some {{languages}} {{are described as}} having both primary <b>stress</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>stress.</b> A syllable with <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress.

In English, it is not fully predictable: the words organization and accumulation both have primary stress on the fourth syllable, but the <b>secondary</b> <b>stress</b> comes on the first syllable in the former word and on the second syllable in the latter. In some analyses, for example the one found in Chomsky and Halle's The Sound Pattern of English, English has been described as having four levels of stress: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, but the treatments often disagree with one another.|$|R
