50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> {{technology}} utilizes <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> sticks {{instead of}} the fluid ink or toner powder usually used in printers. Some types of <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers use small spheres of <b>solid</b> <b>ink,</b> which are stored in a hopper before being transferred to the printing head by a worm gear. After the <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> is loaded into the printing device, it is melted and used to produce images on paper in a process similar to offset printing. Xerox claims that <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> printing produces more vibrant colors than other methods, is easier to use, can print {{on a wide range}} of media, and is more environmentally friendly due to reduced waste output. The sticks are non-toxic and safe to handle. In the mid-1990s, the president of Tektronix actually ate part of a stick of <b>solid</b> <b>ink,</b> demonstrating that they are safe to handle and presumably, eat. The medium of the ink was (at least at the time) made from food-grade processed vegetable oils.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> printer, the SI-480, was {{developed}} and released to the market in 1988 by Dataproducts Corporation. This was a monochrome printer that met with limited success. The first color <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> printer was also released by Dataproducts Corporation.|$|E
50|$|A second {{aspect of}} printer {{technology}} that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid ink, such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink {{are more difficult to}} alter than documents printed with toner or <b>solid</b> <b>inks,</b> which do not penetrate below the paper surface.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{spectral}} prediction model {{as well as}} new approaches for modeling ink spreading which occurs when printing ink layer superpositions. The spectral prediction model enhances the classical Clapper-Yule model by taking into account the fact that proportionally more incident light through a given colorant surface is reflected back onto the same colorant surface than onto other colorant surfaces. This is expressed by a weighted mean between a component specifying the part of the incident light which exits through the same colorant as the colorant from which it enters (Saunderson corrected Neugebauer component) and a component specifying the part of the incident light whose emerging light components exit from all colorants, with a probability to exit from a given colorant equal to that colorant surface coverage (Clapper-Yule component). We also propose two models for taking into account ink spreading, a phenomenon which occurs when printing an ink halftone in superposition with one or several <b>solid</b> <b>inks.</b> Besides the physical dot gain present within a single ink halftone print, we consider in the first model the ink spreading which occurs when an ink halftone is printed on top of one or two <b>solid</b> <b>inks.</b> In the second more advanced model, we generalize this concept to ink halftones printed on top or below <b>solid</b> <b>inks.</b> We formulate for both ink spreading models systems of equations which allow to compute effective ink coverages as a combination of the individual ink coverages which occur in the different superposition cases. The new spectral prediction model combined with advanced ink spreading yields excellent spectral predictions for clustered-dot color halftone prints, both in the case of offset (75 to 150 lpi) {{and in the case of}} thermal transfer printers (50 to 75 lpi) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the color separation technology on offset printing quality were considered. Analysis of control charts by Shugart revealed that stable optical properties on the print modes provided separations technology GCR Medium and UCR, which is also confirmed by a sufficient level of <b>solid</b> <b>ink?s</b> density (R = 1, 3 and R = 1, 75). Analysis {{of the distribution of}} values of printing contrast and its value within the print suggests that for uncoated paper and paperboard type chrome-ersatz best contrast achieved with the use of technology UCR and GCR Medium. Thus, a wide range of printing materials may be regulated by the application of color modes UCR and GCR Medium. Also, modes of printing process in this case is more manageable projected to secure printing process for any printing presses. ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ??????. ?? ??????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????????...|$|R

50|$|Due {{to the way}} <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> {{printers}} put the ink {{onto the}} page, print quality {{is considered to be}} excellent, with bright colors. Excellent results can be achieved with low-quality stock, as the wax covers the stock with a glossy, almost opaque, surface. <b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers are able to print on many different types and thicknesses of media. They are much less sensitive to changes in media type than are color laser printers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> {{printers}} have {{an advantage}} over ink-jet printers for situations involving intermittent use with long periods of downtime. This is because melted <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> that has subsequently cooled and re-solidified inside the ink-delivery pathways is {{a normal part of}} printer operation. So, this cooled-and-solidified ink does not dry out. And, while the printer is not operating, the solidified wax helps to prevent oxygen and moisture from interacting with many internal parts of the ink-delivery components.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010, they {{released}} {{in collaboration with}} Swedish brand Byredo their first eau-de-parfum fragrance [...] "M/MINK", inspired {{by the smell of}} <b>solid</b> Asian <b>ink</b> they regularly use across their designs. In order to achieve this smell, they chose three pictures concerning ink to Ben Gorham, the head of Byredo, so that he can get an idea of how Augustyniak and Amzalag want the eau-de-parfum to smell like.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> {{contaminants}} in <b>ink</b> blocks can clog printhead nozzles when using original or compatible inks, and may require costly printhead replacement.

50|$|Because <b>solid</b> {{blocks of}} <b>ink</b> are used, {{there is less}} waste {{generated}} than is with laser printers or inkjet printers, which produce empty ink or toner cartridges, in addition to packaging and packing materials. A loose ink block does not leave any residual cartridge after it is consumed - only a crushable, thin, plastic packing tray and a recyclable cardboard packaging box.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Ray {{conceived}} Minimalist works using ink and wire. In Ink Box (1986), a large cube is {{filled to the}} brim with ink, giving the illusion of a <b>solid</b> cube. <b>Ink</b> Line (1987) is a continuous stream of black ink traveling from a dime-size opening in the ceiling into a similar hole in the floor. In Spinning Spot (1987), a section of the floor measuring 24 inches in diameter is set spinning at 33 RPM. Consisting of a single 8.5 foot length of wire, both ends of Moving Wire (1988) protrude from the wall and are set 14 inches apart; as one end of the wire extends out from the wall at random intervals, the other retracts.|$|R
50|$|The {{first issue}} was 84 pages, and {{contained}} very few ads. The editorial staff with Bruce Jackson a photographer from New York had {{determined to keep}} the total production of the magazine in house for absolute control of quality and costs. The cover for the first issue, features Dave Sheridan, taken by photographer Michael Heinichen. It {{was the most difficult}} cover to print, which required large areas of <b>solid</b> black <b>ink.</b> J. David Moriaty had worked hard with the staff to save this difficult run. After many long days, he managed to print the covers without too many defects to the magazine. This saved the first issue, {{due to the lack of}} money Rip Off Press had in their budget.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers, {{also known}} as phase-change printers, are a type of thermal {{transfer}} printer. They use solid sticks of CMYK-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. <b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. <b>Solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers. Drawbacks of the technology include high energy consumption and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from pens, and are difficult to feed through automatic document feeders, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, Xerox, manufactured {{as part of their}} Xerox Phaser office printer line. Previously, <b>solid</b> <b>ink</b> printers were manufactured by Tektronix, but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.|$|E

50|$|Another {{convention}} is to employ percentages, so {{the scale is}} then from 0% to 100%. This is used for a more intuitive approach, but if only integer values are used, the range encompasses a total of only 101 intensities, which are insufficient to represent a broad gradient of grays. Also, the percentile notation is used in printing to denote how much ink is employed in halftoning, but then the scale is reversed, being 0% the paper white (no ink) and 100% a <b>solid</b> black (full <b>ink).</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{formulation}} of a high Ag loading (45 wt %) aqueous ink and its subsequent printing on three different ceramic substrates were reported. Monodispersed Ag nanoparticles with a size down to 10 nm were successfully synthesized in aqueous medium.

The printed tracks show the electrical conductivity of 3 μΩcm close to the value of silver bulk (1. 6 μΩcm). The use of high <b>solid</b> loading <b>inks</b> reduces the number of printed layers required for thick, dense and conductive film thus leading to the reduction of the costs, and high efficiency of the printing process. High solid loading also results in the finer printed features. The effect of substrates, printing temperature and dot spacing on the size and morphology of printed silver features was investigated. Increasing the dot spacing together with the substrates temperature resulted in the limited ink spreading, hence narrow printed line and improved geometry of printed patt...|$|R

Our result {{may be viewed}} at significant magnification, compresses well, and lends itself nicely to painterly re-rendering (shown on the right), as well as advanced editing, such as decomposition into layers for a tour-into-the-picture application (see supplementary video). Input image c ○ Dupuis. We introduce a method for automated conversion of scanned color comic books and graphical novels into a new high-fidelity rescalable digital representation. Since crisp black line artwork and lettering {{are the most important}} structural and stylistic elements in this important genre of color illustrations, our digitization process is geared towards faithful reconstruction of these elements. This is a challenging task, because commercial presses perform halftoning (screening) to approximate continuous tones and colors with overlapping grids of dots. Although a large number of inverse haftoning (descreening) methods exist, they typically blur the intricate black artwork. Our approach is specifically designed to descreen color comics, which typically reproduce color using screened CMY inks, but print the black artwork using non-screened <b>solid</b> black <b>ink.</b> After separating the scanned image into three screening grids, one for each of the CMY process inks, we use non-linear optimization to fit a parametric model describing each grid, and simultaneously recover the non-screened black ink layer, which is then vectorized. The result of this process is a high quality, compact, and rescalable digital representation of the original artwork...|$|R
