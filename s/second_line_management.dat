40|$|The overactive bladder {{syndrome}} (OAB) negatively {{affects the}} daily life {{of many people}} worldwide and conservative treatments, such as antimuscarinics, not always bring relief and/or are associated with considerable side effects resulting in treatment failure. Second line treatment options used to be invasive surgical procedures. However, less radical, minimally invasive and reversible alternatives, such as sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin A have emerged. Of these, only sacral neuromodulation with InterStim Therapy has been approved for OAB and been recommended by the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) in 2004. Nevertheless, depending of country rules and habits, both seem {{to be used by}} urologists in clinical practice for treating idiopathic OAB (I OAB). Therefore, this review attempts to provide an update on the available clinical evidence concerning the efficacy and safety, and the current position of sacral neuromodulation and botulinum toxin A in the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> <b>management</b> of adults with I OAB. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{low back}} pain is a common {{condition}} resulting in pain and disability. Current national and international guidelines advocate general practitioner care including advice and paracetamol (4 g daily in otherwise well adults) as {{the first line of}} care for people with acute {{low back pain}}. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) are advocated in many guidelines as <b>second</b> <b>line</b> <b>management</b> options for patients with acute low back pain who are not recovering. No studies have explored the role of NSAIDs and/or SMT in addition to first line management for acute low back pain. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate if NSAIDs and/or SMT in addition to general practitioner advice and paracetamol results in shorter recovery times for patients with acute low back pain. The secondary aims of the study are to evaluate whether the addition of SMT and/or NSAIDs influences pain, disability and global perceived effect at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after onset of therapy for patients with significant acute low back pain. Methods/design: This paper presents the rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial examining the addition of NSAIDs and/or SMT in 240 people who present to their general practitioner with significant acute low back pain. 6 page(s...|$|E

Methods: (i) Review of CPGs for acute seizure management at PREDICT sites. (ii) A standardised anonymous survey of senior emergency doctors at PREDICT sites investigating management of status epilepticus (SE). Results: Ten sites used seven different seizure CPGs. One site had no seizure CPG. First <b>line</b> <b>management</b> was with benzodiazepines (10 sites). <b>Second</b> <b>line</b> and subsequent <b>management</b> included phenytoin (10), phenobarbitone (10), thiopentone (9), paraldehyde (6) and midazolam infusion (5). Of 83 available consultants, 78 (94 %) responded. First <b>line</b> <b>management</b> of SE without intravenous (IV) access included diazepam per rectum (PR) (49 %), and midazolam intramuscular (41 %) and via the buccal route (9 %). First <b>line</b> <b>management</b> of SE with IV access included midazolam IV (50 %) and diazepam IV (44 %). The <b>second</b> <b>line</b> agent was phenytoin (88 %); third line agents were phenobarbitone (33 %), thiopentone and intubation (32 %), paraldehyde PR (22 %) and midazolam infusion (6 %). Fourth line agents were thiopentone and intubation (60 %), phenobarbitone (16 %), midazolam infusion (13 %) and paraldehyde (9 %).

40|$|Introduction: HIV-infected {{children}} in resource-poor settings comprise a unique population who require antiretroviral therapy (ART) in careful consideration {{of social and}} structural barriers to compliance. Given these aggregate challenges and emerging research into “holding” treatment options, we investigated the efficacy of lamivudine monotherapy (LM) {{as an alternative to}} more complex <b>second</b> and third <b>line</b> therapies. Methods: A retrospective review of all eligible LM events (= 6 months) from a cohort of two linked health facilities in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa was undertaken. Events were disaggregated according to absolute CD 4 count at initiation (Group 1 : > 200 cells/L, n= 64; Group 2 := 200 cells/L, n= 10). Study endpoints were defined as a decline of absolute CD 4 = 200 cells/L (Group 1), WHO stage 3 or 4 event (Groups 1 & 2), or initiation of <b>second</b> or third <b>line</b> (Groups 1 & 2). Results: Seventy-four eligible LM events were identified among 71 HIV-positive children (58 % male; median age at LM 9. 7 years and median LM duration 11. 5 months). CD 4 decreases and measured WHO stage 3 or 4 events did not yield overall significance between groups (Table 1). No deaths were recorded. Conclusions: LM offers a promising alternative approach to ART management in young patients with an absolute CD 4 > 200 cells/L pending availability and/or willingness to adhere to <b>second</b> or third <b>line</b> therapies. In more immunocompromised children, LM may be considered as a last option if either the child or caretaker has concerns about <b>second</b> or third <b>line</b> <b>management,</b> or has defaulted repeatedly...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} accounting {{has emerged from}} developments in accounting, with roots, in a broader sense {{over a period of}} the past forty years, and in the narrow sense, over the past ten years. The development reveals two distinct lines of analysis. The first line is the philosophical debate about accountability, if and how it contributes to sustainable development, and which are the necessary steps towards sustainability. This approach is based on an entirely new system of accounting designed to promote a strategy of sustainability. The <b>second</b> <b>line</b> is the <b>management</b> perspective associated with varied terms and tools towards sustainability. This could be seen as an extension of or modification to conventional financial cost or management accounting. The former may be more appealing: To develop sustainability accounting de novo allows a complete reappraisal of the relative significance of social, environmental and economic benefits and risks and their interactions in corporate accounting systems.The development which leads to sustainable accounting could be distinguished in several time periods in which a number of trends were evident: 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-1995 and up to the present. These periods distinguish in volume of empirical studies, normative statements, philosophical discussion, teaching programmes, literature and regulatory frameworks.|$|R

40|$|Southern Africa has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} of HIV worldwide, and South Africa {{has the highest}} number of HIV infected people. South Africa and other resource-limited countries provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people with HIV, with limited, standardized regimens for first <b>line</b> and <b>second</b> <b>line.</b> Patients who fail first line treatment are put on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> regimens, yet options for third line are very limited. The first study looks at predictors of first line treatment failure in South Africa and develops a predictive model that can estimate absolute risk of treatment failure over 5 years on ART, given a baseline profile of clinical and demographic factors. The model was developed with accelerated failure time models, using predictors that maximized discrimination between patients. The model can be used to identify patients who need adherence interventions, and to estimate how changes in baseline parameters in the population influence long-term need for <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. The <b>second</b> study explores whether delays from detection of first line treatment failure until <b>second</b> <b>line</b> treatment initiation, which are widespread in South Africa, decrease the effectiveness of <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. Marginal structural models were used to include patients who never switched to <b>second</b> <b>line</b> after failure in analysis. This study shows that, despite potency of <b>second</b> <b>line</b> drugs, short delays in <b>second</b> <b>line</b> among very sick patients can lead to worse outcomes. These findings may be due to drug resistance, immune system damage, and/or lack of adherence to medication. The third study examines whether switch in type of NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which is a drug class used in both first and <b>second</b> <b>line</b> regimens) from first <b>line</b> to <b>second</b> <b>line</b> improves outcomes on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. While a switch in NRTI is recommended by treatment guidelines, it cannot always occur due to contraindications to some NRTIs. Using clinical data from South Africa and Zambia and adjusting for propensity scores, we see that switching from zidovudine in first line to a different NRTI in <b>second</b> <b>line</b> leads to less treatment failure on <b>second</b> <b>line,</b> suggesting that NRTI resistance {{may play a role in}} <b>second</b> <b>line</b> outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Most {{patients}} who experience virologic failure (VF) on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low-middle income countries fail due to poor adherence rather than antiretroviral resistance. A simple adherence tool designed to detect VF would conserve resources by rationally limiting need for viral load (VL) testing and, {{in those countries}} with access to third line ART, the need for resistance testing. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study of {{patients who}} initiated <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART at a clinic in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Using clinical and pharmacy refill data extracted from the clinic’s electronic database, we determined risk factors for VF. Three different methods of calculating short term pharmacy refill adherence were evaluated and compared with long term adherence since <b>second</b> <b>line</b> initiation. We also explored the ability of differing durations of short term pharmacy refill to predict VF on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. Results: We included 274 patients with a median follow up of 27 months on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. VF ranged between 3 % and 16 % within each six month interval after initiating <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. 243 patients {{with at least one}} VL after 4 months on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> were analysed in the statistical analysis. Pharmacy refill adherence assessed over shorter periods (4 to 6 months) predicted virologic suppression as well as pharmacy refill assessed over longer periods. The risk of VF fell 73 % with each 10 % increase in adherence measured from pharmacy refills over a 4 month period. Low CD 4 count at <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART initiation was a significant independent risk factor for VF. Conclusion: Patients identified as poorly adherent by short term pharmacy refill are at risk for VF on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART. This pragmatic adherence tool could assist in identifying patients who require adherence interventions, and help rationalize use of VL monitoring and resistance testing among patients on <b>second</b> <b>line</b> ART...|$|R

40|$|As safety professionals, we {{strive to}} {{implement}} a robust safety process in our organizations to maximize worker protection. We sell our philosophy and ideas to senior management, and then work with <b>line</b> <b>management</b> and the work force {{to develop and implement}} the safety process. Through this effort, we are likely to accomplish two major objectives. First, we obtain buy-in from <b>line</b> <b>management</b> and the workers, maybe even ownership for the safety process we implement. Second, we increase the likelihood that the hazards (and necessary controls) associated with the work activities performed by our workforce are identified and addressed by the safety process we implement. Our ambition is to maximize safety and health in the work place, and prevent injuries. Realizing this goal improves overall business operations. Petersen suggests an accident is an indication of something wrong in the management system (Petersen, pg 15). Successful organizations operate with the safety process fully integrated into the management system. If the management system fails, the safety process has failed the worker. As safety professionals, we must ask ourselves whether we did our job adequately. The better organizations strive for continuous improvement. The overall success of safety processes, in terms of accident and injury prevention has improved since safety professionals have learned to involve <b>line</b> <b>management</b> and the workers in the process. Although we maintain the label of 'safety expert', our role has shifted somewhat to that of a 'facilitator' in the process. The role of the safety professional is to advise and counsel <b>line</b> <b>management</b> (Kohn & Ferry, pg 28). <b>Line</b> <b>management</b> owns safety! If you subscribe to this philosophy, our role of advisor to <b>line</b> <b>management</b> makes perfect sense. Most safety professionals no longer operate as the 'safety cop'. That role belongs to <b>line</b> <b>management.</b> Instead, our role falls into the category of 'oversight' or facilitator. We observe systems, processes and work activities, and then convey our findings and observations to <b>line</b> <b>management.</b> We advise them with regard to what they need to do, and then we help them find workable methods to implement those solutions. <b>Line</b> <b>management</b> owns the responsibility to implement the process and to monitor safety on a daily basis. Safety professionals advocate safety and facilitate process implementation. We help <b>line</b> <b>management</b> meet their responsibilities with regard to safety. Maximizing safety performance is achieved by maximizing the safety process. Robust safety processes serve as the model and are earmarked by vigorous support of both labor and management. Where a robust safety process exists, the safety professional enjoys interest and support on the part of management and workers. People are motivated to achieve success and willingly accept their roles and responsibilities. Work activities are appropriately planned. Hazards are identified and controlled to safeguard the worker. Work activities are reviewed on a regular basis to avoid the process becoming stale. Goals are established and communicated and serve as a basis on which performance can be measured. People throughout the organization understand their role and responsibilities and are accountable for meeting them...|$|R
