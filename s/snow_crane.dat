50|$|The Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), {{also known}} as the Siberian white crane or the <b>snow</b> <b>crane,</b> is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. They are {{distinctive}} among the cranes, adults are nearly all snowy white, except for their black primary feathers that are visible in flight and with two breeding populations in the Arctic tundra of western and eastern Russia. The eastern populations migrate during winter to China while the western population winters in Iran and formerly, in India and Nepal. Among the cranes, they make the longest distance migrations. Their populations, particularly those in the western range, have declined drastically in the 20th century due to hunting along their migration routes and habitat degradation. The world population was estimated in 2010 at about 3,200 birds, mostly belonging to the eastern population with about 95% of them wintering in the Poyang Lake basin in China, a habitat that may be altered by the Three Gorges Dam. In western Siberia there are only around ten of these cranes in the wild.|$|E
40|$|The <b>snow</b> <b>crane</b> flies {{belonging}} to the genus Chionea (Diptera, Limoniidae) have a Holarctic distribution, with 17 Palaearctic and 18 Neartic species. In this paper two new species of snow flies, Chionea olympiae and Chionea dolomitana, are described from specimens collected in the Alps. The description of C. olympiae is based on males from northwestern Italy, collected in a mountainous area {{belonging to}} the ercinic massif of Mount Rosa. The description of the second species, C. dolomitana, is based on specimens from northeastern Italy, collected in the Dolomites and Venetian Pre-Alps in an altitudinal range between 1000 and 2500 m. Chionea araneoides previously thought to occur throughout the Alps, seems not {{to occur in the}} southeastern Alp...|$|E
40|$|Winter-active insects have {{attracted}} the attention of numerous biologists. Since the beginning of the 19 th century such research focused on their ecology (activity on snow cover, caves, burrows) and morphology (apterism). Th e most abundant winter active insects belong to the Diptera. Th e <b>snow</b> <b>crane</b> fl ies belonging to the genus Chionea (Diptera, Limoniidae) have an Holarctic distribution with 14 Palaearctic and 18 Nearctic species. Few data about these organisms have been reported from Eastern Asia. Th is region represents a very interesting area, from a biogeographical point of view, to investigate the spread and evolution of this genus. In this paper Chionea (Chionea) mirabilis n. sp., from South Korea is described and illustrated. Th is species shows two very interesting particularities not present in other species: the apically enlarged tibiae and wings that are longer than in the other described species...|$|E

50|$|At Holly's funeral, Bigby informs <b>Snow</b> that <b>Crane</b> is {{the prime}} suspect, as {{he was the one}} who made Lily glamour as Snow White and had sex with her. Snow White is {{disturbed}} by this revelation as the Tweedles show up and wound Bigby, Holly, and Grendel with their shotguns. After Bigby recovers they find out that Crane smashed the magic mirror and took a piece with him to avoid them finding him. After some investigation he and Snow end up at Aunty Greenleaf's place, who has been supplying Crane with illegal glamour for years. Snow orders Bigby to burn down Greenleaf's tree and it is up to the player of whether they choose to do so or not, which does have consequences as Greenleaf does bring up Snow's actions in the game's climax. They go to the Pudding N Pie and capture Crane, but once they start leaving they confront the Tweedles and Bloody Mary, who prove tough enough for Bigby to enter his werewolf form (which possibly results in Dum's death). He is severely injured by Mary, and <b>Snow</b> gives <b>Crane</b> up in order to save Bigby.|$|R

50|$|Ichabod Crane is also {{featured}} in the 2013 episodic video game, The Wolf Among Us, developed and produced by Telltale Games. In the game, Crane (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) is the deputy mayor of Fabletown, a secret community of magical, fairytale beings who were exiled from their Homelands centuries ago and forced {{to live in the}} world of mundane humans. In episodes 2 through three, Crane was revealed to have been soliciting prostitutes and using a magic spell to make them look like his assistant Snow White; Sheriff Bigby Wolf and <b>Snow</b> arrest <b>Crane</b> for this and embezzling Fabletown's money to pay for them, but Crane is then kidnapped by the minions of the Crooked Man, the crime lord Crane owes money to.|$|R

2500|$|The {{area around}} the falls, despite its urban setting, is a habitat for many animal and bird species. Among the birds {{commonly}} found {{in the area are}} bald eagles, California gulls, Canada geese, cliff swallows, eared grebes, egrets, golden eagles, American goldfinches, gray catbirds, house wrens, ibises, ospreys, red-necked grebes, sandhill <b>cranes,</b> <b>snow</b> geese, tundra swans, turkey vultures, western grebes, western meadowlarks, white pelicans, and numerous species of duck, owl, and warbler. Common animal species in the area include beavers, mule deer, muskrats, river otters, and white-tailed deer. Beavers are so common in the area that officials consider them pests, and trees in city parks have had to be protected against them. (At one point, beavers were chewing down two trees nightly on Black Eagle Memorial Island. These included two red oak trees found growing on the hill above the damâ€”the only two red oak trees in northcentral Montana).

40|$|Grasslands have {{provided}} fundamental {{goods and services}} to humankind for millennia. In many of the worldâ€™s mountain regions, pastoralists (livestock herders) have benefited from and maintained alpine grassland biodiversity through sustainable land use practices. In recent times, however, many new factors have begun to impact even the remotest ecosystems. Developments {{far removed from the}} grassroots â€“ both literally and metaphorically â€“ now largely determine the future of these critical habitats, both their biodiversity and the local people that they support. The Tibetan plateau is the highest and largest alpine grassland region in the world. Situated in western China, its vast rangelands form the headwaters of Asiaâ€™s most important rivers, including the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra rivers, and they are home for the internationally endangered Tibetan antelope, wild yak, <b>snow</b> leopard, black-necked <b>crane,</b> and other Central Asian wildlife. Tibetan pastoralists also have inhabited the region for many centuries and their survival in this exceptionally harsh environment is testimony to the sustainability of traditional resource management practices. In recent decades, however, as the Tibetan plateau region has become increasingly integrated with the rest of China, many new socio-economic and political realities hav...|$|R

5000|$|Seton bought new, {{specialized}} {{traps and}} carefully concealed them in Lobo's territory, but he later found Lobo's tracks leading from trap to trap, exposing each. When an effort, that was initially {{supposed to take}} two weeks, stretched into 4 months of failed attempts to capture Lobo, Seton became tired and frustrated. While camping out above the creek where <b>snow</b> geese and <b>cranes</b> were wintering, he found Lobo's track strangely following a set of smaller tracks. Quickly he realized Lobo's weakness: his mate, a white wolf nicknamed Blanca. Seton then set out several traps in a narrow passage thinking Blanca would fall for Seton's planted baits that Lobo had thus far managed to avoid. Finally Seton succeeded; Blanca, while trying to investigate Seton's planted cattle head, became trapped. When Seton found her, she was whining with Lobo by her side. Lobo ran to a safe distance and watched as Seton and his men kill Blanca by shooting her and tying her to their horses. Seton heard the howls of Lobo for two days afterward. Lobo's calls were described by Seton as having [...] "an unmistakable note of sorrow in it... It {{was no longer the}} loud, defiant howl, but a long, plaintive wail." [...] Although Seton felt remorse for the grieving wolf, he continued his plan to capture Lobo.|$|R
