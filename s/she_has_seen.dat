5|$|Liz {{is worried}} when she smells maple syrup in her {{apartment}} and Jack tells her {{that it could be}} the chemical agent Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for The Amazing Race and, in fact, not terrorists.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Reyes meet in an FBI records room, {{where she}} divulges {{the story about}} the death of Doggett’s son, Luke: years ago, when Doggett’s son disappeared, the FBI were called in to investigate. Reyes was one of the agents on the case. They never found the killer, and when they {{discovered}} Luke’s body, both Reyes and Doggett saw it transform into ashes instantly. Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it. Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> it again.|$|E
5|$|Carlotta {{continues}} to sing, {{but her voice}} croaks (as {{a result of the}} Phantom tampering with her throat spray) and the lead role is given to Christine. While the ballet is being performed, the Phantom, not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof.

60|$|Too, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> me {{conversing with}} other men upon the earth's surface. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{the arrival of the}} caravan of books and arms, and ammunition, and the balance of the {{heterogeneous}} collection which I had crammed into the cabin of the iron mole for transportation to Pellucidar.|$|R
6000|$|But {{how much}} oftener <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>seen</b> {{him at the}} other door! How in her grievous reveries <b>had</b> <b>she</b> gnashed her teeth and torn her hair when she saw his start of rapturous delight {{as he opened the}} door of the lady! How her soul had burned in agony when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him rush to meet that woman, with her {{flushing}} cheek and sparkling eye of triumph; when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the joy of recovered life; when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard the glad shouts from the multitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make them man and wife before her very eyes; and when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> them walk away together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous shouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek was lost and drowned! ...|$|R
5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E
25|$|The Cheshire cat fades {{until it}} disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin {{suspended}} in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. This echoes ancient questions in logic about substances and predicates.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator for the Bata Shoe Museum, {{traces the}} high heel to male horse-riding warriors in the Middle East who used high heels for functionality, because they help hold the rider's foot in stirrups. She {{states that the}} {{earliest}} high heel <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> is depicted on a 9th-century AD ceramic bowl from Persia.|$|E
60|$|Since then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} live, to realise that men lived, thought and felt, {{that they had}} other desires but those of {{pleasing}} the Cæsar or winning his good graces. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a man offering his life to save another's, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him clinging to a strange symbol which seemed {{to bring peace to}} his heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> Monkhams?" [...] he said. Monkhams was his father's seat, a very grand {{place in}} Worcestershire. Of course he {{knew very well}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> Monkhams. How should <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it? ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{might be}} {{explained}} by one of four hypotheses. It was either a phantom of her brain, and her being fully awake, although recently dwelling on the recollection, rendered that idea less probable, or {{the young man had}} not been killed and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him in propria persona.|$|R
25|$|Sarah {{looks up}} and sees birds flying by. Leslie becomes defensive. Nancy {{explains}} to Sarah that the birds are seagulls. The females compare them to underwater rays. Nancy tells Sarah that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> photographs of rays. Nancy and Charlie cannot explain what photography is to her, so Sarah believes they are insulting her. When Leslie returns, Sarah explains what has happened.|$|E
25|$|Blissfully {{unaware of}} the gangs' plans for that night, Maria daydreams with her friends, Rosalia, Consuelo, Teresita and Francisca, about seeing Tony ("I Feel Pretty"). Later, as Maria dances on the roof happily because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> Tony and {{believes}} he went to stop the rumble, Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo. Maria flees to her bedroom, praying that Chino is lying. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they {{find themselves in a}} dreamlike world of peace ("Somewhere").|$|E
25|$|Luciana is Giovanni's {{youngest}} daughter, out of four. At {{thirteen years}} old, {{she is a}} very spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school to find that her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. Entranced by the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her as well as she is particularly beautiful for her age. Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end.|$|E
60|$|Sally turned restlessly, and, having turned {{remained}} {{for a long}} instant transfixed and rigid. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> something, and what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> was enough to surprise any girl {{in the privacy of}} her bedroom. From underneath the bed there peeped coyly forth an undeniably masculine shoe and six inches of a grey trouser-leg.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it young, and growing, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it {{strong and}} grown, and before her old eyes had time or {{strength}} {{to see any}} more, she died. <b>She</b> would <b>have</b> tried, and who knows but <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> kept it young and strong, with her old fingers, her trembling kisses--a little longer; alas! not even Aunt Ann could fight with Nature.|$|R

25|$|Along the {{way they}} find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who calls himself Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off the {{emotions}} of his victims, and starts to feed off of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues directly into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. Patrick is freed and soon his special talent becomes evident: his drawings and paintings become reality. As their travels bring them nearer to the Dark Tower, Susannah comes {{to the conclusion that}} Roland needs to complete his journey without her. Susannah asks Patrick to draw a door <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> in her dreams to lead her out of this world. He does so and once it appears, Susannah says goodbye to Roland and crosses over to another world.|$|E
25|$|Several months {{pass with}} Carlisle {{monitoring}} Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter Irina sees Renesmee {{from a distance}} and believes her to be an immortal child. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and {{because they could not}} be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the Volturi to report what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen.</b> Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she can now extend to protect others from attacks.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E
60|$|Fanny made no reply. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{with her}} own eyes the man lying still and white, as if in death; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the new nurse rushing off, crying that he was dead. Now she {{was told that he}} was quite well, and that he had gone away! But it was no time for thought.|$|R

500|$|Elizabeth's many {{historic}} {{visits and}} meetings include a state {{visit to the}} Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms.

500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Windsor based Peggy on Violet Kray, mother of the infamous East End gangsters, the Kray twins; however Windsor has denied this. Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> in East End pubs and her own mother: [...] "women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, they get it wrong slightly...Some things I've done with Peggy is from my Mum. She {{was one of those}} East End snobs. I drew on all of those experiences." [...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone found {{similarities}} between the video for [...] "Sweet Dreams", Kanye West's video for [...] "Paranoid" [...] (2009) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes. Canadian magazine Dose also compared the video with [...] "Paranoid" [...] due to their similar dream sequences. Nadia Mendoza of The Sun further compared Knowles' look in the video with Lady Gaga's. Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video, writing that [...] "the dark, horror-type music, the pumping heartbeat, the equally spooky lullaby, the screech of an electric guitar", gave her the impression that she was watching [...] "some 80s magician, with a Knowles soundtrack". However, she complimented {{the rest of the}} video writing that [...] "things (thankfully) move away from the Hallowe'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory (right from the fact it's proper 80s pop through to the video essentially being 'Single Ladies' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers)". Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé's finest and more memorable work, but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> since [...] "Crazy in Love". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in [...] "Single Ladies".|$|E
60|$|Estella {{reflected}} {{without the}} least envy that Miss LeMar was very beautiful. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> {{anyone who was}} really beautiful before--beautiful with the loveliness of the heroines in the novels she sometimes read or the pictures <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R

500|$|Kim {{was working}} as an intern at Seoul University Medical Clinic when the Korean War broke out. He went to Pusan on June 1, 1951, the day the North Korean army retreated. In Pusan, Kim met Oh Young-jin, a fellow Pyongyang National High School graduate. Oh, who would later write the {{screenplay}} to the popular film The Wedding Day (1956), was producing newsreels for the Korean News through the Bureau of Public Information, and helped Kim get a job writing screenplays with this organization. With Oh's help, Kim {{was able to get}} a job working for the United States Information Service in Jinhae. The job helped shape Kim's life in several ways. With the increase in pay he received from the U.S.I.S., he was able to marry Kim Yu-bong in 1951, and their first son, Kim Dong-won, was born in 1952. They would have a daughter born in 1955 and a second son, Kim Dong-yang, born in 1958. The two remained married {{for the rest of their}} lives. Kim Yu-bong supported her husband's filmmaking career through her dental practice, giving him a unique degree of independence among Korean filmmakers of his era to pursue his own personal visions. At a career retrospective during the last year of his life, Kim commented, [...] "My wife's support has been unflagging over the years, even if, at times, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> one of my films and cried 'What have you done with my money?' But at rare moments like this retrospective, she becomes very emotional, recognizing that finally it has all been worthwhile." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mann herself {{considered}} {{these photographs}} to be “natural {{through the eyes}} of a mother, since <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> her children in every state: happy, sad, playful, sick, bloodied, angry and even naked.” Critics agreed, saying her “vision in large measure [...] accurate, and a welcome corrective to familiar notions of youth as a time of unalloyed sweetness and innocence,” and that the book “created a place that looked like Eden, then cast upon it the subdued and shifting light of nostalgia, sexuality and death." [...] When Time magazine named her “America’s Best Photographer” in 2001, it wrote: ...|$|E
