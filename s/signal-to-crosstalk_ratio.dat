40|$|This study {{proposes a}} volume {{holographic}} demultiplexer (VHDM) for extracting the spatial modes excited in a multimode fiber. A unique {{feature of the}} demultiplexer {{is that it can}} separate a number of multiplexed modes output from a fiber in different directions by using multi-recorded holograms without beam splitters, which results in a simple configuration as compared with that using phase plates instead of holograms. In this study, an experiment is conducted to demonstrate the basic operations for three LP mode groups to confirm the performance of the proposed VHDM and to estimate the <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> noise <b>ratio</b> (SNR). As a result, an SNR of greater than 20 dB is obtained. (C) 2013 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a technique that}} ameliorates the performance of bidirectional systems impaired by in-band Rayleigh crosstalk, which is common in passive optical access networks based on centralized remote wavelength feeding. The technique {{is based on the}} combined use of a suitable line coding and ad hoc postdetection electrical filtering. Therefore, it can be seamless implemented in optical access systems and it is easily scalable with the data rate. We experimentally assess the technique by using a 8 B 10 B coded 1. 25 -Gb/s signal. We report an increased tolerance to the <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> by about 5 dB...|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} impact of crosstalk in multicore fibers, using polarization-multiplexed quadrature phase-shift keying signals. Using a 7 -core fiber, we perform single-span transmission experiments, where the level of crosstalk to the core under test can be varied. We find the penalty in the required optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), compared to a system with no crosstalk, for different signal-to-crosstalk ratios and at different pre-forward-error-correction target bit-error rates (BERs). We show that, for a 1 -dB penalty, a 15. 7 -dB <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> can be tolerated at BER = 1 x 10 (- 3). We also perform recirculating loop experiments with varying amount of crosstalk per span to find {{the impact on the}} achievable transmission distance...|$|E
40|$|A novel optical crossconnect architecture, capable {{for tens}} of terabit {{throughput}} and allowing the integration of wavelength and space switching, is presented for both WP and VWP networks. The architecture offers significant advantages in terms of crosstalk performance and node complexity. In the architecture, there are no crossovers and crosspoints. Therefore, the <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> per wavelength channel can be very high since each channel is processed independently from the others. This will also allow to introduce other all-optical techniques like adding/dropping of OTDM channels as well as optical regeneration. The proposed architecture is wavelength and link modular and particularly suitable for crossconnects with {{a very large number}} of wavelength channels. Performance aspects of a single as well as of a cascade of crossconnects have been simulated using a simulation tool...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} for an all-optical wavelength converter based on cross-phase modulation in two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) arranged in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration to evaluate the efficiency of conversion and the <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> (SCR) at {{the output of the}} converter. The results evaluated analytically for input non-return to zero signal at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s show that conversion is possible over a wavelength separation of 2 nm between the pump and the input wavelengths. It is further noticed that SCR of the order of 50 dB or more can be achieved at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s, optical amplifier bandwidth of 10 times bit rate and driving current of 600 mA when the input pump is 60 % of saturation intensity. The range of wavelength conversion can further be increased by increasing the driving current. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{variation}} of the <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> (SXR) due to effects of four-wave mixing (FWM) has been analyzed on center channels of 5 -, 7 -, 9 -channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems implemented with G. 652 standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs) for 12. 5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz and 100 GHz equal channel spacing values. Center channels on such systems are the most severely impacted channels by FWM. Therefore, results obtained are the worst-case values for the DWDM system performance and important for system design. Simulations have been performed for systems using three different commercially available SMFs having different design parameter values for chromatic dispersion, dispersion slope, nonlinearity coefficient and attenuation coefficient which {{are all in the}} scope of the G. 652 Recommendation of Telecommunication Standardization Sector of International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) for SSMFs. In those simulations, under the impact of FWM, {{variation of}} SXR with variations in input powers, channel spacings and link lengths have been observed. Simulation results display the combined effect of the optical fiber and system design parameters on FWM performance of DWDM systems and give important clues for not only long-haul but also access network implementations of DWDM systems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Free-space optical {{interconnects}} (FSOIs) {{promise to}} deliver tremendous gains in connectivity and architectural freedom in future computing systems, {{especially at the}} backplane level. However, a critical hurdle that must be overcome for FSOIs to deliver on their promise is that of optical packaging. The objective of optical packaging in FSOIs is to implement an optical design within the specified alignment budget and support the associated optoelectronics. It is a multidisciplinary field combining aspects of mechanical, optical and electrical engineering. This thesis explores optical packaging issues for FSOIs such as: type of optical interconnect, impact of device technology, environmental effects, and fabrication issues. Approaches taken {{to address these issues}} in previous optical systems described in the literature are then studied; key points are the importance of improving diagnostic techniques and the benefits of microoptic/optoelectronic device integration. To further study these aspects, the optical packaging for a four-stage hybrid macrolens/lenslet FSOI backplane is designed, built, and characterized. A non-obtrusive, in-situ alignment diagnostic system which uses dedicated alignment beams running parallel to the main link is also designed, implemented and characterized. An analysis of optical crosstalk and <b>signal-to-crosstalk</b> <b>ratio</b> considerations due to misalignment is then presented and it is shown that crosstalk can be exploited to yield alignment diagnostic information at the expense of few additional components. A novel approach for simplifying prealignment of microoptics and optoelectronics during fabrication is then presented. This consists of using on-die reflective diffractive structures to generate reference marks for use during alignment and fabrication of integrated microoptic/optoelectronic packages. Future avenues of research are then discussed...|$|E
