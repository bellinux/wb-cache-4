50|$|Using a {{standard}} printing plate, an image is printed onto a substrate {{with the use}} of a ultraviolet-curable cold foil adhesive. An ultraviolet dryer then cures the adhesive, which becomes tacky. Foil spools from an unwind and is nipped to a substrate. Foil sticks to the tacky adhesive on the substrate, and an image with a bright foil surface is created. Foil that does not adhere to the adhesive remains on a thin polyester liner, and waste is directed to a rewind spool. Because the adhesive is applied on press like a conventional ink, no expensive <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> has to be created.|$|E

The carrying web, along with metal that is punched away in previous operations, is treated as scrap metal.

40|$|Since {{this project}} is a {{continuation}} of a cooperative effort between UMR and General Motor Research Laboratories (GMR), it seemed fitting to provide some background information which was instrumental in the evolution of this program. A family of filled epoxies that can be cast-to-size into sheet metal <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> has been developed by GMR. Advantages of this material over commercial plastic tooling materials are a fast curing rate, high strength, and negligible volume shrinkage after curing. Superior Tooling And Molding Plastic (<b>STAMP)</b> tooling <b>dies</b> are considerably cheaper and faster to make than steel tooling dies; therefore, they are currently used for prototype applications throughout General Motors. With improvement of wear resistance, <b>STAMP</b> <b>dies</b> can be used for limited production applications involving 10, 000 or 20, 000 parts. GMR proposed to provide a thin (< 25 {micro}m) wear surface for the cast-to-size <b>STAMP</b> <b>die</b> to extend its wear performance. The objective of the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) research effort is to technically evaluate methodologies to coat STAMP material to appreciably improve wear resistance. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} various types of coatings will be developed and evaluated. Rather, the primary responsibility is to characterize the nature of the STAMP material and design engineered films which will lead to an optimized system. An example of this was the finding that a thin polymer layer existed on the surface of an as-cast <b>STAMP</b> <b>die</b> necessitating removal if satisfactory adherence and toughness were to be attained. The next important finding involved the influence of particle size on wear. The theme of the research approach was maintained throughout the course of the project, with improvements being made as the causes of failure were determined and appropriate corrections or improvements were made...|$|R

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, advanced {{high strength}} steel (AHSS) stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. The prediction of tool wear patterns for sheet metal <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> is a highly challenging task as there are many control parameters involved in the production.

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} of {{high strength}} steels has been continuously {{developed in the}} automotive industry to improve mechanical properties and surface quality of stamped components.

This paper analyzes the laser texturing of hot <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> and discusses how different surfaces textures influence the lubrication and wear mechanisms. To this purpose, experimental tests and numerical simulation were carried out to define the die region to be texturized and to characterize the textured surface topography before and after hot stamping tests with a 3 D surface profilometer and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that laser texturing influences the lubrication at the interface die-hot sheet and improves die lifetime.

40|$|Reliable {{design of}} {{stamping}} dies is desired for efficient and safe production. The design of stamping dies are today mostly based on casting feasibility, {{although it can}} also be based on criteria for fatigue, stiffness, safety, economy. Current work presents an approach that is built on Simulation Driven Design, enabling Design Optimization to address this issue. A structural finite element model of a <b>stamping</b> <b>die,</b> used to produce doors for Volvo V 70 /S 80 car models, is studied. This die had developed cracks during its usage. To understand the behaviour of stress distribution in the <b>stamping</b> <b>die,</b> structural analysis of the die is conducted and critical regions with high stresses are identified. The results from structural FE-models are compared with analytical calculations pertaining to fatigue properties of the material. To arrive at an optimum design with increased stiffness and lifetime, topology and free-shape optimization are performed. In the optimization routine, identified critical regions of the die are set as design variables. Other optimization variables are set to maintain manufacturability of the resultant <b>stamping</b> <b>die.</b> Thereafter a CAD model is built based on geometrical results from topology and free-shape optimizations. Then the CAD model is subjected to structural analysis to visualize the new stress distribution. This process is iterated until a satisfactory result is obtained. The final results show reduction in stress levels by 70 % with a more homogeneous distribution. Even though mass of the die is increased by 17 %, overall, a stiffer die with better lifetime is obtained. Finally, by reflecting on the entire process, a coordinated approach to handle such situations efficiently is presented. open access Model Driven Development and Decision Suppor...|$|E
