50|$|Barrel <b>sealed</b> <b>manifolds</b> {{with two}} O-rings in {{parallel}} are {{more tolerant of}} minor misalignment and varied centre distance than face-sealed manifolds with single O-ring seals which {{are more likely to}} leak if impacted. Isolation manifolds provide the possibility of closing off one cylinder if there is an unrecoverable leak, conserving the remaining gas in the other cylinder. Cylinder or manifold valve knob extension operators (slobwinders) can be stiff, can trail and snag on things, and can be difficult to find when needed. Valve- and manifold protector frames are not necessary and may be worse line-traps than the valves. Some models {{make it more difficult to}} reach the valve, and some can increase the diver's profile.|$|R
50|$|PEEK {{is finding}} {{increased}} use in spinal fusion devices and reinforcing rods. It is extensively {{used in the}} aerospace, automotive, and chemical process industries. PEEK <b>seals</b> and <b>manifolds</b> are commonly used in fluid applications. PEEK also performs well in applications where continuous high temperatures (up to 500°F/260°C) are common.|$|R
40|$|The mixed {{reactant}} {{fuel cell}} (MRFC) {{is a new}} concept, in which a mixture of aqueous fuel and gaseous oxygen (or air) flows directly through a porous anode-electrolyte-cathode structure or through a strip-cell with an anode-electrolyte-cathode configuration. These structures can be single cells or parallel stacks of cells and may be ina planar, tubular or any other geometry. Selectivity in the electrocatalysts for MRFCs is mandatory to minimize mixed-potentail at the electrodes, which otherwise would reduce the availabel ell voltage and compromise the fuel efficeincy. MRFC offers a cost effective solution in fuel cell design, {{since there is no}} need for gas-light structure within the stak and as a consequence, considerable reduction in <b>sealing,</b> <b>manifolding</b> and reactants delivery struc 5 ure is possible. In recent years, significant advances have been made in MRFCs, using methanol as a fuel. This paper reviews the status of mixed reactant fuel cells and reports some recent experimental data for methanol fuel cell systems. ...|$|R
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to <b>manifold</b> <b>seal,</b> and a <b>manifold</b> badge.|$|R

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the <b>manifold</b> tube, which <b>seal</b> against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face <b>seal</b> <b>manifolds,</b> and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R
40|$|The {{sintering}} behaviour of {{a composite}} material formed by a borosilicate glass (60 SiO 2 - 24 B 2 O 3 - 16 Na 2 O mol%) and zirconia fibres has been characterised {{as a function}} of the particle size of the glass powders, the fibre volume fraction, temperature and time of sintering. This composite is suitable for <b>sealing</b> gas <b>manifolds</b> of molten carbonate fuel cells, and the sintering temperatures are close to the working temperature of the cell (650 °C). The Clusters model was extended and used to analyse the results. New considerations are included in the model to account for the presence of rigid inclusions. The parameters of the modified model are: the size distribution of the glass powder, the viscosity and surface tension of the glass, the (empirical) shape factor for the geometry of the glass powder, the number of nucleating sites per unit area, the crystal growth rate curve, the fibre volume fraction and length. The Clusters model allows one to include the effect of surface crystallisation and fibre content as an inhibitor of densification and successfully describes the sintering kinetics of the borosilicate glass/zirconia fibres system...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} devices that convert {{chemical}} energy in hydrogen enriched fuels into electricity electrochemically. Micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs), the type pioneered by K. Kendall {{in the early}} 1990 s, {{are a variety of}} SOFCs that are on the scale of millimetres compared to their much larger SOFC relatives that are typically on the scale of tens of centimetres. The main advantage of the MT-SOFC, over its larger predecessor, is that it is smaller in size and is more suitable for rapid start up. This may allowthe SOFC to be used in devices such as auxiliary power units, automotive power supplies, mobile electricity generators and battery re-chargers. The following paper is Part I of a two part series. Part I will introduce the reader to the MT-SOFC stack and its applications, indicating who is researching what in this field and also specifically investigate the design issues related to multi-cell reactor systems called stacks. Part II will review in detail the combinations of materials and methods used to produce the electrodes and electrolytes of MT-SOFC’s. Also the role of modelling and validation techniques used in the design and improvement of the electrodes and electrolytes will be investigated. A broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines are involved in a stack design. Scientific and engineering content has been discussed in the areas of thermalself- sustainability and efficiency, <b>sealing</b> technologies, <b>manifold</b> design, electrical connections and cell performance optimisation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} part of the {{long-term}} perspective to implement in vivo some new noninvasive methods to monitor the bone prostheses sealing or osseointegration (dental implants, hip prostheses). Although the most widely used clinically, X-ray radiography suffers from low sensitivity, limiting for instance its ability to detect early loosening of a prosthesis. The potential of methods developed over the past twenty years and based on elasticity measurements has been shown in vitro, but their in vivo effectiveness is still questionable. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of new methods based on nonlinear elasticity measurements that have emerged in the fields of geophysics and nondestructive testing, and which showed greater sensitivity than the linear elastic response to the presence of weak contacts within a rigid structure, such as cracks. For this, several osseointegration and <b>sealing</b> models (with <b>manifold</b> damping and boundary conditions) have been studied experimentally using different nonlinear elasticity techniques. Finally, this experimental study allowed the extraction of the most promising nonlinear parameters and the evaluation of their respective advantages and limitations for an in vivo application...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{sintering}} process of different glasses {{in the system}} Na 2 O–B 2 O 3 –SiO 2 has been studied. The studied compositions are suitable for <b>sealing</b> the gas <b>manifolds</b> of molten carbonate fuel cells. Sealing glasses are usually applied on the surfaces to be sealed using powder glass mixed with an organic medium. The agglomerant elimination and the sintering of the glass powder take place during the thermal treatment. Three different particle sizes of glass powder and different sintering temperatures and times {{have been used to}} reveal the influence of the specific surface area and viscosity on sintering. The control of these parameters allows optimization of the sealing conditions of the glasses. Dense materials have been characterized as well as the sintering mechanism. Two processes take place during the thermal treatment: the {{sintering process}} and the quartz crystallisation. Both processes act in opposite directions on the glass densification. Crystallisation is the dominant process at long times and high temperatures. The viscous flow Scherer model has been adequately applied to the experimental data. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) {{are one of}} the options as {{auxiliary}} power units (APU) in transportation, e. g. in vehi-cles or in aircraft. In particular, metal supported SOFCs consisting of metallic frames and substrates coated with plasma sprayed functional layers have shown an excellent stability concerning redox cycling. In order to provide sufficient power, these single cells have to be assembled to stacks. To prevent short-circuiting the frame of each cell has to be electrically insulated from the neighbouring one. For that purpose a ceramic coating is applied on each metal frame by thermal spraying before it is brazed to other stack components. Such layers should at one hand show good wetting and adhesion to the silver based brazing materials. On the other hand it should maintain sufficient electrical resistance even at the fuel cell operating temperature. As the applied solder, which connects the cells and <b>seals</b> the gas <b>manifold</b> simultaneously, is an excellent electrical conductor, it is mandatory to prevent the brazing material from penetrating into the deposit. In this paper a description of the design and experiences with these plasma sprayed insulating layers is given...|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of swirl flaps are mainly associated with fouling by exhaust gas recirculation, which leaves tarry deposits on the flaps {{and the inside}} of the intake manifold. Over time the flaps can begin to stick in one position and the engine management system may report an error code if the correct flap position cannot be achieved within a few percent of the design specification. More seriously, the flaps or their mountings can fracture under the strain and parts can enter the cylinder. This almost always causes major engine damage due to the very small clearances inside a diesel engine. The BMW M47TU 2-litre engine manufactured between 2001 and 2004, and the similar 3-litre engine, is notorious for swirl flap failure, as the small screws used to secure the flaps to their spindle will fall into the intake ports if the spindle fractures; in 2004 the intake manifold was redesigned to eliminate these. Some owners choose to have the flaps removed as a precaution, with blanking plates fitted to maintain <b>manifold</b> <b>sealing.</b> In many cases the impact on driveability and fuel economy is negligible.|$|R
