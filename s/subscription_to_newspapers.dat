40|$|In {{this paper}} we study privacy issues {{regarding}} the use of the SSL/TLS protocol and X. 509 certificates. Our main attention is placed on subscription-based remote services (e. g., <b>subscription</b> <b>to</b> <b>newspapers</b> and databases) where the service manager charges a flat fee {{for a period of time}} independent of the actual number of times the service is requested. We start by pointing out that restricting the access to such services by using X. 509 cer-tificates and the SSL/TLS protocol, while preserving the interests of the service managers, neglects the right to privacy of the users. We then propose the concept of a crypto certificate and the Secure and Private Socket Layer protocol (SPSL protocol, in short) and show how they can be used to preserve user privacy and, at the same time, protecting the interests of the service managers. The SPSL protocol only requires the user to have a standard X. 509 certificate (with an RSA key) and does not require the user to get any special ad-hoc certificate. Finally, we show the viability of the proposed solution by describing a system based on SPSL for secure and private access to subscription-based web services. Our implementatio...|$|E

Camps had <b>subscriptions</b> <b>to</b> American <b>newspapers,</b> and every camp published its own newspaper with poetry and short stories, puzzles and games, listings of upcoming events, and classified ads. Camp authorities recognized the periodicals' value in serving as creative outlets and as accurate indicators of the prisoners' views. The tone of their articles varied; some promoted Nazi ideology and foresaw German victory. Even as Germany's defeat neared in early 1945, eight of 20 camp newspapers advocated Nazi ideology.|$|R

However, Kim U-ryong of the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and Kim Eon-gyeong of the Citizens Coalition for Democratic Media both described the novel as [...] "obscene" [...] and criticised its publication in a newspaper read by young people. Grand National Party spokeswoman Na Kyung-won issued a statement opining that {{the real reason for}} the Blue Houses subscription cancellation was Munhwa Ilbos criticism of the presidential administration, an accusation which a Blue House spokesman denied.|$|R
