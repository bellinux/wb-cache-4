40|$|It {{is known}} {{that a large number}} of both genetic and {{environmental}} factors contribute to the risk of inhibitor development, but underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are still under investigation. The clinical research on inhibitors towards factor VIII (FVIII) is challenged by the fact that this is an infrequent event occurring in a rare disease. Therefore, it is widely accepted that complementary studies involving animal models can provide important insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of this complication. In this respect, mouse models have been studied for clues to FVIII immunogenicity, natural history of immunity and for different approaches to primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction. In the clinical setting, the type of FVIII product used and the occurrence of product switching are considered important factors which may have an influence on inhibitor development. The evaluation of data currently available in the literature does not prove unequivocally that a difference in the immunogenicity exists between particular FVIII products (e. g. recombinant vs. plasma-derived, full length vs. B-domainless). In addition, national products switches have occurred and, in this context, switching was not associated with an enhanced inhibitor risk. In contrast with severe haemophilia A, patients with moderate and mild haemophilia A receive FVIII treatment infrequently for bleeds or surgery. In this condition the inhibitor risk is low but remains present lifelong, requiring continuous vigilance, particularly after intensive FVIII exposur...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Insulin {{secretion}} {{increases in}} normal pregnancy to meet increasing demands. Inability to increase beta-cell function results in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We have previously {{shown that the}} expression of the transcription factor ARNT (Aryl-hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator) is reduced in the islets of humans with type 2 diabetes. Mice with a beta-cell specific deletion of ARNT (b-ARNT mice) have impaired glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>secondary</b> to defective insulin secretion. We hypothesised that ARNT is required to increase beta-cell function during pregnancy, and that b-ARNT mice would be unable to compensate for the beta-cell stress of pregnancy. The aims of this study were to investigate the mechanisms of ARNT regulation of beta-cell function and glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Methods: b-ARNT females were mated with floxed control (FC) males and FC females with b-ARNT males. Results: During pregnancy, b-ARNT mice had a marked deterioration in glucose <b>tolerance</b> <b>secondary</b> to defective insulin secretion. There was impaired beta-cell proliferation in late pregnancy, associated with decreased protein and mRNA levels of the islet cell-cycle regulator cyclinD 2. There was also reduced expression of Irs 2 and G 6 PI. In contrast, in control mice, pregnancy was associated with a 2. 1 -fold increase in ARNT protein and a 1. 6 -fold increase in cyclinD 2 protein, and with increased beta-cell proliferation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Isoflurane {{was used}} to treat a patient with status asthmaticus {{refractive}} to standard therapeutic measures. The patient developed a significant withdrawal syndrome when the isoflurane was weaned. A case is reported here where this withdrawal syndrome was treated successfully by using a weakening dose neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pediatric critical care unit. PATIENT: A 4 -yr-old girl with severe reactive airways disease. INTERVENTIONS: The use of weakening doses of cisatracurium to assist in {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} in the setting of withdrawal symptoms following the extended use of inhaled isoflurane. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Despite treatment with mechanical ventilation, intravenous corticosteroids, and bronchodilators for status asthmaticus, the patient required inhaled isoflurane. She became tolerant to isoflurane {{over an extended period of}} time; her tolerance was associated with a specific withdrawal syndrome, with the development of choreoathetoid movements resulting in poor pulmonary coordination and agitation. Conventional medical treatment of withdrawal failed. Finally, by using an infusion of cisatracurium at weakening doses to assist in the control of these choreoathetoid movements, the isoflurane and ventilator support were weaned. CONCLUSIONS: Weakening doses of cisatracurium may be used safely to control unpleasant motor symptoms <b>secondary</b> to <b>tolerance</b> of isoflurane.

METHODS: In total, 171 adult MS outpatients with urinary disorders presenting at eight centers were randomized (stratification according to center and use of clean intermittent self-catheterization) to cranberry versus placebo in a 1 -year, prospective, double-blind study that was analyzed using a sequential method on an intent-to-treat basis. An independent monitoring board analyzed the results of the analyses each time 40 patients were assessed on the main endpoint. Cranberry extract (36 mg proanthocyanidins per day) or a matching placebo was taken by participants twice daily for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the time to first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), subject to validation by a validation committee. RESULTS: The second sequential analyses allowed us to accept the null hypothesis (no difference between cranberry and placebo).

The infection of Fusarium solani f. sp. piperis, the causal agent of Fusarium disease in black pepper, was monitored on the cultivars Bragantina (susceptible) and Cingapura (tolerant), during 45 days’ post infection (dpi). Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the volatile concentrates of both cultivars showed that the Bragantina responded with the production of higher contents of α-bisabolol at 21 dpi and a decrease of elemol, mostly at 30 dpi; while Cingapura displayed an decrease of δ-elemene production, except at 15 dpi. The phenolic content determined by the Folin Ciocalteu method showed {{an increase in the}} leaves of plants inoculated at 7 dpi (Bragantina) and 7 – 15 dpi (Cingapura); in the roots, the infection caused a phenolic content decrease in Bragantina cultivar at 45 dpi and an increase in the Cingapura cultivar at 15, 30 and 45 dpi.

40|$|Background: Despite {{awareness}} {{about the impact of}} intermittent claudication (IC) on mobility, balance and quality of life; the underlying pathophysiology and alterations in muscle architecture secondary to the disease are often overlooked. This review aimed to summarize the pathophysiological muscle changes present secondary to IC. Methods: The electronic databases, Medline, EMBASE, Cinahl and AMED, were searched for studies from 1967 to August 2011. Search terms included exercise, intermittent claudication and muscle. Studies about IC which were focused on muscle histology, muscle architecture, blood flow or changes with exercise were included. Results: Of 434 studies identified, 135 unique results were found. Only 78 of these were suitable from abstract review, of which 15 were unobtainable   and a further nine were identified from hand-searching references. Studies in animal models demonstrated a predominance of type II muscle fibres and an improvement in animal exercise <b>tolerance</b> <b>secondary</b> to training. Exercise alone was never able to improve distances to that of healthy controls, however a lower limb fistula along with exercise did. Lower limb blood flow was demonstrated to be affected regionally, and most evident during exercise with a prolonged return to normal in patients with IC. At a cellular level, the myocytes metabolism increased in those with IC, but returned to normal post-revascularization. Conclusion: Treatment for claudicants includes either revascularization or exercise. Successful revascularization has demonstrated a return to normal muscle metabolism; the underlying physiological improvement secondary to exercise still requires clarification.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{regulation}} {{is necessary to}} control inflammatory responses and to prevent autoimmune diseases. Therefore, mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance have evolved to ensure that T cells recognize antigens as self- or non-self-antigens. The thymus is crucially important for central tolerance induction to self-antigens via negative selection of T cells. However, if T cells escape negative selection in the thymus and enter the periphery, peripheral mechanisms are active to warrant immune <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Secondary</b> lymphoid organs, as well as tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, {{play an important role}} in peripheral tolerance. In chronic inflammatory diseases, tertiary lymphoid organs are sometimes formed that may also be involved in the induction of peripheral tolerance. This review discusses the main processes that are involved in immune regulation and tolerance, and focuses on the contribution of NF-κB signalling to these processes.

40|$|Question: In the Northern Hemisphere, {{species with}} {{dispersal}} limitations are typically absent from secondary forests. In Australia, {{little is known}} about dispersal mechanisms and other traits that drive species composition within post-agricultural, secondary forest. We asked whether mode of seed dispersal, nutrient uptake strategy, fire response, and life form in extant vegetation differ according to land-use history. We also asked whether functional traits of Australian species that confer tolerance to grazing and re-colonisation potential differ from those in the Northern Hemisphere. Location: Delatite Peninsula, NE Victoria, Australia. Methods: The vegetation of primary and secondary forests was surveyed using a paired-plot design. Eight traits were measured for all species recorded. ANOSIM tests and Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling were used to test differences in the abundance of plant attributes between land-use types. Results: Land-use history had a significant effect on vegetation composition. Specific leaf area (SLA) proved to be the best predictor of response to land-use change. Primary forest species were typically myrmecochorous phanerophytes with low SLA. In the secondary forest, species were typically therophytes with epizoochorous dispersal and high SLA. Conclusions: The attributes of species in <b>secondary</b> forests provide <b>tolerance</b> to grazing suggesting that disturbance caused by past grazing activity determined the composition of these forests. Myrmecochores were rare in secondary forests, suggesting that species had failed to re-colonise due to dispersal limitations. Functional traits that resulted in species loss through disturbance and prevented re-colonisation were different to those in the Northern Hemisphere and were attributable to the sclerophyllous nature of the primary forest...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic (As) is a toxic element {{for plants}} {{and one of}} the most common {{anthropogenic}} pollutants found at contaminated sites. Despite its severe effects on plant metabolism, several species can accumulate substantial amounts of arsenic and endure the associated stress. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in arsenic tolerance remains obscure in many model plant species used for land decontamination (phytoremediation), including willows. The present study assesses the potential of Salix purpurea cv. ‘Fish Creek’ for arsenic phytoextraction and reveals the genetic responses behind arsenic tolerance, phytoextraction and metabolism. Four weeks of hydroponic exposure to 0, 5, 30 and 100 mg/L revealed that plants were able to tolerate up to 5 mg/L arsenic. Concentrations of 0 and 5 mg/L of arsenic treatment were then used to compare alterations in gene expression of roots, stems and leaves using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression revealed transcripts encoding proteins putatively involved in entry of arsenic into the roots, storage in vacuoles and potential transport through the plant as well as primary and <b>secondary</b> (indirect) toxicity <b>tolerance</b> mechanisms. A major role for tannin as a compound used to relieve cellular toxicity is implicated as well as unexpected expression of the cadmium transporter CAX 2, providing a potential means for internal arsenic mobility.

40|$|The direct {{assessment}} of the antigen-reactive cell (ARC) 1 in most lymphoid tissues has, to date, been limited to the heterologous erythrocyte antigens (1 - 5). Because of the limitations implicit {{in the nature of}} these antigens regarding the <b>secondary</b> response and <b>tolerance,</b> a method has been devised to enumerate the ARC using the purified protein antigen, polymerized flagellin of Salmonella adelaide (POL). In the preceding paper (6), the relevant technique has been described and it has been shown that, using this method, the foci of bacterial inhibition produced by the progeny of ARC in spleens of lethally irradiated syngeneic host mice, 8 days after receiving normal donor spleen ceils and antigen, are antibody dependent and contain antibody-forming cells (AFC). The linear relationship between the number of foci and number of injected spleen cells, within a limited cell injection range, indicates that each focus is the response of one ARC. In this paper, we have employed the described method for the enumeration of ARC in three areas of immunological interest.

40|$|Abstract Background β 2 -Adrenergic receptors (β 2 AR) play {{important}} regulatory {{roles in}} a variety of cells and organ systems and are important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway and cardiovascular disease. Prolonged use of β-agonists results in <b>tolerance</b> <b>secondary</b> to receptor down-regulation resulting in reduced therapeutic efficiency. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the signaling capabilities of the β 2 AR expressed by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that also included an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene (AAV-β 2 AR/EGFP). Results By epifluorescence microscopy, ~ 40 % of infected HEK 293 cells demonstrated EGFP expression. β 2 AR density measured with [3 H]dihydroalprenolol ([3 H]DHA) increased either 13 - or 77 -fold in infected cells compared to mock infected controls depending on the culture conditions used. The [3 H]DHA binding was to a single receptor population with a dissociation constant of 0. 42 nM, as would be expected for wild-type β 2 AR. Agonist competition assays with [3 H]DHA showed the following rank order of potency: isoproterenol>epinephrine> norepinephrine, consistent with β 2 AR interaction. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels were 5 -fold higher in infected cells compared to controls (314 ± 43 vs. 63. 4 ± 9. 6 nmol/dish; n = 3). Receptor trafficking demonstrated surface expression of β 2 AR with vehicle treatment and internalization following isoproterenol treatment. Conclusions We conclude that HEK 293 cells infected with AAV-β 2 AR/EGFP effectively express β 2 AR and that increased expression of these receptors results in enhanced β 2 AR signaling. This method of gene transfer may provide an important means to enhance function in in vivo systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe tested {{whether in}} vivo {{nitroglycerin}} (NTG) treatment causes tyrosine nitration of prostacyclin synthase (PGI 2 -S), {{one of the}} nitration targets of peroxynitrite, and whether this may contribute to nitrate tolerance. BackgroundLong-term NTG therapy causes <b>tolerance</b> <b>secondary</b> to increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity and increased vascular formation of reactive oxygen species. Because NTG releases nitric oxide (NO), NTG-induced stimulation of superoxide production should increase vascular nitrotyrosine levels, compatible with increased formation of peroxynitrite, the reaction product from NO and superoxide. MethodsNew Zealand White rabbits and Wistar rats were treated with NTG (0. 4 mg/h for 3 days). Tolerance was assessed with isometric tension studies. Vascular peroxynitrite levels were quantified with luminol-derived chemiluminescence (LDCL) and peroxynitrite scavengers, such as uric acid and ebselen. As a surrogate parameter {{for the assessment of}} the activity of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent kinase-I (cGK-I; the final signaling pathway for NO), the phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASP) at serine 239 was analyzed. ResultsNitroglycerin treatment increased LDCL, and the inhibitory effect of uric acid and ebselen on LDCL was augmented in tolerant rings. Immunoprecipitation of 3 -nitrotyrosine–containing proteins and immunohistochemistry analysis identified PGI 2 -S as a tyrosine-nitrated protein. Accordingly, conversion of (14 C) -PGH 2 into 6 -keto-PGF 1 α(=PGI 2 -S activity) was strongly inhibited. In vitro incubation of tolerant rings with ebselen and uric acid markedly increased the depressed P-VASP levels and improved NTG sensitivity of the tolerant vasculature. ConclusionsNitroglycerin-induced vascular peroxynitrite formation inhibits the activity of PGI 2 -S as well as NO, cGMP, and cGK-I signaling, which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in the setting of tolerance...|$|R

We report here the results of the docetaxel plus 5 FU regimen stopped according to the interim analysis. The docetaxel plus cisplatin arm was continued. Methods Forty (40) chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable LAPC were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either continuous fluorouracil (5 -FU) 200 mg/m 2 /day (protracted IV) and docetaxel (DCT) 20 mg/m 2 /week or DCT 20 mg/m 2 and cisplatin (CDDP) 20 mg/m 2, plus concurrent radiotherapy for a period of 6 weeks. The radiation dose to the primary tumor was 54 Gy in 30 fractions. The trial's primary endpoint was the 6 -month crude non-progression rate (NPR). <b>Secondary</b> endpoints were <b>tolerance,</b> objective response rate, and overall survival. Accrual was to be stopped if at 6 months more than 13 disease progressions were observed in 20 patients. Results Eighteen (18) progressions occurred at 6 months in the 5 -FU-DCT arm. Six-month NPR was 10 % (95 %CI: 0 - 23). Six and 12 -month survivals were 85 % (95 %CI: 64 - 95) and 40 % (95 %CI: 22 - 61); median overall survival was 10. 1 months.

40|$|Spectroscopy, is {{the solar}} {{coronagraph}} foreseen for the ESA Solar Orbiter mission. METIS is conceived to image the solar corona from a near-Sun orbit {{in three different}} spectral bands: in the HeII EUV narrow band at 30. 4 nm, in the HI UV narrow band at 121. 6 nm, and in the polarized visible light band (590 – 650 nm). It also incorporates the capability of multi-slit spectroscopy of the corona in the UV/EUV range at different heliocentric heights. METIS is an externally occulted coronagraph which adopts an “inverted occulted” configuration. The Inverted external occulter (IEO) is a small circular aperture at the METIS entrance; the Sun-disk light is rejected by a spherical mirror M 0 through the same aperture, while the coronal light is collected by two annular mirrors M 1 -M 2 realizing a Gregorian telescope. To allocate the spectroscopic part, one portion of the M 2 is covered by a grating (i. e. approximately 1 / 8 of the solar corona will not be imaged). This paper presents the error budget analysis for this newconcept coronagraph configuration, which incorporates 3 different sub-channels: UV and EUV imaging sub-channel, in which the UV and EUV light paths have in common the detector {{and all of the}} optical elements but a filter, the polarimetric visible light sub-channel which, after the telescope optics, has a dedicated relay optics and a polarizing unit, and the spectroscopic sub-channel, which shares the filters and the detector with the UV-EUV imaging one, but includes a grating instead of the <b>secondary</b> mirror.

40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a {{powerful}} stimulant of appetite and an important regulator of energy homeostasis. Along with pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide YY (PYY), NPY activates 5 G-protein coupled receptors: Y 1, Y 2, Y 4, Y 5 and Y 6. As a processed pseudogene, {{the role of the}} human Y 6 is of interest given emerging evidence of functional pseudogenes. In the mouse, where it is expressed as a fully functional protein, the role of Y 6 is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that loss of Y 6 in mice (Y 6 -/- mice) led to a marked elevation in metabolic rate without compensatory hyperphagia. As a result, Y 6 -/- mice showed significant reductions in body weight relative to wild type (WT) mice, which was accompanied by pronounced reductions in lean mass and an age-induced increase in adiposity at 20 and 24 weeks of age. Loss of Y 6 receptors in mice led to significant enhancement of glucose <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Secondary</b> to the increase in adiposity, 24 -week-old Y 6 -/- mice showed a significant elevation in non-fasted serum insulin level without any change in glucose tolerance. The effects of Y 6 deletion were exacerbated by 16 weeks of high fat feeding, during which time Y 6 -/- mice showed increased body weight and fat gain, and pronounced deterioration of glucose homeostasis. The metabolic deregulations in Y 6 -/- mice may arise from impaired central vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling. Indeed, this work shows that Y 6 are expressed in neurons expressing VIP in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In line with the established role of VIP in regulating the growth hormone axis and circadian rhythm, we showed a significant reduction in serum IGF- 1 level in Y 6 -/- relative to WT mice, along with aberrant corticosterone and feeding rhythms. Since low serum IGF- 1 level and circadian arrhythmicity are associated with obesity, our results suggest that the reduction in lean mass and age-induced increase in adiposity in Y 6 -/- mice may be consequences of these factors. Additionally, peripheral administration of PP, but not PYY or PYY 3 - 36, significantly increased c-fos expression in the SCN of WT but not Y 6 -/- mice relative to saline-treated animals, suggesting that PP is a physiological activator of Y 6. Collectively, this data demonstrated that the mouse Y 6 receptor {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of energy homeostasis, possibly via PP actions on VIP neurons, acting to influence the growth hormone axis and circadian rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. INTRODUCTION: The primary {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} acidified formulae (pH 3. 5 and 4. 5) decreased gastric and tracheal colonisation, as well as microbial contamination of the enteral feeding delivery system, compared with a non-acidified control formula (pH 6. 8) in critically ill patients. <b>Secondary</b> objectives included <b>tolerance</b> of the trial formulae and mortality in relation to the administration of acidified formulas. DESIGN: The trial was a controlled, double-blinded, randomised clinical trial of three parallel groups at a single centre. METHOD: Sixty-seven mechanically ventilated, medical and surgical critically ill patients were randomised according to their APACHE II scores and included in the trial. Patients received either an acidified (pH 3. 5 or 4. 5) or control polymeric enteral formula via an 8 -Fr nasogastric tube at a continuous rate. Daily samples were taken for microbiologic analyses of the enteral formulae at various stages of reconstitution and at 6 -hour and 24 -hour intervals during administration thereof (feeding bottle and delivery set). Daily patient samples included nasogastric and tracheal aspirates, haematological evaluation and gastro-intestinal tolerance. The trial period terminated when patients were extubated, transferred from the ICU, enteral nutrition became contraindicated, a patient died, or for a maximum of 21 days. RESULTS: Gastric pH showed no significant difference (p = 0. 86) between the 3 feeding groups [pH 3. 5 (n = 23), pH 4. 5 (n = 23) and pH 6. 8 (n = 21) ] at baseline prior to the administration of enteral formulae. After initiation of feeds, the gastric pH decreased significantly (p< 0. 0001) in the acidified formulae as compared to the control formula during the trial period. Patients who received acidified enteral formulae (pH 3. 5 and 4. 5) had significantly less (p < 0. 0001) contamination from the feeding bottles and delivery systems in respect of Enterobacteriacea, and Enterococcus., The more acidified group (pH 3. 5) showed significantly less gastric contamination (p = 0. 029) with Enterobacteriacea,, but not for fungi. The 3. 5 acidified group also had the lowest gastric growth in terms of colony counts (≤ 104) of these organisms, but not for fungi, when compared to the control group (≤ 105). Vomiting episodes were 22 % and abdominal distension 12 %, with a higher incidence in the control group. Adverse events occurred equally between the groups with a higher, but not significantly different incidence of 37 % in the control group and 32 % for the acidified groups. There was no evidence of gastro-intestinal bleeding in any patient. Overall, the mortality rate in this trial was 6 %, with 6. 5 % for the acidified groups (n= 46) and 4. 8 % for the control group (n= 21), a statistically insignificant difference. CONCLUSION: Acidified enteral formulae significantly decrease gastric colonisation by preserving gastric acidity that decreases the growth of Enterobacteriaceaes organisms. Acidified formulae significantly decrease bacterial contamination of the enteral feeding system (bottle and delivery set) of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus organisms. Acidified formulae are tolerated well in critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|Cholecystokinin- 8 (CCK- 8) is an {{important}} gastrointestinal (GI) peptide that is released from endocrine I-cells in response to feeding. CCK- 8 promotes satiety, reducing food intake via the CCK 1 receptor. It is also responsible for initiating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. The hypothesis underlying this thesis was that CCK- 8 properties may be exploitable for treatment for obesity and type 11 diabetes. CCK- 8 is rapidly released by feeding but has a half life of only 1 - 2 min because of rapid degradation by aminopeptidase A. In the present study, the aminopeptidase A inhibitor, bestatin was shown to prevent N-terminal degradation of CCK- 8 in mouse plasma. Furthermore, novel N-terminally modified CCK-S analogues, such as aceylated(Ac) -CCK- 8 and pyroglutamyl p(GluGln) -CCK-S, as well as analogues with secondary pegylated[PEG] and palmitate[PAL] modifications, resisted enzyme degradation. These results suggested that amino terminal protection prevented enzymatic breakdown, raising the possibility of prolonged satiety effects in vivo. Indeed, novel N-terminally modified analogues of CCK- 8 reduced food intake for a prolonged time and {{to a greater extent}} than native CCK- 8. Further to this, these analogues significantly increased insulin secretion from clonal pancreatic BRIN-BD 11 cells compared to native CCK- 8. Acute in vivo studies also showed that CCK- 8 and related analogues reduced the plasma glucose excursion when administered with glucose in normal and obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice. Long term studies involving daily injections of the analogue, p(GluGln) CCK- S, in normal, high fat fed and obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice resulted in significant reduction of both food intake and body weight as well as enhanced glucose tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, intermittent treatment of obese and high fat fed mice with p(GluGln) CCK- 8 significantly decreased body weight and improved glucose <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Secondary</b> modifications of this CCK- 8 analogue, whereby a PEGylated moiety was attached to the C-terminus to promote binding to plasma proteins and extend the half life, were also assessed in vivo. p(GluGln) CCK- 8 [PEG] exerted similar beneficial effects as p(GluGln) CCK- 8 but no superior actions were recorded, possibly due to the low doses of analogue administered. The long term effects of p(GluGln) CCK- 8 were examined in combination with other peptide therapeutics known to enhance either the secretion or action of insulin. The combination of p(GluGln) CCK- 8 with glucagons like peptide (GLP-l) mimetic exendin- 4 produced significantly greater benefic ial effects than either peptide alone. In acute studies, this combination significantly improved glucose tolerance in normal and obese diabetic mice (ob/ob) and potently stimulated insulin secretion from clonal pancreatic BRIN-BDll cells. Daily administration of the combination p(GluGln) CCK- 8 plus exendin- 4 to high fat fed mice decreased food intake, reduced body weight, increased insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose tolerance. In other experiments, the gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonist, Pro 3 GIP[PEG] was administered daily in eqimolar doses with p(GluGln) CCK- 8 in high fat fed mice. These mice exhibited reduced food intake, decreased body weight and marked improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. However, each peptide alone produced prominent effects with no appreciable additive effects being observed in combination. In conclusion, this thesis has provided evidence that N-terminal modification of CCK- 8 confers enzyme resistance, prolonged action and enhanced biological effects in animal models of obesity-diabetes. The ability to decrease food intake, promote weight loss and improve glucose homeostasis suggests that novel analogues, such as p(GluGln) CCK- 8, might be exploitable clinically alone or in combination for the treatment of obesity and type 11 diabetes.
