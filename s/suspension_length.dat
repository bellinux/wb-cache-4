50|$|P. mellyi nests {{are known}} for their {{distinct}} combs at different levels of suspension. It builds nests with materials from three main sources: vegetation close to the nest, materials stolen from abandoned or occupied neighboring nests, and material removed from one cell, which is then used to start to enlarge a cell in {{the other part of the}} nest. Such recycling of the materials of the cells is frequently observed. A brand new cell is only built when there is no cell to shelter an anticipated egg. Material used for nest development has two important features: the cuticular cell layer of plants constitutes a substantial portion of the nest, and the texture of the nest material is of fine crumbs and small flakes. This kind of fragile aspect of the nest material might explain the low occurrence of large nests, and this may possibly hinder the evolution of large colony size. Its nesting structure is known for its flexibility, and thus lacks a typical shape or form. First off, cells modify its size with the changing size of the larva as it grows: the cell goes through a phase of regression until the cell size is equivalent to that of the growing larva. Then, both the larva and the cell starts to grow again in a similar fashion. Additionally, there is a general trend of decrease percent cell wall sharing with increase in <b>suspension</b> <b>length.</b> Typically, the nests are located on the strands of dead vegetation such as hanging vine tendrils or loose strands of thatch under the roofs of houses. The mean total <b>suspension</b> <b>length</b> of these nests is 18.4 cm and the mean suspension width is 0.64mm. The long and narrow shape of the nest also provides protection from predators.|$|E

50|$|In the ABC system, a {{computer}} detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls {{the action of}} the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder {{in the direction of the}} suspension strut, and change the <b>suspension</b> <b>length.</b> This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz.|$|E

Low size and low power are the crucial pico-projector constraints. In this work, {{we present a}} fast method for the optimization of a silicon single-axis electromagnetic torsional micromirror.

Multiple constraints link the required current through the coil, its area occupancy, the operating frequency, mirror <b>suspension</b> <b>length,</b> and magnets size. With only rather general assumptions about the magnetic field distribution and mechanical behavior, we show that a fully analytical description of the mirror electromagnetic and mechanical behavior is possible, so that the optimization targets (the assembly size, comprising the mirror and magnets, and the actuation current) can be expressed as closed functions of the design parameters. Standard multiobjective optimization algorithms can then be used for extremely fast evaluation of the trade-offs among the various optimization targets and exploration of the Pareto frontier. The error caused by model assumptions are estimated by Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to be below a few percent points from the exact solution...|$|E

As a first step {{in the development of}} a successful Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation for Dendrobium savin white, factors influencing the successful T-DNA integration and expression (as measured by the transient GUS expression) were investigated. Various parameters were included such as different acetosyringone concentrations used during co-cultivation in Agrobacterium <b>suspension,</b> the <b>length</b> of the preculture period of PLBs prior to infection, co-cultivation period, different calcium concentrations, silver nitrate concentrations, different bacterial density (OD 600 nm) and duration of immersion periods.

The results based from transient gusA gene expression of PLBs were suggested that the Agrobacterium-mediated transfer system of T-DNA is highly efficient.
