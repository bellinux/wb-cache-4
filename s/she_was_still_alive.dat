25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, {{seems to make}} clear <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of {{it remains to be}} seen, but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may make the case that since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E

25|$|Da Capo II: To You, {{released}} in June 2009, largely consists of prequel stories to the Da Capo II main story, such as Otome's and Yume's younger years, including {{the times when}} their mother, Yuki, was still alive, and Mahiru's backstory of when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> Another fandisc, titled Da Capo II: Fall in Love, was released on December 18, 2009, featuring after stories for the heroines included in the PS2 port and its Plus Communication release. The final Da Capo II release was Da Capo II: Dearest Marriage, which features Yoshiyuki and Otome in their marriage life. An English version of the original visual novel was published by the European company MangaGamer on December 24, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of 28 people were unearthed at Masada. The {{remains of a}} male 20–22 years of age, a female 17–18, and a child about 12 years old {{were found in the}} palace. The remains of two men and a full head of hair with braids belonging to a woman were also found in the bath house. Forensic analysis showed the hair had been cut from the woman's head with a sharp instrument while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> (an old practice for captured women) while the braids indicated that she was married. Based on the evidence, anthropologist Joe Zias believes the remains may have been Romans whom the rebels captured when they seized the garrison.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to think that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E

25|$|Angelika Kluk was a 23-year-old {{student from}} Skoczow, near Krakow in Poland. She {{was staying at}} the presbytery of St Patrick's Church, where {{she worked as a}} cleaner to help finance her Scandinavian Studies course at University of Gdańsk. She was last seen alive in the company of Tobin on 24 September 2006, and is thought to have been {{attacked}} by him in the garage attached to St Patrick's presbytery. She was beaten, raped and stabbed and her body was concealed in an underground chamber beneath the floor near the confessional in the church. Forensic evidence suggested that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> when she was placed under the floorboards. Police found her body on 29 September, and Tobin was arrested in London shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Neighbours {{had assumed}} the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was {{attributed}} to nearby waste bins. The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation. Drug addicts frequented the area, {{which may explain why}} no one questioned the constant noise from the television. Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials to believe that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by automatic debit payments and debt forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 1984, Knorr packed all of Suesan's {{belongings}} in trash bags and, after binding Suesan's {{arms and}} legs and placing duct tape over her mouth, ordered her sons Robert and William to put Suesan in their car. They drove her to Squaw Valley where Robert and William placed her {{on the side of the}} road on top of the bags containing her belongings. Knorr then doused Suesan and the bags in gasoline and lit the girl on fire. Suesan's still smoldering body was found the following day. An autopsy determined that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> when she was lit on fire. Due to the state of the remains, a positive identification was never made and Suesan was classified as Jane Doe #4873/84.|$|E

25|$|Keyes' {{last known}} murder was the {{kidnapping}} and killing of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, a barista working in Anchorage, Alaska. Authorities said that Keyes kidnapped {{her from her}} place of employment on February 1, 2012, stole her debit card and other property, then murdered her the following day. Police stated that Keyes sexually assaulted Koenig before he murdered her. After Koenig's death, Keyes left on a cruise out of New Orleans, leaving Koenig's body in a shed. When he returned home, he took a photograph of her body with a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News, maintaining the illusion that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> in his ransom demand. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig and disposed of her body in Matanuska Lake north of Anchorage.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that, indeed, the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, as incest was not uncommon. This would mean that Akhenaten did marry his own sister and that he and Nefertiti are the parents of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, Nefertiti, who may have survived her husband, may be identical with Smenkhare and may have adopted this name if she took over the reign after Akhenaten's death (and having her daughter move into her official roles of chief priestess and 'wife'). All this is not proven, but should be mentioned as a further plausible scenario. One difficulty posed by this identification is the mummy's age at death, because Nefertiti gave birth to Meritaten no later than year 1 of Akhenaten's reign and {{there is evidence that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> during year 16.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that Negeri Sembilan {{has the largest}} number of converts, with 840 applications made to officially renounce Islam in 2005, 62 of which succeeded. An academic has suggested that this is because Negeri Sembilan is the only state which (officially) permits conversion. A convert must first apply to the Syariah Court for a declaration {{that he or she is}} no longer a Muslim; the convert will then be counselled for about a year by a Mufti. If, after this period, the convert still wants to convert, the judge may permit the application. This process is unique to the state; no other state allows Muslims to officially convert. In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Court also permitted Wong Ah Kiu, a convert from Islam to Buddhism legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, to be buried in the Buddhist fashion, although her conversion had not been legally recognised while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> The case marked the first time non-Muslims had testified in a Syariah court in Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, {{that he had not}} murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
500|$|In a 2002 Scripps Treasure Coast Publishing interview, Raucher lamented never {{hearing from}} {{her again and}} {{expressed}} his hope that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> Raucher's novelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, [...] "To those I love, past and present," [...] serves more as the tribute to Seltzer that he had intended the film to be, with {{the focus of the}} book being more on the two boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy. Consequently, the book also mentions Seltzer's death, which is absent from the film adaptation.|$|E

500|$|In May 1866, {{following}} a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold {{the rights to}} the Book of Household Management  to Ward, Lock and Tyler (later Ward Lock & Co). The writer Nancy Spain, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons' work, [...] "surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain" [...] than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons—especially the death of Isabella—in order to protect their investment by letting readers think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> and creating recipes—what Hughes considers to be [...] "intentional censorship". Those later editions continued to make the connection to Isabella in what Beetham considers to be a [...] "fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler". Those subsequent volumes bearing Isabella's name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the Book of Household Management  has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E
500|$|Nefertiti (meaning [...] "the {{beautiful}} one {{has come}} forth") was the 14th-centuryBC Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. Akhenaten initiated a new monotheistic form of worship called Atenism {{dedicated to the}} Sun disc Aten. Little is known about Nefertiti. Theories suggest {{she could have been}} an Egyptian royal by birth, a foreign princess or the daughter of a high government official named Ay, who became pharaoh after Tutankhamun. She may have been the co-regent of Egypt with Akhenaten, who ruled from 1352BC to 1336BC. Nefertiti bore six daughters to Akhenaten, one of whom, Ankhesenpaaten (renamed Ankhesenamun after the suppression of the Aten cult), married Tutankhamun, Nefertiti's stepson. Nefertiti was thought to have disappeared from history in the twelfth year of Akhenaten's reign, though whether this is due to her death or because she took a new name is not known. She may also have later become a pharaoh in her own right, ruling alone for a short time after her husband's death. However, it is now known that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> in the sixteenth year of her husband's reign from a limestone quarry inscription found at Dayr Abū Ḥinnis.

500|$|Initial reviews were mixed, {{with some}} critics applauding the story's conclusion, and others deriding it. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, opined that the episode worked best [...] "if some of the {{previous}} Samantha-related clues were forgotten", such as when the Alien Bounty Hunter told Mulder that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> in [...] "End Game". Despite this, he wrote that [...] "it was only right that Samantha be dead since Mulder's life had always been defined by what he has lost, not what he has found". He surmised that the episode was not [...] "perfect", but that its [...] "plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along the way". He was also complimentary towards [...] "the ethereal quality of the final few moments", writing that they [...] "lifted this episode up and made {{it one of the}} season's most memorable". Kenneth Silber from Space.com was pleased with the episode, and wrote, [...] "'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha." [...] Jeremy Conrad from IGN referred to the episode as [...] "excellent" [...] and noted that a large portion of The X-Files mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, [...] " [...] a final, and concrete, answer to the single thing that was driving Mulder for the entire run of the series. In some ways, when he got that answer a major part of The X-Files story ended." ...|$|E
