40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{consumers}} became more aware and sensible {{in respect to}} environment and food safety matters. They {{are more and more}} interested in organic agriculture and markets and tend to prefer ‘organic’ products more than their traditional counterparts. To increase the quality and reduce the cost of production in organic and low-input agriculture, the 6 FP-European “QLIF” project investigated the use of natural products such as bio-inoculants. They are mostly composed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and other microorganisms, so-called “plant probiotic” microorganisms (PPM), because they help keeping an high yield, even under abiotic and biotic stressful conditions. Italian laws (DLgs 217, 2006) have recently included them as “special fertilizers”. This thesis focuses on the use of <b>special</b> <b>fertilizers</b> when growing tomatoes with organic methods in open field conditions, and the effects they induce on yield, quality and microbial rhizospheric communities. The primary objective was to achieve {{a better understanding of how}} plant-probiotic micro-flora management could buffer future reduction of external inputs, while keeping tomato fruit yield, quality and system sustainability. We studied microbial rhizospheric communities with statistical, molecular and histological methods. This work have demonstrated that long-lasting introduction of inoculum positively affected micorrhizal colonization and resistance against pathogens. Instead repeated introduction of compost negatively affected tomato quality, likely because it destabilized the ripening process, leading to over-ripening and increasing the amount of not-marketable product. Instead. After two years without any significant difference, the third year extreme combinations of inoculum and compost inputs (low inoculum with high amounts of compost, or vice versa) increased mycorrhizal colonization. As a result, in order to reduce production costs, we recommend using only inoculum rather than compost. Secondly, this thesis analyses how mycorrhizal colonization varies in respect to different tomato cultivars and experimental field locations. We found statistically significant differences between locations and between arbuscular colonization patterns per variety. To confirm these histological findings, we started a set of molecular experiments. The thesis discusses preliminary results and recommends their continuation and refinement to gather the complete results. ...|$|R

For this purpose, two variety of canola (Zarfam and Modena), four irrigation regimes including 30 %, 45 %, 60 % and 75 % (I 1 -I 4) of maximum allowable depletion (MAD) of available soil water (ASW) and four nitrogen rates (viz. 0, 90, 180 and 270 Â kg NÂ ha- 1 (N 1 -N 4) were involved in Karaj, Iran for two successive years (2007 - 2008). Our results revealed <b>special</b> <b>fertilizer</b> threshold for each irrigation regime in respect to seed yield. Response rate to fertilizers was ceased in lower fertilizer rates by prolonging irrigation. The response rate showed a decrease of 15. 4 %, 17. 2 % and 30. 7 % in I 2, I 3 and I 4 in comparison with I 1, but I 2 response to fertilizer ceased in higher N rate as Ncritical (189. 8 Â kg NÂ ha- 1). This implies that I 2 improved response of canola cultivars to N fertilizer, which was accompanied by its higher WUE. Also, all estimated Ncriticals for all irrigation levels were higher than the current recommendation of 130 Â kg NÂ ha- 1. This show the capability of increasing canola cultivars yield in study region by reasonable increasing of fertilizer rate (decreasing gap between recommended N rate and estimated values) in advisable irrigation regime (I 2).

This paper mainly describes results of the FPR trials conducted in Hainan province of China and discusses the function of FPR in the transfer of cassava technologies, existing problems and future development prospects. The project involves the following aspects of research: variety trials, {{soil and water conservation}} and fertilizer management. Contour barriers of tropical grass and legume species, and intercropping with peanut and other legume crops {{have been shown to be}} effective in protecting the soil from erosion. Results based on trials conducted at CATAS from 1995 to 1999 indicate that hedgerows of vetiver grass, Clitoria ternatea, Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Indigofera endecaphylla, Arachis pintoi, Tephrosia candida, Ananas comosus and Brachiaria decumbens decreased dry soil loss (5 - 30 t/ha) by 65 - 94 %, compared to the check treatment which had a dry soil loss of 85 t/ha. FPR trials conducted by farmers in their own fields indicate that cassava intercropped with peanut and planting vetiver grass as contour barriers was the best practice: dry soil loss decreased by 28 - 57 % compared to the check treatment, and increased income by 3, 300 Yuan/ha. This practice has been widely adopted by farmers in the pilot site of Kongba village in Baisha county of Hainan, and is being disseminated to neighboring villages by farmer-to-farmer extension. During 1995 - 1999, more than 41 promising clones have been tested in 38 farmers’ fields; they were harvested and evaluated by farmers themselves. Results show that SC 8013 and OMR 33 - 10 - 4 outyielded the check variety SC 205 by 13. 1 % and 34. 4 %, respectively. However, there were no significant differences among varieties in terms of soil erosion control. It is very easy for farmers to select and adopt their favorate varieties through their own participation. This approach will enhance the dissemination of new varieties and technologies. Fertilizer trials were conducted in 14 farmers’ fields using 12 treatments. The results show that all the treatments with fertilizers produced higher yields than those without fertilizers, and that application of 300 kg/ha of a <b>special</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (No. 3) increased the yield by 33 % and gross income by 22 %.

40|$|Several recent papers {{deal with}} {{concerns}} about the longevity of the supply of the mineral phosphorus. The paper by Edixhoven et al.  (2014), for instance, expresses doubts about whether the upward estimate of reserves by the IFDC (2006, 2010) and the USGS (2010) provides an accurate, reliable, and comparable picture, as {{it is based on}} reports that do not clearly differentiate between phosphate ore and phosphate products (i. e., marketable phosphate rock concentrate). Further, the indistinct use of the terms reserves and resources is criticized. Edixhoven et al.  (2014) call for a differentiated inventory of world phosphate reserves including "guidelines which determine the appropriate drill hole distances and a detailed granularity". The claim that "humanity is on the safe side" with respect to future phosphate supply is doubted, as the validity of the IFDC's upgrading of the Moroccan data to 50  Gt phosphate is questioned. The main achievement of Edixhoven et al.  (2014) is to elaborate that in the literature frequently used data on phosphate rock ore and phosphate concentrate are not properly distinguished, resulting in incorrect summary figures. In addition, it is commendable to raise the question how transparency concerning reserve and resources data and information on the geopotential of phosphate can be achieved because phosphorus is a <b>special</b> element. As <b>fertilizer,</b> it cannot be substituted and there are no unlimited resources as for the other main nutrients potassium in sea water and nitrogen in the air. However, the paper by Edixhoven et al.  (2014) contains in the opinion of the authors some incorrect statements. Our comment elaborates first that several statements, such as that the upgrading of the Moroccan data is "solely based" on one scientific paper, are incorrect. Secondly, the paper comments on and illuminates a set of, in our opinion, misleading statements. These include the fact that the dynamic nature of reserves (which depend on price, technology, innovation for exploiting low-grade deposits, etc.) is acknowledged, but the right conclusions are not drawn, including the mixing of finiteness and staticness, {{and the way in which}} the critique of the USGS upgrading of the Moroccan reserves has been linked to Peak P. In particular, we clarify that reserves are primarily company data that serve mining companies for their strategic planning and may, by no means, be used as proxy data for providing global Peak P estimates. Likewise, we elaborate that drilling plans for assessing reserves have to be adjusted to site characteristics, in particular, in the case of four plateaus in Morocco and the Western Sahara comprising an area greater than 10   000  km 2. We reconstruct the IFDC and USGS estimates and conclude that there is no evidence for considering the somewhat surprising increase to 50  Gt phosphate concentrate to be an unreasonable estimate for Moroccan reserves. However, the partial mixing of different units (e. g., phosphate ore and phosphate concentrate or marketable product) in the USGS data may be avoided by improving the database and using proper conversion factors. When applying these factors and assessing all reserves of marketable Gt of phosphate rock (PR-M), which is a common scale for measuring annual consumption, the magnitude of the 2014 USGS estimates of 67  Gt PR reserves does not change essentially but decreases from 64 (IFDC assessment) to 57. 5  Gt PR-M (a worst-case calculation). We agree that a better harmonization of the (national) classification systems is meaningful. The discussion includes several ideas and thoughts that go beyond the paper by Edixhoven et al.  (2014). We suggest that the discrepancies in the resource estimates are often caused by missing system understandings, different conceptions of sciences, and diverging world views. Finally, we suggest the establishment of a solidly funded, international standing committee that regularly analyzes global geopotential for assuring long-term supply security...|$|R

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), <b>special</b> alloys, <b>fertilizers,</b> fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
