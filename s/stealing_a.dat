5|$|Prompt Payment and <b>Stealing</b> <b>a</b> Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. <b>Stealing</b> <b>a</b> Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the batting order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder.

At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.|$|E
5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players {{have the freedom to}} choose how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a locked door. In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as <b>stealing</b> <b>a</b> specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or <b>stealing</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character has, and changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a key objective or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, <b>stealing</b> <b>a</b> car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
