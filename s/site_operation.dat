40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} {{strategies for}} assessing and managing induced seismicity risk during each {{phase of a}} carbon storage project. We consider both nuisance and damage potential from induced earthquakes, {{as well as the}} indirect risk of enhancing fault leakage pathways. A phased approach to seismicity management is proposed, in which operations are continuously adapted based on available information and an on-going estimate of risk. At each project stage, specific recommendations are made for (a) monitoring and characterization, (b) modeling and analysis, and (c) <b>site</b> <b>operations.</b> The resulting methodology can help lower seismic risk while ensuring <b>site</b> <b>operations</b> remain practical and cost-effective...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{resorted to}} the use of construction operations simulation modeling to investigate the cost efficiency of waste-handling practices on the Kai Tak Airport demolition project in Hong Kong. By modeling the <b>site</b> <b>operation</b> of sieving and stockpiling broken concrete, the well-established construction simulation methodology of CYCLONE was contrasted with the newly developed simplified discrete event simulation approach (SDESA). Further, the SDESA model was readily extended to include (1) raw demolition waste collecting and sorting; (2) broken concrete sieving and stockpiling; (3) steel bar recycling; and (4) debris disposal at the landfill. The production rate derived from simulation was indicative of a close match between the simulation model and the actual site system. The resulting simulation model provided a basis for evaluating the cost efficiency of actual site operations and alternative resource provision scenarios being postulated. Through computer simulation, the actual <b>site</b> <b>operation</b> was found smooth and efficient with utilization rates for resources of different types ranging from 79 to 99 %. In addition, the cost-time reduction ratios were calculated for four alternatives of resource provisions in comparison with the original base case. The research findings suggested that provided the project budget had satisfied the higher cash flow requirement, doubling the resource provision on site would potentially cut the project duration by half and not increase the total direct cost.
