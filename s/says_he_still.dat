25|$|Ian puts Bobby in {{a private}} school, hoping that it will help with his anger problems. However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his {{restaurant}} to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest. Ian eventually decides not to sell, meaning Bobby must leave the school, {{even though he is}} happy there and doing well. Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition.

6000|$|If {{you would}} prefer a joke or two to {{anything}} else, I have two for you, fresh hatched, just ris, as the bakers' wives say by the rolls. The first I played off on Brown; the second I played on myself. Brown, when he left me, [...] "Keats," [...] says he, [...] "my good fellow" [...] (staggering upon his left heel and fetching an irregular pirouette with his right); [...] "Keats," [...] says he (depressing his left eyebrow and elevating his right one), though by the way at the moment I did not know which was the right one; [...] "Keats," [...] <b>says</b> <b>he</b> (<b>still</b> in the same posture, but furthermore both {{his hands in his}} waistcoat pockets and putting out his stomach), [...] "Keats--my--go-o-ood fell-o-o-ooh," [...] says he (interlarding his exclamation with certain ventriloquial parentheses),--no, this is all a lie--He was as sober as a judge, when a judge happens to be sober, and said: [...] "Keats, if any letters come for me, do not forward them, but open them and give me the marrow of them in a few words." [...] At the time I wrote my first to him no letter had arrived. I thought I would invent one, and as I had not time to manufacture a long one, I dabbed off a short one, and that was the reason of the joke succeeding beyond my expectations. Brown let his house to a Mr. Benjamin--a Jew. Now, the water which furnishes the house is in a tank, sided with a composition of lime, and the lime impregnates the water unpleasantly. Taking advantage of this circumstance, I pretended that Mr. Benjamin had written the following short note-- ...|$|E
