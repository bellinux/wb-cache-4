The goal of the abolition of exequatur is to achieve a rapid return of the child to his country of habitual residence immediately prior to her/his wrongful removal. This goal has to be reached, inter alia, by reducing the jurisdiction of the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of certified judgments to questions of enforcement stricto sensu under the national procedural law of that State. On the other hand, the State of origin of the judgments shall be responsible for all matters relating to the merits of the judgments and to the certification of these judgments, this latter substituting the procedure of exequatur in the Member <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The Povse case shows that complex facts of a case, proceedings before the respective national courts, the time needed for the interpretation of union law by the Court of EU, and the international law on the protection of human rights questions the goal of abolition of exequatur under this Regulation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the principle of self-financing of companies (one of the 3 basic principles of the economic reform in Poland) and of its connection with the undertaking initiative of industrial companies. The analysis was {{made on the basis of}} materials published in 4 periodicals over the period of 3 years: 1982 - 1984. By "entrepreneurship is meant an undertaking initiative in the sphere of economy, mainly in the field of production, with the prospect of profit and of non-routine (and thereby risky) character. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the reform legislation in the field of self-financing is far from satisfactory. Among the most popular practices is the so called "soft financing" expressed mainly in subsidizing and conceding tax (and other) exemptions without objective justification. This has certain negative effects in the sphere of economic behavior of companies, especially with regard to their entrepreneurship. Most generally, instead of undertaking profitable initiatives which could establish their position on the market the companies concentrate their efforts on the "game" with agencies of the Government in view of gaining profits without carrying out their proper activity. Thus make-believe entrepreneurship supersedes real initiative.

The paper discusses these rules, with reference to the broader context that includes rules on international jurisdiction of courts of EU Member States in matters of parental responsibility, and rules of exequatur of foreign judgments on parental responsibility in general. The importance of the unique rules is reflected in the fact, that the enforcement of judgments of the courts of EU Member States in these matters is automatic, which means without the need of any special procedure, on the basis of certificates issued by the court of a Member State that has given the judgment, and without review by the Member <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement,</b> thus contributing to the effective exercise of parental responsibility in the child's best interests...|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{trust is}} one of the {{cornerstones}} of cooperation in the field of European Union private international law. Based on this principle the rules on the cross-border recognition and enforcement of judgments in the European Union are still subject to simplification. The step-by-step approach of the implementation of this principle led to the abolition of the exequatur, often accompanied by a partial harmonization of enforcement law to improve and support the smooth working of cross-border enforcement without exequatur. In this regard, it seems that the Member States still want to have control over the ‘import’ of judgments which results in maintaining the ground for non-recognition and the possibility of relying on them in the Member <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> This article considers the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in three areas of justice: civil and commercial matters, family law and maintenance.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the enforcement of}} {{occupational safety and health}} (OSH) regulations; it validates the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of OSH regulations by extracting the salient issues that influence enforcement of OSH regulations in Nigeria. It’s the duty of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity (Inspectorate Division) to enforce the Factories Act of 1990, while the Labour, Safety, Health and Welfare Bill of 2012 empowers the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health of Nigeria to administer the proceeding regulations on its behalf. Sadly enough, the impact of the enforcement authority is ineffective, as the key stakeholders pay less attention to OSH regulations; thus, rendering the OSH scheme dysfunctional and unenforceable, at the same time impeding OSH development. For optimum OSH in Nigeria, maximum enforcement and compliance with the regulations must be in place. This paper, which is based on conceptual analysis, reviews literature gathered through desk literature search. It identified issues to OSH enforcement such as: political influence, bribery and corruption, insecurity, lack of governmental commitment, inadequate legislation inter alia. While recommending ways to improve the enforcement of OSH regulations, it states that self-regulatory style of enforcing OSH regulations should be adopted by organisations. It also recommends that more OSH inspectors be recruited; local government authorities empowered to facilitate the enforcement of OSH regulations. Moreover, the study encourages organisations to champion OSH enforcement, as it is beneficial to them; it concludes that the burden of OSH improvement in Nigeria is on the government, educational authorities, organisations and trade unions...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|E

40|$|Federal law is {{enforced}} {{through a}} combination of public and private efforts. Virtually all federal civil statutes vest enforcement authority in a federal agency; some also create private rights of action that permit private parties to sue to enforce federal law. Decades of commentary on the choice between public and private enforcement have generated a remarkably stable set of arguments about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each type. But the conventional wisdom tells only part of the story, as it ignores variations within the category <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement.</b> In fact, there are two distinct types <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement.</b> Many federal statutes authorize civil enforcement by both a federal agency and the states, typically through their attorneys general. State enforcement is largely decentralized, and states act on behalf of a set of interests that diverge significantly from those represented by federal enforcers. State enforcement also empowers a different set of agents - elected, generalist attorneys general - whose incentives and capabilities distinguish them from the appointed policy specialists who populate federal enforcement agencies. The result is a brand <b>of</b> public <b>enforcement</b> that differs markedly from the more familiar federal model. This Article exposes <b>state</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> federal law as both a unique model <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> and a unique form <b>of</b> <b>state</b> power. <b>Enforcement</b> has been neglected in the federalism literature to date, which equates state power with state regulation. As I show, however, enforcement authority can serve as a potent means <b>of</b> <b>state</b> influence, enabling states to adjust the intensity <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> and to press their own interpretations of federal law. Importantly, enforcement authority does not depend on regulatory authority. The two typically go hand in hand: a government creates laws and then enforces them. But <b>state</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> federal law breaks that link by authorizing state actors to enforce the laws of a different sovereign. Thus, state enforcement authority can thrive even in areas where state law is preempted or state regulators have chosen not to act. Enforcement also empowers a different breed <b>of</b> <b>state</b> representatives. Just as state attorneys general differ from federal agencies as agents <b>of</b> <b>enforcement,</b> they differ from state agencies as agents of federal-state interaction. Moreover, attorneys general in most states are independent from the state legislature and governor, and may represent different constituencies. Enforcement authority therefore opens up new outlets for state-centered policy, empowering actors whose interests and incentives distinguish them from the state institutions that dominate other channels of federal-state dialogue...|$|R
