25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in DIN rail format, use flying leads rather than <b>screw</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, {{because of the small}} form factor, the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, rather than from the final circuit wiring.|$|E
25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have <b>screw</b> <b>terminals</b> for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E

25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include <b>screw</b> <b>terminals</b> for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E

5000|$|When {{properly}} tightened, {{the connections}} are physically and electrically secure because they firmly contact a large section of wire. The terminals are relatively low cost {{compared with other}} types of connector, and a <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> can easily be integrated into the design of a building wiring device (such as a socket, switch, or lamp holder).|$|R
50|$|However, {{with the}} {{clamping}} plate type of <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> {{this time is}} reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the screw to clamp the wire between the terminal and the clamping plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the screw head.|$|R

50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>terminals</b> {{are low in}} cost when {{compared}} to other types of connectors, and can be readily designed into products for circuits carrying currents of from a fraction of an ampere up to several hundred amperes at low to moderate frequencies. The terminals easily can be re-used in the field, allowing for the replacement of wires or equipment, generally with standard hand tools. <b>Screw</b> <b>terminals</b> usually avoid the requirement for a specialized mating connector to be applied to the ends of wires.|$|E
50|$|While wires may be crimped, {{they should}} not be heavily tinned with solder prior to {{installation}} in a <b>screw</b> <b>terminal,</b> since the soft metal will cold flow, resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. Screw connectors sometimes come loose if not done up tightly enough at fitting time. Verifying adequate tightening torque requires calibrated installation tools and proper training. In the UK, all screw connectors on fixed mains installations are required to be accessible for servicing, for this reason.|$|R

5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since wire strands may not be contained by the screw head in a basic <b>screw</b> <b>terminal,</b> stranded wires may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|R

50|$|Junctions {{should be}} made in a {{reliable}} manner, {{but there are many}} possible approaches to accomplish this.For low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered, however {{it may be difficult to}} find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.Reference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> blocks.For high temperatures, a common approach is a spot weld or crimp using a durable material.A common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added emfs.This may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.|$|R
