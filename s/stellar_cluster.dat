The spatial distribution of the <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> is not coincident {{with that of the}} bright HII regions, as revealed by the HST/NICMOS Pa_alpha image. Overall, the circumnuclear star formation in NGC 2903 shows a ring-like morphology with an approximate diameter of 625 pc. The SF properties of the <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> and HII regions have been studied using the photometric and spectroscopic information in conjunction with evolutionary synthesis models. The population of bright <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> shows a very narrow range of ages, 4 - 7 X 10 ^ 6 yr after the peak of star formation, or absolute ages 6. 5 - 9. 5 X 10 ^ 6 yr (for the assumed short-duration Gaussian bursts), and luminosities similar to the clusters found in the Antennae interacting galaxy. This population of young <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> accounts for some 7 - 12 % of the total stellar mass in the central 625 pc of NGC 2903. The HII regions in the ring of star formation have luminosities close to that of the super-giant HII region 30 Doradus, they are younger than the <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters,</b> and will probably evolve into bright infrared <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> similar to those observed today. We find that the star formation efficiency in the central regions of NGC 2903 is higher than in normal galaxies, approaching the lower end of infrared luminous galaxies.

40|$|Aims. We {{study how}} IMF {{sampling}} affects the ionizing flux and emission line spectra of low mass <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> Methods. We performed 2 x 10 ^ 6 Monte Carlo simulations of zero-age solar-metallicity <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> covering the 20 - 10 ^ 6 Mo mass range. We study {{the distribution of}} <b>cluster</b> <b>stellar</b> masses, Mclus, ionizing fluxes, Q(H 0), and effective temperatures, Tclus. We compute photoionization models that broadly describe {{the results of the}} simulations and compare them with photoionization grids. Results. Our main results are: (a) A large number of low mass clusters (80 % for Mclus = 100 Mo) are unable to form an H ii region. (b) There are a few overluminous <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> that form H ii regions. These overluminous clusters preserve statistically the mean value of obtained by synthesis models, but the mean value cannot be used as a description of particular clusters. (c) The ionizing continuum of clusters with Mclus < 10 ^ 4 Mo is more accurately described by an individual star with self-consistent effective temperature(T*) and Q(H 0) than by the ensemble of stars (or a cluster Tclus) produced by synthesis models. (d) Photoionization grids of <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> {{can not be used to}} derive the global properties of low mass clusters. Conclusions. Although variations in the upper mass limit, mup, of the IMF would reproduce the effects of IMF sampling, we find that an ad hoc law that relates mup to Mclus in the modelling of <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> is useless, since: (a) it does not cover the whole range of possible cases, and (b) the modelling of <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> with an IMF is motivated by the need to derive the global properties of the cluster: however, in clusters affected by sampling effects we have no access to global information of the cluster but only particular information about a few individual stars.

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{studies of}} <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> in {{external}} galaxies use surface photometry and therefore focus on {{systems that are}} still bright and compact enough {{to be separated from}} the stellar background. Consequently, the latter stages of unbound cluster evolution are still poorly understood. This dramatically constrains our knowledge of the dissolution processes of <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> in various physical environments. We present the first results of a new approach to directly detect and quantify the characteristics of evolved <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> Using the exceptional spatial resolution and sensitivity of HST/ACS images to resolve the stellar content nearby galaxies, we construct colour-magnitude diagrams for the observed fields. This enable us to separate the younger population likely present in young clusters from the older stellar content of the star field background. We utilize a clustering algorithm to assign each star to a group based on its local spatial density. This novel approach makes use of algorithms typically applied in N-body and cosmological studies. We test the method and show that it successfully detects less compact clusters that would normally be lost in the star field background. We also detect B-type stars well spread in the galaxy disk of NGC 1313, probably the result of infant mortality of <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{presented a}} model for the cluster formation efficiency (CFE), i. e. the fraction of star formation occurring in bound <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> It utilizes the idea that the formation of stars and <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> occurs across a continuous spectrum of ISM densities. Bound <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> naturally arise from the high-density end of this density spectrum. Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions can achieve high star formation efficiencies (SFEs) and can be unaffected by gas expulsion. Lower-density regions remain gas-rich and substructured, and are unbound upon gas expulsion. The model enables the CFE to be calculated using galactic-scale observables.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} the ISM {{and the massive}} stars formed in {{clusters}} and, more generally, in recent events of star formation is reviewed via the global effects each has on the other. The pre-existing environment affects {{the properties of the}} massive stars, the duration of the star-forming event and could potentially affect the IMF. The collective effect of massive-star winds and supernova explosions creates a structured ISM by forming bubbles, supershells and, in more extreme cases, by inducing large-scale gas outflows. Gas/dust removal may quench star formation in young <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> Conversely, supernova-driven shocks may trigger star formation in molecular clouds surrounding the <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters.</b> Metal ejection from the massive stars is responsible for the pollution of the ISM and, if the metal-rich gas can escape the galaxy's gravitational potential, of the IGM. The environment where <b>stellar</b> <b>clusters</b> form is populated by a diffuse stellar population which contributes between 50 % and 80 % of the total UV light.
