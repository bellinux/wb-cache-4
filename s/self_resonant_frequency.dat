40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of inductors on an Alumina substrate over the temperature range of 25 to 475 C. Five sets of inductors, each set consisting of a 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5, and a 4. 5 turn inductor with different line width and spacing, were measured on a high temperature probe station from 10 MHz to 30 GHz. From these measured characteristics, it is shown that the inductance is nearly independent of temperature for low frequencies compared to the <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency,</b> the parasitic capacitances are independent of temperature, and the resistance varies nearly linearly with temperature. These characteristics result in the <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> decreasing by only a few percent as the temperature is increased from 25 to 475 C, but the maximum quality factor decreases {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3.

40|$|In today’s {{communication}} devices, {{the need}} for high performance inductors is increasing as they are extensively used in RF integrated circuits (RFICs). This need is even more pronounced for variable inductors as they are widely required in tunable filters, voltage controlled amplifiers (VCO) and low noise amplifiers (LNA). For RFICs, the main tuning elements are solid state varactors {{that are used in}} conjunction with invariable inductors. However, they have limited linearity, high resistive losses, and low <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This emphasizes {{the need for}} developing another tuning element that can be fabricated monolithically with ICs and can offer high range of tuning. Due to the ease of CMOS integration and low cost silicon based IC fabrication, the inductors currently used are a major source of energy loss, therefore driving the overall quality factor and performance of the chip down. During the last decade there has been an increase in research in RF MicroelectroMechanical Systems (RF MEMS) to develop high quality on chip tunable RF components. MEMS capacitors were initially proposed to substitute the existing varactors, however they can not be easily integrated on top of CMOS circuits. RF MEMS variable inductors have recently attracted attention as a better alternative. The research presented here explores using porous anodic alumina (PAA) in CMOS and MEMS fabrication. Due to its low cost and low temperature processing, PAA is an excellent candidate for silicon system integration. At first, PAA is explored as an isolation layer between the inductor and the lossy silicon substrate. Simulations show that although the dielectric constant of the PAA is tunable, the stress produced by the required thicker layers is problematic. Nevertheless, the use of PAA as a MEMS material shows much more promise. Tunable RF MEMS inductors based on bimorph sandwich layer of aluminum PAA and aluminum are fabricated and tested. A tuning range of 31 % is achieved for an inductance variation of 5. 8 nH to 7. 6 nH at 3 GHz. To further improve the Q, bimorph layers of gold and PAA are fabricated on Alumina substrates. A lower tuning range is produced; however the quality factor performance is greatly improved. A peak Q of over 30 with a demonstrated 3 % tuning range is presented. Depending on the need for either high performance or tunability, two types of tunable RF MEMS inductors are presented. Although PAA shows promise as a mechanical material for MEMS, the processing parameters (mainly stress and loss tangent) need to be improved if used as an isolation layer. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} this material has been proposed and successfully used as a structural material for MEMS devices and CMOS processes...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{communication}} devices demand challenging specifications {{in terms of}} miniaturization, performance, power consumption and cost. Every new generation of radio frequency integrated circuits (RF-ICs) offer better functionality at reduced size, power consumption and cost per device and per integrated function. Passive devices (resistors, inductors, capacitors, antennas and transmission lines) represent {{an important part of}} the cost and size of RF circuits. These components have not evolved at the same level of the transistor devices, especially because their performance is strongly degenerated when they scale down in size. The low resistivity silicon used to build the transistors also imposes prohibitive levels of RF losses to these passive devices. Radio frequency microelectromechanical systems (RF MEMS) are enabling technologies capable to bring significant improvement in the electrical performances and expressive size and cost reduction of these functions, with unparallel introduction of new functionalities, unimaginable to attain when using bulky, externally connected discrete components. High quality factor (Q) inductors are amongst ones of the most needed components in RF circuits and at the same time ones that are most affected by thin metallization and substrate related losses, demanding considerable research effort. This thesis presents a contribution toward the development of thick metal fabrication technologies, covering also the design, modeling and characterization of high quality factor and high self-resonant frequency (SRF) RF MEMS passive devices, with a special emphasis on spiral inductors. A new approach using damascene-like interconnect fabrication steps associated to low κ dielectrics (polyimide), highly-conductive thick copper electroplating, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and tailored substrate properties delivered quality factors in excess of 40 and <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in excess of 10 GHz, performances in the current state-of-the-art for integrated spiral inductors built on top of silicon wafers. Furthermore, the developed process steps are compatible with back-end processing used to fabricate modern IC interconnects and have a low thermal budget (< 250 °C), what makes it a good choice to build above-IC passives without degenerating the performance of passivated RF-CMOS circuits. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of quartz substrates was also studied for the fabrication of spiral inductors, offering excellent RF performances (Q exceeding 40 and SRF exceeding 7 GHz). A new doubly-functional quartz packaging concept for RF MEMS devices was developed. This technique process both sides of the packaging wafer: the top is used to embed high quality factor copper inductors while the bottom is thermo-mechanically bonded to another RF MEMS wafer, offering a semi-hermetic SU- 8 epoxy-based seal. The bonding process was optimized for high yield, to be compatible with SF 6 -plasma-released MEMS and to present low level of RF losses. Band pass filters for the GSM (1. 8 GHz) and WLAN (5. 2 GHz) standards were fabricated and characterized by RF measurements and full wave electromagnetic simulations. Although further development is need in order to predict the frequency response accurately, insertion losses as low as 1. 2 dB were demonstrated, levels that cannot be usually attained using on-chip passives. Systematic analysis, RF measurements, electromagnetic simulations and equivalent circuit extraction were used to model the behavior of the fabricated devices and establish a methodology to deliver optimum performances for a given technological profile and specified performance targets (quality factor, inductance and frequency bandwidth). A simple yet accurate physics-based analytical model for spiral inductors was developed and proved to be accurate in terms of loss estimation for thick metal layers. This model is capable to accurately describe the frequency-dependent behavior of the device below its first <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> over a large device design space.

40|$|Integrated inductors, {{also called}} spiral inductors, on-chip inductors, or planarinductors, are inseparable part in radio {{frequency}} integrated circuits (RFICs). Increasing growth in RFICs {{from the past}} few decades has forced study of these components in greater detail. Apart from IC inductors, there are several components mounted on a chip - namely capacitors, resistors, MOSFETs, diodes etc. It is extremely important to understand the electrical and magnetic behavior of all these components. Electrical behavior of these components is easy to understand. However, the real challenge lies in realizing and predicting the magnetic behavior of components, namely, inductors and capacitors. Capacitors have their own physical model developed for accurate modeling, but for inductors there are many factors to be considered. As the frequencies in RFICs are in the GHz range, factors such as <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> (SRF), quality factor (Q), self and mutual inductance are critical to design due to the very small size of inductor. Past research in this field has made it possible to predict magnetic behavior accurately by theoretical methods and/or electromagnetic simulators. Apart from these simulators, various equations have been derived for accurate calculation of inductance related to several geometries. Lumped physical models developed in the past help to model parasitic elements most accurately. This thesis concentrates on a brief study of integrated inductors, their construction and modeling.

40|$|The {{permeation}} of CMOS {{technology to}} radio frequencies and beyond has fuelled {{an urgent need}} for a diverse array of passive and active circuits that address the challenges of rapidly emerging wireless applications. While traditional analog based design approaches satisfy some applications, the stringent requirements of newly emerging applications cannot necessarily be addressed by existing design ideas and compel designers to pursue alternatives. One such alternative, an amalgamation of microwave and analog design techniques, is pursued in this work. A number of passive and active circuits have been designed {{using a combination of}} microwave and analog design techniques. For passives, the most crucial challenge to their CMOS implementation is identified as their large dimensions that are not compatible with CMOS technology. To address this issue, several design techniques ? including multi-layered design and slow wave structures ? are proposed and demonstrated through experimental results after being suitably tailored for CMOS technology. A number of novel passive structures - including a compact 10 GHz hairpin resonator, a broadband, low loss 25 - 35 GHz Lange coupler, a 25 - 35 GHz thin film microstrip (TFMS) ring hybrid, an array of 0. 8 nH and 0. 4 nH multi-layered high <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> (SRF) inductors are proposed, designed and experimentally verified. A number of active circuits are also designed and notable experimental results are presented. These include 3 - 10 GHz and DC- 20 GHz distributed low noise amplifiers (LNA), a dual wideband Low noise amplifier and 15 GHz distributed voltage controlled oscillators (DVCO). Distributed amplifiers are identified as particularly effective in the development of wideband receiver front end sub-systems due to their gain flatness, excellent matching and high linearity. The most important challenge to the implementation of distributed amplifiers in CMOS RFICs is identified as the issue of their miniaturization. This problem is solved by using integrated multi-layered inductors instead of transmission lines to achieve over 90 % size compression compared to earlier CMOS implementations. Finally, a dual wideband receiver front end sub-system is designed employing the miniaturized distributed amplifier with resonant loads and integrated with a double balanced Gilbert cell mixer to perform dual band operation.

One area of application which is immediately obvious is the RF filtering which is required in {{communication devices}}. The primary contribution of the present work is to establish a procedure for using such embedded passives to implement RF filters. While a large body of work has been previously devoted to the modeling and creation of individual embedded passives, the challenge of combining them into functional networks for use in communications system has not yet been the subject of a significant amount of academic analysis. By consolidating the knowledge gained by previous work concerning the modeling and optimization of embedded passives, the present work attempts to formulate an optimized procedure for creating embedded passive filter networks. The present work presents the design and implementation of LC ladder filters for microwave frequencies using passives embedded in an organic substrate provided by Intel Corporation. The work presents an efficient and accurate methodology for the design and implementation of such filters in a limited footprint area, with an emphasis on creating a straightforward, fast design procedure. For both embedded passive inductors and capacitors a parameterized three dimensional model suitable for use in a fullwave solver has been developed. An exhaustive documentation of the simulation parameters used to simulate these structures is provided in order to assist others in repeating the work presented here. In order to create embedded filters, libraries spanning the design space of both embedded inductors and capacitors have been formed. Inductors with different numbers of turns, trace widths, trace spacing, and inner diameters have been simulated from 1 to 10 GHz and analyzed to obtain the inductance, <b>self</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency,</b> Q, and parasitic effects. Capacitors with plate areas ranging from a minimum size up to 1 mm 2 ̆ 2 are also simulated and empirical formulas for their capacitance, resistance and inductance are provided. Based on this, a design methodology is proposed and documented. The design methodology includes compensation for the coupling effects that exist between embedded passives placed in close proximity to one another. Based on the simulated coupling effects suggestions for layout are made. A design procedure developed in this work has been applied to a three pole and five pole low pass filters. The filters 2 ̆ 7 characteristics show an excellent agreement the response of the LC ladder filter. Finally the work presents a study of some the effects of manufacturing tolerances on filter construction. Based on the preliminary findings of the investigation the most detrimental effects are determined and further work to explore these issues is suggested...|$|E

So this study aims at using a non-destructive method, the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> measurement, to estimate the failure scenario of a rock sample. The experiments focus on determining <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> values of two limestone rocks at different known states of uniaxial stress which are linked to states of cracking. Then the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> is measured on the same limestone rocks submitted to a global mechanical stress : freeze-thaw cycles. First this study shows that the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> can give {{a model of the}} failure scenario of a rock sample submitted to local mechanical stresses. Besides the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> variations with global stresses are similar to the trend previously observed with uniaxial stresses. So this study enables to predict its failure scenario considering the trend of the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> values...|$|R
