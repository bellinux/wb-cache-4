The relationship between the presence of farmers’ markets and adult Italians’ Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed by applying quantile regression on a cross-sectional, individual-level database, matched with regional farmers’ markets density figures. Findings illustrate that for most adult Italians, a higher density of farmers’ markets is associated with lower BMIs and that this relationship becomes more marked for individuals with higher BMIs facing limited supermarket access...|$|E

The mathematical expressions of initial distribution line fault current traveling wave, reflection wave of the fault location and the refraction wave of opposite ends are derived.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} adaptation/standardization of the {{marketing}} program done by small and medium sized companies (SME) for international markets. To {{be able to answer}} this, four research questions were posed: (1) How are SMEs’ standardization/adaptation of products to international markets influenced by various factors? (2) How are SMEs’ standardization /adaptation of price to international markets influenced by various factors? (3) How are SMEs’ standardization/adaptation of promotion to international markets influenced by various factors? (4) How are SMEs’ standardization/adaptation of distribution channels to international markets influenced by various factors? The empirical work for this study consists of data collected from Liko, an international medium sized company in the industrial sector making medical technical equipment. The findings of the study indicate that a successful international SME is taking the initiative to adapt to customers in foreign markets since this can help the SME to concur market shares. The study also showed that a specialized product often require price adaptation in different international markets since customer demands differ, and when the product is specialized, {{it is important for the}} SME to have knowledge over both the market and the product area in order to set the right price. It is also important for the SME to have experience within the promotional area in order to be market leader and it should use tradeshows as a part of their promotion activity. This study also shows that a <b>short</b> <b>distribution</b> channel, and thereby <b>short</b> <b>distribution</b> time, leads to increased sales for the SME. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

KIIs illuminated numerous challenges in providing humanitarian assistance and resulting tensions within the community, including that assistance programs target the most vulnerable households (IDPs, widows, households with many children, and the elderly) but do not have sufficient resources to cover all households that meet the inclusion criteria or to assist other poor households. Local council members explained how strict selection criteria and <b>short</b> <b>distribution</b> time frames can hinder programs from reaching {{some of the most}} vulnerable and that perceived inequities can strain community relations; some local council members suggested tensions could be avoided if programs were designed to benefit the whole community rather than selected households.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{accuracy}} of reactive power sharing, the droop control gains are necessary to be optimized [11, 12]. However, there are still inherent tradeoff between the load sharing accuracy and voltage regulation. Therefore, these methods are only valid for the microgrid with <b>short</b> <b>distribution</b> lines where the line impedance is negligible. Recently, the virtual reactor or integral unit to adjust the equivalent impedance of DGs {{is added to the}} conventional droop control loop [13, 14]. However, the line impedance is still unknown even the equivalent impedance of DGs can be established. Thus, the line impedances are detected or calculated in some literatures [15, 16] in order to mitigate their influence. However, it is quite complicated to implement. In some cases, the external communication is still adopted [17]. However, the reliability and stability of microgrids will be affected substantially by the communication system. The complicated communication system would also increase the difficulties significantly in design and implementation of large scale microgrids.|$|E
