5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E

5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
25|$|Another form of dress, now rarely <b>seen,</b> <b>is</b> the habit, {{which is}} worn over a black gown. Only Oxford and Cambridge (though in theory Durham too) use habits and mainly reserve their use for very formal {{ceremonial}} occasions {{and to a}} specific group of academics or officials.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{models and}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been proposed}} in attempt to explain {{the broad range of}} symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> not experienced equally in all patients.|$|E
50|$|To date, the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (<b>SEE)</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} {{formally}} published measurement of ethnocultural empathy. <b>SEE</b> <b>is</b> composed of three instrumental aspects: intellectual empathy, empathic emotions, and the communication of those two.|$|R
40|$|The Holy <b>See</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} from the Vatican. The Vatican is a state, whereas the Holy <b>See</b> <b>is</b> the central governing institution of the Catholic Church.

Although {{it is not a}} state, it enjoys international recognition. Its diplomacy consists of intern and extern aspect. The intern aspect of its diplomacy is that of church interest. The extern aspect is that of diplomacy itself. It is neutral in internationally political interests. It focuses on humanitarian and moral diplomacy. </em...|$|R

25|$|Undress gowns {{may be made}} of silk or stuff. The gown may be {{worn with}} a doctor's hood. The PhD hood, the one most {{commonly}} <b>seen,</b> <b>is</b> made of black corded silk lined with scarlet cloth; the hoods of higher doctors are made of red cloth and lined with silk in the faculty colour (scarlet for letters, pink shot light blue for science, light-cherry for laws, mid-cherry for medicine, dove grey for divinity). The MusD hood is of cream damask lined with dark cherry satin.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, what is <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} that are consistent only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into {{the black hole}}. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with other gas streams, interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E

25|$|Another example are {{historical}} role-playing sims such as 1880s Victorian London and The 1920s Berlin Project. While only {{encouraged to}} do so in 1880s Victorian London, visitors to the 1920s Berlin Project are required to dress accurately as part of the history based immersive experience. Sims may incorporate rules that have less to do with thematic realism, and more to do with adhering to community guidelines. For instance, one rule that is commonly <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> the prohibition or restriction of underage avatars in role-playing sims that feature sexual content; these rules are separate from Linden Labs' sim restrictions, as they restrict underage characters played by adult players.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{classification}} {{is usually}} {{followed by an}} abundance indication, following one of several schemes: S2,5; S2/5; S2 Zr4 Ti2; or S2*5. A number following a comma is a scale between 1 and 9 based on the ratio of ZrO and TiO. A number following a slash is a more recent but less common scheme designed to represent the ratio of carbon to oxygen {{on a scale of}} 1 to 10, where a 0 would be an MS star. Intensities of zirconium and titanium may be indicated explicitly. Also occasionally <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> a number following an asterisk, which represents the strength of the ZrO bands on a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E
25|$|For {{partially}} impacted {{teeth in}} those over 20 year of age, {{the most common}} pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the impacted tooth. The bacteria associated with infections include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides bacteria. The next most common pathology <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> cavities or tooth decay. Fifteen percent of people with retained wisdom teeth exposed to the mouth have cavities on the wisdom tooth or adjacent second molar due to a wisdom tooth. The rate of cavities {{on the back of}} the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age.|$|E

25|$|The bell {{itself is}} simple in design, {{hammered}} into shape {{with a small}} handle fixed to the top with rivets. Originally forged from iron, it has since been coated in bronze. The shrine is inscribed with three names, including King Domnall Ua Lochlainn's. The rear of the shrine, {{not intended to be}} <b>seen,</b> <b>is</b> decorated with crosses while the handle is decorated with, among other work, Celtic designs of birds. The bell is accredited with working a miracle in 1044 and having been coated in bronze to shield it from human eyes, for which it would be too holy. It measures 12.510cm at the base, 12.84cm at the shoulder, 16.5cm from base to shoulder, 3.3cm from shoulder to top of handle and weighs 1.7kg.|$|E
25|$|The north tower, {{completed}} in 1439, was the world's tallest building from 1647 (when the spire of St. Mary's church, Stralsund burnt down) until 1874 (when {{the tower of}} St. Nikolai's Church in Hamburg was completed). The planned south tower was never built and as a result, with its characteristic asymmetrical form, the cathedral is now the premier landmark of Alsace. One can see 30 kilometers from the observation level, which provides {{a view of the}} Rhine banks from the Vosges {{all the way to the}} Black Forest. The octagonal tower as it can be <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> the combined work of architects Ulrich Ensingen (shaft) and Johannes Hültz of Cologne (top). Ensingen worked on the cathedral from 1399 to 1419, and Hültz from 1419 to 1439.|$|E
25|$|On the surface, {{all that}} can be <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> a {{concrete}} slab inset with glass tiles, the skylights for the platform below. This patch of concrete {{is in the middle}} of a grove of dogwoods in front of City Hall, close to Broadway. However, for the 2004 Centennial Celebration, one of the street entrances was restored (and presently resembles a modern station entrance), and the station was opened for the duration of the celebration. Otherwise, the station is now used only as an emergency exit. , tours of the station are once again being conducted, by the staff of the Transit Museum. However, at present, tours are only open to registered members of the museum and require advance payment and reservations.|$|E

25|$|Cones are {{responsible}} for colour vision. They require brighter light to function than rods require. In humans, there are three types of cones, maximally sensitive to long-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and short-wavelength light (often referred to as red, green, and blue, respectively, though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours). The colour <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> the combined effect of stimuli to, and responses from, these three types of cone cells. Cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea. Only a few are present {{at the sides of}} the retina. Objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea, as when one looks at an object directly. Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve. When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres. The optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{bilateral}} {{activation of}} the brain has been seen with unilateral stimulation (accomplished by placing a stimulus under one nostril only), the activation <b>seen</b> <b>is</b> not exactly equal in both hemispheres. Different {{parts of the brain}} are involved in olfactory memory, depending on what type of memory is being processed (e.g. implicit memory-habituation or explicit memory-recognition) and this is evident in the results of explicit and implicit tasks of memory. Studies have shown that the left hemisphere is activated during verbal semantic retrieval of odor-related memories, while the right hemisphere shows activation during non-verbal retrieval of semantic odor-related information. Much overlap does occur between regions, however. Information of odors of a semantic nature is distributed across both sides of the brain, although the right hemisphere is more involved in the processing of odor quality and previous encounter of the stimulus than the left. Neural plasticity is also an important part of olfaction, as different experiences may result in alterations of both cortical and subcortical circuitry in the brain.|$|E
