40|$|Abstract Background <b>Self-directed</b> {{and other}} <b>violence</b> {{as well as}} {{subsequent}} coercive interventions occur in a substantial proportion of patients with personality disorders during in-patient treatment. Different strategies {{may be required to}} reduce coercive interventions for patients of different diagnostic groups. Methods We specialised one of our acute admission wards in the treatment of personality disorders and adjustment disorders (ICD- 10 F 4 and F 6). Patients are not transferred to other acute wards in case of suicidal or violent behaviour. Violent behaviour and coercive interventions such as seclusion or restraint were recorded {{in the same way as}} in the rest of the hospital. We recorded the percentage of subjects affected by diagnostic group and average length of an intervention in the year before and after the change in organisational structure. Results The total number of coercive interventions decreased by 85 % both among patients with an F 4 and those with an F 6 primary diagnosis. Violent behaviours decreased by about 50 %, the proportion of involuntary committed patients decreased by 70 %. Conclusion The organisational change turned out to be highly effective without any additional cost of personnel or other resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPersonality {{disorder}} {{is associated with}} self-harm and suicide, as well as criminal offending and violence towards others. These behaviours overlap when the means chosen to self-harm or attempt suicide put others at risk. In such circumstances, an individual's mental state at {{one and the same}} time may be deemed to meet the conditions for criminal responsibility, and to warrant involuntary hospital admission. I explore this tension in how people with personality disorder are treated {{at the hands of the}} criminal and civil law respectively in England and Wales: they may be deemed sufficiently mentally well to be punished for their crimes, but not deemed sufficiently mentally well to retain the right to make their own decisions about matters of serious importance to their own lives, including whether or not to continue them. The article divides into four sections. After introducing this tension, Section 2 sketches the nature of personality disorder and the psychology underlying <b>self-directed</b> and other-directed <b>violence.</b> Section 3 addresses the questions of whether people with personality disorder who are violent, whether towards self or others, typically meet the conditions for criminal responsibility and mental capacity respectively, considering in particular whether their underlying desires and values, or their emotional distress, affect their mental capacity to make treatment decisions. Section 4 then considers what we might do to address the tension, within the confines of current legislation. Drawing on The Review of the Mental Health Act 1983, I argue that we are ethically justified in involuntarily admitting to hospital people with personality disorder who pose a serious risk to themselves only if we simultaneously undertake to offer genuine help for their future, in the form of appropriate treatment, social support, and better life opportunities — a provision which, as things stand in England and Wales, is sorely lacking...|$|R

50|$|Van Orden et al. (2010) {{posited that}} there are two major factors {{involved}} in suicide attempts. The first major factor is a desire for death and the second acquired capability. Desire for death occurs through ideations of thwarted belongingness it is described as feeling alienated from others emotionally and perceived burdensomeness it is described as feeling that one is incompetent and therefore a burden on others. The acquired capability in this context is used because people naturally fear death and painful experiences. The capability to carry out the suicide attempt is usually formed from emotional and physical pain and disrupted cognitive status and is acquired through previous suicide attempts (<b>self-directed</b> <b>violence),</b> rehearsing suicide through behavior or imagery, and getting used to painful or dangerous experiences in other ways.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has linked {{family and community}} connectedness with decreased risk of <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> among adolescents.

The authors provide an interdisciplinary review of current trends and historical data on <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> in adolescents of color.

40|$|Objective: The primary aim was {{to relate}} Toxoplasma gondii {{seropositivity}} and serointensity to scores on the self-rated Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS-S). Another {{aim was to}} reevaluate the previously reported positive association between T gondii serointensity {{and a history of}} nonfatal suicidal <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence.</b> Method: This cross-sectional, observational study compared T gondii serointensity and seropositivity in plasma from 54 adult suicide attempters (inpatients at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden) and 30 adult control subjects (randomly selected from the municipal population register in Lund, Sweden) recruited between 2006 and 2010. The potential of patients and controls for <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> was evaluated with the SUAS-S. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria. Plasma samples were tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies to T gondii, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between T gondii serointensity or seropositivity and a history of nonfatal suicidal self-directed violence; multivariable linear regression was used to explore the relationship between T gondii serointensify or seropositivity and the SUAS-S. Both regression models included sex, age, and body mass index as covariates. Results: Seropositivity of T gondii (adjusted odds ratio [OR]= 7. 12; 95 % CI, 1. 66 - 30. 6; P=. 008) and serointensity of T gondii (adjusted OR= 2. 01; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 3. 71; P=. 03) were positively associated with a history of nonfatal suicidal <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence.</b> Seropositivity of T gondii was associated with higher SUAS-S scores, a relationship significant for the whole sample (P=. 026), but not for suicide attempters only. No significant associations with other pathogens were identified.

OBJECTIVE: We used a nationally representative survey to examine demographics and underlying psychiatric disorders in United States (US) hospitalizations with non-fatal <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> (SDV). METHOD: International Classification of Disease, 9 (th) Revision (ICD- 9) discharge diagnosis data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) were examined from 1997 to 2006 using frequency measures and adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: The rate of discharges with SDV remained relatively stable over the study time period with 4. 5 to 5. 7 hospitalizations per 10, 000 persons per year. Excess SDV was documented for females, adolescents, whites, and those from the Midwest or West. While females had a higher likelihood of self-poisoning, both genders had comparable proportions of hospitalizations with SDV resulting in injury. Over 86 % of the records listing SDV also included psychiatric disorders, with the most frequent being affective (57. 8 %) and substance abuse (37. 1 %) disorders. The association between psychiatric disorders and self-injury was strongest for personality disorders for both males (OR = 2. 1; 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 3. 4) and females (OR = 3. 8; 95 % CI = 2. 7 - 5. 3).

The paper also draws on a series of philosophical, psychoanalytic and political motifs – the ideas of ‘no hope’, Lacanian concept of the imaginary, and Mngxitama’s notion of the failure of interracial dialogue - as a means of drawing attention to the readiness with which we often succumb to comforting social myths...|$|E

The strategic direction we propose is to prevent suicidal behavior by building and strengthening connectedness or social bonds within and among persons, families, and communities. Background In the United States and around the world, <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> is a serious public health problem.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the types of}} violence that are present worldwide, in the everyday lives of people, and that constitute {{the bulk of the}} health burden imposed by violence. Accordingly, the information has been arranged in nine chapters, covering the following topics: 1. Violence – a global public health problem 2. Youth violence 3. Child abuse and neglect by parents and other caregivers 4. Violence by intimate partners 5. Abuse of the elderly 6. Sexual violence 7. <b>Self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> 8. Collective violence 9. The way forward: recommendations for action; Because it is impossible to cover all types of violence fully and adequately in a single document, each chapter has a specific focus. For example, the chapter on youth violence examines interpersonal violence among adolescents and young adults in the community. The chapter on child abuse discusses physical, sexual and psychological abuse, as well as neglect by parents and other caregivers; other forms of maltreatment of children, such as child prostitution and the use of children as soldiers, are covered {{in other parts of the}} report. The chapter on abuse of the elderly focuses on abuse by caregivers in domestic and institutional settings, while that on collective violence discusses violent conflict. The chapters on intimate partner violence and sexual violence focus primarily on violence against women, though some discussion of violence directed at men and boys is included in the chapter on sexual violence. The chapter on <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> focuses primarily on suicidal behaviour. The chapter is included in the report because suicidal behaviour is one of the external causes of injury and is often the product of many of the same underlying social, psychological and environmental factors as other types of violence. The chapters follow a similar structure. Each begins with a brief discussion of definitions for the specific type of violence covered in the chapter, followed by a summary of current knowledge about the extent of the problem in different regions of the world. Where possible, country-level data are presented, as well as findings from a range of research studies. The chapters then describe the causes and consequences of violence, provide summaries of the interventions and policy responses that have been tried, and make recommendations for future research and action. Tables, figures and boxes are included to highlight specific epidemiological patterns and findings, illustrate examples of prevention activities, and draw attention to specific issues. The report concludes with two additional sections: a statistical annex and a list of Internet resources. The statistical annex contains global, regional and country data derived from the WHO mortality and morbidity database and from Version 1 of the WHO Global Burden of Disease project for 2000. A description of data sources and methods is provided in the annex to explain how these data were collected and analysed. The list of Internet resources includes web site addresses for organizations involved in violence research, prevention and advocacy.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{estimation}} {{of an effect}} size {{is an important step}} in designing an adequately powered, feasible clinical trial intended to change clinical practice. During the planning phase of VA Cooperative Study # 590, “Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Lithium for Preventing Repeated Suicidal <b>Self-Directed</b> <b>Violence</b> in Patients with Depression or Bipolar Disorder (Li+),” it was not clear what effect size would be considered large enough to influence prescribing behavior among practicing clinicians. MethodsWe conducted an online survey of VA psychiatrists to assess their interest in the study question, their clinical experience with lithium, and their opinion about what suicide reduction rate would change their prescribing habits. The 9 -item survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey© and VA psychiatrists were individually emailed an invitation to complete an anonymous online survey. Three email waves were sent over three weeks. ResultsOverall, 862 of 2713 VA psychiatrists (response rate =  31. 8 %) responded to the anonymous survey. 74 % of the respondents would refer a patient to the proposed trial, 9 % would not, and 17 % were unsure. Presented with suicide reduction rates in 10 % increments ranging from 10 to 100 %, 61 % of respondents indicated that they would use lithium if suicide attempts were reduced by at least 40 %; 83 % would use lithium if it reduced attempts by at least 50 %. ConclusionsEven with the limitations of response bias and the reliability of responses on future prescribing behavior, a survey of potential users of a clinical trial's results offers a convenient, empirical method for determining and justifying clinically relevant effect sizes...|$|E
40|$|In 1992 and 1998 Russia {{experienced}} two {{economic crises}} {{that led to}} dramatic impoverishment of population, social anxiety, and followed by mortality surges. This study analyzes age- and sex-specific mortality from violent causes in Russia after the 1992 and 1998 economic crises, using official statistical data. Accidents, injuries and alcohol poisoning demonstrated the most rapid relative increase in mortality for both sexes during the first 1992 crisis. Suicide mortality surge was particularly high in males while homicide dynamics was relatively similar for both sexes. The response to the 1998 crisis was different: the relative rate of homicide increase was particularly high among women while suicide dynamics did not demonstrate profound sex differences. Our {{findings suggest that the}} effects of the first crisis are related to stress and <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence,</b> while the second crisis is associated with violence against other persons (especially women). Further study of homicide and suicide mortality found specific responses to crisis of different age groups in the case of suicide mortality and the leading role of alcohol consumption in homicide mortality. Analysis of gender differences in suicide and homicide mortality showed increasing disadvantage of working age males in the case of suicides and increasing disadvantage of young females in the case of homicides. Factor analysis of violent mortality revealed 3 major underlying factors explaining over 92 percent of variation in external mortality which can be related to alcohol, violence, and stress. The effect of alcohol factor on violent mortality is dominating although its role in the recent years decreased while two other factors increased after 1992. Thus, violence and stress are the issues of major concern in expl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Interpersonal {{violence}} and suicide are major health concerns, leading to premature death, extensive human suffering and staggering monetary costs. Although violent behaviour has multiple causes, {{it is well}} known that acute substance intake and abuse increase the risks of both interpersonal and <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence.</b> This association is quite well established for alcohol, while a more ambiguous literature exists for other common drugs of abuse. For example, anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), synthetic analogues to the “male” sex hormone testosterone are suggested to elicit violent and aggressive behaviour. Two studies (I and III) in the present thesis addressed the association between AAS use and being suspected or convicted of a violent crime among remand prisoners and in a general population sample, respectively. Further, using the case-crossover design to control for confounders stable within individuals, I also investigated the triggering (short-term risk) effect of alcohol and drugs such as benzodiazepines and AAS, on violent crime (Study II). Finally, a fourth study (IV) based on a large national forensic sample of suicide completers (n= 18, 894) examined the risk of using a violent, more lethal, suicide method, when under acute influence of alcohol, central stimulants or cannabis. The results of this thesis suggested that AAS use in itself is not a proximal risk factor for violent crime; the observed risk is probably due to the co-occurrence of abuse of other substances. Alcohol is a strong triggering risk factor for violent crime, constant across males and females as well as individuals with or without behavioral and psychiatric vulnerability. Intake of high doses of benzodiazepines is associated with an increased risk for violent crime. Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of using the lethal suicide method of jumping from a height. I conclude that mapping substance abuse patterns may inform violence risk assessment and treatment planning...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Converging {{evidence}} identifies {{sleep disturbance}} as an evidence-based {{risk factor for}} suicidal behaviour. This relationship {{has not yet been}} systematically evaluated in association with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Research is warranted among adolescents given increased vulnerability to sleep disturbances and high risk of suicide attempts. The current investigation sought to examine sleep disturbances among youth with 1) no history of <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> (SDV) (controls), 2) history of NSSI, or 3) history of a suicide attempt (SA). Methods: N= 1046 high school students (aged 15 – 17; 53 % female) completed self-report surveys of SDV (with and without suicidal intent), depression, and a range of sleep parameters using: The Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI; Insomnia symptoms), Disturbing Dreams and Nightmare Severity Index (DDNSI), Munch Chronotype Questionnaire (MCQ; sleep efficiency (SE), total sleep time (TST), chronotype), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Consistent with suicidal ideation findings, sleep disturbance were hypothesized to be greater among both SDV groups relative to those without such a history. ANCOVA analyses (including HADS as a planned covariate) were employed to examine differences between groups. Results: Youth in groups endorsing past SDV (NSSI= 12. 2 %, SA= 5. 6 %) scored Significantly lower on the SCI (p< 0. 001), indicating greater insomnia severity than controls (82. 2 %). SE was poorer (school (p= 0. 005) and weekend nights (p= 0. 004)), with shorter school night TST (p= 0. 003) and greater eveningness observed among those reporting NSSI and SA history (p= 0. 020). DDNSI-assessed nightmare severity differed significantly between all three groups (p< 0. 001), with the highest scores observed among those with an SA history. All effects remained when controlling for depression, with the exception of chronotype. Conclusion: Findings revealed significant differences in sleep disturbance between youth with no history of SDV and those reporting NSSI or SA histories. These findings may inform empirically-driven approaches to risk assessment and interventions to enhance prevention of suicide and NSSI...|$|E
40|$|Non-conflict armed {{violence}} Rethinking models {{of conflict and}} conflict resolution Significant unrest that falls {{outside the scope of}} civil conflict or rebel insurgency is becoming more common. Such conflicts hamper development, along with other sources of tension, instability or unrest, and researchers are beginning to realise their importance. Predictive research not only illustrates how accepted and widelyevidenced drivers – such as inequality – affect conflict, but also how they are magnified {{in a world that is}} increasingly globalised. It directs us to rethink the scale and impact of what are currently considered ‘lowintensity’ patterns of conflict and the required policy responses. The changing nature of {{armed violence}} over the past several decades has blurred the distinction between armed conflict and crime 1. Well over half the 740, 000 plus people who die every year as a result of violence die in non-conflict settings 2. Between 1978 and 2000, more people died from armed violence in Rio de Janeiro than in Colombia, which is experiencing civil conflict 3. The global cost of non-conflict armed violence (NCAV) is estimated at US$ 163 billion a year 4. Data on non-conflict armed violence, however, has been largely neglected in international policy until recently. While it shares many characteristics with large-scale armed conflict, the heavy costs associated with non-conflict violence demand a more nuanced understanding of its causes and the implications for policy. What is non-conflict armed violence? It is defined as small- or large-scale criminally- or politically-motivated armed violence 5 including criminal violence (homicide, assault), gang violence, <b>self-directed</b> <b>violence</b> (suicide), domestic violence and gender-based violence 6. Men aged 15 to 29 are the main perpetrators and the main victims of these types of violence. Gender roles are changing, however, but women are still disproportionately affected by domestic and gender-based violence. Drivers of non-conflict armed violence Some drivers are similar to the causes of large-scale conflict, including...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{growing body}} of {{research}} identifies the harmful effects that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; occurring during childhood or adolescence; eg, child maltreatment or exposure to domestic violence) have on health throughout life. Studies have quantified such effects for individual ACEs. However, ACEs frequently co-occur and no synthesis of findings from studies measuring the effect of multiple ACE types has been done. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five electronic databases for cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies published up to May 6, 2016, reporting risks of health outcomes, consisting of substance use, sexual health, mental health, weight and physical exercise, violence, and physical health status and conditions, associated with multiple ACEs. We selected articles that presented risk estimates for individuals with at least four ACEs compared with those with none for outcomes with sufficient data for meta-analysis (at least four populations). Included studies also focused on adults aged at least 18 years with a sample size of at least 100. We excluded studies based on high-risk or clinical populations. We extracted data from published reports. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) using a random-effects model. Findings Of 11   621 references identified by the search, 37 included studies provided risk estimates for 23 outcomes, with a total of 253   719 participants.

The outcomes most strongly associated with multiple ACEs represent ACE risks for the next generation (eg, violence, mental illness, and substance use). To sustain improvements in public health requires a shift in focus to include prevention of ACEs, resilience building, and ACE-informed service provision. The Sustainable Development Goals provide a global platform to reduce ACEs and their life-course effect on health. Funding: Public Health Wales...|$|E
