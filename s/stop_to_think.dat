5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what they're doing or why, {{and the story of}} Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E

500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E
500|$|Robinson was {{the modern}} {{definition}} of a boxer puncher. He was able to fight almost any style: he could come out one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents weaknesses, he also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, [...] "Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward." [...] Robinson was efficient with both hands, and he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a TIME magazine article in 1951, [...] "Robinson's repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up {{on the spur of}} the moment." [...] Robinson commented that once a fighter has trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. [...] "You don't think. It's all instinct. If you <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> you're gone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Paper Clip" [...] has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics, who generally consider {{it among the}} best of the series. In an overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Paper Clip" [...] was rated as A−. It was called an [...] "outstanding episode", although Scully's unwillingness to accept the paranormal after making contact was seen as [...] "exacerbat a maddening trend". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A+. He felt that its strengths came from its parallels with real world history, such as its handling of Operation Paperclip and the actions of the West during the Cold War, noting that [...] "the compromises the United States and other Western nations made to survive the onslaught of communism in the Cold War were ones that should have made more of those nations' citizens take pause, <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the cost of living free, but they almost never did". The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc {{for the rest of the}} series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} lukewarm reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, Species {{holds an}} approval of 34% based on 35 reviews. Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, criticizing the film's plot and overall lack of intelligence. Cristine James from Boxoffice magazine gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as Alien' meets 'V' meets 'Splash' meets 'Playboy's Erotic Fantasies: Forbidden Liaisons,' diluted into a diffuse, misdirected bore." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars, stating that [...] "as {{long as you}} don't <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what's going on, Species is capable of offering its share of cheap thrills, with a laugh or two thrown in as well." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly found the film lacking in imagination and special effects, also commenting that Alfred Molina [...] "sport a haircut that's scarier than the creature." [...] Varietys review of the film {{described it as a}} [...] "gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own" [...] and that Ben Kingsley and other lead actors [...] "have only two-dimensional roles to engage them". The review mentions the similarity between H.R. Giger's design of Sil and his work on Alien.|$|E

The United Kingdom ambassador to Italy, Ivor Roberts, echoed this criticism when he stated that President Bush was [...] "the best recruiting sergeant ever for al Qaeda."". The Washington Post, p.
