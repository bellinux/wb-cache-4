5000|$|Scabiosa columbaria - pigeon scabious, pincushion flower, <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> dove pincushion; found wild on chalk downland in SE England ...|$|E
50|$|Members of this genus {{are native}} to Africa, Europe and Asia. Some species of Scabiosa, notably <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> (S. columbaria) and Mediterranean sweet scabious (S. atropurpurea) have been {{developed}} into cultivars for gardeners.|$|E
50|$|In the British Isles {{the main}} food plant of the larval {{stage of the}} marsh {{fritillary}} is the devil's bit scabious, Succisa pratensis, but can also include the field scabious, Knautia arvensis, and the <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} plants is wide and {{includes}} bee orchid, horseshoe vetch and chalk milkwort. The site supports an abundant population of pyramidal orchids. Typical plants which flourish {{on the site}} are cowslip, salad burnet, common rock-rose, yellow-rattle, burnet-saxifrage, oxeye daisy, spring-sedge (Carex caryophyllea) and marjoram. Grasses include upright brome, quaking-grass, sweet vernal-grass, crested hair-grass, yellow oat-grass and sheep's fescue. Tor-grass is dominant but in <b>small</b> areas. Devil's-bit <b>scabious</b> is present on the lower slopes. Sainfoin has entered the site from surrounding fields.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} one of the most {{important}} expanses of primary magnesian limestone grassland in Great Britain. In particular, it has the largest area of the grassland type which is characterised by blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria.|$|E
5000|$|... "Most of {{the site}} {{comprises}} species-rich turf in which sheep's-fescue Festuca ovina and meadow oat-grass Avenula pratensis are major components whilst quaking-grass Briza media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> Scabiosa columbaria, and cowslip Primula veris are widespread and frequent." ...|$|E
50|$|This former quarry is {{grassland}} on Jurassic limestone. The flora is diverse, {{with over}} thirty flowering plant species in each square metre. There are several locally rare plants, such as dodder, autumn gentian, clustered bellflower and <b>small</b> <b>scabious.</b> The sward is kept short by grazing by sheep and cattle.|$|E
50|$|In {{the earlier}} {{half of the}} year (spring and summer), these are often popular sights: grizzled skipper, brown argus, purple hairstreak, eyebright, <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> kidney vetch, dingy, grayling, large thyme, {{marjoram}} autumn gentian and carline thistle. In the later {{half of the year}} (autumn and winter), purging buckthorns are popular.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} plant that grows between 25 and 100 cm. It prefers grassy places and dry soils, avoiding heavy soils, and flowers between July and September. The flowered head is flatter than similar species devils bit scabious and <b>small</b> <b>scabious.</b> There are 4 stamens in each flower, and 1 notched long stigma.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{interest}} lies {{in an area}} of unimproved magnesian limestone grassland, {{in which}} blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria, are the dominant species. This is a scarce vegetation type, which is found only in County Durham and the extent of which has been severely reduced by quarrying and intensive agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|Succisa pratensis Moench, {{also known}} as devil's-bit or devil's-bit scabious, is a {{flowering}} plant in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae. It differs from other similar species in that it has 4-lobed flowers, whereas <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> and field scabious have 5 lobes and hence it has been placed in a separate genus in the same family. [...] It also grows on damper ground.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} habitats are {{found at the}} site. Parts of the shingle with more moderate toxicity support short grasses such as sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina), or taller grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhena therum elatius) and common knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Amongst these are found a number of species associated with limestone including kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), purging flax (Linum catharticum) and <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> (Scabiosa columbaria).|$|E
5000|$|The western rocky {{slopes of}} the Ijevan {{mountain}} range and Mount Abeghasar are rich in petrophytes and rare plants. Rocks and cliffs serves as a favorable habitat for numerous rare species such as Armenian Saint John's wort (Hypericum armenum, saxifrage (Saxifraga juniperifolia, S. tridactylites), scorzonera (Scorzonera rigida), cephalaria (Cephalaria media), <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> (Scabiosa columbaria), jasmine (Jasminum fruticans) and others. Mount Abeghasar is especially rich in rare species.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland {{on the edge}} of Salisbury Plain, parts of it with over forty plant species per square metre, and supports some uncommon butterflies. Its slopes of the Lower Chalk mostly face south-west, and there are two combes. The sward is notable for upright brome (Bromus erectus) and sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina). Other plants include quaking grass! crested hair-grass, Bird’s-foot-trefoil, dwarf thistle, <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> (Scabiosa columbaria) and hoary plantain (Plantago media).|$|E
50|$|The down has {{a typical}} chalk downland {{wildlife}} on the uncultivated areas (generally the {{southern and eastern}} slopes). This includes plants such as <b>Small</b> <b>Scabious,</b> Harebell, Cowslip and Lady's Bedstraw. The chalk cliffs {{to the north and}} east are important nesting places for seabirds.Historically, Culver has been the source of commercial bird's egg collecting from ropes over the cliff. It was also known for breeding peregrine falcons, as well as breeding Common Woodpigeons (Culvers), the source of the cliff's name.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a small area of species-rich magnesian limestone grassland, a vegetation type that is rare nationally and mainly restricted to County Durham and Tyne and Wear. There are two distinct plant communities, the larger of which, dominated by blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria, is known only from east Durham. The other community, dominated by upright brome, Bromus erectus, is common on limestone in southern England but is at its northern limit in Durham, {{where there are no}} other protected sites.|$|E
50|$|Cadbury Hill is a {{designated}} Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond - previously hidden by undergrowth - was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, wood anemone, bluebell, betony, <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of common spotted orchids. The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers.|$|E
50|$|Further {{information}} {{is in the}} nature reserves handbook. This oolitic limestone grassland supports a variety of plants and animals. These include the greater butterfly-orchid, bee orchid, common spotted orchid, wild columbine, common rock-rose, milkwort, kidney vetch, wild thyme, yellow rattle and devil's bit scabious during May and June. Green-winged orchid, cowslip, early purple orchid, wood anemone, hairy violet and bluebell can be seen early in the year. In late summer pyramidal orchid, autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, Carline thistle, betony, yellow-wort, marjoram, zigzag clover, <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> and Dyer's greenweed flower.|$|E
50|$|Andrena marginata, {{sometimes}} called the <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> mining bee is a species of the sand bee (Andrena) genus. It feeds on different nectar-bearing plants of the family Dipsacaceae, like field scabious and Devil's-bit scabious (from which its common name derives), though has also been observed foraging on knapweed and creeping thistle. The female builds a nest {{in the ground and}} fills the cells with a mixture of nectar and pollen. One egg is placed in each cell and the larva hatches, grow and pupates within the nest. The adults emerge in spring after hibernation.|$|E
50|$|The Wren's Nest is a {{geological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest in the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, north west of {{the town}} centre of Dudley, in the West Midlands of England. It {{is one of the}} most important geological locations in Britain. It is also a Local Nature Reserve, a national nature reserve (NNR) and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The site is home to a number of species of birds and locally rare flora, such as <b>Small</b> <b>Scabious,</b> Milkwort and Quaking Grass. The caverns are also a nationally important hibernation site for seven different species of bat.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{important}} for its magnesian limestone grassland communities, which are largely confined to County Durham and increasingly scarce even there. The grasslands at Quarrington Hill are typical of the type, being characterised {{by the presence of}} blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria. Less common species include common milkwort, Polygala vulgaris, hairy violet, Viola hirta, and wild carrot, Daucus carota. The nationally scarce dark-red helleborine, Epipactis atrorubens, is found at the site, as is basil thyme, Clinopodium acinos, a southern species that is uncommon this far north.|$|E
50|$|Folkestone Downs {{is one of}} {{the largest}} areas of {{unimproved}} chalk downland in Kent. The extensive flora includes many typical species found in chalk grassland including horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> as well as scarce species such as bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea). Many species of orchid grow on the downs notably the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) as well as the nationally scarce early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) and man orchid (Aceras anthropophorum). The nationally scarce burnt orchid (Neotinea ustulata) has also been recorded in the past. Folkestone Downs is also notable for its extensive lichen flora.|$|E
50|$|The site {{occupies}} {{part of a}} disused quarry, {{in which}} have developed areas of primary and secondary magnesian limestone grassland. Such grassland is largely confined to County Durham and increasingly scarce even there. The grasslands at Tuthill Quarry are typical of the type, being characterised {{by the presence of}} blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> Scabiosa columbaria, but a number of less common species are also present, including common butterwort, Pinguicula vulgaris, and adder's-tongue fern, Ophioglossum vulgatum. There is a small patch of the nationally scarce bird's-eye primrose, Primula farinosa, {{and one of the few}} records from lowland Durham of lesser clubmoss, Selaginella selaginoides, is from this site.|$|E
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is restharrow, hare's-foot clover, hop trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, musk mallow, clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, brown knapweed, greater knapweed, <b>small</b> <b>scabious,</b> woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|E
50|$|Gentle slopes on the Maiden Paps support species-rich Magnesian Limestone {{grassland}} {{dominated by}} upright brome Bromus erectus, blue moor-grass Sesleria albicans, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha, red fescue Festuca rubra, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and herbs such as common rock-rose Helianthemum nummularia, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, fairy flax Linum catharticum, wild thyme Thymus praecox, pignut Conopodium majus, <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> Scabiosa columbaria and sea plantain Plantago maritima. Of particular note {{is a small}} population of perennial flax Linum anglicum, which occurs here towards the northern limit of its distribution range in Great Britain, and locally uncommon plants such as frog orchid Coeloglossum viride, autumn gentian Gentianella amarella, purple milk-vetch Astragalus danicus and thrift Armeria maritima. Steep south facing slopes above the reclaimed railway line support a more open, herbrich grassland characterised by common quaking-grass Briza media, blue moorgrass, crested hair-grass and red fescue with yarrow Achillea millefolium, hairy violet Viola hirta, hoary ragwort Senecio erucifolius, and fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea. Other uncommon plants include pale St. John’s-wort Hypericum montanum, lesser meadow-rue Thalictrum minus, and black bryony Tamus communis.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), <b>small</b> <b>scabious</b> (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
