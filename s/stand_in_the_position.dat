60|$|So much by way {{of proof}} that the method of {{establishing}} laws in science {{is exactly the same}} as that pursued in common life. Let us now turn to another matter (though really it is but another phase of the same question), and that is, the method by which, from the relations of certain phenomena, we prove that some <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of causes towards the others.|$|E
6000|$|I {{asked him}} if he had been at the chateau lately. His reply was very brief and expressive. [...] "The king denies my account of the {{programme}} of the Hôtel de Ville, and we <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of two gentlemen, who, in substance, have given each other the lie. Circumstances prevent our going to the Bois de Boulogne to exchange shots," [...] he added, smiling, [...] "but they also prevent our exchanging visits." [...] I then ventured to say that I had long foreseen what would be the result of the friendship of Louis-Philippe, and, for the first time, in the course of our conversations, I adverted to my own visit to the palace in his company, an account of which I will extract, for your benefit, from my note-book.[2] ...|$|E
60|$|How {{completely}} the analogy holds throughout, becomes yet clearer when we recognise {{the fact that}} the sciences are arts to each other. If, as occurs in almost every case, the fact to be analysed by any science, has first to be prepared--to be disentangled from disturbing facts by the afore discovered methods of other sciences; the other sciences so used, <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of arts. If, in solving a dynamical problem, a parallelogram is drawn, of which the sides and diagonal represent forces, and by putting magnitudes of extension for magnitudes of force a measurable relation is established between quantities not else to be dealt with; it may be fairly said that geometry plays towards mechanics much the same part that the fire of the founder plays towards the metal he is going to cast. If, in analysing the phenomena of the coloured rings surrounding the point of contact between two lenses, a Newton ascertains by calculation the amount of certain interposed spaces, far too minute for actual measurement; he employs the science of number for essentially the same purpose as that for which the watchmaker employs tools. If, before writing down his observation on a star, the astronomer has to separate from it all the errors resulting from atmospheric and optical laws, it is manifest that the refraction-tables, and logarithm-books, and formulæ, which he successively uses, serve him much as retorts, and filters, and cupels serve the assayer who wishes to separate the pure gold from all accompanying ingredients.|$|E

5000|$|During the off-season, Matthews {{committed}} to weight training and conditioning programs to gain size and improve his performance level and stamina. At {{the beginning of}} the 2008 season, defensive coordinator Nick Holt, Carroll, and Norton decided to try using Matthews in a hybrid [...] "Elephant" [...] position, where Matthews would <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of defensive end, but use the speed and tactics of a linebacker; the coaches had used Cushing in the position in a similar manner in 2006. [...] The experiment was successful, as Matthews recorded 4.5 sacks while playing alongside his other NFL-bound teammates Brian Cushing, Rey Maualuga and Kaluka Maiava. Furthermore, Matthews continued his spectacular special teams play and was awarded USC's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2008, making him the only player in USC history to be awarded three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards. Matthews was a participant in the 2009 Senior Bowl and was considered a top prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E

50|$|She is {{described}} as extremely beautiful, having dark thick long hair {{with the scent of}} Champaka, Asoka and Punnaga flowers. She had the musk thilaka on her forehead, eyelids which appeared {{as if they were the}} gate of the house of the God of love, and having eyes like fish playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake of her face. She had a nose with studs that shone more than the stars, ears with the sun and moon as studs, cheeks which were like the mirror of Padmaraga, beautiful rows of white teeth, and she was chewing Thamboola with camphor. She had a voice sweeter than the sound emanating from Veena of Sarswathi, and having such a beautiful smile that Shiva himself could not take his eyes off her. She was wearing Mangala soothra and necklaces, with beautiful breasts which were capable of buying the invaluable love of Kameswara, having wisps of beautiful hair raising from her belly, her stomach having three pretty folds, and she was wearing red silk tied with a string with red bells. She had thighs which steal the heart of Kameshwara, knees which looked like crowns made of precious gems, voluptuous legs, upper parts of the feet resembling the backs of tortoises, feet which resembled lamps made of gems which could dispel worries from the mind of devotees and a body with a golden red color. She was given in marriage to Kameshwara by Trimurtis as priests of the wedding, Varhai and Kurukulla <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of her father and mother, Vishnu <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of her brother and made to stay <b>in</b> Nagara at <b>the</b> top of Maha Meru Mountain.

But this was not the most noteworthy feature: they were all grouped {{in such a way that}} their tails, without a single exception, were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened. There was an inner circle closely huddled, and outside these they radiated wider apart, the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar, to which the clump of furze-bushes <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> of a wearer's neck.|$|R
