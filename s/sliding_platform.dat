40|$|SummarySSB {{proteins}} bind to {{and control}} the accessibility of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), likely facilitated by their ability to diffuse on ssDNA. Using a hybrid single-molecule method combining fluorescence and force, we probed how proteins with large binding site sizes can migrate rapidly on DNA and how protein-protein interactions and tension may modulate the motion. We observed force-induced progressive unraveling of ssDNA from the SSB surface between 1 and 6 pN, followed by SSB dissociation at ∼ 10 pN, and obtained experimental evidence of a reptation mechanism for protein movement along DNA wherein a protein slides via DNA bulge formation and propagation. SSB diffusion persists even when bound with RecO and at forces under which the fully wrapped state is perturbed, suggesting that even in crowded cellular conditions SSB {{can act as a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>platform</b> to recruit and carry its interacting proteins for use in DNA replication, recombination and repair.

40|$|For many {{applications}} such as tele-operational robots and interactions with virtual environments, {{it is better to}} have performance with force feedback than without. Haptic devices are force reflecting interfaces. They can also track human hand positions simultaneously. A new 6 DOF (degree-of-freedom) haptic device was designed and calibrated in this study. It mainly contains a double parallel linkage, a rhombus linkage, a rotating mechanical structure and a grasping interface. Benefited from the unique design, it is a hybrid structure device with a large workspace and high output capability. Therefore, it is capable of multi-finger interactions. Moreover, with an adjustable base, operators can change different postures without interrupting haptic tasks. To investigate the performance regarding position tracking accuracy and static output forces, we conducted experiments on a three-dimensional electric <b>sliding</b> <b>platform</b> and a digital force gauge, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Courting male fiddler crabs Uca terpsichores (1 cm {{carapace}} width) sometimes build {{mounds of}} sand called hoods at the entrances to their burrows. Males wave their single enlarged claws to attract females to their burrows for mating. It was shown previously that burrows with hoods are {{more attractive to}} females and that females visually orient to these structures. In this study, we test whether males also use their hoods to find their burrows. We first determined the maximum distance that males can see and find a burrow opening without a hood. Males were removed from their burrows and placed on the sand at a range of distances from a burrow opening. If they were more than about 8 cm (seven units of eye-height) away, they were unable find the burrow. In contrast, males that were burrow residents used a non-visual path map {{to return to their}} burrows from much greater distances. To determine if hoods help males find their burrows when there are errors in their path maps, we moved residents 1 – 49 cm on <b>sliding</b> <b>platforms</b> producing errors equal to the distances they were moved. Males with self-made hoods or hood models at their burrows relocated their burrows at significantly greater distances than did males with unadorned burrows. Hood builders also relocated their burrows faster. Hence, hoods have two functions: they attract females and they provide a visual cue that males use to find their burrows quickly and reliably when their path maps fail...|$|R

40|$|DNA damage causes {{replication}} forks to stall, {{which can}} {{ultimately lead to}} double strand breaks, chromosomal rearrangements, and cell death. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is a clamp protein which encircles DNA and acts as a <b>sliding</b> <b>platform</b> for proteins that will act on the DNA, including polymerases. Replication fork stalling causes PCNA to be mono-ubiquitylated, resulting in a polymerase switch from the classical polymerases that perform replication to the Y-family polymerases which conduct translesion synthesis (TLS) to bypass the DNA damage and allow replication to continue. Y-family polymerases include DNA polymerases eta, kappa, iota, and Rev 1. The mechanism by which these polymerases are assembled into multi-protein complexes which include PCNA has previously not been well-understood. The studies outlined below demonstrate that ternary complexes involving PCNA, Rev 1, and pol η can adopt multiple conformations which can rapidly interconvert. Additionally, I have demonstrated that ubiquitin stimulates the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase eta through a novel interaction with the catalytic core. These studies represent significant progress towards understand the regulation of TLS polymerase activity through both recruitment to and activation by ubiquitylated PCNA...|$|E

40|$|Plant defence {{responses}} are mediated by key regulatory proteins that affect expression {{of thousands of}} genes. Over the last decade, microarrays have {{played a pivotal role}} to elucidate the underlying networks of gene regulation that lead {{to a wide variety of}} defence responses. Undoubtedly, they provided a valuable tool to quantify and profile the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously, with two main aims: (1) gene discovery and (2) global expression profiling. The usefulness of this reverse genetics approach has been demonstrated by numerous discoveries of key regulatory genes important for defence signalling as well as valuable end-point genes whose products display direct action against pests and diseases. Several microarray technologies are currently in use; most include a glass <b>slide</b> <b>platform</b> with spotted cDNA or oligonucleotides, some of which are synthesized directly on the underlying substrate. The frequent use of microarrays has enabled the creation of powerful microarray databases that allow researchers a rapid retrieval of gene expression profiles from various treatments and tissues. While physiological pathways are in parts positively or negatively linked, the discovery of a regulatory defence signalling network by microarrays has demonstrated that ultimately genes and their products, and not pathways are controlled by regulation. Future research should focus on simultaneous time-course analyses of host cells and pathogens to fully understand the biology of disease progression. In addition, most research on plant defence responses has focused on single pathogens, pests and/or signalling compounds. However, plants in nature grow under the influence of multiple environmental stresses while interacting immensely with other organisms. Recent studies of plant-microbe interactions have revealed transcriptional responses of plants to multiple organisms. New technology has enabled a metatranscriptomics approach that will allow the analysis of plants interacting with entire microbial communities, such as those present in the rhizosphere...|$|R

The effort described here, however, should exceed this limit {{to be able}} to test the necessity of extremely high resolution in radar images. The range resolution of radar is determined by its instantaneous bandwidth. At higher millimetre wave bands even moderate relative bandwidths are equivalent to high absolute bandwidths. For the development of related processing algorithms, an experimental, polarimetric radar operating at 10 GHz, 35 GHz, 94 GHz and 220 GHz has been developed using a FM/CW waveform with a bandwidth of 4000 MHz (8000 MHz at 220 GHz) resulting in a resolution better than 4 cm (2 cm at 220 GHz).

A single point mutation, Ser 228 Ile, in the human PCNA gene was recently identified to cause a disease whose symptoms resemble those of DNA damage and repair disorders. The mutation lies near the binding site for most PCNA-interacting proteins. However, the structural consequences of the S 228 I mutation are unknown. Here, we describe the structure of the disease-causing variant, which reveals a large conformational change that dramatically transforms the binding pocket for PCNA client proteins. We show that the mutation markedly alters the binding energetics for some client proteins, while another, p 21 (CIP 1), is only mildly affected. Structures of the disease variant bound to peptides derived from two PCNA partner proteins reveal that the binding pocket can adjust conformation to accommodate some ligands, indicating that the binding site is dynamic and pliable. Our work has implications for the plasticity of the binding site in PCNA and reveals how a disease mutation selectively alters interactions to a promiscuous binding site that is critical for DNA metabolism...|$|E
