5000|$|Aida is {{best remembered}} for {{the theory that}} the 'rationality' of Western civilization was {{consequential}} upon the practice of raising and killing livestock. This hypothesis, called the [...] "livestock rearing theory" [...] (kachiku shiikusetsu), was set forth in his 1966 book Rationalism (G≈çrishugi). He associated the <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>animals,</b> which had been hitherto reared with great care, with the nonchalant belligerence of Western soldiers. In his view, Westerners are free from the kind of hysteria Japanese soldiers would often show at the sight of bloodshed. Aida blamed this very hysteria for the excessive acts of cruelty that the Japanese were accused of during the Second World War. Westerners, on the other hand, have so long been accustomed to calmly butchering animals that they developed a rational approach to slaughter, which they extended to human conflict. The Japanese hardly had any contact with livestock owing to the Buddhist taboo of eating meat and were too emotive to master the Western sort of nonchalance.|$|R
5000|$|The Creek Nation {{split into}} factions during the War of 1812. One group of Creek nativists, the Red Sticks, argued against any more {{accommodation}} {{of the white}} settlers while the other Creeks favored adopting the white lifestyle. The Red Stick faction from the Upper Towns opposed both land cessions to settlers and the Lower Towns' assimilation into European-American culture. The nativists were soon called [...] "Red Sticks" [...] because they had raised the [...] "red stick of war," [...] a favored weapon and symbolic Creek war declaration. Civil war among the Creeks erupted {{in the summer of}} 1813 and the Red Sticks attacked accommodationist headmen and, in the Upper Towns, began a systematic <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>animals,</b> most <b>of</b> which belonged to men who had gained power by adopting aspects of European culture. Not understanding internal issues among the Creek, frontier whites were alarmed about rising tensions and began 'forting up' and moving into various posts and blockhouses such as Fort Mims while reinforcements were sent to the frontier.|$|R

40|$|Brucellosis, a {{bacterial}} zoonosis, {{is a disease}} caused {{by members of the}} genus Brucella. In Indonesia, brucellosis has known as a contagious reproductive disease in animals, however, only certain people know that brucellosis can be transmitted to human. Bovine brucellosis is characterised by {{one or more of the}} following signs : abortion, retained placenta. orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. The Brucella organism is transmitted to human most commonly by ingestion of untreated milk or milk products or through the mucous membranes and wound of the skin. The severity of human disease varies, depending largely upon the infecting strain. Brucella abortus, B. melitensis. B. suis and B. canis are highly pathogenic for humans. Clinical symptoms of human brucellosis may include an intermittent fever, headaches, weakness, arthalgia, myalgia and weight loss. Occasional complications include arthritis, endocarditis, hepatitis granuloma, meningitis, orchitis dan osteomyelitis have also been reported. Brucellosis can also produce spontaneous abortion in pregnant woman. Diagnosis is based on the isolation of the organism and serology. Antibiotics are usually the mainstay of treatment and long-term treatment may be required. Brucellosis can be controlled by comprehensive campaigns to eradicate the disease by vaccination programme followed by test and <b>slaughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>animals</b> which exhibit positive serologic reactions to brucellae. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} bachelor's thesis was {{to study}} and {{describe}} operations and principles <b>of</b> <b>slaughtering</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>animals.</b> Starting with transporting the animals to the slaughterhouse, describing all the required actions including the final treatment of the carcass. Thesis deals with differences in various technologies and ways <b>of</b> processing diverse <b>domestic</b> <b>animal</b> species [...] both locally significant and rare and atypical for the Czech Republic. Work then describes legislative requirements related to various operations on the slaughtering line and at home slaughters. In second part it solves the problematics of stunning, analysing it based on price and severity {{of each of the}} stunning methods. It also deals with how those differences may affect quality of the initial material. Finally, new trends appearing locally and globally and ways those can improve meat quatity are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} the stable carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotope analyses of humans from two Middle Bronze Age cemeteries at Asine, Greece: Barbouna (n= 6) and the East Cemetery (n= 13). In general, the dietary pattern of adults and juveniles shows a heavy reliance on mainly terrestrial foods; C 3 plants and a varying amount of animal protein (meat, milk or dairy products). The high nitrogen values of some individuals from the East cemetery indicate a substantial consumption of animal protein, although the carbon values show that no detectable amounts of marine foods, or C 4 plants such as millet had been consumed. High nitrogen values as well as the high <b>slaughter</b> age <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>animals,</b> as found in previous studies point towards a significant utilization of milk and dairy products at Asine. A low increase of nitrogen values in subadults younger than one years of age from Barbouna compared to females at the East cemetery indicates that these children may have been fed breast milk as well as supplementary foods. Therefore, despite the poor preservation and uneven sample size, the Asine isotopic data give us information on diet during the MH period, as well as variation between the members of the community...|$|R
