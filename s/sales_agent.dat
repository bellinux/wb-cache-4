5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's <b>sales</b> <b>agent,</b> Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive <b>sales</b> <b>agent.</b> Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of the C-130As took almost a decade, {{with the process}} being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the <b>sales</b> <b>agent</b> for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before {{it was to have}} been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The paper discuses {{the main}} {{problems}} which appear when traditional business, based in <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> moves to new e-commerce models. Customers, {{used to describe}} to <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> their needs using natural language, are suffering {{from the lack of}} expressiveness using product query forms, which are too rigid. Replacing <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> for automatic systems implies a loss of flexibility interpreting the customer query, narrowing the result set, which could imply a loss of business opportunities. The paper proposes solutions to these problems, using fuzzy logic to model customer requirements, process queries flexibly and ranking results...|$|R

Empirical evidence indicates that a few <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> achieved a dominant position in the European distribution network. Success in promoting the diffusion of U.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{literature}} on management control {{in the context of}} front-line service work, including sales work. Given the nature of front-line work, service recipients – customers and clients – {{play an important role in}} management control and in the social relations in the workplace. Moreover, the triangle relationship has become a research focus for decades. However, most of the research has been done in western countries. In addition, little attention has been paid to sales work mixed with service elements. Furthermore, the complexity of the triangle relationship between three parties has not been sufficiently evaluated. This thesis investigates management control in a Chinese life insurance company and the effects of management on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship between management, <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients. In order to address the research target, this study employs a qualitative approach and chooses a single-case study research design. The qualitative data has been collected from a documentary analysis, observations and semi-structured interviews. The empirical findings suggest that: a. 	The management controls in the studied case can be categorised into two main types: formally coercive control that consists of output control, bureaucratic control, direct control and attendant control; and informally normative control that consists of concertive control in the sales teams and normative control in morning meetings. b. 	The controls for contradictory logic that interact with one another to have an impact on individual <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and the triangle relationship. c. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a greater family responsibility and the capability of meeting sales targets set by the company are more motivated by financial incentives, identified with organisational and occupational value and self-disciplined. d. 	<b>Sales</b> <b>agents</b> who have a poor performance and lack the capability to improve their performance are more likely to resist management control. e. 	The relationship between management and the <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> is not always conflictual. f. 	Co-worker assistance and informal coping are found in the relationships among <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> although their <b>sales</b> work is highly individualised and competitive. g. 	The relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients is instrumental in its nature, but when there is an ongoing relationship and a high level of trust between <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> and clients, this relationship appears to be less instrumental. h. 	Improving the quality of service and enhancing the myth of customer sovereignty may sacrifice efficiency in the short term, but it can potentially increase sales efficiency in the long run. ...|$|R

This is the case of long distance telephone service, where there is a fixed monthly fee and a charge per call.

In this environment, markets have reacted by hiring <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> to switch consumers from one firm to another. Without considering <b>sales</b> <b>agents,</b> social welfare is the same under a two-part tariff regime as under single pricing, but the distribution of surplus is different. When <b>sales</b> <b>agents</b> are introduced to the model, they are able to reduce switching costs, and welfare might increase; but they generate over-switching with respect to the social optimum. ...|$|R
