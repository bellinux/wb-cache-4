2500|$|Glow-transfer {{counting}} tubes, {{similar in}} essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge {{on one of}} a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of [...] "guide" [...] cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the United Kingdom was Dekatron. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named <b>Selectron</b> tubes.|$|E

The Williams tube would prove more capacious than the <b>Selectron</b> tube (the <b>Selectron</b> was limited to 256 bits, while the Williams tube could store thousands) and less expensive. The Williams tube would nevertheless prove to be frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances.|$|E

RCA responded with the <b>Selectron</b> with a capacity of 4096 bits, with a planned production of 200 by the end of the year.

40|$|We {{review the}} pair-production and decay of <b>selectrons</b> in e − e − {{collisions}} and {{show how the}} standard model backgrounds can be virtually eliminated with polarized beams. The exceedingly simple analysis involved and the large sample of background-free supersymmetric events make this linear collider operating mode ideal for discovering <b>selectrons</b> and measuring {{the mass of the}} lightest neutralino. In spite of their economy of principles, supersymmetric extensions of the standard model [1] involve an opulent number of free parameters. Although the strengths of the interactions must be precisely the same as those of the standard model, at this stage the masses and mixings of the supersymmetric partners of the conventional particles cannot be predicted from first principles. To see clear through this jungle of parameters it is important to perform as many independent experiments as possible. A particularly promising candidate is the pairproduction of <b>selectrons</b> in e − e − collisions e − e − → ˜e − ˜e −. (1...|$|R

This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.|$|R
