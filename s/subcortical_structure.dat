50|$|The caudal ganglionic {{eminence}} {{is another}} <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> {{that is essential}} to the generation of cortical interneurons. It is located next to the lateral ventricle, posterior to where the LGE and MGE fuse. The CGE is a fusion of the rostral medial and lateral ganglionic eminence, which begins at the mid to caudal thalamus. There are two molecular domains that exist within the CGE and closely resemble extensions of the caudal MGE and LGE. The CGE is distinct from the LGE and MGE in gene expression patterns and progeny produced. Unlike the cells from the MGE, the cells from the CGE were rarely parvalbumin-containing neurons. It seems that the majority of cells from the CGE were GABAergic interneurons, but depending on where they are located, CGE-derived cells are very diverse. CGE-derived cells include GABAergic interneurons, spiny interneurons, mossy cells, pyramidal and granule neurons, and even oligodendrocyte and astrocyte glial cells.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAccurate {{tissue and}} {{structure}} segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans {{is critical in}} several applications. In most approaches this task is handled through two sequential steps. We propose to carry out cooperatively both tissue and <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> segmentation by distributing a set of local and cooperative Markov random field (MRF) models Tissue segmentation is performed by partitioning the volume into subvolumes where local MRFs are estimated in cooperation with their neighbors to ensure consistency. Local estimation fits precisely to the local intensity distribution and thus handles nonuniformity of intensity without any bias field modelization. Similarly, <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> segmentation is performed via local MRF models that integrate localization constraints provided by a priori fuzzy description of brain anatomy. <b>Subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> segmentation is not reduced to a subsequent processing step but joined with tissue segmentation: the two procedures cooperate to gradually and conjointly improve model accuracy. We propose a framework to implement this distributed modeling integrating cooperation, coordination, and local model checking in an efficient way. Its evaluation was performed using both phantoms and real 3 T brain scans, showing good results and in particular robustness to nonuniformity and noise with a low computational cost. This original combination of local MRF models, including anatomical knowledge, appears as a powerful and promising approach for MR brain scan segmentation...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to localize the effects of previously identified risk variants in the myelin associated glycoprotein gene on brain morphometry in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. 45 schizophrenia patients and 47 matched healthy controls underwent clinical, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and genetics procedures. Gray and white matter cortical lobe volumes along with <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> volumes were calculated from T 1 -weighted MRI scans. Each subject was also genotyped for the two disease-associated MAG single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs 720308 and rs 720309). Repeated measures general linear model analysis found significant region by genotype and region by diagnosis interactions for the effects of MAG risk variants on lobar gray matter volumes. No significant associations were found with lobar white matter volumes or <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> volumes. Follow-up univariate general linear models found the AA genotype of rs 720308 predisposed schizophrenia patients to left temporal and parietal gray matter volume deficits. These results suggest that the effects of the MAG gene on cortical gray matter volume in schizophrenia patients can be localized to temporal and parietal cortices. Our results support a role for MAG gene variation in brain morphometry in schizophrenia, align with other lines of evidence implicating MAG in schizophrenia, and provide genetically-based insight into the heterogeneity of brain imaging findings in this disorder...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that the volume of several <b>subcortical</b> <b>structures</b> decreases in relation to age. Different metrics of cortical structure (e. g., volume, thickness, surface area, and gyrification) {{have been shown to}} index distinct characteristics of interindividual differences; thus, {{it is important to consider}} the relation of age to multiple structural measures. Here, we compare age-related differences in subcortical and ventricular volume to those differences revealed with a measure of structural complexity, quantified as fractal dimensionality. Across 3 large data sets, totaling nearly 900 individuals across the adult lifespan (aged 18 – 94 years), we found greater age-related differences in complexity than volume for the <b>subcortical</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly in the caudate and thalamus. The structural complexity of ventricular structures was not more strongly related to age than volume.

40|$|Previously it {{has been}} shown that the {{hippocampus}} and neocortex can spontaneously reactivate ensemble activity patterns during post-behavioral sleep and rest periods. Here we examined whether such reactivation also occurs in a <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure,</b> the ventral striatum, which receives a direct input from the hippocampal formation and has been implicated in guidance of consummatory and conditioned behaviors. During a reward-searching task on a T-maze, flanked by sleep and rest periods, parallel recordings were made from ventral striatal ensembles while EEG signals were derived from the hippocampus. Statistical measures indicated a significant amount of reactivation in the ventral striatum. In line with hippocampal data, reactivation was especially prominent during postbehavioral slow-wave sleep, but unlike the hippocampus, no decay in pattern recurrence was visible in the ventral striatum across the first 40 min of post-behavioral rest. We next studied the relationship between ensemble firing patterns in ventral striatum and hippocampal ripples?sharp waves, which have been implicated in pattern replay. Firing rates were significantly modulated in close temporal association with hippocampal ripples in 25 % of the units, showing a marked transient enhancement in the average response profile. Strikingly, ripple-modulated neurons in ventral striatum showed a clear reactivation, whereas nonmodulated cells did not. These data suggest, first, the occurrence of pattern replay in a <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> implied in the processing and prediction of reward and, second, a functional linkage between ventral striatal reactivation and a specific type of high-frequency population activity associated with hippocampal replay.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a local likelihood-based active contour model for <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> segmentation. As a {{generalization}} of the Chan-Vese piecewise-constant model, our solution uses Bayesian a posterior probabilities as the driving forces for curve evolution. Distribution prior for {{the structure of}} interest, e. g., caudate nucleus, can be seamlessly integrated into the level set evolution procedure, and no thresholding step is needed for capturing the target. Unlike other region-based active contour models, our solution relaxes the global piecewise-constant assumption, and uses locally varying Gaussians to better account for intensity inhomogeneity and local variations existing in many MR images. More accurate and robust segmentations are therefore achieved. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Subcortical</b> <b>structures</b> play a {{critical}} role in brain function. However, options for assessing electrophysiological activity in these structures are limited. Electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in <b>subcortical</b> <b>structures</b> can be recorded non-invasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these subcortical signals are much weaker than those due to cortical activity. In addition, we show here that it is difficult to resolve subcortical sources, because distributed cortical activity can explain the MEG and EEG patterns due to deep sources. We then demonstrate that if the cortical activity can be assumed to be spatially sparse, both cortical and subcortical sources can be resolved with M/EEG. Building on this insight, we develop a novel hierarchical sparse inverse solution for M/EEG. We assess the performance of this algorithm on realistic simulations and auditory evoked response data and show that thalamic and brainstem sources can be correctly estimated in the presence of cortical activity. Our analysis and method suggest new opportunities and offer practical tools for characterizing electrophysiological activity in the <b>subcortical</b> <b>structures</b> of the human brain.

This study evaluated the effect of handedness and sex on the volumes of selected <b>subcortical</b> <b>structures</b> and cerebellar hemispheres in normal persons. METHODS: Volumetric measurements were performed of the caudate heads, thalami, and cerebellar hemispheres in 34 (20 right- and 14 left-handed, 19 female and 15 male) normal persons. Amygdalar and hippocampal volumes were reported previously for these persons. All study participants completed a 10 -item handedness questionnaire.

MR images were spatially normalized, and volumes were painted with a 1. 0 mm 3 resolution cursor on an SGI workstation. The effects of handedness and sex on standardized volumes and right-to-left volume ratios were calculated, and volumes were compared between right and left sides for each structure.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} a small cortical infarct which is known to induce dramatic changes in gene expression in the entire cerebral cortex, on the gene expression in the striatum, a target structure of cortical neurons. Striatal glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 67) and enkephalin expressions were increased in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion. Conversely, neuropeptide Y- and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity were decreased in the ipsilateral striatum and this decrease was only related to a decrease in the labeling of processes with no changes in the number of labeled neurons. A minimal cortical lesion may therefore induce changes in gene expression in a <b>subcortical</b> <b>structure</b> through hyperactivity of glutamatergic synaptic inputs.
