5|$|In plants, some {{barriers}} to hybridization include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic <b>sterility,</b> cytoplasmic-genic male <b>sterility</b> and structural differences of the chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from <b>sterility</b> in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of <b>sterility</b> in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause <b>sterility</b> in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
5|$|Species are reproductively {{isolated}} {{by strong}} barriers to hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic <b>sterility,</b> cytoplasmic-genic male <b>sterility</b> {{and the structure}} of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E
5|$|Product safety testing : <b>Sterility</b> (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo {{testing for}} {{adventitious}} viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.|$|E
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional <b>sterility</b> of otherwise fertile workers.|$|E
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete <b>sterility</b> is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sterility</b> in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. <b>Sterility</b> of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch is an {{economically}} important {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific, and several studies indicate {{that it may be}} suffering population declines due to overfishing and overexploitation. Malacologists and ecologists have recommended a reduction in its exploitation rate; initiatives in Thailand are attempting to ensure the possibility of reproduction in young-adult individuals and manage the natural populations in general. L.canarium demonstrates the imposex phenomenon, but is resistant to <b>sterility</b> caused by it; therefore, {{it has been suggested that}} this species might be useful as a bioindicator for organotin pollution monitoring near Malaysian ports.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. <b>Sterility</b> is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, arid zone {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by <b>sterility</b> barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and <b>sterility.</b> The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce <b>sterility.</b> The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Light wind {{transports}} CO2 to {{the leaf}} canopy but strong wind causes severe damage and {{may lead to}} <b>sterility</b> (due to pollen dehydration, spikelet <b>sterility,</b> and abortive endosperms).|$|E
25|$|Mapping {{genes that}} cause partial to {{complete}} <b>sterility</b> in many interspecific hybrids. As many as 35 such genes have been mapped in Oryza, and <b>sterility</b> {{is a big}} problem in the perennial rice program.|$|E
25|$|Aseptic {{technique}} is {{the act of}} maintaining <b>sterility</b> during procedures.|$|E
25|$|A {{laboratory}} vacuum places controlled {{stress on}} a sealed package {{to test the}} strength of seals, the tendency for leakage, {{and the ability to}} retain <b>sterility.</b>|$|E
25|$|For high-risk {{applications}} such as medical devices and injections, a <b>sterility</b> assurance level of at least 10−6 is required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).|$|E
25|$|Preparation of {{injectable}} {{medications and}} intravenous solutions for fluid replacement therapy requires not only <b>sterility</b> but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of adventitious agents after initial product sterilization.|$|E
25|$|Penetrating {{injuries}} to the scrotum may cause castration, or physical separation or {{destruction of the}} testes, possibly along with part {{or all of the}} penis, which results in total <b>sterility</b> if the testicles are not reattached quickly.|$|E
25|$|Packaging {{for medical}} materials, medical devices, health care supplies, etc., have special user {{requirements}} and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, <b>sterility</b> and strength {{need to be}} controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production.|$|E
25|$|However, when overthrown the Pythia curses {{the people}} with <b>sterility</b> before casting herself into an abyss. The curse results in the still birth that night of every unborn child on Gallifrey, {{including}} Rassilon's own son. Persecuted, her priestesses and acolytes flee to a nearby planet where they become the Sisterhood of Karn.|$|E
25|$|The {{induction}} of polyploidy is {{a common}} technique to overcome the <b>sterility</b> of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, Triticale is the hybrid of wheat (Triticum turgidum) and rye (Secale cereale). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale.|$|E
25|$|In August 2003, rumors {{spread in}} some states in Nigeria, {{especially}} Kano, that the vaccine caused <b>sterility</b> in girls. This resulted in the suspension of immunization efforts in the state, causing a dramatic rise in polio rates in the already endemic country. On 30 June 2004, the WHO announced that after a 10-month ban on polio vaccinations, Kano had pledged to restart the campaign in early July. During the ban the virus spread across Nigeria and into 12 neighboring countries {{that had previously been}} polio-free. By 2006, this ban would be blamed for 1,500 children being paralyzed and had cost $450 million for emergency activities. In addition to the rumors of <b>sterility</b> and the ban by Nigeria's Kano state, civil war and internal strife in the Sudan and Côte d'Ivoire have complicated WHO's polio eradication goal. In 2004, almost two-thirds of all the polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria (760 out of 1,170 total).|$|E
25|$|A {{precondition}} for further commercialization of GM forest trees {{is likely to}} be their complete <b>sterility.</b> Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of transgene escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is their potential for wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce {{for a long time before}} being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special environmental considerations over GM crops. Ensuring <b>sterility</b> for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, the {{likelihood}} of survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a <b>sterility</b> assurance level (SAL) equal to {{the probability of a}} non-sterile unit.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s, {{statistical}} methods {{were developed to}} analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933, another important breeding technique, cytoplasmic male <b>sterility</b> (CMS), developed in maize, was described by Marcus Morton Rhoades. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen. This enables the production of hybrids {{without the need for}} labour-intensive detasseling.|$|E
25|$|Orr is an {{evolutionary}} geneticist whose {{research focuses on}} the genetics of speciation and the genetics of adaptation, in particular on the genetic basis of hybrid <b>sterility</b> and inviability. How many genes cause reproductive isolation between species? What are the normal functions of these genes and what evolutionary forces drove their divergence? He studies these problems through genetic analysis of reproductive isolation between species of Drosophila.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the system}} uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the {{fermentation}} requires no <b>sterility</b> or aseptic conditions, making this front {{step in the}} process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in {{the front end of the}} process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} islanders, {{including}} Hawaiians, people of Tikopia in the Solomon Islands, and on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, {{believe that the}} sins of the father will fall upon the children. If a child is sick, the parents are suspected of quarreling or misconduct. In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause <b>sterility</b> of land or other disasters. Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology.|$|E
25|$|In context, {{immediate}} symptoms {{become apparent}} if exposed to above 250mSv per day. Symptoms include nausea {{and loss of}} appetite as well as damage to bone marrow, lymph nodes and the spleen. Generally, these symptoms become more severe and noticeable in the 1000 to 3000mSv bracket with recovery probable, but not assured. New and more serious symptoms appear above 3000mSv such as peeling of the skin, hemorrhaging and <b>sterility</b> with death if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{numerous}} international medical organizations {{launched a}} campaign to eradicate polio globally, as had been successfully done for smallpox. By 2003, polio had been eradicated in {{all but a few}} countries, among them Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan However, mullahs in northern Nigeria began to oppose the vaccination program, claiming that it was a plot to spread AIDS and <b>sterility,</b> and prevented any vaccination. Polio cases in Nigeria tripled over the next three years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken {{an interest in the}} afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to <b>sterility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Social living {{provides}} {{a multitude of}} advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes <b>sterility</b> or near-sterility of {{the overwhelming majority of}} colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids).|$|E
25|$|The IRRI {{project was}} {{terminated}} in 2001 because of budget cuts, but the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS) in Kunming has continued the research. Rhizome were considered more stress tolerant than stolons, so {{they focused on}} populations derived from crosses with O. longistaminata. As Eric Sacks and colleagues found at IRRI, the plants in these populations mostly lack rhizomes and have {{a high level of}} <b>sterility.</b> Finding the extremely rare plants with both rhizomes and fertility has required screening large F2 and Backcross populations.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Dannie Richmond the quartet {{fulfilled}} their remaining contracted engagements with drummer Lewis Nash and then disbanded in mid-1988. Their music, usually original compositions by Pullen, Adams and Richmond, had ranged from blues, through ballads, to post-bop and avant-garde. The ability of the players to encompass all these areas, often within one composition, removed any sameness or <b>sterility</b> from the quartet format. Except for the early recordings on the vanished Horo label, their European recordings on Soulnote and Timeless remained frequently available, unlike those made for Blue Note.|$|E
