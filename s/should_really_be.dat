25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the {{fundamental}} problem of form and content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E
25|$|Some questionnaires, {{such as the}} Religious Orientation Scale, {{relate to}} {{different}} religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion {{for the purpose of}} psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> seen as multidimensional.|$|E

500|$|The critic Eduard Hanslick {{objected to}} the {{religious}} air surrounding Parsifal even at the premiere: [...] "The question of whether Parsifal <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> withheld from all theatres and limited to... Bayreuth was naturally on all tongues... I must state here that the church scenes in Parsifal {{did not make the}} offensive impression on me that others and I had been led to expect from reading the libretto. They are religious situations – but for all their earnest dignity they are not {{in the style of the}} church, but completely in the style of the opera. Parsifal is an opera, call it a 'stage festival' or 'consecrational stage festival' if you will." ...|$|E
500|$|... "While it's easy to {{complain}} about a stretch of so-so movies," [...] wrote Matt Patches at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, [...] "the twist is we <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> thanking the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." [...] For most viewers, it {{is a chance to}} catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like Kill List to wider audiences via home-media releases.|$|E
500|$|Marco {{was later}} {{killed in a}} bush fire disaster. Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes for the bush fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done it at her grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just {{to get to this}} point. This <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> a happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person. Blair said it saw her become well-equipped to look after her child.|$|E

500|$|David Blackwell of Enterline Media {{thought that}} Sanctuary was an [...] "interesting concept", but felt {{the first six}} episodes were [...] "hit-or-miss". Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it really works and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does {{take a while to}} kick in, but it is a very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E
2500|$|The paint colour {{used most}} widely today {{is known as}} [...] "currant red" [...] and is defined by a British Standard, BS381C-Red539. This {{slightly}} brighter red was introduced with the K8 model in 1968, but went on to be used across the estate on previous models too. Hence, for complete historical accuracy, any kiosks in pre-1968 settings <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> painted in the previous, and slightly darker, shade BS381C-Red538.|$|E
2500|$|People tend {{to believe}} as {{dictated}} by their own emotions, projections, and transferences. ... Our judgment <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> guided by what the protagonists never tired of asserting themselves: {{that there was no}} sex. In the final analysis the question is whether we believe their testimony or not. I choose to believe them, and not out of prudery, but because in those days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to Spielrein, differently than we do today; moreover, because unconsummated sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular press and professional journals.|$|E

2500|$|As {{pointed out}} by Higgins , the {{sampling}} theorem <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> considered in two parts, as done above: the first stating {{the fact that a}} bandlimited function is completely determined by its samples, the second describing how to reconstruct the function using its samples. Both parts of the sampling theorem were given in a somewhat different form by J. M. Whittaker [...] and before him also by Ogura [...] They were probably not {{aware of the fact that}} the first part of the theorem had been stated as early as 1897 by Borel [...]27 As we have seen, Borel also used around that time what became known as the cardinal series. However, he appears not to have made the link [...] In later years it became known that the sampling theorem had been presented before Shannon to the Russian communication community by Kotel'nikov [...] In more implicit, verbal form, it had also been described in the German literature by Raabe [...] Several authors [...] have mentioned that Someya [...] introduced the theorem in the Japanese literature parallel to Shannon. In the English literature, Weston [...] introduced it independently of Shannon around the same time.28 ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights <b>should</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend." ...|$|E
