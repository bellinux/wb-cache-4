PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four patients with liver tumours > 1  cm prospectively underwent MR elastography using 50 -Hz mechanical waves and a full three-directional motion-sensitive sequence. The model-free viscoelastic parameters (the complex shear modulus and its real and imaginary parts, i. e. the storage and loss moduli) were calculated in 72 lesions after exclusion of cystic, treated or histopathologically undetermined tumours. RESULTS: We observed higher absolute shear modulus and loss modulus in malignant versus benign tumours (3. 38 [*]±[*] 0. 26 versus 2. 41 [*]±[*] 0. 15 kPa, P[*]<[*] 0. 01 and 2. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 26 versus 1. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 13 kPa, P[*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively). Moreover, the loss modulus of hepatocellular carcinomas was significantly higher than in benign hepatocellular tumours.

The material’s loss modulus contribution to the structure’s overall controllability is assumed to be negligible.

This study determines key mechanical properties of rotator cuff repair patches, including establishing values for toughness and measuring the shear properties of repair patches and human rotator cuff tendons. We hypothesized that different repair grafts would (1) have varying material parameters, and (2) not all have mechanical properties similar to human rotator cuff tendons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight specimens each from the Restore, GraftJacket, Zimmer Collagen Repair, and SportsMesh repair patches were tested to failure in tension and for suture pullout. We assessed ultimate tensile strength, tensile (Young's) modulus, and failure strain. This study also established toughness values and <b>shear</b> data. <b>Storage</b> <b>modulus</b> was calculated using dynamic shear analysis for the patches and 18 samples of normal rotator cuff tendon.
