40|$|Abstract. Oil tubing {{works as}} a special {{pipeline}} in oil well has the characteristic of high work efficiency and under high loading. Oil tubing failure which commonly happens {{during the course of}} oilfield development and production can bring severe economic loss because of the failure accidents caused by the eccentric friction <b>of</b> rods and <b>tubing</b> account for a great percentage. It has a great of significance to study on the fatigue fracture situation and the critical eccentric friction depth <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> with defects. Oil <b>tubings</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material with the specification of Ф 73 * 5. 51 commonly used in oilfields were chosen to be the source of semi-ellipse surface crack tensile specimens. Residual life <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> with different eccentric friction percentages was studied through tensile tests. The critical eccentric friction percentage under which the residual life <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> can meet pump detection period was determined, which provides reference for making a reasonable failure standard <b>of</b> <b>tubing.</b> From the tensile test results <b>of</b> the oil <b>tubings</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material simulating the condition that the eccentric friction depth accounts for 30 % ~ 50 % of the wall thickness, the critical friction depth <b>of</b> oil <b>tubing</b> <b>of</b> J 55 material is 43. 0 % of the wall thickness. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} pressure strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values. So, for the sake of improving strength design <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit pressure <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing under {{internal pressure}} by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the burst strength <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing’s burst strength has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the new burst strength model is much closer to the real burst values than that of other models. The research results provide an important reference to optimize the tubing and casing design of deep and ultra-deep wells...|$|R

In-line detection is described in general monographs in the Ph. Eur. 2.2. 66 (European Pharmacopeia 9.0 2017 a). Briefly, a sample containing a radiopharmaceutical is diluted (if necessary) and injected onto a chromatography system with specified volume, conditions and column as written in accordant standard operating procedure (SOP). Important QC parameters for in-line detection on LC are limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) and detector linearity (Guide for the elaboration of monographs on radiopharmaceutical preparations 2018).

40|$|Abstract. Oil well tubing {{is used in}} oil {{extraction}} in offshore oil well. Under the force of tubular columns, erosion and pressure of drilling fluids, the oil well tubing usually fails in long-term service, which always leads to accidents and stagnation of production. So it’s especially necessary to detect faults in tubing. Intense-magnetic memory testing equipment for reusable offshore oil well tubing is developed for this consideration. The equipment is composed of feeding machines, baiting machines, transport machines and a detection machine. Measurement and control system decides the running sequence logic of these components and obtains fault signals <b>of</b> <b>tubing.</b> The avoidance <b>of</b> transport machines for oil well tubing coupling makes the transport <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> stable. The synchronization control of transport and detection <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> decides the accurate location of faults. The automatic switch of both detection units and measurement of fault signals makes it convenient to detect oil well <b>tubing</b> <b>of</b> multiple sizes...|$|R
