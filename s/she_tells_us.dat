As she puts it, “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E

[...] Chuck Campbell of Daily News viewed the song as [...] "gurgling" [...] and noted that Simpson was singing it breathlessly. An editor of The Advocate remarked that the track sounded more manufactured than composed. Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News wrote that he felt [...] "Irresistible" [...] was a [...] "limp seduction tune". Similarly, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the single could have been easily reprocessed for a [...] "new virginity ad campaign." [...] The Northern Echos Hayley Gyllenspetz dismissed the song, elaborating that it sounded similar to the works of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. She added, [...] "If only this 21-year-old songbird had done something original she may indeed have been irresistible." [...] An editor of The Malay Mail echoed Gyllenspetz's comment, writing that the track sounded like a typical Aguilera pop-Latino piece. [...] In 2003, [...] "Irresistible" [...] won a Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) [...] "Pop Music Award".|$|E
500|$|Caroline Bansal from musicOMH gave a mixed {{review for}} the song, {{feeling that the}} singer's vocals over the Spanish guitar was monotonous. She felt that the chorus was more melodic {{but it was the}} lyrics and the dance beats which did not {{complete}} the track. Bansal said that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] could have been composed better. Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine wrote that [...] "Love Profusion", along with the song [...] "Intervention", [...] "address Madonna's marriage to director Guy Ritchie", and [...] "find the once-cynical pop star surprisingly open and emotional, which prompts her to spit out cliché after cliché as <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> how happy she is". Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was the most straight forward dance track on the album. He added that [...] "this is one of those [...] which could become a favorite and it feels like a classic upbeat Madonna song. It fuses the message behind the song American Life with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well". Sean O'Brien from The People complimented the song for its [...] "great melody and acoustic guitar flavor to it", and deduced {{that it would be a}} hit in the night clubs. Dan Gennoe from Dotmusic website gave a positive review of the track, calling [...] "Love Profusion", along with [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process" [...] from American Life, [...] "gracious" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] songs. In 2012, website AfterElton.com listed [...] "Love Profusion" [...] at number91 on their list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs".|$|E

6000|$|Would he or <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us?</b> Or {{would the}} fashionable novelist reply as I once overheard a harassed mother retort upon {{one of her}} inquiring children.

6000|$|At this time, Herschel {{was engaged}} in playing the {{harpsichord}} in the orchestra of the theatre; and {{it was during the}} interval between the acts that he made his first general survey of the heavens. The moment his part was finished, he would rush out to gaze through his telescope; and in these short periods he managed to observe all the visible stars of what are called the first, second, third, and fourth magnitudes. Henceforth he went on building telescope after telescope, each one better than the last; and now all his glasses were ground and polished either by his own hand or by his brother Alexander's. Carolina meanwhile took her part in the workshop; but as she had also to sing at the oratorios, and her awkward German manners might shock the sensitive nerves of the Bath aristocrats, she took two lessons a week for a whole twelvemonth (<b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> in her delightfully straightforward fashion) [...] "from Miss Fleming, the celebrated dancing mistress, to drill me for a gentlewoman." [...] Poor Carolina, there she was mistaken: Miss Fleming could make her into no gentlewoman, for she was born one already, and nothing proves it more than the perfect absence of false shame with which in her memoirs <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> all these graphic little details of their early humble days.|$|E

The old idea was, you know, that there are seventy-two princely devils, and as many as seven million--er--commoners. It may very well sound quaint to our ears, Mrs Lovat; but there it is. But whether that has any bearing on--on what you were saying, Danton, I can't say.

[...] "The house, once the summer resort of Arcadian sonneteers, was now abandoned to a family of market-gardeners, who hung their hats and jackets on the marble heads of improvvisatori and crowned poetesses, and threw their beans, maize, and garden-tools into the corners of the desolate reception-rooms, from whose mildewed walls looked down a host of celebrities--brocaded doges, powdered princesses, and scarlet-robed cardinals, simpering drearily in their desolation," [...] and [...] "sad, haggard poetesses in sea-green and sky-blue draperies, with lank, powdered locks and meager arms, holding lyres; fat, ill-shaven priests in white bands and mop-wigs; sonneteering ladies, sweet and vapid in dove-colored stomachers and embroidered sleeves; jolly extemporary poets, flaunting in many-colored waistcoats and gorgeous shawls." ...|$|E
60|$|Cagliostro was a low-born Neapolitan ruffian. But {{he had a}} presence! In the Memoirs of Madame d'Oberkirch <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> {{how much}} she disliked and distrusted Cagliostro, always {{avoiding}} him, and warning Cardinal Rohan against him--in vain. But she admits that the man dominated her, or would have dominated her, by something inexplicable in his eyes, his bearing, and his unaccountable knowledge, as when he publicly announced, on a certain day, {{the death of the}} great Empress, Maria Theresa, of which the news did not arrive till five days later. Now Home had none of this dominating personality. He has been described to me, by a lady who knew him in his later years, when he had ceased to work drawing-room miracles in society, as a gentle, kindly, quiet person, with no obvious fault, unless a harmless and childlike vanity be a fault. Thus he struck an observer not of his intimate circle. He liked to give readings and recitations, and he played the piano with a good deal of feeling. He was a fair linguist, he had been a Catholic, he was of the middle order of intelligence, he had no 'mission' except to prove that disembodied spirits exist, if that were a legitimate inference from the marvels which attended him.|$|E
6000|$|This lady was, in a {{literary}} sense, and though, like the sire of Evelina, he cast her off, {{the daughter of}} Horace Walpole. Just when King Romance seemed as dead as Queen Anne, Walpole produced that Gothic tale, [...] "The Castle of Otranto," [...] in 1764. In that very year was born Anne Ward, who, in 1787, married William Radcliffe, Esq., M.A., Oxon. In 1789 she published [...] "The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne." [...] The scene, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> is laid in [...] "the most romantic part of the Highlands, the north-east coast of Scotland." [...] On castles, anywhere, she doted. Walpole, not Smollett or Miss Burney, inspired her {{with a passion for}} these homes of old romance. But the north-east coast of Scotland is hardly part of the Highlands at all, and is far from being very romantic. The period is [...] "the dark ages" [...] in general. Yet the captive Earl, when [...] "the sweet tranquillity of evening threw an air of tender melancholy over his mind [...] . composed the following sonnet, which (having committed it to paper) he the next evening dropped upon the terrace. He had the pleasure to observe that the paper was taken up by the ladies, who immediately retired into the castle."
