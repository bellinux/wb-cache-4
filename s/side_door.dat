5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung <b>side</b> <b>door</b> on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
5|$|Cave 9 located to {{the right}} of Cave 8, can be entered via the latter's veranda. Cave 9 has its own veranda and a hall. The veranda has four Satakarni-period, broken pillars. The hall has a larger central door - with windows on either side - and a <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> both having grooves for wooden frames. The purpose of this hall is unknown and speculated to be a school or study.|$|E

5|$|Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to drop {{supplies}} by parachute on Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel {{cans and}} boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used GPS to locate their targets, then pushed ordinance through the <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> One {{of the aircraft}} was shot down by an SA-6 missile, killing Marko Živković, {{the commander of the}} air unit.|$|E
5|$|Family {{tensions}} {{play out}} on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every type of container and pallet, and a <b>side</b> <b>door</b> {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{the small}} <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> were {{replaced}} by large, sliding sides (index letter i), in order to enable loading and unloading of palletised goods by forklift trucks. For example, the wagons could be loaded at a port directly from the ship by crane; at their destination they could then be unloaded through the <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|These dual cab {{locomotives}} {{have three}} windows between the <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> on one <b>side</b> and four {{on the opposite}} side. When the locomotive is observed from the side with three windows, its no. 1 end will be to the viewer’s left. As on the later Class 4E, the locomotive had <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> on both <b>sides</b> behind each cab.|$|R
50|$|The {{bi-directional}} variants have {{a second}} driver's cab and additional <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> unlike the uni-directional models.|$|R
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondent}} Michael Alvarado {{agreed to}} help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck {{in the parking lot}} of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwords, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present during the interview but were not allowed in by police. Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.|$|E

25|$|Early bay-window tent. When Volkswagen transitioned to the bay-window or breadloaf {{model with}} large, single curved {{windshield}} and sliding <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> the Westfalia camper was modified {{to include an}} angled poptop. This design provided space for a large child's cot overhead, and on later models, the poptop was further enlarged to fit a full bed large enough for two adults.|$|E
50|$|The Series 6 and Series 7 {{locomotives}} {{are visually}} indistinguishable from each other, {{but can be}} distinguished from all the older series models by the rainwater beading that had been added above the small grilles on the sides aft of the <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> Beginning with Series 8, all subsequent series had a large hatch <b>door</b> on each <b>side</b> {{to the right of}} their <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} built of English red bricks with local oyster shell mortar. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on October 30, 1745. The nave has a rectangular plan with five bays. The center bays have <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> with fanlights {{and the others}} have windows with fanlights. Brick pilasters flank the <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and are {{at the corners of}} the church. The roof is hipped over the sanctuary and has a Jacobean or Dutch gable at the entrance. The nave has a plastered, barrel-vaulted ceiling. The pews are paneled, wooden box pews. There is a center aisle and a cross aisle at the <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> The floor is flagstone. [...] The first service was held on August 16, 1747.|$|R

25|$|The {{first two}} people he shot were sitting {{directly}} in front of him. The shooting was contained to one theater. After the shooting ended, Houser exited the theater through a <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and apparently tried to head for his vehicle while blending in with survivors. However, upon noticing police sirens, he retreated back inside the building and fired three more shots at fleeing moviegoers before committing suicide.|$|E
25|$|Abbate {{was allowed}} to enter his {{courtroom}} hearing through a <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> in order to shield himself from the press. This generated controversy and allegations surfaced that the police ticketed the vehicles of news organizations and threatened reporters with arrest. Superintendent Cline {{announced that he would}} demote the Captain who gave the orders, and launched investigations into the actions of the other officers involved.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, June 24, five text {{messages}} {{were sent to}} co-workers between 3:51a.m. and 3:58a.m. using both Chris Benoit's and Nancy Benoit's cell phones. Four of them were the Benoits' address; the fifth said that the family's dogs were in the enclosed pool area, and also noted that a garage <b>side</b> <b>door</b> had been left open. Guerrero and Scott Armstrong {{were two of the}} recipients of these texts.|$|E

25|$|The single <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> {{which had}} been {{introduced}} to around 6½ per cent of Mark B production vehicles after November 1951, became a standard fixture on the Mark C. Because the car's monocoque construction depended principally upon its skin for rigidity, the size of door was severely limited and to overcome the resulting decrease in structural rigidity, vertical steel strengthening brackets were fitted either side and along the bottom edge of the door aperture.|$|E
25|$|At the 2010 Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta– {{the second}} to last race to use the rear wing– Carl Edwards made {{deliberate}} contact with Brad Keselowski (in retaliation for several events including the Talladega race the prior season), causing Keselowski to turn backwards and once more flip over despite the roof flaps being deployed. Keselowski flipped over once and crashed on his <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> Edwards was parked {{for the rest of}} the race and put on three-race probation.|$|E
25|$|In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, {{then got}} out of the passenger's <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker was {{shouting}} frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, standing on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker, Ryan took a couple of steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.|$|E
