5000|$|Dunlop Rubber, {{founded in}} 1889, was a British {{multinational}} {{involved in the}} manufacture of various rubber products. By the end of the Second World War, around 1946, starting with Fort Dunlop, Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham in Britain, Dunlop had manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Ireland, South Africa and India. It had sales outlets in nearly every country in the world. Then the Monopolies and Restrictive Prices Commission forced some pricing changes. In the early sixties Dunlop opted for the cheaper textile radial tyres rather than the <b>steel</b> <b>belted</b> radial <b>tyres.</b> The British car industry declined and the 1973 oil crisis compounded matters. Dunlop started losing markets. As its business declined it started selling off many of its companies, including that in India.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a <b>steel</b> <b>belted</b> radial <b>tyre</b> under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the <b>tyre</b> including ply, <b>belts,</b> and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted radial tyre subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R

Stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are used {{primarily in the}} chemical, food, rubber, plastic, wood, and laminate industries. Carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are energy efficient and ideal for applications necessitating radiant heating of products or in high-temperature applications that might exceed the annealing temperatures of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> also carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> can more evenly distributed heat since most stainless steel alloys are comparatively poor heat conductors. Carbon <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> are used primarily in food processing, transport, and bake ovens. Textured Steel is also a commonly found belt material.

5000|$|Shot peening is a {{solution}} process for flattening a deformed <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> in which {{the surface of the}} belt is hammered with small spherical stainless steel or carbon steel balls called peening shot. Every single small piece of shots hitting the <b>steel</b> <b>belts</b> functions as a small peening hammer, transmitting a small indentation or dimple on the <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> surface. In order for the indentation to be formed, the <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> surface layer must yield in tension. The compressed grains help to recover the surface to its real surface (original surface) producing a hemisphere of cold-worked metal extremely stressed in compression. Overlapping indentation create a homogeneous layer of residual compressive stress. It is well known that cracks will not lead up nor propagate in a compressible stressed zone. Because nearly all fatigue and stress corrosion failures create at the surface of a part, compressive stresses generate by shot peening provide very important increases in life time.Note that: ...|$|R

40|$|The Outokumpu <b>Steel</b> <b>Belt</b> Sintering (SBS) Technology is {{used for}} {{manufacturing}} chromite pellets that are charged into a smelting furnace for ferrochromium production. One {{of the main elements}} in successful fur-nace operation is the control of gas flows inside the furnace, giving improved temperature distribution in the bed during the process. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) gives excellent opportunities for studying these phenomena. An investigation using CFD can be performed relatively fast. For example, implications of different configurations can be studied within a day and an optimum design chosen. Therefore, Outokumpu Technology has developed a <b>Steel</b> <b>Belt</b> Sintering Model (SBSM), which takes advantage of a commercial CFD code. Each main physicochemical event occurring in a <b>steel</b> <b>belt</b> sintering furnace is incorporated independently in the SBS model as a sub-model, enabling every event to be studied separately. The commercial CFD code solves mass, momentum, species and energy equations for determination of the gas flow, composition and temperature. In addition, the Outokumpu SBSM takes into account the moving pellet bed, drying of pellets in terms of water content, coke combustion, oxidation and reduction of chromite and the decomposition of car-bonates and silicates. During the development of the model, numerous laboratory-scale tests were performed. The sub-models were validated against the laboratory tests. The reliability of the Outokumpu <b>Steel</b> <b>Belt</b> Sintering Model was validated against a pilot-scale batch-sintering furnace by comparing the modelling results against measure-ments.
