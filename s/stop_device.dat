These 'frozen' specimens are helpful in examining the plastic deformation that occurs in the regions of compression and shear which form the chip; the secondary shear at the tool-chip interface; and the nose ploughing/flank rubbing action which operates on the newly machined surface. The Hammer QSD employs a shear pin mechanism, broken by a flying hammer, which is traveling at the same velocity as the workpiece. The device has been successfully tested up to 6000 sfpm (30. 48 m/sec) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractContinuously cooled {{bainitic}} steels {{have the}} potential to replace conventional quenched and tempered steels in automotive applications. Whereas the machining performance often decides about the cost effectiveness of a particular part, little general knowledge exists about the machinability of such novel steels. First practical experiences with drilling operations confirm the good machinability of bainitic steels as well as the potential for further optimization. Also from a scientific point of view a better understanding of chip formation in the drilling process is desirable. This includes the variation of forces over the drilling edge and the determination of corresponding shear angles. For generating real chip roots a quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> was developed. In addition to conventional metallographic micro sections, a non-destructive method namely computer tomography was used for characterization of chip formation based on chip roots...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} work investigates {{a technique to}} further improve performance of vibration energy harvesters under displacement-constrained operation.

However, there is a range of tested acceleration amplitudes in which the transducing end- <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> performs worse than the conventional device. In this paper, an approach using electric control is used to optimize the end-stop transducer performance and thereby further improve the system effectiveness under displacement constrained operation. For example, the maximum power increases {{by a factor of}} 2. 4 compared to that of a conventional prototype under the same operating conditions and constrained displacement amplitude, while this value was about 1. 3 for the previous technique...|$|E

40|$|The final surface {{roughness}} obtained by machining operation {{is very important}} in finish cut. One of the main factors relating to the {{surface roughness}} is the formation and destruction of built up edges. It is clear that their fragments increase the surface roughness. Orthogonal cutting method is used in order to obtain the obvious relation between cutting speed and surface roughness. Cutting speed is changed from 5 m/min to 200 m/min in this experiment. Built up edges are frozen and observed using quick <b>stop</b> <b>device</b> of cutting by explosive. The conclusions attained are as follows. 1.

40|$|The {{grinding}} process {{is still an}} important manufacturing process for the machining of automotive components. For power train components, ultra-high carbon steel (UHC-steel) is a promising new innovative alloy because of its low specific density. Results from turning of UHC-steel showed that the texture of UHC-steel significantly differs from conventional steels. Furthermore, extremely hard carbides, which are embedded into a soft ferrite matrix, result in a UHC-steel specific machining behavior and a high tool wear rate. Therefore, UHC-steel is marked as a difficult-to-cut material. So far, there are no research results available for the grinding of UHC-steel. Therefore, fundamental investigations were conducted in order to analyze the material removal and chip formation mechanisms. Scratching tests with a geometrically defined cubic boron nitride cutting edge showed ductile material removal mechanisms for a single grain chip thickness variation from hcu = 1. 5 up to 14 μm.

40|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} in a {{woman with}} a missing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube CASE DESCRIPTION An 87 -year-old bedridden, demented woman who was enterally fed via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube pre-sented to the ED with vomiting, abdominal pain and fever (38. 3 °C), and a surgical consult was requested from the senior surgical resident. The patient had been referred to the emer-gency department 3 days earlier due to a missing PEG tube. The patient was seen by a surgical resident, and an 18 F Foley cath-eter was inserted into the gastrostomy site. A plain abdominal X-ray on her repeat visit showed a distal small bowel obstruction with an evident intraluminal migrated PEG tube (figure 1). The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy, which revealed an obstruction just proximal to the ileocecal valve with a patch of full-thickness necrosis of the ileum. An enterotomy revealed the Foley catheter with a still inflated balloon (figure 2). An ileoce-cectomy was performed, and her postoperative course was uneventful. Small bowel obstruction by migrated gastrostomy feeding tubes is a rare complication mostly occurring in the duo-denum or jejunum. 1 This case’s severe presentation emphasises the importance of tube fixation to the stoma site using an exter-nal <b>stop</b> <b>device,</b> routine assessment of the tube’s placement by the nursing staff and consideration of imaging in cases where the gastrostomy tube is missing...|$|E
