Many <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have a good high school experience". Students, {{who tend to be}} individualistic and creative thinkers, are encouraged to ask questions.

500|$|The New York Times, calling Shimer [...] "one of the {{smallest}} liberal arts colleges in the United States", described its students as [...] "both valedictorians and high school dropouts. What the students share, besides a love of books, is a disdain for the conventional style of education. Many <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have a good high school experience." [...] Shimer students tended to be individualistic, creative thinkers and are encouraged to be inquisitive. The college enrolled 97 students in 2014, about half from Illinois. Of these students 41 were women, 25percent were students of color and 76percent were age 24 or over. Forty percent were first-time, full-time college students. Of the full-time students attending {{for the first time}} in 2012, 86percent returned for their second year. Sixty percent of students who entered in 2007 completed a bachelor's degree in six years.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian also {{quoted a}} U.S. {{official}} explaining the anticipated difficulty {{of finding a}} country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil. A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial, and that [...] "it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body". On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: [...] "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This {{is not one of}} them." [...] Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain {{and the director of the}} Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful.|$|E

500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common reasons {{reported}} for sexually harassing behavior is because the harasser thinks it is funny to do so. In their 2006 study, the AAUW found that this was the most common rationale for harassment by boys—59 percent used it. Less than one-fifth (17%) of those boys who admitted to harassing others <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so because they wanted a date with the person. (AAUW, 2006) Other researchers assert that the [...] "I thought it was funny" [...] rationale is a fallacy, and the true reasons align more with that of a need to assert power and induce fear in others—more in line with bullying. These hazing behaviors develop in school, continue in high school and college, eventually moving into the workplace. (Boland, 2002) ...|$|E
2500|$|Betty Riess, a {{spokeswoman}} for Bank of America, told MintPress News via email, [...] "We do not close accounts {{on the basis of}} nationality, nor do we close accounts without notice to customers." [...] However, account holders believe there could be a relationship between this action and their national origin. Although most account holders <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not receive any notification prior their accounts being frozen, Bank of America insists that they do not freeze any account without prior notification. When it was reported that Bank of America was closing the accounts of Iranians living in the U.S. and Iranian-Americans, there was speculation that the bank did so on the basis of discriminatory ideology, since Bank of America did not give these individuals any reason why their accounts were being closed. The bank responded to these accusations, arguing that it was only following the rules put forth by the U.S. federal government regarding economic relations between the U.S. and Iran.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, the {{incident}} has caused some debates {{because it is}} rare that a Christian black metal band gets signed to a secular label. Previously only Horde's release of Hellig Usvart in 1994 on Nuclear Blast is a similar known case. In December 1998, the drummer Armoth {{said in an interview}} with the Art for the Ears webzine that they sent the CD and a short biography for Cacophonous Records and that Cacophonous Records just wanted to sign Antestor because of the music, which was exactly what the band wanted to do.

[...] And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult: [...] "No, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body." ...|$|R
