40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarTravelling {{is a risky}} business. One of {{the risks}} is to aquire a {{tropical}} infectious <b>disease</b> and <b>import</b> this <b>disease</b> into the home country. To gain insight in the relation between travelling and tropical diseases data of various sources have been collected. Travellers' diarrhoea and fever are the most frequent complaints travellers suffer from. A study showed that 15 % of the travellers remained ill after returning home. In 1990, 800 cases of so-called <b>import</b> <b>diseases</b> were reported at the Inspectorate of Health. The registration probably is not complete. <b>Import</b> <b>diseases</b> regularly seen in the Netherlands are dysenteria bacillaris, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, malaria and tuberculosis. The transmission route and pathology of these diseases is briefly discussed. Also the occurrences in the Netherlands from 1950 until now is given. Possible preventive measures are vaccination, chemoprophylactic medicine and preventive behaviour. A study showed that only 50 % of the Dutch travellers took preventive measures and that this percentage among non-Dutch inhabitants was much lower. It is important to improve travel health advice. The government, travel agencies, travel health centers and migration organisations must cooperate to achieve this goal. Several more data are necessary to discuss the topic of <b>import</b> <b>diseases.</b> A more complete view of the problems {{could lead to a}} better vaccination level and health care advice for travellers...|$|R

Data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in humans were summarized from 1999 to 2008 on the situation of <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> in Japan and observed {{that there is no}} border for infectious diseases. Diseases such as shigellosis, amebiasis, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever, giardiasis, cholera, hepatitis A and paratyphoid fever are important <b>imported</b> <b>diseases</b> and the introduction of new pathogens may result in their establishment in the country.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis deals {{with the problems of}} <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases.</b> It comprises the factors influencing their incidence and the possibilities of specific and nonspecific prophylaxis and prevention. Further on, this part focuses on chosen infectious diseases, their epidemiological and clinical characteristics and trends in incidence. These infections are divided according to possibilities of specific prophylaxis. The thesis offers an overview of the possibilities of pre-travel consultancy in the South Bohemia region. The practical part of the thesis aims at the characterization of the incidence of <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> in the districts within the region of South Bohemia in the years 2000 ? 2010. It also presents a survey of medical facilities and other subjects providing pre-travel consultancy and specific prophylaxis in the sphere of <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> prevention. During the monitoring period, the total number of <b>imported</b> <b>diseases</b> which occurred in the region of South Bohemia and were registered in the EPIDAT system was 351. Out of this number, 205 cases occurred in the district of České Budějovice. (Český Krumlov ? 47, Jindřichův Hradec ? 25, Písek ? 2, Prachatice ? 17, Strakonice ? 31, Tábor ? 24). The most frequent imported infections were alimentary infections (240 cases, i. e. 68 %); out of this, the most frequent cases were diseases caused by Salmonella (73 cases), Shigella (71 cases) and campylobacters (42 cases). The most frequent countries of origin were Egypt (43 cases), Croatia (42 cases) and India (30 cases). The number of medical facilities and other subjects providing pre-travelling consultancy and specific prophylaxis of infectious diseases rose from nine to thirteen during the period of monitoring. Four hypotheses were determined within this thesis. Hypothesis no. 1 ? during the period of monitoring the total number of <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> increased. Hypothesis no. 2 ? during the period of monitoring the total number of infectious <b>diseases</b> <b>imported</b> from exotic destinations increased. Hypothesis no. 3 ? during the period of monitoring there was {{an increase in the number}} of the facilities and other subjects providing pre-travel advice, vaccination or other specific prophylaxis. Hypothesis no. 4 ? the increasing number of medical facilities or other subjects providing pre-travel advice, vaccination or other specific prophylaxis did not influence an increase in the number of <b>imported</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> during the period of monitoring. Only hypotheses no. 3 and no. 4 were proved...|$|R
