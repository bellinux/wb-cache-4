40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the effects of a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{morphology}} of the epiphyseal plate in goat distal femur. Eighteen premature female goats were divided randomly into <b>sliding</b> <b>plate,</b> regular plate and control groups. Radiographic analysis and histological staining were performed to evaluate the development of epiphyseal plate at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. In the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> group, the plate extended accordingly as the epiphyseal plate grows, and the epiphyseal morphology was kept essential normal. However, the phenomenon of the epiphyseal growth retardation and premature closure were very common in the regular plate group. In addition, the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> group exhibited more normal histologic features and Safranin O staining compared to the regular plate group. Our results suggest that the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> can provide reliable internal fixation of epiphyseal fracture without inhibiting epiphyseal growth. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} fixture for supporting an elongated specimen for crush testing. The fixture comprises a base plate, four guiding rods, a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate,</b> four support rods and two collars. The guiding rods {{connect to the}} base plate and extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the base <b>plate.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> has linear bearings which encircle the guiding rods and enable translation of the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> along the axis of each guiding rod. The four supporting rods mount to the base plate and also extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the base plate. Each support rod has a keyway for a wedge which contacts the elongated specimen and holds the specimen in place during crushing. Each collar lies above the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> and holds a pair of support rods on their ends opposite the ends connected to the base plate.

5000|$|A {{more obvious}} {{change in the}} shutter {{hardware}} was noted in shutter bolts. The common <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> and keeper style of bolt started to appear. It was simpler to fabricate and operate than the earlier [...] "strap style lock" [...] and required a less skilled work force to produce. This bolt relied on both the new cheap fasteners and the readily available plate iron.

5000|$|The Reisekamera, {{meaning a}} [...] "travel camera", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost {{standardised}} design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, {{but not as}} cumbersome as the studio camera. A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it {{might just as well}} be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks {{on either side of the}} baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position. The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery. However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} upgrade the seismic {{resistibility}} of structures and enhance the functionality of an isolator, a new base isolator called the multiple trench friction pendulum system (MTFPS) is proposed in this study. The proposed MTFPS isolator is composed of a trench concave surface and several intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates</b> in two orthogonal directions. Mathematical formulations have been derived to examine {{the characteristics of the}} proposed MTFPS isolator possessing multiple intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates.</b> By means of mathematical formulations, it can be inferred that the natural period and damping effect of the MTFPS isolator with several intermediate <b>sliding</b> <b>plates</b> can be altered continually and controllably during earthquakes. Furthermore, results obtained from shaking table tests demonstrate that the proposed isolator provides good protection to structures for prevention of damage from strong earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} quality of alumina are taken along with different metals {{as the starting}} materials. Different compositions are formulated taking single or combination of metals which are mixed with phenol formaldehyde resin and pressed with a specific pressure of 2000 kg/cm 2. The bricks are cured at 240 °C for 12 hours. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated. Also the bricks are fired at 1100 °C in reducing atmosphere. Physical, thermal and thermo mechanical properties are evaluated and correlated with the mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Based on these findings carbon bearing plates are made {{with the addition of}} carbon black or carbon black and graphite. The addition is restricted up to 5 %. Properties are evaluated and correlated with mineralogical and microstructural analysis. Plates containing aluminium metal shows superior thermal and thermo-mechanical properties than silicon metal containing Al 2 O 3 <b>slide</b> <b>plates.</b> However plate containing metal in combination has the best thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. Fused alumina based plates has comparatively superior properties for all grade of metal addition. Plate containing both carbon black and graphite flake was having comparatively efficient properties in carbon bonded <b>slide</b> <b>plates.</b> To improve the thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance, along with mechanical properties, in situ synthesised plasma fused ZrO 2 -SiC was incorporated in the Al 2 O 3 –C <b>slide</b> gate <b>plates.</b> Apart from mechanical properties, thermal spalling resistance, erosion resistance and oxidation resistance of these <b>slide</b> <b>plates</b> were compared with the normal ones.

40|$|A Monsanto Automatic Capillary Rheometer and a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> {{rheometer}} {{were used}} to study the spurt phenomenon and to discover {{whether it is the}} result of a system instability or a material property. The capillary rheometer has been the only instrument able to operate at spurt stresses up to present time, because capillary rheometers operate at shear stresses that are out of the range of rotational shear rheometers. However, a <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer can generate shear stresses in the spurt range. A comparative study using two linear polybutadiene samples at 50 °C was carried out using these two rheometers. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of the actual pressure drop in the capillary in order to determine the true shear stress at the wall. It was found that spurt occurs only in the capillary rheometer. In other words, the flow curve generated by the <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> rheometer is continuous in the shear stress range where spurt is observed in the capillary rheometer. Slip velocities were determined using data from the two rheometers, and the slip velocities for the post-slip capillary flow all fall on the smooth curve based on <b>sliding</b> <b>plate</b> data, provided that the pressure drop in the capillary, and not the overall driving pressure, is used to calculate the wall shear stress...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to an apparatus for stirring materials using planar orthogonal axes oscillations. The apparatus has a movable <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> sandwiched between two fixed parallel support plates.

40|$|A {{fluid flow}} of molten steel in {{continuous}} casting mold directly results in slab surface and internal defects, such as slag entrapment, inclusions, and pinholes. Much {{effort was made}} on the field to stabilize it. Appli-cation of various electromagnetic forces and various nozzle designs are proposed and applied to commercial continuous casting process.

In this study, fluid flow in submerged entry nozzle is in-situ observed through transparent immersion nozzle by a fusible alloy model and a molten steel flow model. According to the experiment, fluid flow in submerged entry nozzle is dominated by argon flow rate, metal flow rate and nozzle diameter. Meniscus height in the nozzle is stable enough to measure, and decreasing argon flow rate, increasing metal flow rate and reducing nozzle diameter leads the flow from potential-flow to plug-flow. Another examination, measurement of net argon flow rate through mold meniscus revealed that about 20 % of argon gas injected from upper <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> is brought into nozzle at continuous casting process.

40|$|This {{technical}} report summarizes the research conducted and progress achieved {{during the period}} from October 1, 1997 to March 30, 1998. Numerical modeling and simulation on the gas velocity and pressure were continued to predict the flow patterns in the CFB. The renormalization group k-e turbulence model was employed to improve the predictions of the near the wall flow, wall heat/mass transfer, and wake/vortex shedding behavior. This model could provide more accurate prediction of swirl than in standard k-E model. The air velocity profile was predicted in 2 -D velocity vector of the <b>slide</b> <b>plate.</b> The aeration (secondary) air flow rate reduced air velocity and caused a strong gas mixing processes. The air flowed from the high pressure region into the low pressure region. The aeration air injection affected on its neighborhood pressure profile. Two eddies are formed at level k= 15 which is symmetrical with the aeration air inlet center line. It is very {{interesting to note that the}} air stream flows from the lower pressure region into the high pressure region. Experimental measurements will be conducted to understand heat transfer characteristics in the CFB system. In addition, numerical modeling and simulation will be continued to predict the flow patterns, velocity, pressure, temperature, and heat flux with the heat transfer effect in the CFB system...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{lithography}} {{will enable}} physicians and researchers to obtain macromolecules with high purity (greater than 90 percent) from desired cells in conventionally processed, clinical tissues by simply annotating the desired cells {{on a computer}} screen. After identifying the desired cells, a suitable lithography mask will be generated to protect {{the contents of the}} desired cells while allowing destruction of all undesired cells by irradiation with ultraviolet light. The DNA from the protected cells {{can be used in a}} number of downstream applications including DNA sequencing. The purity (i. e., macromolecules isolated form specific cell types) of such specimens will greatly enhance the value and information of downstream applications. In this method, the specific cells are isolated on a microscope slide using photolithography, which will be faster, more specific, and less expensive than current methods. It relies on the fact that many biological molecules such as DNA are photosensitive and can be destroyed by ultraviolet irradiation. Therefore, it is possible to protect the contents of desired cells, yet destroy undesired cells. This approach leverages the technologies of the microelectronics industry, which can make features smaller than 1 micrometer with photolithography. A variety of ways has been created to achieve identification of the desired cell, and also to designate the other cells for destruction. This can be accomplished through chrome masks, direct laser writing, and also active masking using dynamic arrays. Image recognition is envisioned as one method for identifying cell nuclei and cell membranes. The pathologist can identify the cells of interest using a microscopic computerized image of the slide, and appropriate custom software. In one of the approaches described in this work, the software converts the selection into a digital mask that can be fed into a direct laser writer, e. g. the Heidelberg DWL 66. Such a machine uses a metalized glass plate (with chrome metallization) on which there is a thin layer of photoresist. The laser transfers the digital mask onto the photoresist by direct writing, with typical best resolution of 2 micrometers. The plate is then developed to remove the exposed photoresist, which leaves the exposed areas susceptible to chemical chrome etch. The etch removes the unprotected chrome. The rest of the photoresist is then removed, by either ultraviolet organic solvent or over-development. The remaining chrome pattern is quickly oxidized by atmospheric exposure (typically within 30 seconds). The ready chrome mask is now applied to the tissue slide and aligned manually, or using automatic software and pre-designed alignment marks. The <b>slide</b> <b>plate</b> sandwich is then exposed to UV to destroy the DNA of the unwanted cells. The slide and plate are separated and the slide is processed in a standard way to prepare for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and potential identification of cancer sequences...|$|E
