40|$|Abstract [...] The {{adsorption}} {{and degradation}} on montmorillonite of s-triazine, the parent compound {{of a major}} group of triazine-based herbicides, were studied by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The original s-triazine appeared to hydrolyze with residual bound water in montmorillonite at 20 "C to produce formamide, which formed an intercalate with the clay. A mechanism for the conversion of s-triazine to formamide was proposed which does not support earlier eports that formic acid and ammonia re the reaction products.

40|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> (e. g. micas and clays) are {{important}} constituents {{of a wide}} variety of geological formations such as granite, basalt, and sandstone. <b>Sheet</b> <b>silicates,</b> particularly clays such as bentonite are common materials in near-field engineered barriers in high-level nuclear waste (HLW) repositories.

However, theability of the <b>sheet</b> <b>silicates</b> to incorporate radionuclides and retard release and migration of radionuclides may be significantly affected by the near-field radiation due to the decay of fission products and actinides. for example, the unique properties of the sheet structures will be lost completely if the structure becomes amorphous due to irradiation effects.

Due to its high thermal stability and negatively charged features, {{it is interesting to}} investigate whether the mica substrate will affect sample surface structure by enabling interactions between biological systems.

Experimentally, previous research group members have observed protein alignment on the mica surface in register with underlying crystal directions.

We apply molecular dynamics (MD) calculations to investigate whether the mica substrate affects ordering of the ions in water. We first optimize the mica structure with four K⁺ ions originally in the system. Then we use two methods to check whether ions effect the mica surface reconstruction. The two methods are: replacing K⁺ ions with Na⁺ ions and removing ions from the mica system. Our calculations show that K⁺ and Na⁺ ions induce different surface reconstruction of mica. Furthermore, ion arrangements on the mica surface play an important role in water pattern formation. In this way, the nanoscale crystallographic reconstruction of the mica surface may be translated into a micro-scale pattern for protein alignment...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempted}} {{to identify the}} significant parameters which affect radionuclide migration from a low level radioactive waste disposal site located in a clay deposit. From initial sorption studies on smectite minerals, increased Kd with decreasing initial cation concentration was observed, and three sorption mechanisms were identified. The observation of anion dependent sorption {{was related to the}} existence of a mechanism in which an anion-cation pair are bound to the clay surface through the anion. The influence of competing cations, typical of inorganic groundwater constituents, depended on: (1) Ni/Co:Mn+(Mn+ = competing cation) ratio, (2) nature of M^n+, (3) total solution ionic strength. The presence of organic material in groundwater is well documented, but its effect on cation sorption has not been established. An initial qualitative investigation involving addition of simple organic ligands to Ni(Co) -hectorite samples demonstrated the formation of metal complexes in the clay interlayers, although some modified behaviour was observed. Further quantitative examination involving likely groundwater organic constituents and more comprehensive physical investigation confirmed this behaviour and enabled separation of the organic compounds used into two classes, according to their effect on cation sorption; (i) acids, (ii) amine compounds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Mossbauer spectroscopy were used to investigate the nature of transition metal ions sorbed onto montmorillonite and hectorite. Evidence strongly favoured the sorption of the hexaaquo cation, although a series of sorption sites of slightly different chemical characteristics were responsible for broadened peak widths observed in XPS and Mossbauer investigations. The surface sensitivity of XPS enabled recognition of the two surface sorption sites proposed in earlier sorption studies. Although thermal treatment of Fe^ 3 +/Fe^ 2 +-hectorite samples left iron atoms bonded to the <b>silicate</b> <b>sheet</b> structure, Mossbauer evidence indicated the presence of both ferric and ferrous iron in all samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{description}} of inorganic crystal {{has moved on}} from the early concentration on a picture of linked symmetrical polyhedra, and we outline several further systems for visualising inorganic structures, discuss their relative usefulness and {{draw attention to the}} value of the concepts of curvature in understanding the “grammar” underlying inorganic and biological structure. The “letters” are the atoms and the “words” are the smallest clusters of bonded atoms. “Grammar” {{is the way in which}} the words are combined into larger units and “syntax” is the next level of organisation. We will not here touch on what “meaning” represents, but the metaphor of language is immensely productive and suggestive. Since the discovery of the role of DNA, this metaphor has become firmly established in molecular biology. We suggest now that it is useful also in the inorganic field. One important element of this “grammar” is intrinsic curvature, which can be considered as a measure of strain in structures caused by a misfit of neighbouring components. We concentrate particularly on this element of structuration at the expense of many others which would require lengthly development. For example, strain in flat sheets (for instance <b>silicate</b> <b>sheet</b> structures), besides making them cylindrical, may make them curve either elliptically, producing closed domains (such as spherulites or icosahedral virus particles) or hyperbolically into the third dimension, yielding periodic minimal surfaces. Periodic minimal surfaces occur as a dominant secondary structure in lipids, lyotropic colloids (“soaps”), framework silicates (zeolite molecular sieves) and many other systems. We describe a number of minimal surfaces and show how their profiles and areas can be calculated numerically. Going a step further, the curvature of 3 -D structures into 4 -D is difficult to imagine, but this concept is nevertheless important. The mapping of a structure of one curvature onto a structure of an incompatible curvature may be seen as the basis for possible reactions or transformations...|$|E

40|$|Polymer/clay nanocomposites {{have been}} {{observed}} to exhibit enhanced thermal/mechanical properties at low weight fractions (We) of clay. Continuum-based composite modeling reveals that the enhanced properties are strongly dependent on particular features of the second-phase "particles"; in particular, the particle volume fraction (f,), the particle aspect ratio (L/t), and the ratio of particle thermal/mechanical properties {{to those of the}} matrix. These important aspects of as-processed nanoclay composites require consistent and accurate definition. A multiscale modeling strategy is employed to account for the hierarchical morphology of the nanocomposite: at a lengthscale of thousands of microns, the structure is one of high aspect ratio particles within a matrix; at the lengthscale of microns, the clay particle structure is either (a) exfoliated clay sheets of nanometer level thickness or (b) stacks of parallel clay sheets separated from one another by interlayer galleries of nanometer level height, and the matrix, if semi-crystalline, consists of fine lamella, oriented with respect to the polymer/nanoclay interfaces. Here, quantitative structural parameters extracted from XRD patterns and TEM micrographs (the number of silicate sheets in a clay stack, N, and the <b>silicate</b> <b>sheet</b> layer spacing, d(ool)) are used to determine geometric features of the as-processed clay "particles", including L/t and the ratio of fp to We. (cont.) These geometric features, together with estimates of silica lamina elastic and thermal expansion properties obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, provide a basis for modeling effective thermal/mechanical properties of the clay particle. In the case of the semi-crystalline matrices (e. g., nylon 6), the transcrystallization behavior induced by the nanoclay is taken into account by modeling a layer of matrix surrounding the particle to be highly textured and therefore mechanically anisotropic. Micromechanical models (numerical as well as analytical) based on the "effective clay particle" were employed to calculate the overall anisotropic elastic constants, anisotropic coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and anisotropic yield surface of the amorphous and semi-crystalline polymer-clay nanocomposites and to compute their dependence on the matrix and clay properties as well as internal clay structural parameters. The proposed modeling technique captures the strong modulus enhancements observed in elastomer/clay nanocomposites as compared with the moderate enhancements observed in glassy and semi-crystalline polymer/clay nanocomposites. (cont.) For the case where the matrix is semi-crystalline, the enhancements of composite modulus and strength are found to rely on different functions of the clay: while the modulus enhancement {{can be explained by the}} conventional role of "stiff filler", the strength enhancement of the nanocomposite mainly lies in the improvements of the matrix property achieved through the matrix transcrystallization induced by nanoclay the "nucleation sites". When the nanocomposite experiences a morphological transition from intercalated to completely exfoliated, an abrupt jump in the composite initial yield strength, as opposed to the moderate increase in the overall composite modulus, was predicted. The elastic moduli and anisotropic CTE for MXD 6 -clay and nylon 6 -clay nanocomposites predicted by the micromechanical models are in excellent agreement with experimental data. In summary, continuum-based micromechanical models can provide robust predictions of the overall thermal/mechanical properties of polymer/clay nanocomposites, with the employment of a reliable method to account for the intrinsically hierarchical morphology of the nanoclay, and for the special matrix morphology and properties adjacent to the nanoclay. by Nuo Sheng.

40|$|This present {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} most important impediment for a large scale implementation of sequestering CO₂ by mineralisation, the energy cost of dehydroxylation of serpentinite ores. The current work, based on a practical heat activation strategy, provides reasonable energy and cost estimates of the thermal treatment of serpentine. A practical heat activation strategy comprises prograde heating to yield a material containing 20 % OHres and employs heat integration to recover ~ 80 % of the sensible heat from the dehydroxylated mineral. This study also reconfirms that crystallinity primarily controls magnesium availability. Once dehydroxylated, overheating must be avoided to prevent the material from recrystallising. Significant loss of crystallinity commences by ~ 50 % OHres, peaks at about 20 % OHres, and terminates beyond 5 % OHres. Besides limiting crystallinity, entrapment of liberated water {{and the formation of}} hematite must be minimised or altogether eliminated. The fluidisation of the reactor bed and the use of CO₂ as purge gas combined with prior demagnetisation circumvent these limiting factors. Furthermore, the rapid thermal treatment of 75 µm particles allows for optimal conditions of temperature and rate of dehydroxylation and presents a practical means to increase the throughput and minimise reactor size. Examination of the prior studies on the dehydroxylation of serpentine minerals identified the knowledge gaps that require addressing. This review surveys the key concepts, including the chemical and physical transformations involving the proposed mechanisms, thermal stability, reaction kinetics, the formation of intermediates and products, associated heat requirements, factors that influence the reaction, as well as associated enhancements in both dissolution and carbonation. The review finds the activation processes must avoid recrystallisation of disordered phases to forsterite and enstatite, and minimise the partial pressure of water vapour, which engenders reverse reaction. In particular, this current study determined the suitability of the serpentinite resource from the Great Serpentinite Belt in New South Wales for thermal activation using thermal, X-ray and spectroscopic techniques. Experimental investigations designed to evaluate the thermal behaviour and structural transformations of serpentine minerals include thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. We focussed on antigorite as the model serpentine mineral for these studies, however, we include the other serpentine minerals, lizardite and chrysotile as well as partially serpentinised samples in subsequent energy measurements by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. We first analysed the changes in antigorite’s derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) and deduced factors affecting the mass loss profiles to serve as guide in both fundamental studies and in the design of a scale-up dehydroxylation reactor. The imposed heating rate, type of purge gas, type of comminution and sample mass all influence the dehydroxylation curve. However, the results show no influence of material of construction of the heating vessel and flow rate of the purge gas. We report an important effect of oxidation of Fe²⁺ under air purge gas that occurs prior to dehydroxylation and leads to formation of hematite skins on serpentinite particles, slowing down subsequent mass transfer and increasing the processing temperature. Design considerations of a practical scale up reactor for activating serpentinite ores for storing CO₂ by carbonation ought to comprise rapid heating, proper size reduction, prior demagnetisation and fluidisation of the powdered bed. We then demonstrate the optimisation of heat treatment of antigorite, to provide a benchmark of an extreme case of activation among serpentine minerals. Antigorite was investigated non-isothermally via thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and in-situ X-ray powder diffraction, its thermal reaction sequence elucidated and reaction kinetics subsequently modelled. Here we describe a predictive framework expedient to the thermal processing of serpentinites for the mineralisation of CO₂. We successfully modelled an optimised thermal dehydroxylation strategy for antigorite using a three-dimensional phase boundary reaction model (R 3), with activation energy Ea of 160 kJ mol⁻¹ and a frequency factor A of 5. 7 ± 4. 1 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ (5. 7 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ for dynamic and 1. 6 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ for static stage). This strategy translates to a fast and efficient thermal processing in an optimally-sized calcining vessel. Furthermore, the results imply that activation of the more common serpentine minerals lizardite and chrysotile would be significantly less energy intensive as their dehydroxylation proceeds at lower temperatures than that of antigorite. We also investigated the local chemical environment of thermally treated antigorite to elucidate the structural transformations that take place during its dehydroxylation. A combination of ²⁹Si and ²⁵Mg magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, phase compositional analysis and morphological observations served to characterise these transformations. The results indicate that, whilst the octahedral sheet remained relatively immobile, the tetrahedral sheet demonstrated a range of movements. This progressive break-up of the <b>silicate</b> <b>sheet</b> leads to various SiO₄ tetrahedral polymerisation and the formation of two intermediate phases, dehydroxylate 1 and dehydroxylate 2. These metastable phases possess similar Mg octahedral environment, but differ in the local configuration of SiO₄ tetrahedra. The results suggest that crystallinity plays a significant role in antigorite dehydroxylation wherein partially amorphised regions dehydroxylate preferentially. For applications to mineralisation of CO₂, once dehydroxylated, the formation of new crystalline phases must be minimised in order to maximise the loss of crystallinity. The combined chemical, morphological and physical evidence implies that significant loss of crystallinity commences at about 50 % OHres until about 5 % OHres. Finally, we present realistic cost estimates based on a practical heat activation strategy for serpentinites. By comparing serpentinites from the Great Serpentinite Belt to those found in Coolac Serpentinite Belt, we found the former more suitable for heat activation under a practical heat activation strategy. Based on the research findings, the thermal activation of serpentine minerals from the Great Serpentinite Belt (GSB) presents a practical option to New South Wales for the mineralisation of CO₂. Heat activation of the GSB serpentinites is best performed via prograde heating to about 680 °C to yield an active material with 20 % OHres and requires an energy input of at least 541 MJ (tSerpentinite) ⁻¹.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This present {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} most important impediment for a large scale implementation of sequestering CO₂ by mineralisation, the energy cost of dehydroxylation of serpentinite ores. The current work, based on a practical heat activation strategy, provides reasonable energy and cost estimates of the thermal treatment of serpentine. A practical heat activation strategy comprises prograde heating to yield a material containing 20 % OH res and employs heat integration to recover ~ 80 % of the sensible heat from the dehydroxylated mineral. This study also reconfirms that crystallinity primarily controls magnesium availability. Once dehydroxylated, overheating must be avoided to prevent the material from recrystallising. Significant loss of crystallinity commences by ~ 50 % OH res, peaks at about 20 % OH res, and terminates beyond 5 % OH res. Besides limiting crystallinity, entrapment of liberated water {{and the formation of}} hematite must be minimised or altogether eliminated. The fluidisation of the reactor bed and the use of CO₂ as purge gas combined with prior demagnetisation circumvent these limiting factors. Furthermore, the rapid thermal treatment of 75 µm particles allows for optimal conditions of temperature and rate of dehydroxylation and presents a practical means to increase the throughput and minimise reactor size. Examination of the prior studies on the dehydroxylation of serpentine minerals identified the knowledge gaps that require addressing. This review surveys the key concepts, including the chemical and physical transformations involving the proposed mechanisms, thermal stability, reaction kinetics, the formation of intermediates and products, associated heat requirements, factors that influence the reaction, as well as associated enhancements in both dissolution and carbonation. The review finds the activation processes must avoid recrystallisation of disordered phases to forsterite and enstatite, and minimise the partial pressure of water vapour, which engenders reverse reaction. In particular, this current study determined the suitability of the serpentinite resource from the Great Serpentinite Belt in New South Wales for thermal activation using thermal, X-ray and spectroscopic techniques. Experimental investigations designed to evaluate the thermal behaviour and structural transformations of serpentine minerals include thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. We focussed on antigorite as the model serpentine mineral for these studies, however, we include the other serpentine minerals, lizardite and chrysotile as well as partially serpentinised samples in subsequent energy measurements by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. We first analysed the changes in antigorite’s derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) and deduced factors affecting the mass loss profiles to serve as guide in both fundamental studies and in the design of a scale-up dehydroxylation reactor. The imposed heating rate, type of purge gas, type of comminution and sample mass all influence the dehydroxylation curve. However, the results show no influence of material of construction of the heating vessel and flow rate of the purge gas. We report an important effect of oxidation of Fe²⁺ under air purge gas that occurs prior to dehydroxylation and leads to formation of hematite skins on serpentinite particles, slowing down subsequent mass transfer and increasing the processing temperature.
