5|$|Committed to <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> {{activism}} in Transylvania, Agârbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near Sibiu, with a break during World War I that eventually took him deep into Ukraine. In 1919, {{he moved to}} Cluj, where he lived {{for most of the}} remainder of his life. After the war, he involved himself in both the political and cultural life of Greater Romania. He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre for <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> {{activity}} in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E

In July 1964 two backbench Conservative MPs reported to their Chief Whip that Driberg and Lord Boothby (a well-known Conservative peer) had been importuning males at a dog track, and were involved with gangs of thugs.|$|E

5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> values regarding science.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Zocalo it has, over time, {{been the}} focus of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> activities, most of which have {{occurred}} in the 20thand 21stcenturies. The cathedral was closed for four years while President Plutarco Elías Calles attempted to enforce Mexico's anti-religious laws. Pope Pius XI closed the church, ordering priests to cease their public religious duties in all Mexican churches. After the Mexican government and the papacy came to terms and major renovations were performed on the cathedral, it reopened in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Pressburg flourished {{during the}} 18th-century reign of Queen Maria Theresa, {{becoming}} {{the largest and}} most important town in Hungary.
