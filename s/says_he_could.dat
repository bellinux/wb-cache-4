5|$|Meanwhile, Ruskin {{is at the}} Trudy's {{murder scene}} when a guard, believing Ruskin to be Monk, informs him Leverett is the killer. When Stottlemeyer and Disher arrive at Leverett's car {{dealership}} to arrest him, Ruskin has already arrived and is keeping him as a hostage. Monk enters the dealership and stops Ruskin but is emotionally shaken when Ruskin <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have saved Trudy. At the end, he talks with Dr. Kroger and cancels his trip.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, it is {{revealed}} that Dennis and Gavin {{are still in}} contact. After another six weeks, Margaret visits Sharon, saying that Gavin is acting strangely, but Sharon dismisses this and sends Margaret away. Later, Gavin tells Kathy he has Dennis so she reluctantly gets {{in his car and}} is seen leaving by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman). Sharon sees that Dennis has been in contact with Gavin and Buster tells Sharon what he saw so, fearing for Kathy's safety, they get Gavin's address from Dennis. Kathy and Gavin arrive at a large country house that he bought with Sharon's money, and he locks them in, saying they can live there together. Kathy realises that Dennis is not there, and then Margaret arrives. Gavin locks Kathy in a room as Margaret and Gavin argue, and Margaret knocks Gavin unconscious and lets Kathy out of the room. Gavin regains consciousness and the women try to escape. As Sharon and Buster arrive, a woman falls onto the windscreen of the car and lies dead on the floor. Sharon realises it is Margaret, and she and Buster break into the house where Buster finds Kathy while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is packing a bag with cash. Sharon locks the door and Gavin insists that Margaret's death was an accident. Sharon asks him why he stayed in contact with Dennis when she paid him to stay away, so he says he would never harm his grandson. She tells him to give himself up to the police and if he does so, she will visit him in prison with Dennis and they can be a family when he gets released. Police and paramedics then arrive, as Sharon called them and Gavin accuses her of stalling until they arrived, but she insists she called them for Margaret's sake. Gavin says he will give himself up to the police so Sharon unlocks the bedroom door, but he then tries to escape. He sees his only way out is via the balcony but he is too scared of harming himself to jump. Sharon joins him on the balcony and he asks Sharon to tell the police that Margaret fell. A police officer then arrives on the balcony and Gavin grabs Sharon, threatening to jump, killing them both. Sharon <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never kill himself so he lets her go and she tells him it is over between them. Gavin is then arrested.|$|E

500|$|One {{report says}} the wrestler {{was able to}} hold a {{pomegranate}} without damaging it while challengers tried to pry his fingers from it, and another report <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> burst a band fastened around his brow by inhaling air and causing the temple veins to swell. He was said to maintain his footing on an oiled discus while others tried to push him from it. [...] These feats {{have been attributed to}} misinterpretations of statues depicting Milo with his head bound in victor's ribbons, his hand holding the apple of victory, and his feet positioned on a round disc that would have been fitted into a pedestal or base.|$|E
500|$|In November 1823, the American sealing captain Benjamin Morrell {{reached the}} South Sandwich Islands in the {{schooner}} Wasp. According {{to his own}} later account he then sailed south, unconsciously following the track taken by James Weddell a month previously. Morrell claimed to have reached 70°14'S, at which point he turned north because the ship's stoves were running short of fuel—otherwise, he <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have [...] "reached 85° without the least doubt". After turning, {{he claimed to have}} encountered land which he described in some detail, and which he named New South Greenland. This land proved not to exist. Morrell's reputation as a liar and a fraud means that most of his geographical claims have been dismissed by scholars, although {{attempts have been made to}} rationalize his assertions.|$|E
500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, Brown felt {{guilt over}} {{still looking at}} Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E

They can sing an entire Lionel Richie song." [...] Berman wrote that Richie said he was told that Iraqi civilians were playing [...] "All Night Long" [...] the night U.S. tanks invaded Baghdad. Richie was against the war, but <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see a day when he would come and perform in Baghdad.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates asks Protagoras [...] "in {{respect to}} what" [...] Hippocrates will improve by associating with him, {{in the manner}} that by associating himself to a doctor he would improve in {{medicine}} (318d). Protagoras begins his discourse {{with the statement that}} a good Sophist can make his students into good citizens. [...] Socrates says that this is fine and good, but that he personally believes that this is not feasible since virtue cannot be taught (319b). He adds that technical thinking (technē) can be imparted to students by teachers, but that wisdom cannot be. By way of example, Socrates points to the fact that while in matters concerning specialised labour one would only take advice from the appropriate specialist, like for example builders (τέκτονες) about construction, in matters of state everyone's opinions is considered, which proves that political virtue is within everyone, or that at least that is what Athenians in their democratic ideals believe. Another example is that Pericles did not manage to impart his wisdom to his sons (319e). Socrates' uses a similar example in the Meno. He then adds that Clinias, younger brother of Alcibiades, was taken from the family for fear that Alcibiades would corrupt him, and he was given back as a hopeless case. Socrates <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> give more examples, but thinks his point is sufficiently established.|$|E
