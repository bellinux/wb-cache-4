60|$|That {{the house}} of the forest of Lebanon was a house significant, I think is clear; also, if it had not, we should not have had so {{particular}} an account thereof in the holy Word of God: I read but of four buildings wherein, in a particular manner, the houses or fabrics are, as to their manner of building, distinctly handled. The tabernacle is one, the temple another; the porch which he built for his throne, his throne for judgment; and this house of the forest of Lebanon is the fourth. Now the three first, to wit, the tabernacle, the temple, the porch and throne, wise men will say are typical; and therefore <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

6000|$|I {{will give}} thee a {{pertinent}} instance. In Deuteronomy 22, thou mayest read of a betrothed damsel, one betrothed to her beloved, {{one that had}} given him her heart and mouth, as thou hast given thyself to Christ; yet was she met with as she walked in the field, by one that forced her, because he was stronger than she. Well, what judgment now doth God, the righteous judge, pass upon the damsel for this? [...] "The man only that lay with her," [...] saith God, [...] "shall die. But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; {{there is in the}} damsel no sin worthy of death. For, as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> matter; for he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her" [...] (Deut 22:25-27).|$|E

The Lord have mercy upon you for this your crime! Mine was the sin. Mine should be the guilt. Oh, my God, my God! Is this just, in my old age, to pour down this fire of punishment upon my bowed head? Have I not suffered and done penance--ay, until I had even thought that I had won for myself peace and rest and forgiveness? Was it a sin to think <b>so?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> my punishment?
