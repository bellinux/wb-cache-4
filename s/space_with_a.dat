5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter <b>space</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in <b>space</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began {{over most}} of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office <b>space,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four research papers. In the first paper we study whether certain properties of sets (functions) are separably determined. In our results we use the "method of elementary submodels". In the second paper we generalize some results concerning Valdivia compacta (equivalently <b>spaces</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> commutative retractional skeleton) to the context of <b>spaces</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> retractional skeleton (not necessarily commutative). The third paper further studies the structure of <b>spaces</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> projectional (resp. retractional) skeleton. Under certain conditions we prove {{the existence of a}} "simultaneous projectional skeleton" and we use this result to prove other statements concerning the structure of <b>spaces</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> projectional (resp. retractional) skeleton. In the last paper we study the method of elementary submodels in a greater detail and we compare it with the "method of rich families". ...|$|R
