25|$|In May 1930 the {{prototype}} PZL.2 was shown by Bolesław Orliński at air meeting in Brno, where it impressed viewers with <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> and minimal speed. After being {{fitted with a}} rear machine gun, it was shown at Paris Air Show in December 1930.|$|E
25|$|The XT-37 was aerodynamically clean, {{so much so}} that a speedbrake {{was fitted}} behind the {{nosewheel}} doors to help increase drag for landing and for use in other phases of flight. Since the <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> gear placed the engine air intakes close to the ground, screens pivoted over the intakes from underneath when the landing gear was extended, to prevent foreign object damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{wide track}} and a {{steerable}} nosewheel made the aircraft {{easy to handle}} on the ground, and the <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} simple to maintain, with more than 100 access panels and doors. An experienced ground crew could change an engine in about half an hour.|$|E

50|$|SATS (Short Airfield for Tactical Support) was {{a related}} test {{programme}} where F-104G aircraft were catapult launched from <b>short</b> <b>land</b> strips and recovered using arrestor gear, test launches {{were carried out}} at Lakehurst and Lechfeld in 1966.|$|R
25|$|When Caproni had {{completed}} initial testing, the Regia Aeronautica {{took control of}} the plane and transferred it to Guidonia Montecelio for a brief series of further test flights. All test pilots reported that the plane was extremely stable in flight, {{to the point where it}} was difficult to change course; test pilots were also astounded by the very low landing speed and the consequently very <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> run.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{produced}} in 1929–1930 and a scale-model of the aircraft was tested in the wind-tunnel. The prototype {{was built on the}} factory's own initiative and first flew in late 1930 in Biała Podlaska, piloted by Franciszek Rutkowski. In 1931 it was tested in the Aviation Technical Research Institute (ITBL) in Warsaw. It was evaluated as much better than the PWS-5, with better performance, good handling and a <b>short</b> <b>landing.</b> However, the aircraft was not produced, because the Polish Air Force had just ordered a production of the Lublin R-XIII aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The station's only {{entrance}} and exit is a station {{house at the}} center of the plaza. It has a token booth, turnstile bank, and a staircase leading to a <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> above both platforms that separate into two staircases facing the opposite directions going down to the platforms themselves. The station house was renovated in 1988, which included installation of white tiles and a stained-glass artwork titled Transit Skylight by David Wilson. The station house is located on Newkirk Avenue's south side between East 15th and East 16th Streets.|$|E

25|$|The 10 May 1962 {{armistice}} limited RLAF operations, {{with the}} T-6s becoming non-operational, although Lao aviation cadets were forwarded to Lopburi, Thailand for T-28 training in June 1962. However, during the truce, Vang Pao used his CIA supported Hmong army of hilltribesmen to begin grubbing out <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> strips {{to be used}} for logistical support of his troops by helicopters and STOL aircraft. These tiny primitive air strips would proliferate throughout Laos and became a major component of the Royalist war effort; they would eventually be approximately 200 of these so-called Lima Sites. They would be essential for resupply, quick aerial movement of troops, and refugee relief operations.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1972, at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, {{after making}} a {{successful}} jump, he tried {{to come to a}} quick stop because of a <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> area. Knievel reportedly suffered a broken back and a concussion after getting thrown off and run over by his motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson. Knievel returned to jumping in November 1973, where he successfully jumped over 50 stacked cars at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For 35 years, Knievel held the record for successfully jumping the most stacked cars on a Harley-Davidson XR-750 (the record was broken in October 2008). His historic XR-750 is now part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Made of steel, aluminum and fiberglass, the customized motorcycle weighs about 300 pounds.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Saab {{finalized}} the aerodynamic {{design of}} the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted double delta wing with a small, high-set canard foreplane, equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged {{to be the best}} means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a thrust reverser enabled the sought <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> performance.|$|E

500|$|A {{little known}} third {{airborne}} operation, Operation Niwi, was also conducted on 10 May in southern Belgium. The objectives {{of this operation}} was to land two companies of the 3rd battalion Grossdeutschland Infantry Regiment by Fi 156 aircraft at Nives and [...] {{in the south of}} the country, in order to clear a path for the 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions which were advancing through the Belgian–Luxembourg Ardennes. The original plan called for the use of Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, but the <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> capability of the Fi 156 (27metres) saw 200 of these aircraft used in the assault.

2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{landings}} {{are done}} by touching all three wheels {{down at the}} same time in a three-point landing. This method does allow the <b>shortest</b> <b>landing</b> distance but can be difficult to carry out in crosswinds, as rudder control may be reduced severely before the tailwheel can become effective.|$|R

50|$|The LAR fleet is {{expanded}} to include a Cessna Citation Mustang, an aircraft to be primarily used for the organ team transportation activities.

50|$|The unique {{capabilities}} of the C-7 for <b>short</b> <b>landing</b> and takeoff made Caribou transports absolutely vital to the war effort.

5000|$|Terrain: this is {{especially}} a factor for eventers as they ride combinations cross-country.
