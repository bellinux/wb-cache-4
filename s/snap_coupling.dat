50|$|Professor Per-Ingvar Brånemark {{discovered}} osseointegration in the 1950s {{which allows}} titanium implants to fuse with human bone. The discovery led to wide use in dental implants. In the mid-1970s Brånemark, {{together with his}} ENT colleague Dr Anders Tjellström, glued an Oticon bone vibrator to a <b>snap</b> <b>coupling</b> fitted to a dental implant and then connected it to an audiometer. The patient reported a very high, clear sound. It was obvious that the sound propagated very well through {{the bones of the}} maxilla to the inner ear. This became the starting point for the future development of the hearing device Baha together with the titanium implant.|$|E
40|$|Bone {{conduction}} is {{the process}} by which an acoustic signal vibrates the skull bones to stimulate the cochlea. Patients with pure conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and single sided deafness are sometimes poorly rehabilitated by conventional air conduction hearing aids due to for example the functionality losses in the middle ear. With these hearing impairments, the cochlea may function perfectly and a bone conduction hearing device can transmit the sound signal more efficiently to the cochlea. Today, the percutaneous bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is an important alternative for such individuals. This device uses a percutaneous <b>snap</b> <b>coupling</b> together with a bone anchored implant to transmit the sound vibrations to the skull bone and has proven to offer very good hearing rehabilitation. However, such a system with permanent skin penetration requires a life-long commitment of care every day, may cause skin infections, and there is a risk for implant damage due to trauma and hence improvements are called for in these aspects. A novel bone conduction implant (BCI) device is designed {{as an alternative to the}} percutaneous BAHA device, because it leaves the skin intact. The BCI device provides a specific hearing aid digital signal processor, and analog signal processing parts. By applying amplitude modulation technique, the sound signal is transmitted to a permanently implanted transducer via an inductive link system through the intact skin. An efficient wireless power and data transmission system for the BCI device has been designed and implemented. Maximum power output (MPO) of the BCI was designed to occur at 4 mm skin thickness. The power output variability for 1 to 8 mm skin thickness variations was within 1. 5 dB. Maximum MPO was found to be 109 dB relative to 1 μN at transducer resonance frequency. This implant system consumes 14. 6 mA of battery current at 1 kHz at 65 dB input sound pressure level. It was also found that the gain headroom improvement with the BCI versus the BAHA was in the range of 10 - 30 dB, if the mechanical output of the devices were normalized at the cochlear level...|$|E

The engine may not quit the rails, or it may bound off alone, <b>snap</b> the <b>coupling</b> chains and leave the {{carriages}} to run until they come to a gradual standstill; or, the concussion may be so modified that no serious injury may result; or, should it come to the worst, the traveller may be among the fortunate number who make [...] "miraculous escapes." [...] But if a crank of an aerial machine should snap while it is careering through space, or even a screw get loose and cause a momentary stoppage of the motor, it is abundantly evident that escape from total and swift destruction would be [...] "miraculous" [...] indeed, for the whole affair would come to the ground like a thunderbolt, and [...] "leave not a wrack behind!" ...|$|R
40|$|Patients who are {{suffering}} from conductive hearing loss, single sided deafness and mixed hearing loss, cannot be rehabilitated by conventional air conduction hearing aids due to the functionality losses in the middle ear. Since in these hearing impairments, the cochlea functions perfectly, a bone conduction hearing aid is used for transmitting sound data to the cochlea. Today, percutaneous Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) is an important alternative for such individuals. These devices use a percutaneous <b>snap</b> <b>coupling</b> and bone anchored implant that incurs skin infections, requires a life-long commitment of care every day, {{and there is a}} risk for implant damage due to trauma. A novel Bone Conduction Implant (BCI) system is designed {{as an alternative to the}} percutaneous system, because, it leaves the skin intact. The BCI system comprises digital and analog signal processing units and applying amplitude modulation technique, sound information is transmitted to a permanently implanted transducer via an inductive link system through the intact skin. A coupling insensitive efficient inductive power and data link is designed that can deliver maximum force output to the transducer. The BCI system uses a 1. 3 volt standard hearing aid battery that provides power to the entire electronics and the transducer. In the process of designing and implementing the electronics of the BCI, the most critical, challenging and interesting focus is to have a very high efficiency system. Using ultra low power low voltage electronics circuit design and implementation with matured technologies, the power dissipation can be reduced and the whole device will be high efficient and the battery lifetime will be increased. The power amplifier design is another important part of the electronics that must be designed very efficiently. The proposed high efficiency switching power amplifiers are Class-D and Class- E. Studying and designing an application-specific integrated circuit for BCI system that covers all the demands on the power and efficiency is the main goal of this project. This Project has been divided into two different parts. In the first Part, Two different prototypes which use Class-D and Class-E as their Power Amplifier have been designed and implemented. The results proved Class-D amplifier as a better topology for this specific application with current consumption bellow 4 mA which is significantly lower than 22 mA which is consumed by Class-E for similar RF load. Spartan 3 board has been used as FPGA board to produce Clock signal and Pulse-density-Modulation (PDM) to Pulse-Width- Modulation conversion. In the second part, integrated version of proved circuit was designed in 0. 35 um Standard CMOS Technology and it was submitted for fabrication in SOIC 20 standard die frame...|$|E
