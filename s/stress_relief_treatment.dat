40|$|Abstract – The {{practice}} of tempering for stress relief before cryogenic thermal treatment in an AISI D 2 tool steel {{has been shown}} to stabilize the retained austenite, nullifying the effect of cryogenic treatment The practice simultaneously enhances the wear resistance of the steel after complete thermal cycling (quench + stress relief + cryogenic treatment + double temper). Cryogenic treatment {{has been shown to}} have a large effect on the properties of heat treated steels, especially tool steels. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of some parts it is necessary to do a prior stress relief heat treatment to avoid cracks and catastrophic failures. In previous work [1] it was verified that the <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> stabilizes the austenite even when the sample is submerged in liquid nitrogen. The literature [2] suggests that there is a C-curve kinetic behavior for the austenite to martensite transformation at temperatures lower than Ms. In order to confirm those previous work results[1] and test the hypothesis of a C-curve behavior, samples from an AISI D 2 tool steel bar were austenitized at 1040 °C for 40 minutes and then quenched in oil.

40|$|Manufacturing of {{aero engine}} {{components}} requires attention to residual stress and final {{shape of the}} product in order to meet high quality product standards. This sets very high demands on involved manufacturing steps to meet design requirements. Simulation of manufacturing processes can therefore be animportant tool to contribute to quality assurance. The focus in this work is on simulation of a manufacturing process chain comprising of sheet metal forming, welding and a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment.</b> Simulation of sheet metal forming can be used to design a forming tool design that accounts for the material behaviour, e. g. spring back, and avoid problems such as wrinkling, thinning and cracking. Moreover, the simulation can also show how the material is stretched and work hardened. The residual stresses after forming may be of local character or global depending on the shape that is formed. However, the heat affected zone due to welding is located near the weld. The weld also causes large residual stresses with the major component along the weld. It is found that the magnitude of the residual stresses after welding is affected by remaining stresses from the previous sheet metal forming. The final stress relieve treatment will relax these residual stresses caused by e. g. forming and welding. However, this causes additional deformations. The main focus of this study is on how a manufacturing process step affects the subsequent step when manufacturing a component of the nickel-based super alloy 718. The chosen route and geometry is a simplified leading edge of an exhaust case guide vane. The simulations were validated versus experiments. The computed deformations were compared with measurements after each manufacturing step. The overall agreement between experiments and measurement was good. However, not sufficiently accurate considering the required tolerance of the component. It was found from simulations that the residual stresses after each process affects the subsequent step.

40|$|The High-Speed Research (HSR) Airfoil Alloy program {{developed}} fourth-generation single-crystal superalloys {{with up to}} an 85 F {{increase in}} creep rupture capability over current production airfoil alloys. Recent results have been generated at the NASA Glenn Research Center on these fourth-generation alloys, but in coated form, for subsonic turbine blade applications under NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program. One goal for UEET is to optimize the airfoil alloy/thermal barrier coating system for 3100 F turbine inlet temperatures. The state-of-the art turbine blade airfoil system consists of a superalloy single crystal that provides the basic mechanical performance of the airfoil. A thermal barrier coating is used to reduce {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a bondcoat is deposited between the base material and the thermal barrier coating. The bondcoat improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and improves the spallation resistance of the thermal barrier coating. A commercial platinum aluminide bondcoat was applied to the HSR-developed alloys, and a diffusion zone developed as a result of interaction between the bondcoat and the superalloy. Optimized strength is obtained for superalloys when the refractory element content is high and the limits of microstructural stability are approached or exceeded slightly. For fourthgeneration alloys, instability leads to the formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases, which form internally in the superalloy, and a secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which forms under the diffusion zone. There was a concern that excessive quantities of either TCP or SRZ might decrease the mechanical properties of the superalloy, with SRZ thought to be particularly detrimental and its formation unpredictable. Thus, an SRZreduction effort was initiated in the NASA UEET Program so that methods developed during the HSR project could be optimized further to reduce or eliminate the SRZ. An SRZ is a three-phase constituent composed of TCP and stringers of gamma phase in a matrix of gamma prime. An incoherent grain boundary separates the SRZ from the gammagamma prime microstructure of the superalloy. The SRZ is believed to form as a result of local chemistry changes in the superalloy due to the application of the diffusion aluminide bondcoat. Locally high surface stresses also appear to promote the formation of the SRZ. Thus, techniques that change the local alloy chemistry or reduce surface stresses have been examined for their effectiveness in reducing SRZ. These SRZ-reduction steps are performed on the test specimen or the turbine blade before the bondcoat is applied. Stressrelief heat treatments developed at NASA Glenn have been demonstrated to reduce significantly the amount of SRZ that develops during subsequent high-temperature exposures. Stress-relief heat treatments reduce surface stresses by recrystallizing a thin surface layer of the superalloy. However, in alloys with very high propensities to form SRZ, stress relief heat treatments alone do not eliminate SRZ entirely. Thus, techniques that modify the local chemistry under the bondcoat have been emphasized and optimized successfully at Glenn. One such technique is carburization, which changes the local chemistry by forming submicron carbides near the surface of the superalloy. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the depth and uniform distribution of these carbides are enhanced when a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> and an appropriate surface preparation are employed in advance of the carburization treatment. Even in alloys that have the propensity to develop a continuous SRZ layer beneath the diffusion zone, the SRZ has been completely eliminated or reduced to low, manageable levels when this combination of techniques is utilized. Now that the techniques to mitigate SRZ have been established at Glenn, TCP phase formation is being emphasized in ongoing work under the UEET Program. The limitsf stability of the fourth-generation alloys with respect to TCP phase formation are currently being defined along with high-temperature creep rupture properties. In addition, a regression model is being developed at Glenn for the prediction of the presence of TCP phase in the microstructure and SRZ under the diffusion zone. The model is based on a design-of-experiments methodology with emphasis on the potential synergistic effects of alloying elements...|$|E
40|$|As each {{production}} process introduces residual stresses in the material, cold-rolled steel tubes are not delivered stress-free. The motivation o f this research {{can be traced}} back to the laser cutting of tubes. During the cutting process, residual stresses are relieved, which causes defor mation of the tube and a reduction of the precision of cut. Residual str esses also play a role in stress corrosion and sudden collapse of tubula r structures. This work concentrates on the residual stresses in cold-rolled steel tub es due to the welding process. Insight into the origin, influencing para meters, distribution and magnitude is gained with a finite element (FE) simulation of the welding process. An FE model allows for the visualisat ion of these aspects in the entire tube. A welding simulation requires t he quantification of numerous input parameters: thermal and thermomechan ical material properties (and their evolution at elevated temperatures), thermal and mechanical boundary conditions, and a model for the heat-in put of the welding torch. The simulation is split up into a thermal anal ysis which calculates the temperature field in the tube during the weldi ng and subsequent cooling and a thermomechanical simulation which calcul ates the deformation and stress. Since welding simulations require an appropriate value for numerous para meters, validation of the simulation results is of utmost importance. Fo r this purpose, a laboratory setup which allows measuring the temperatur es and deformations during the welding of the tube is built. The tempera tures are measured with 5 thermocouples. The deformation is measured wit h strain gauges and the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Although DIC has some advantages over other techniques measuring deforma tions during welding, to the author's knowledge it is the first time tha t DIC is used in a welding application. First, it is investigated whethe r it is possible to measure the thermal expansion of the types of stainl ess steel used in this work (austenitic SS 304 and ferritic SS 409) on 3 D objects. It is shown that this is possible up to 600 &# 176;C. From these measu rements the thermal expansion coefficient is determined, and this is use d as input in the thermomechanical simulations. Although the strain that occurs in the welding is rather small compared to common DIC applicatio ns, the strain evolution during the welding and subsequent cooling of th e tube can be recognised easily. These strain evolutions are in agreemen t with the strain evolution measured with the strain gauges. Strain gaug es have in this application the disadvantage that the measured strain mu st be compensated for the actual material temperature, which makes their result dependent on this temperature measurement. In the thermal simulation, the predicted temperature field is brought in agreement with the measured temperature field. For this purpose, the va lue of three poorly known input parameters was optimised: (i) the effici ency of the welding process; (ii) the actual room temperature around the setup; and (iii) the convection film coefficient. This procedure result s in physically acceptable values for these parameters. The difference b etween the measured and the simulated temperature curves at the thermoco uple points is minimised, but they are certainly not yet coincident, whi ch is directly reflected in the simulated strain evolutions. In the thermomechanical simulation, the thermal field is combined with t he thermal dilatation of the material to calculate the stress and strain evolution during the welding process. The tube in the experiments was s ubjected to a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> before the experiment was started and also the simulations start from a stress-free tube. The simulated st rain evolutions are compared with the measured ones. The residual stress profile in the middle section of the tube is compared to an X-ray diffr action residual stress measurement. A sensitivity analysis shows that pa rameter variations are visible in both the strain evolution and in the r esidual stress profile. Validating the simulations with the strain evolu tion is preferred to a residual stress measurement as in this way the wh ole process is checked and not just the final state. The methodology developed for a SS 304 tube with a diameter of 60 mm and w all thickness of 1. 5 mm is applied to a SS 409 tube with a diameter of 60 m m and wall thickness of 2 mm. Especially the larger heat input and the lo wer thermal expansion coefficient define this case study. The results ar e similar to the SS 304 tube, but a better material characterisation of t he SS 409 steel is necessary to improve the results. Finally, the effect of an initial residual stress field on the strain ev olution during and the residual stress after the welding is investigated. For that reason the stress/strain state inferred from exploratory roll ing simulations was implemented as initial field in the welding simulati ons. From these simulations it is concluded that the final residual stre ss pattern is mainly determined by the welding process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} (THF) is a {{well established}} process in the automotive industry and its application is being extended to the aerospace for manufacturing complex geometries. However, most of the alloys used in aerospace are high in strength and low in formability, which renders the application of THF more challenging. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a method to increase the formability of an austenitic stainless steel. A multistep forming process was simulated through interrupted uniaxial tensile testing experiments to study the influence of the latter process on formability. The tensile test was divided into several deformation steps with a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> after each forming step. The results indicated that the application of intermediate heat treatments considerably increased the formability of the stainless steel 321 alloy (SS 321). Microstructure evolution as a function of deformation or heat treatment parameters was also investigated and revealed the formation of strain-induced martensite after the first deformation and heat treatment cycle without any deleterious effect on formability enhancement.

A detailed examination has been carried out of the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of samples of T 91 and T 92 steels which have been subjected to both a 'normal' pre-service heat treatment and an extended <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> at 765 °C for up to 16 hours. The samples have subsequently been creep tested to failure at different stresses ranging from 66 to 112 MPa. In each case, a reduction in rupture time was observed of 20 - 30 % in the samples which had experienced the additional <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> compared to those which had not. It is shown that these data, when compared with the mean values expected from European Creep Collaborative Committee (ECCC) Datasheets, result in a reduction in stress of approximately 10 % of the mean value predicted from the ECCC data, which is within the allowable scatter band. In order to investigate the reasons behind this reduction in life, extensive analyses have been carried out using a range of advanced electron microscopy techniques. In particular, imaging using both ion and electron beams in combination with image analysis methods have been used to provide a rapid and accurate technique for quantifying the particle size distributions of the M C carbides and also the Laves phase, which was found only in the T 92 samples. Electron backscatter diffraction techniques have also been used to quantify the changes occurring in the martensitic matrix with respect to the nature and length of the grain boundaries and the grain size distribution. The effect of the additional heat treatment on microstructural evolution is to coarsen the secondary phase particle distribution and enhance matrix recovery before the steel enters service, {{to the detriment of the}} hardness and creep fracture life. It is also demonstrated that there is a significant effect of applied stress on the particle size distributions and matrix recovery during creep testing.

40|$|An {{optimized}} carburization {{treatment has}} been developed to mitigate instabilities that form in the microstructures of advanced turbine airfoil materials. Current turbine airfoils consist of a single crystal superalloy base that provides the mechanical performance of the airfoil, a thermal barrier coating (TBC) that reduces {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a bondcoat between the superalloy and the TBC, that improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and the spallation resistance of the TBC. Advanced nickel-base superalloys containing high levels of refractory metals have been observed to develop an instability called secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which can form beneath diffusion aluminide bondcoats. This instability between the superalloy and the bondcoat has the potential of reducing the mechanical properties of thin-wall turbine airfoils. Controlled gas carburization treatments combined with a prior <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> and adequate surface preparation have been utilized effectively to minimize the formation of SRZ. These additional processing steps are employed before the aluminide bondcoat is deposited and are believed to change the local chemistry and local stresses of the surface of the superalloy. This paper presents the detailed processing steps used to reduce SRZ between platinum aluminide bondcoats and advanced single crystal superalloys...|$|R
40|$|The metal {{additive}} manufacturing industry is rising {{and so is}} the interest in new lattice structures with unique mechanical properties. Many studies have already investigated lattice structures with different geometries and their influence on mechanical properties, but {{little is known about the}} effect of specific processing characteristics that are inherent to metal {{additive manufacturing}}. Therefore this study investigates the effect of two crucial steps in the manufacturing process: the build orientation selection and heat treatment. In total the microstructure and static mechanical properties of five different orientations and three heat treatment conditions were evaluated using Ti 6 Al 4 V diamond like lattice structures. The results show a significant decrease in mechanical strength for samples that are built diagonally and a transformation of the microstructure after a HIP (hot isostatic pressing) treatment, resulting in a lower maximum strength, but higher ductility. In general, horizontal struts should be avoided during manufacturing, unless the applied load after manufacturing can be properly supported by other struts. Both a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> and a HIP treatment can be used in statically loaded applications, whereas a HIP treatment is believed to be beneficial for dynamically loaded applications. This study enables an appropriate selection of build orientation and heat treatment of lattice structures for different applications. status: publishe...|$|R
