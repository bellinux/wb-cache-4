5|$|Despite heavy loss of form, {{which also}} saw the team fall outside the top ten in the FIFA rankings, Croatia {{were placed in the}} top tier of teams for the UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} draw; Croatia was previously a candidate to co-host the tournament with Hungary which would have allowed the team to qualify automatically, but UEFA eventually chose Poland and Ukraine as hosts instead. Despite being top-seeds in their qualifying group, Croatia finished second behind Greece, <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> a play-off against Euro 2008 rivals Turkey. Croatia proceeded to beat Turkey 3–0 on aggregate, with all three goals coming in the away leg in Istanbul, thereby qualifying for the 2012 European championship. In the proceeding group-stage draw for the tournament, Croatia were placed in the third tier of teams, and were eventually grouped with Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, von Neumann {{became a}} {{commissioner}} of the AEC. He accepted this position {{and used it to}} further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, {{which turned out to be}} the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.|$|E

5|$|Murray next competed at the London 2012 Summer Olympics in singles, doubles, {{and mixed}} doubles. He partnered his brother Jamie Murray in doubles and {{suffered}} a first-round exit to Austria (Jürgen Melzer and Alexander Peya) in three sets. In the mixed doubles, Murray was partnered by Laura Robson. They {{made it all}} the way to the finals where they lost to the Belarusian top seeds (Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi) in three sets, <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> the silver medal. In singles, Murray lost only one set on his way to the finals where he met Federer, defeating him in straight sets, for the loss of just 7 games. By winning the Olympic gold medal, Murray became the first British man to win the Olympic singles gold medal in tennis since Josiah Ritchie in 1908, and only the 7th man in the open era to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Peggy Rockman {{had three}} older sisters, {{all of whom}} married Jampu Jakamarra, to whom Peggy herself would also later be married. Her family first settled {{alongside}} white Australians — a couple mining gold in the Tanami Desert — when she was aged between six and eight. While still a child herself, she worked caring for the mining family's children, during which time she became a proficient English speaker. After the mine was abandoned, Peggy Rockman's family returned to a nomadic existence in the region, before <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> a time at a pastoral station called Gordon Downs. Around 1952, the family {{was taken by the}} government's Native Affairs Branch to a new settlement called Lajamanu, in the central desert west of Tennant Creek, Northern Territory. There, Peggy Rockman was required to work full-time in the settlement's kitchens, being paid with meals, and occasionally also with rations. At the settlement, she had three children with Jampu Jakamarra.|$|E
5|$|The Greco-Persian Wars {{had their}} roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in {{particular}} Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city. While Greek states {{had in the past}} often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|The {{music hall}} and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible {{because of its}} large red {{imitation}} windmill on its roof, and became {{the birthplace of the}} dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} the Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived outside the village of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach rumbled into the village, {{although}} the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, {{and in the end}} the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. <b>Settling</b> <b>for</b> the night, they prepared to engage the next day.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the second quarter, Appalachian State ran another six plays, ending the drive with a nine-yard {{touchdown}} pass by Edwards to Hans Batichon. The extra point again evened the score, this time at 14–14. Michigan was forced into a three-and-out and had to punt the ball, with Appalachian State starting their next drive at the Michigan 37. On the fifth play of the next drive, the Mountaineers scored a touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Edwards to Jackson. The Mountaineers converted the extra point attempt, giving them the lead at 21–14. Michigan began their next drive at their 20-yard line, and drove down to the Appalachian State 40-yard line in four plays. Their next play, a Brandon Minor run for five yards, was followed by a Minor run for no yards and an incomplete pass. The Wolverines opted to go for it on fourth down but failed to convert, turning the ball over to Appalachian State. The following Mountaineer drive featured nine running plays in a row, the last a six-yard run by Edwards for a touchdown. The extra point was successful, increasing the Mountaineer lead and making the score 28–14. Michigan returned the next kickoff to their 32-yard line, with 2:15 left on the clock. The Wolverines drove to the Appalachian five-yard line, ultimately <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> a field goal with 23seconds left, cutting Appalachian State's lead to eleven points.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, both teams had more {{offensive}} success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown {{four and a}} half minutes into the third quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16–0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16–0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16–6 after a missed two-point conversion. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over twominutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16–13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an onside kick in hopes of having a chance for a game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, and ran out the clock.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{fell behind}} early after Cordarrelle Patterson's 105-yard kickoff {{return for a}} touchdown. Devin Hester {{attempted}} to respond on the ensuing kickoff, but was pushed out of bounds at the Vikings' 32-yard line. The Bears fought back with a one-yard touchdown pass by Jay Cutler to Martellus Bennett, which Chicago added to with Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. In the second quarter, Jared Allen stripped the ball from Cutler, and Brian Robison returned the fumble 61 {{yards for a touchdown}} with 7:34 to go in the half. Afterwards, Hester returned the kickoff 80 yards to Minnesota's 23-yard line. The Bears offense later reached Minnesota's one-yard line, but Cutler had his pass intercepted by Kevin Williams in the end zone for a touchback. The Vikings failed to capitalize on the turnover after Tim Jennings intercepted Christian Ponder and scored on a 44-yard interception return. Minnesota retaliated with Ponder's 20-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 1:11 remaining, and the half ended with the Bears <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> a field goal. In the second half, the Vikings scored two field goals from Blair Walsh to take the 30–24 lead. However, the Bears scored on Cutler's 16-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, and ultimately prevailed after recovering a fumbled squib kick.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

Nasr set the early pace in Group B before <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> ninth and Frijns rounded out the top ten. Ericcson was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best time of one minute and 22.349 seconds was 1.208 seconds off Cecotto's pace. Ericsson paced Group B early on but was demoted as the session progressed. He was {{followed}} by Sergio Canamasas in 12th and Rossi in 13th place. Coletti was another Group B early pace setter but ended up starting from 14th position. Haryanto qualified in 15th but was demoted ten places on the grid for causing an avoidable accident at the previous round {{of the season in}} Catalunya. As a result Nathanaël Berthon inherited the place and was followed by Calado. Richelmi and Daniël de Jong filled the next two placings and 20th place qualifier René Binder was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Canamasas during the session. Giovesi thus started from Binder's qualifying position with Daniel Abt joining him on the grid's tenth row. Simon Trummer and Jake Rosenzweig clinched the 22nd and 23rd positions. Lancaster started from 24th after spinning his car at Sainte Dévote turn necessitating yellow flags to be waved in the area. The final position in the field was taken by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs whose fastest time was 2.2 seconds slower than Cecotto.|$|E
