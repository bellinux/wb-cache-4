5|$|Country singer Taylor Swift's Fearless had {{the longest}} run among the {{releases}} that have reached peak position in 2008, spending 11 non-consecutive weeks {{beginning with the}} issue dated November 29 and continuing into the 2009 chart year. She is the only singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the Billboard200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth {{on the list of}} solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in Billboard history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, <b>Sleep</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Static, and Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: Juno, Mamma Mia! and Twilight.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E

In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.|$|E

50|$|She comes upon {{a castle}} where the prince {{is to be}} married, and takes {{a job as a}} maid. One night she cracks nut and finds inside it a dress. She finds that each nut holds a dress and each dress is more {{beautiful}} than the last. The prince's bride asks to buy the first dress, but instead the princess offers a trade. In exchange for the dress, she will be allowed to spend one night in the prince's room. That night the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink so that he <b>sleeps</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night and the princess cannot reveal to him who she is. She weeps and the servants overhear. The second night the princess makes the same bargain with the bride but again the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink so that he <b>sleeps</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night. As the princess weeps, the servants again hear. On the third night the princess trades the last dress for a chance {{to spend the night in}} the prince's room. Again the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink but this time the servants have told the prince of the princess' sorrowful pleas, and he does not drink. When the princess begins to weep, he reveals that he is awake and knows that she is his true love.|$|R

It was recorded using 100% solar energy at the Solar-Powered Plastic Plant studio in Los Angeles.

25|$|By {{the time}} infants reach {{the age of}} two, their brain size has reached 90 percent of an adult-sized brain; a {{majority}} of this brain growth has occurred {{during the period of}} life with the highest rate of sleep. The hours that children spend asleep influence their ability to perform on cognitive tasks. Children who <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night and have few night waking episodes have higher cognitive attainments and easier temperaments than other children.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{is active}} in the ecology and {{sustainability}} movement, often with an ocean-centric focus. Johnson and wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and the Kōkua Hawaii Foundation. In 2008 Johnson adopted the concept of greening (reduce and reuse), and donated 100% of the proceeds of the <b>Sleep</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> Static tour to the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation. Similarly, the proceeds from the 2010 To the Sea album tour went to All At Once, a Johnson backed collaborative of greening charities promoting fan involvement.|$|E

25|$|Jack Hody Johnson (born May 18, 1975) is a singer-songwriter, musician, actor, record producer, {{documentary}} filmmaker and {{a former}} professional surfer from the United States.

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, {{and that they should}} not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
25|$|The Crucible is {{the final}} test in recruit training, and {{represents}} the culmination {{of all of the}} skills and knowledge a Marine should possess. Designed in 1996 to emphasize the importance of teamwork in overcoming adversity, the Crucible is a rigorous 54-hour field training exercise demanding the application of everything a recruit has learned until that point in recruit training and includes a total of 48 miles of marching. It simulates typical combat situations with strenuous testing, hardship and the deprivation of food and sleep. Two recruits are given three MREs (a self-contained, individual field ration), each usually taking one, then splitting the third up how ever is agreeable between the two. The recruits are only allowed six hours of <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire 54-hour event. Recruits are broken into squad-sized teams (possibly smaller) and placed under the charge of one drill instructor. West Coast recruits are returned to Edson Range for the Crucible. Parris Island recruits will conduct the Crucible in the derelict Page Airfield on {{the south end of the}} depot.|$|E

5000|$|Ferber method founder Richard Ferber, MD, Director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital Boston, concurs with Baby Wise {{regarding}} {{some of its}} sleep advice, but {{he warns}} against expecting too much. Baby Wise predicts that the 8-week-old child will be sleeping 7 to 8 hours in a row at night, and the 13-week-old child increasing the nighttime sleep period {{to as much as}} 11 hours. Ferber said, [...] "Parents shouldn't expect babies to sleep that long that early, although a very few will on their own". Ferber says that the book may frustrate parents of babies that are not sleeping so much; the parents may wonder what is wrong with the infant. Ferber says that if a baby <b>sleeps</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night, the parents may actually need to wake it for feeding.|$|R

500|$|Although {{not much}} is {{revealed}} about Stacy's early life, {{it is said}} in [...] "Acceptance" [...] {{that she is a}} Duke University graduate. Presumably ten years before the events of House, at a [...] "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [...] paintball game, she met Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) with whom she started a romantic relationship. Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an infarction in his right leg. He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After he was put into a chemically induced coma to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> worst of the pain, Stacy, his medical proxy at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, which caused their relationship to end.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous anecdotes is Seongcheol's Jangjwa Bulwa (Hangul: 장좌불와, Hanja: 長坐不臥). [...] Literally {{translated}} as 'long sitting, no lying,' it is a meditation technique that some monks employ to intensify their practice. [...] Sitting meditation is equivalent to most other practices, except that the practitioner does not lie down to sleep, but stays in the lotus position even during sleep, {{with the intention of}} minimizing <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> position. [...] Seongcheol was known to have practiced this for eight years after his enlightenment. [...] He reportedly never once lied down and denied sleeping at all.|$|E

2500|$|Dulness {{takes her}} throne, and Pope {{describes}} the allegorical tableau of her throne room. Science is chained beneath her foot-stool. Logic is gagged and bound. Wit has been exiled from her kingdom entirely. Rhetoric is stripped {{on the ground}} and tied by sophism. Morality is dressed in a gown that is bound by two cords, of furs (the ermines of judges) and lawn (the fabric of bishops sleeves), and at a nod from Dulness, her [...] "page" [...] (a notorious hanging judge named Page who had had over one hundred people executed) pulls both cords tight and strangles her. The Muses are bound in tenfold chains and guarded by Flattery and Envy. Only mathematics is free, because it is too insane to be bound. Nor, Pope says, could Chesterfield refrain from weeping upon seeing the sight (for Chesterfield had opposed the Licensing Act of 1737, which is the chaining of the Muses). Colley Cibber, however, slumbers, his head in Dulness's lap. (In a note, Pope says that it is proper for Cibber to <b>sleep</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole of Book IV, as he had had no part in the actions of book II, slept through book III, and therefore ought to go on sleeping.) ...|$|E
