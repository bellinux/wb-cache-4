5|$|A {{scene in}} the pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later. The inside of a surveillance van used in a few scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> set {{right next to the}} Grid set; using a set would be more manageable for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the Home Office and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the Home Office were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton.|$|E

5|$|Cast {{and crew}} began {{arriving}} in Florida on October 1, to shoot scenes on Dania Beach and around South Florida. That same day, Downey {{returned to the}} set after his ankle injury. In early October, scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> replica of the Malibu restaurant Neptune's Net, and filming took place on location at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Scenes were shot during the daytime inside the Miami Beach Resort at Miami Beach on October 10 and 11. The production returned to Wilmington in mid-October for additional filming. On November 1, scenes were shot at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{glass window}} {{on the front door}} of the Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action. The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjević was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. Šišić was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after {{being hit by a}} fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter. His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses, as well as Željava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft were flying to Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken a <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being the one who had fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months suspended prison sentence and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to pay a fine of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 to the victim for the wounds suffered to his ear.|$|E
5|$|Raimi {{was able}} to secure $1600 to produce the film. Raimi and Campbell {{collected}} a group of their friends and family {{who were interested in}} participating in the production of the film. The film was primarily <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> farm house belonging to one of Raimi's friends located in Marshall, Michigan. One of the regular actors involved with Raimi's early short films, Ellen Sandweiss, was cast as the film's protagonist. This decision stemmed from the notion that most horror films at the time involved female leads, who were more enjoyable to watch terrorized. The current boyfriend of Sandweiss was cast as the film's antagonist, a demon who threatens the cast. Campbell was cast as one of the protagonists, though he initially was not familiar with horror cinema and instead identified as a fan of comedies. One of the films that inspired Campbell's interest in the genre was John Carpenter's film Halloween. Another Raimi regular, Scott Spiegel, was also cast as a protagonist based on his prior collaborations with the group.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{principal}} photography {{was expected}} to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other technical requirements. He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in quicksand was <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E
5|$|Then 29-year-old Trinidad-born field athlete Cleopatra Borel-Brown {{participated in}} women's shot put on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf in Beijing. Previously an athlete and {{student of the}} University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Borel-Brown also participated for Trinidad and Tobago in the 2004 Athens Olympics. The {{qualifying}} round of the event, which took place on August 15, placed her in the second heat. She put the <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 17.96meters, placing her at seventh place out of the 17 heat athletes. Borel-Brown ranked behind the United States' Michelle Carter (18.49meters) and ahead of Italy's Assunta Legnante (17.76meters). The leaders of Borel-Brown's heat included China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Overall, Borel-Brown ranked 17th out of 33 ranking athletes. She did not progress to the final round.|$|E
5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|E

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with Vasiljković, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards Viduševac, where they <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to Viduševac.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E
