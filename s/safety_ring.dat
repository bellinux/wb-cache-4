50|$|Since {{a guerrilla}} force {{expects to have}} the {{population}} become increasingly loyal to it, there is an obvious psychological problem with leaving an area with active explosive devices.

The river process, sloop steep, joint and fault system are the most important geomorphologic information of the Soleghan road. Soleghan road have been studied in this view and thus provide information which take the basis of stability road. Every road in Iran or world can include one or some important process, so some information is needed. More than half of Iran and world roads have built about before 1970, when the geomorphologic education and research was in the early of stage. Therefore many of Iran and world roads such as Soleghan road havent built with new geomorphologic and basic information. Too more damages which in order to geomorphologic process exposed to roads, people and cars in Iran and world such as Soleghan road are increased. Many flood and slumps destroyed built roads, many people and cars, damage or crash to ignoring the geomorphologic information, thus if we use geomorphologic information in road building, damage and crashes will be decreased, so safety will be increase...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} service-oriented {{architectures}} (SOAs) has strongly facilitated {{the development and}} deployment of large-scale distributed (serviceoriented) applications. The middleware for orchestrating process-based applications that consist of several distributed services has to be inherently distributed as well, {{in order to provide}} a high degree of scalability and to avoid a single point of failure. Self-healing execution of such processes supported by a distributed middleware requires replicated control metadata and instance data of processes. Most importantly, replication has to be provided {{in a way that does}} not affect the adaptivity and elasticity behavior of the middleware for composite service execution. In this technical report, we introduce OSIRIS <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring,</b> a novel approach to fault-tolerant process execution. <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> is based on OSIRIS, a distributed and decentralized middleware for the execution of composite services. Essentially, the <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> exploits dedicated node monitors, organized in a self-organizing ring structure, for the replication of control data. Moreover, it leverages virtual stable storage for managing process instance data in a robust way. We present the architecture of OSIRIS’ <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> and discuss in detail the algorithms it applies for self-healing process execution. The performance evaluation shows that the additional gain in robustness has only marginal effects on the scalability characteristics of the system...|$|E
40|$|Workflows {{provide an}} {{easy to use}} {{programming}} model {{for the construction of}} complex services that are (recursively) composed of simpler services. When it comes to high performance workflow execution, the distribution (outscaling) of the constituent services of the workflow across an environment of computational nodes is a key concept and also a very straightforward advantage of the workflow paradigm. However, scalable workflow execution cannot only be provided by the distribution of services but also necessitates novel architectures for the workflow engine in charge of service orchestration. Even though workflow orchestration is commonly provided by centralized solutions, these architectures imply performance bottlenecks and single points of failure. Hence, the workflow engine has to be distributed as well, by efficiently replicating workflow metadata across several nodes in a network. A particular challenge stems from the requirement of providing scalable worflow execution that {{is at the same time}} also reliable. In this paper, we present OSIRIS-SR, a decentralized middleware for the distributed execution of workfows. It has particularly been designed to jointly provide a high degree of scalability and reliability. OSIRIS-SR locally leverages the concurrent and redundant Actor model for worflow processing, whereas globally OSIRIS-SR runs a number of scalable system services for the management of worflow metadata, with the <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> being the most prominent one. The <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> service features a self-healing node overlay for the purpose of active workflow instance supervision that serves at the same time as a scalable and reliable metadata storage. We discuss in detail the <b>Safety</b> <b>Ring</b> architecture and the mechanics behind the scalable and reliable worflow management in OSIRIS-SR. The evaluation results of OSIRIS-SR show that support for reliable workflow execution does not significantly impact the system's scalability characteristics...|$|E

This paper synthesizes these two algorithmic techniques thereby improving performance (responsiveness) of logical ring protocols. The parameterized technique preserves the <b>safety</b> properties of <b>ring</b> protocols and maintains high throughput in busy systems, while reducing the delay in lightly loaded systems from a linear to the logarithmic function in the number of processors.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{distribution}} {{is not at}} all easier with the progress of cloud computing, and an exact examination on the shared data offers a collection of profits both to the the public and individuals. Data distribution with a huge number of applicants must get into account numerous issues, counting effectiveness, data integrity and confidentiality of data owner. Ring signature is a capable applicant to build an unsigned and genuine data sharing system. It lets a data owner to secretly authenticate his data which can be set into the cloud for storage or scrutiny purpose. so far the expensive certificate authentication in the conventional public key infrastructure (PKI) surroundings becomes a restricted access for this solution to be scalable. Identity-based (ID-based) ring signature, which eradicates the method of certificate verification, can be utilized instead. In this paper, we additionally improve the <b>safety</b> of ID-based <b>ring</b> signature by giving advance security: If a secret key of any user has been compromise, all earlier produced signatures that contain this user still remains legal. This property is particularly significant to any huge scale data distribution system, since it is unfeasible to request all data owners to re-authenticate their data still if a secret key of one single user has been compromised. We offer an actual and well-organized instantiation of our scheme, demonstrate its safety and supply an accomplishment to illustrate its realism...|$|R

Methods: A total of 15 eyes of 15 patients with intractable neovascular glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 28  mmHg not responding to medical treatment were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had poor visual acuity and underwent Alahmady ring implantation. The ring was designed from fenestrated silicon tube used in lacrimal surgeries and was implanted subsclerally after passing it through the anterior chamber. Patients were followed up for at least 24  months. Success in this study was defined based on IOP ≥ 8  mmHg and < 21  mmHg, with not more than 1 glaucoma drug, and improvement of patient symptoms and signs with maximum use of beta blocker as antiglaucoma drug. Results: A total of 15 eyes of 15 patients (9 males [60 %] and 6 females [40 %]) were analyzed in this study. The mean IOP before surgery was 38. 6  mmHg (standard deviation [SD]: 6. 98) and it was 14. 05  mmHg (SD = 7. 57) after surgery. The follow-up range was 24 – 36  months. Success of silicon drainage device was defined as an IOP < 21  mmHg on the last follow-up visit. Medications included only beta-blockers and topical steroids for those who were without severe complications or for those who were not in a condition to undergo a further glaucoma surgery. Conclusion: Alahmady ring implantation proves to be a good surgical option for neovascular glaucoma; however, a longer follow-up period is recommended.

Furthermore, the project has provided education and training as scientists and practising engineers to a large group of PhD and MSc students. Research knowledge from the project has been implemented in models, such as Delft 3 D, and has enhanced the expertise of staff of Delft Cluster institutes. For instance, Jos Dijkman has been appointed, as the only foreigner, in an American review commission under the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, charged with the review of all post-Katrina studies by the Interagency Performance Evaluation Taskforce. Applied knowledge from the project has been used and disseminated in various ways. Optical glass fibre cables from work package A 1 provided the spinoff of a method to monitor groundwater upwelling at the toe of inner dike slopes. Consultancies (DHV, HKV) now routinely apply morphological models of work package A 2 to P KB Room for the River measures. Work package A 3 has established the probability of occurrence of super storm surges with greater accuracy by reconstructing storm-surge levels from the last 10, 000 years using novel deposit dating methods. Findings from work package B are to be incorporated in guidelines for flood defence design and evaluation, thus affecting the evaluations for the "Hydraulische Randvoorwaarden". The system behaviour identified and analyzed in work package C turns out to be so important for the overall <b>safety</b> of dike <b>rings,</b> that it will inevitably lead to the need of adopting a new safety philosophy on a short term.

The facility typically operates almost full year with one-month start-up period, 10 -month science program for experiments (with short accelerator physics studies and routine maintenance during the period of science program), and a month-long shutdown period. A typical operational mode for science program consists of long periods of circulating stored beam (which decays with a lifetime in tens of hours), interposed with short injection events (in minutes) to fill the stored current. The stored beam energy ranges from a few hundreds MeV to 10 GeV with a low injection beam power (generally less than 10 watts). The injection beam energy can be the same as, or lower than, the stored beam energy. However, the stored beam power (product of stored beam current and energy), which is one of the key parameters in determining the production and hazards of gas bremsstrahlung (GB) and SR in beamlines, is quite high (MW to GW levels). Because of the similar design and dose control goals as well as similar beam parameters and operation modes among SR facilities, it is highly desired and useful for SR accelerator community to have the design and practices for radiation safety of the storage ring and SR beamlines that are professionally sound and consistent. On the other hand, it can be understood that a SR facility may need to have its specific policies and practices, due to its own technical, practical, economical and/or political considerations...|$|R
