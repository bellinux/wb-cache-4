5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E

40|$|Panniculitis {{is defined}} as an {{inflammation}} of the subcutaneous tissue of varying aetiology. It may appear in many systemic diseases, and often occurs in patients suffering from systemic inflammatory connective tissue diseases. It is observed mainly {{in the course of}} <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> discoides (2 – 3 % of patients), but it may be an early symptom of developing the <b>systemic</b> form of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> In this paper we present a case of a patient with a severe course of panniculitis manifested as a painful, tough and warm skin lesion {{on the side of the}} thigh. It was accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as hectic fever, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. In addition, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, salmonellosis and cat scratch disease antibodies were found positive. Despite aggressive antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy, there were no satisfactory results. Steroid therapy was attempted (pulses, followed by oral doses of methylprednisolone), which resulted in an effective clinical outcome...|$|R
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

40|$|Background: Pleomorphic Malignant Fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) {{is a rare}} {{neoplasms}} of {{the soft}} tissue and bone composed of fibroblastic and histiocytic components with mitosis figures, nuclear pleomorphism and anaplasia. Case Presentation: We presented a rare case of MFH in 44 year old woman with history of <b>systemic</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>lupus</b> and seizures. Treated with prednisone. The cerebral TAC showed a temporal mass. Craniotomy was performed and {{the examination of the}} biopsy sample revealed a giant, pleomorphic and atypical cells.

40|$|A {{number of}} uncommon, {{clinically}} diverse and poorly understood inflammatory skin diseases are linked {{by the presence}} of a set of histopathological elements that have traditionally been referred to as the “lichenoid tissue reaction/interface dermatitis” (LTR/IFD). The prototypic skin disease in this category is lichen planus. However, the LTR/IFD can also be seen in skin disorders associated with <b>systemic</b> illnesses (<b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> dermatomyositis), and the skin changes of potentially fatal disorders such as graft-versus-host disease, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. It has been traditionally felt that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes represent the final effector cell type for the epidermal basal cell layer injury pattern that is common to LTR/IFD disorders. Recent work has suggested that a number of different LTR/IFD skin disorders share a common inflammatory signaling pathway involving the actions of plasmacytoid dendritic cell-derived IFN-α. This signaling pathway appears to amplify cytotoxic T cell injury to the epidermal basal cell compartment. This review will summarize the work implicating this pathway {{as well as the other}} cellular and molecular mechanisms that are thought to be responsible for the prototypic LTR/IFD disorder, lichen planus. It is hoped that a better understanding of the immunological commonalities shared by various LTR/IFD disorders will lead to more effective safer treatment options for these illnesses...|$|R

40|$|The {{antimalarial}} drug chloroquine {{is also used}} {{in the prevention of}} photodermatoses and in patients with inflammatory connective diseases. The drug binds strongly to melanin. Melanocytic activity can be studied by analysis of the urinary markers of eumelanin (6 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid, 6 H 5 MI- 2 -C) and phaeomelanin (5 -S-cysteinyl-dopa, 5 -S-CD). To determine whether chloroquine interacts with this activity, we measured the urinary excretion of the two metabolites in 16 patients with either <b>systemic</b> or discoid <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> polymorphic light eruption or rheumatoid arthritis, during a period with and without treatment with chloroquine phosphate. Two control groups consisting of 7 untreated patients and 10 healthy subjects were also included in the study.

The number of pyrimidine dimers was measured by incubating the epidermal skin DNA with UV-specific endonuclease and sedimenting the DNA through alkaline sucrose gradients. The initial number of dimers induced following sunlamp exposure was 7. 6 ± 1. 8 per 108 daltons DNA. The level of photorepair was measured by illuminating {{an area of the}} skin with > 450 -nm radiation immediately following sunlamp exposure. We found that 56. 5 ± 9. 5 % of the dimers are photorepaired with 5 min of illumination. Excision repair was measured in an area of the skin covered for 2 and 24 h postirradiation. Approximately 44 and 81 % of the dimers induced immediately following sunlamp exposure were removed at these respective times.
