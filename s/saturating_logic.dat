In his patent the Schottky diode {{prevented}} the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The diode {{could also be}} integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. His patent also showed how the Schottky transistor {{could be used in}} DTL circuits and improve the switching speed of other <b>saturated</b> <b>logic</b> designs, such as Schottky-TTL, at a low cost.|$|R

Backward search in this logic gives an effective algorithm that returns either zero, one or two distinct inhabitants for any given type.

50|$|In 1964, Dr. Biard {{designed}} linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to {{work with}} silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal-semiconductor Schottky-barrier diode. The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly {{enough to cover the}} Schottky clamped TTL ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of <b>saturated</b> <b>logic</b> designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|R
40|$|The {{allosteric}} control of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, EC 2. 1. 3. 2) of Escherichia coli involves feedback inhibition by both CTP and UTP {{rather than just}} CTP alone. It has been known that CTP functions as a heterotropic inhibitor of catalysis; however, the inhibition by CTP alone is incomplete (50 - 70 % at various aspartate concentrations) and {{there is only a}} partial occupancy of the allosteric binding sites by CTP at <b>saturating</b> concentrations. The <b>logic</b> of these allosteric characteristics can now be understood in that UTP is a synergistic inhibitor of ATCase in the presence of CTP even though UTP has no independent effect at pH 7. 0. When saturating concentrations of CTP are present, the concentration of substrate required for half-maximal activity (S 0. 5) of the native holoenzyme for aspartate increases from 5 to 11 mM. When CTP and UTP are both present, the aspartate requirement increases further (S 0. 5 = 17 mM). At aspartate concentrations less than 5 mM, the heterotropic inhibition of ATCase is 90 - 95 % in the presence of both pyrimidine nucleotides. UTP does enhance the binding of CTP to the holoenzyme but the number of tight binding sites does not change (n = 3). The binding of UTP is stabilized in the presence of CTP although its binding characteristics are not as strong as those of CTP. The recent crystallographic studies of Kim et al. [Kim, H. K., Pan, Z., Honzatko, R. B., Ke, H. M. & Lipscomb, W. N. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 853 - 875] have described a structural asymmetry across the molecular two-fold axis that is consistent with these CTP/UTP interactions. The synergistic inhibition of ATCase by both CTP and UTP provides a satisfying logic for ensuring a balance of endogenous pyrimidine nucleotide pools...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a qualitative {{understanding of the}} transformations of urban life and space {{in the context of}} austerity. It argues that the lifeworld of disadvantaged urban youth increasingly tightened as opportunities for employment, personal development and independent living diminish. As urban neoliberalisation intensifies, urban space excludes young people from ‘decent’ urban living or even the city itself. The urban roots and impacts of the 2008 financial crisis are well documented. However, where such work investigates new structural conditions and policies, this thesis focusses on its recipients to explore the lived experiences and spaces of austerity. Through a critical return to humanistic geographies, especially the lifeworld, the ‘lifeworld assemblage’ is developed to bridge conceptions of place as constructed through networks of resources, power and knowledge, and the spatial experiences and meanings of those inhabiting the city-after-austerity. This concept is applied to disadvantaged urban youth in Ireland, one of the groups most severely affected by austerity. To investigate this group’s everyday lived experiences of austerity urbanism, 33 individuals aged 18 to 25 were interviewed, living in two of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Ireland: Knocknaheeny (Cork) and Ballymun (Dublin). First, austerity policy is assessed to establish how it creates and enhances spaces of exclusion, deepening exploitation and extending precariousness into the sphere of social reproduction. It then proceeds, using interview data and the lifeworld assemblage, to explore how local geographies determine the specific austerity encounters of disadvantaged urban youth. Next, it is argued that the lifeworld becomes <b>saturated</b> with neoliberal <b>logic,</b> denying any diverging horizon or possibility, with a specific focus on the labour market, urban accommodation and support services. Finally, austerity’s effect on youth’s multi-scalar sense of place is investigated using ‘at-homeness’. It is shown that varying scales carry different meanings for disadvantaged urban youth and play specific roles in the austerity experience. As years of austerity dramatically transformed Irish society, understanding its experience by those most vulnerable provides a critical position to interrogate how austerity gets embedded in personal and spatial relations, how it contributes to systemic colonisation of the lifeworld, and to identify the range of scales and sites from which austerity has emerged. It also provides the means to examine how the population has perceived and negotiated these impacts on and in their lifeworld...|$|R
40|$|Value and {{the concept}} of value {{co-creation}} in marketing networks are growing in importance in providing competitive advantage in increasingly <b>saturated</b> markets. Service-Dominant <b>logic</b> (S-D logic) revolves around the concept that value is always co-created by customers and organizations together (Gronroos, 2006; Vargo and Lusch, 2004; 2008). This study provides a conceptual framework around the topic of co-creation, and identifies customer value creating processes, supplier value creating processes and encounter processes within a single case study of a pharmaceutical organization (called PharmCo for this study). This organization has successfully created its own competitive space, achieving 34 % market growth, year-on-year, over a seven-year period. The paper summarizes some of the key conditions of service dominant logic (Ballantyne & Varey, 2007), including value in use, stakeholder interaction, co-creation and the role of integrated networks, the role of the marketer as managing communication, interaction and relationships, between networks of co-operators. Organizations with a service-dominated culture will create networks of supporting suppliers thereby enabling stronger solutions to be offered to customers (Sheth and Sharma, 2008). Value is always determined by the customer and co-created in the joint interaction (service) between buyer and seller (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). Co-creation of value is not simply inviting the customer {{to take part in the}} product development, but actually integrates the organization’s offering into the lives of their customers (Payne et al., 2008). Co-creation at PharmCo took place in the ‘disease space’, within the network of relationships surrounding the patient, aimed at supporting the patient. Culture has been identified as a management opportunity to optimize human resources to improve business performance and is an attribute that is not easy to copy (Ogbonna and Harris, 2002). Culture may be employed to develop appropriate behaviors and attitudes in employees by focusing them on a set of meaningful and unified objectives (Chatman and Cha, 2003) leading to competitive advantage. The staff at PharmCo were encouraged to carry a small credit card-sized checklist summarizing what the organization’s values and paradigm, including the purpose of ‘providing life-transforming treatment’. PharmCo realized that product alone would not solve the patient’s problems and to help them beat their addition they created a network of expertise that the patient and their medical practitioners could access through a communications website. Exchange networks, typified by the interaction model and the role of actors, processes, bonds and resources, may be developed with external agencies and become part of organizational/marketing activities in service-dominated organizations (Lian and Laing, 2007). These networks may rely on a range of variables, e. g. social, power, diffusion, economic, and knowledge management, but all are based in communication ties (Katz and Lazer, 2002). PharmCo set up a value creation network, which is comprised of at least 36 distinct entities. Value was jointly created as members of the network, which is an organic and open-ended entity, because it grows and develops as the disease space evolves, delivered higher levels of service to the patient. The members of the network understanding the reason why they participate in the network, and underpins this with an understanding of how their interaction can support the patient to everyone’s advantage. The importance of the culture and the guiding principle of the focus to patient treatment have been emphasized, rather than the more direct commercial emphasis on selling products. This is very much a direct contrast to the conventional pharmaceutical business model, which involves large sales forces calling on physicians in order to “detail” the benefits of their particular medication and to encourage sales. Not only have PharmCo developed a very different approach in the context of the pharmaceutical industry they have also created a unique competitive advantage, which has been achieved through: The building of relationships through dialogue to create a network that is sustained by a common vision. Managers focused on providing comprehensive solutions to customers’ needs, and competing in the “problem space” rather than the “marketplace”. Marketing collateral is being used to resource the network, measure and provides the route to continual improvement. Network members understanding why and how they create and deliver value, and a relentless focus to providing customer solutions create the vision for the organization...|$|R
