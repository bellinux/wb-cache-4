5000|$|The 2011 season saw a {{resurgence}} in {{popularity of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>facet</b> surrounding the field trial events, that a sort of fashion competition between the owner and handlers of the dogs. A very informal scoring system rewards participants on theappropriateness of various clothing, with items such as short, dog themed ties, anachronistic hats, again dog themed, formal outerwear, and outlandish, inappropriate foot ware. One could describe it {{as a sort of}} [...] "retro-hipster for the rural woodlands set". The rise in popularity is believed to have begun in the state of Minnesota, championed by one Ben McKean, a lifelong dog enthusiast surging boldly to the height of the sport, while simultaneously reviving the class and style of the sports progenitors.|$|E

The 96 patients evaluated for this cohort received an Ant-Cer II Dynamic Anterior Cervical Plate for treatment of their myelopathic/radiculopathic symptoms and were evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 14 weeks postoperatively. Sixty-four (67 %) patients reported no ISP and limited narcotic use at their 2 week follow-up visit as well as 79 (85 %) patients at their 6 week and 68 (89 %) at their 14 week visits resulting in an overall favorable clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that the prismatic and <b>secondary</b> prism <b>facets</b> of ice-I_h crystals possess structural features that can reduce the effective hydrophilicity of the ice/water interface. The spreading dynamics of liquid water droplets on ice facets exhibits long-time behavior that differs for the prismatic { 101 ̅ 0 } and secondary prism { 112 ̅ 0 } facets {{when compared with the}} basal { 0001 } and pyramidal { 202 ̅ 1 } facets. We also present the results of simulations of solid-liquid friction of the same four crystal facets being drawn through liquid water, and find that the two prismatic facets exhibit roughly half the solid-liquid friction of the basal and pyramidal facets. These simulations provide {{evidence that}} the two prismatic faces have a significantly smaller effective surface area in contact with the liquid water. The ice / water interfacial widths for all four crystal facets are similar (using both structural and dynamic measures), and were found to be independent of the shear rate. Additionally, decomposition of orientational time correlation functions show position-dependence for the short- and longer-time decay components close to the interface.

40|$|Purpose: Facet joints are {{important}} anatomical structures for {{the stability of}} spine. Surgical or degenerative damage to a facet joint may lead to spinal instability and causes clinical problems. This article explains the importance of facet joints, reviews facet replacement systems, and describes a simple and effective method for facet replacement after surgical removal of facet joints. Materials and Methods: Ten patients were operated with the diagnosis of unilateral nerve root compression <b>secondary</b> to <b>facet</b> degeneration. The hypertrophic facet joints were removed with microsurgical techniques and the roots were decompressed. Then, a unilateral artificial facet joint was created using two hinged screws and a dynamic rod. Results: The clinical outcome of all the patients was determined good or excellent at second and last follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) controls using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Radiological evaluations also demonstrated no implant-related complications. Conclusions: The authors suggest that, if removal of a facet joint is necessary to decompress the nerve roots, the joint can {{be replaced by a}} construct composed of two hinged screws connected by a dynamic rod. This simple system mimics the function of a normal facet joint and is an effective technique for unilateral facet joint replacement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Documents in {{rich text}} corpora often contain {{multiple}} facets of information. For example, an article {{from a medical}} document collection might consist of multifaceted information about symptoms, treatments, causes, diagnoses, prognoses, and preventions. Thus, documents in the collection may have different relations across each of these various facets. Topic analysis and exploration for such multi-relational corpora is a challenging visual analytic task. This paper presents SolarMap, a multifaceted visual analytic technique for visually exploring topics in multi-relational data. SolarMap simultaneously visualizes the topic distribution of the underly-ing entities from one facet together with keyword distributions that convey the semantic definition of each cluster along a <b>secondary</b> <b>facet.</b> SolarMap combines several visual techniques including 1) topic contour clusters and interactive multifaceted keyword topic rings, 2) a global layout optimization algorithm that aligns each topic cluster with its corresponding keywords, and 3) 2) an optimal temporal network segmentation and layout method that renders temporal evolution of clusters. Finally, the paper concludes with two case studies and quantitative user evaluation which show {{the power of the}} SolarMap technique...|$|E
40|$|Humanitarian {{engineering}} {{across the}} UK {{has been a}} steadily growing area of pedagogical practice to enhance the knowledge of engineering students by applying their skills in global scenarios. These scenarios {{are different from the}} average activity due to their focus on not only the solution to the problem, but also the people, culture, religion and other factors that can make a huge impact upon the longevity and sustainability of the installed solution. This paper looks to gain understanding of the underlying definition of what being entrepreneurial actually is, whilst reviewing the multiple debates surrounding entrepreneurship and humanitarian engineering. Once an understanding of the background literature is complete, measurement of the characteristics of these humanitarian engineering students were conducted and compared against other engineers and students studying enterprise and entrepreneurship. In order to improve accuracy a pilot study was built into the measurement tool in order to improve validity. A <b>secondary</b> <b>facet</b> of this work looks to understand the experiences of engineers who have been involved in field work in Africa and have actively observed and contributed towards the impact of the engineering projects on systemic entrepreneurship. By further developing the use of humanitarian engineering across higher education institutions, systemic entrepreneurship can be improved both in the UK and in the international projects that they are involved in. One of the key outcomes being the need to educate engineers in systemic entrepreneurship {{and the fact that it}} does not just apply within business, rather it is a mindset that can influence both their career and the individuals whom they come into contact with throughout their lives...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{machining}} performance of an aerospace structural material commercially known as GLARE fibre metal laminate and its metal constituent aluminium Al 2024 -T 3 aerospace alloy using commercially available solid carbide twist drills. The {{objective is to}} quantify {{the effects of the}} cutting parameters and two modern coolant technologies on cutting forces and a number of hole quality parameters. The generated drilling cutting forces, quality of machined hole and drilling-induced damage and defects when drilling GLARE fibre metal laminates were experimentally studied. Drilling-induced defects and damage investigated were surface roughness, burr formation at both sides of the workpiece and interlayer burr, hole size and circularity error, chip formation as well as damage described at the macro level (delamination area) using computerised tomography (CT) scan, and at the micro level (fibre matrix debonding, chipping, adhesions, cracks) using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results have been statistically analysed using full factorial and response surface methodology statistical techniques to generate multiple regression models which makes it attractive as an indirect tool predicting the machining outputs prior the start of actual tests. Moreover, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the percentage contribution of drilling parameters on cutting forces and hole quality outputs. The results indicated that the presence of coolant during the drilling process of GLARE could significantly improve hole quality. The use of cryogenic liquid nitrogen was found to eliminate the formation of waste on the borehole surface and burr formation at the hole exit. Using minimum quantity lubrication coolant was found to reduce the workpeice temperature compared to dry drilling at room temperature. Both coolants reduced the surface roughness compared to dry drilling but increased the cutting forces especially when using cryogenic liquid nitrogen. The cutting parameters results indicated that a maximum operating feed rate of 300 mm/min and a maximum spindle speed of 6000 rpm is recommended for superior hole quality results. Moreover, drilling at or below those levels of cutting parameters did not lead to severe delamination or fibre pull outs in the laminate compared to the higher cutting parameters used in the study. In addition, the fibre orientation and workpiece thickness were found to play a significant role on surface roughness and hole size but did not have a considerable impact on cutting forces due to the small thickness of glass fibre layers in the laminate. Adhesion and built up edge was found to be the main wear mechanism when drilling monolithic aluminium alloy, while adhesion and abrasion of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>facets</b> of the drill were identified to be the main wear process that occurs in drilling GLARE laminates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionFacet {{joint pain}} {{is a common}} source of non-radicular back pain worldwide. Non-surgical interventional {{modalities}} remain the mainstay {{in the treatment of}} facetogenic back pain and comprise the second most commonly performed interventional pain procedures in the USA. CaseA 36 year-old man with chronic cervical pain secondary to C 6 –C 7 facet arthrosis radiographically, underwent diagnostic local anesthetic bilateral facet joint injection under fluoroscopic guidance. The left side was injected uneventfully; however, 1 – 2 min following injection of the right side the patient complained of unwellness and became very anxious. He referred paresthesias of the bilateral upper extremities, chest and upper abdomen. Physical examination showed sensory deficits roughly from C 5 to T 7 without motor deficits; resuscitation measures were not warranted. The deficits were completely resolved by 35 – 40 min in the recovery area. DiscussionFacet joint injections are a common and safe method of treating back pain <b>secondary</b> to <b>facet</b> arthropathy. Despite excellent safety profiles, rare and sometimes, life-threatening complications can occur. Our case hypothesizes intrathecal injection of local anesthetic during facet joint injection. Few reports have described similar situations. We hypothesize a mechanism of entry through the facet joint, given the proximity of the ligamentum flavum, and the intrathecal space to the anterior aspect of the facet joint. This report reinforces the need for resuscitation and airway management equipment to be readily available where interventional procedures are performed, as well as the need for adequate proficiency in airway management and resuscitation techniques in Pain Medicine training...|$|R
40|$|Conscientiousness (C) is {{positively}} associated with health and longevity although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully understood. Stress {{may play a role}} in explaining the C–longevity relationship. This study investigated whether C predicted the cognitive appraisals of daily stressors/hassles. Participants (N[*]=[*] 102) completed measures of C and cognitive appraisal in relation to the most stressful hassle they had experienced in the last 7 [*]days. Correlational analysis revealed that Total C, Order and Industriousness were positively correlated with primary appraisals, and Responsibility was positively correlated with <b>secondary</b> appraisals. The <b>facets</b> of C were then entered into hierarchical regression models, controlling for age and gender. This demonstrated that Order (β[*]=[*] 0. 27, p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and Industriousness (β[*]=[*] 0. 28, p[*]<[*] 0. 05) significantly predicted primary appraisals, accounting for 15. 8 % of the variance. Responsibility significantly predicted secondary appraisals (β[*]=[*] 0. 44, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), accounting for 16. 3 % of the variance. These findings indicate that higher Order and Industriousness are related to having a greater stake in daily stressors, whereas higher Responsibility is related to greater confidence in one's ability to deal with daily stressors. These results are the first demonstration that C is related to the appraisals of daily hassles and suggest that C may moderate the experience of stress in daily life...|$|R
40|$|In Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, fatigue cracks can {{nucleate}} internally {{instead of}} at the surface. Internal or subsurface cracks in titanium alloys are found to initiate at faceted features, which {{can be seen on}} the fracture surface after failure. These facets are fractured primary α (hcp) grains, which have broken in a very planar manner. The main purpose of this work is to study internal fracture in drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires, which has not been done before, since all published studies use forged or rolled samples. Fatigue tests with load ratio R= 0. 1 and a frequency of 60 Hz have been performed on wires with average α grain sizes of approximately 1, 2, 5 and 10 µm. In total, 50 samples were successfully tested. Four samples broke due to an internally initiated crack after testing at a maximum stress of 750 MPa: three samples with average alpha grain size 5 μm, which failed after 2. 6 x 10 ^ 7, 5. 7 x 10 ^ 7 and 9. 6 x 10 ^ 7 cycles, and one sample with average alpha grain size 10 μm, which failed after 7. 6 x 10 ^ 6 cycles. In general, an increase in grain size resulted in lower fatigue lives. In the four samples with internal crack initiation, a cluster of facets was observed at the initiation site on the fracture surface. The projected area size of the facet-containing area was not related to the fatigue life, and the estimated threshold stress intensity factor range was between 6 and 8 MPa√m. The actual surface area, taking into account the roughness, was correlated to the fatigue life. The facets were not smooth, but showed some nano-roughness with linear markings. As a result of the crystallographic texture, the facets were highly inclined, at angles mostly between 50 ° and 70 °. Nearly all facets were parallel to a prismatic lattice plane. The linear markings on these facets were parallel to the direction of the prismatic slip system, which means that facet formation most likely occurred by a prismatic slip band mechanism. One anomalous facet was observed in the sample with an average grain size of 10 µm. This facet coincided with a near-basal plane, and displayed a fan-shaped pattern instead of linear markings, which indicates that a cleavage mechanism took place. These observations suggest that both a slip-based and a cleavage-based mechanism are possible, depending on the grain size, local texture and possibly other parameters. A local comparison of Taylor factors showed that the Taylor factor of each faceted grain had a tendency towards being higher than the Taylor factors of its corresponding neighbouring grains. It is suggested that the Taylor factor may be used to distinguish between plastically hard and soft grain orientations, and therefore could be capable of explaining the stress distribution between grains, which is the root cause for facet formation. Fracture surface cross-sections revealed <b>secondary</b> <b>facets,</b> which in some cases extended through more than one grain. Short crack growth through a grain boundary occurred when two compatible slip systems were present in these grains. This compatibility could be expressed by calculating misalignment factors. Additionally, a limited number of dwell fatigue tests have been performed, with a hold time of 30 or 120 s at maximum load. Introducing a hold time at maximum load drastically reduced the amount of cycles to failure by two to three orders of magnitude compared to regular fatigue tests, and promoted surface crack initiation. This was caused by strain accumulation due to cold creep, which occurred during each maximum load hold. A recovery process took place during each minimum load hold, which caused an increased initial strain rate during each following maximum load hold.
