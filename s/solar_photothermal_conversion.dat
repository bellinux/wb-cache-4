The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by The Electrochemical Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] sulfides (CuxS) are compound semiconductor materials that exhibit considerable variations of optical and electrical properties. Copper sulfide thin films can be used in many applications, such as solar control coatings, <b>solar</b> cells, <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> of <b>solar</b> energy, electroconductive coatings, and microwave shielding coatings. In this paper, chemical bath deposition growth of copper sulfide thin films were monitored for the first time using an in-situ quartz crystal microbalance as a function of time, temperature, concentrations of reactants, and pH. The reaction activation energy was determined based on initial growth rates. The high activation energy, 68 [kJ/mol], indicates that the rate limiting step of the deposition is the chemical reaction rather than mass transport. The structure, morphology, composition and optical absorption of the films were studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy respectively. These properties were found to depend strongly on the deposition conditions. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the study of black molybdenum, a new cermet consisting of small Mo particles embedded in MoO₂. As with most two-phase materials, the optical properties of black molybdenum are significantly different from those of either constituent, and can be adjusted within wide limits through modifications of composition and microstructure due to variations of the fabrication process parameters. The subject of this work is to understand the exact relationships, to allow reproducible production of films with chosen optical properties. Theoretical interpretation of the optical properties of two-phase materials has in the past been hampered by insufficient microstructural characterization. Recent theoretical work by others has lifted the requirements of detailed microstructural knowledge, leaving only two required parameters for characterization of cermet reflectance: the optical properties of the constituent phases and their volume fractions in the cermet. Better characterization is obtained when structural considerations, such as film topology, surface texture and the presence of a possible amorphous phase, are taken into account. We adopted this approach to the study of black molybdenum, and accomplished satisfactory agreement between theoretical and observed reflectances. Black molybdenum films were prepared using two separate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, involving deposition from either Mo(CO) ₆ or MoO₂Cl₂. We found the influence of composition through a comparison of films with different Mo:MoO₂ ratios, while the influence of structure on film reflectance was determined by comparing films from these two deposition techniques. During this investigation we produced black molybdenum films which display a spectrally selective profile [...] low visible reflectance combined with high infrared reflectance, and which may be applied to <b>photothermal</b> <b>solar</b> energy <b>conversion.</b> The versatility of CVD in adjusting film composition and structure resulted in another film of interest in <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> [...] black tungsten, a tungsten-tungsten oxide composite material.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In recent years, copper sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} candidates for new photothermal agents due to their strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, and suitable size for photothermal therapy. 1, 2 However, the low <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of copper sulfide NCs in the tissue transparency window from 650 to 900 nm hinders further development of copper sulfide as an effective photothermal agent. 3, 4 Therefore, it is still necessary to improve the <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency near 800 nm for these materials to be used effectively in photothermal therapy. 4 As a result, other kinds of copper chalcogenide NCs, such as copper selenide, copper telluride, and their alloys have been recently proposed. 5, 6, 7 By changing the mix of chalcogen substituents in the NC, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) position can be tuned to more closely match the tissue transparency window, leading to a higher <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency near the excitation wavelength. 8 Copper selenide-sulfide and copper telluride-sulfide alloy NCs are especially interesting candidate materials for photothermal agents, as they should have lower cytotoxicity than pure copper selenide and copper telluride NCs due to their reduced selenium and tellurium content. However, their potential use for photothermal therapy {{has not yet been}} evaluated in depth. Herein, the <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of several copper chalcogenide alloy NCs were investigated to evaluate the potential use of each as a photothermal agent via a comparison with unalloyed copper sulfide NCs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Copper sulfides (Cu[subscript x]S) are {{compound}} semiconductor materials that exhibit considerable optical and electrical properties varying significantly {{as a function}} of the composition. Copper sulfide thin films can be used in many applications, such as solar control coatings, <b>solar</b> cells, <b>photothermal</b> <b>conversion</b> of <b>solar</b> energy, electroconductive coatings, and microwave shielding coatings. A variety of solution-based and vapor-based techniques are suitable for their deposition. Solution-based processes have the advantages of simplicity, low capital cost, and low processing temperature. In this work, copper sulfide thin film deposition by a number of solution-based processes was investigated. These processes include chemical bath deposition (CBD), Microreactor Assisted Solution Deposition (MASD), and PhotoChemical Deposition (PCD). The growth kinetics of copper sulfide thin films by CBD was monitored using an in-situ quartz crystal microbalance for the first time. CBD growth was studied {{as a function of}} time, temperature, concentrations of reactants, and pH. The reaction activation energy was determined based on initial growth rates. The result indicates the rate limiting step of the deposition is the chemical reaction rather than mass transport. The structure, morphology, composition and optical absorption of the films were found to depend strongly on the deposition conditions. Results from the study of CBD reactions indicated the need to de-reduce the undesirable homogeneous particle formation. The MASD process was developed to achieve this objective. The continuous flow process together with the microreactor design not only improve the mixing of reactants and provide a better temporal control over the reaction which result in higher quality films and a higher deposition rate. A particle-free flux was obtained after adjusting the key process parameters (concentration of mixed reactants, solution temperature, substrate temperature, and residence time). Significantly improved copper sulfide thin film deposition with a good selectivity of heterogeneous surface reactions was achieved. PCD basically employs the UV illumination to excite the irradiated region of the substrate in a deposition solution. It has the potential to reduce the homogeneous particle formation. We investigated the growth kinetics of copper sulfide thin films by PCD under various deposition conditions (e. g. pH, substrate position, reactant concentration, deposition time, and temperature) that influence on the film properties and characteristics. Moreover a detailed mathematical model that describes the multiple chemical reactions in the deposition mechanism was also developed in this work to have a better understanding of the reaction mechanism. Reaction rate constants were successfully estimated from the experimental data based on this model. The calculated results agree well with the experimental data. This model could serve as a useful tool for the control and optimization of photochemical deposition of copper sulfide thin films. Both CBD and PCD processes suffer from severe homogeneous particle formation which has resulted in lower deposition rate. In contrast, MASD provides good selectivity towards heterogeneous surface deposition using molecular precursors at a much higher deposition rate. Thus MASD process was used to deposit copper sulfide layers on textured substrates with nice conformal coverage. Dense, crack-free CuInSe₂ thin films were fabricated successfully after adding an indium precursor layer, and followed by a selenization process. This approach offers a potential low-cost route to fabricate thin absorber solar cells...|$|R
