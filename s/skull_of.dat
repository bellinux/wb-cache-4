50|$|Lions' <b>skulls</b> rival those <b>of</b> tigers in size or length (Pease, 1913, page 101), {{with even}} the largest known <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> tigers being {{smaller than the}} largest known <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions, albeit slightly. Apart from their sizes, the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions and tigers are {{generally}} similar, with there being differences in structural features of the lower jaws, relative lengths of their noses, and the frontal regions. In fact, the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> lions, especially from Asia, were so {{similar to those of}} tigers that Heptner and Sludskii (1972) argued that the lion was closer to the tiger than to other animals like the leopard and jaguar, unlike what others believed.|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{brain to}} have been {{discovered}} was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex. The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years old, {{was found in the}} <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although the brains were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.|$|E
5|$|The <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> AMNHFARB6810, the best-preserved <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Plateosaurus {{that has}} been taken apart during {{preparation}} and is thus available as separate bones, was described anew in 2011. The authors of that publication, palaeontologists Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark A. Norell, refer the skull to P.erlenbergensis, a species erected in 1905 by Friedrich von Huene. If the P.erlenbergensis holotype is diagnostic (i.e., has enough characters to be distinct from other material), it is the correct name for the material assigned to P.longiceps Jaekel, 1913. However, according to the last detailed study of the holotype material of P.engelhardti by Markus Moser, P.erlenbergensis is a junior synonym of P.engelhardti.|$|E

40|$|By {{taking the}} measure {{and working out}} indexes in all the items, {{statistical}} observations were made <b>of</b> the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto, Hokuriku and Kinki Districts. It was revealed that the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto District differed from those of Hokuriku District in many items, and also from those of Kinki District in {{a considerable number of}} items. Between the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto and Hokuriku Districts there were significant differences in 26 items : the male skull showed significant differences in 20 items, the female skull in 15 items and both male and female skulls in 10 items. Between the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto and Kinki Districts, there were significant differences in 20 items : the male skull showed significant differences in 18 items, the female skull in 9 items and both male and female skulls in 7 items. These observations indicate that the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto District considerably differ in size not only from those of Hokuriku District but also from those of Kinki District. Survey of the items in which significant differences were found shows that, while significant differences existing between the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto and Hokuriku Districts were confined to a series of items and those existing between the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> inhabitants of Kanto -and Kinki Districts to another series of items, significant differences existed between the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the inhabitants of Kanto District and those of both Hokuriku and Kinki Districts in a few items...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{parameters}} {{were measured}} on <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> four species of Peromyscus from Arkansas. Univariate statistical tests, multivariate analyses of variance, and principal axis factor {{analyses were performed}} on the data set and/or subsets {{in a search for}} species-level discriminating characters. Total length <b>of</b> <b>skull</b> was found to discriminate between <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> P. maniculatis, P. leucopus, and a combined group of P. attwateri and P. gossypinus. Furthermore, the ratio of interorbital width and length of nasal bone was found to adequately discriminate between <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> P. attwateri and P. gossypinus...|$|R
5|$|The <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic {{material}} on the squamosal. The neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.|$|E
5|$|When {{originally}} {{described by}} Brown, Prosaurolophus maximus was known from a skull and jaw. Half {{of the skull}} was badly weathered {{at the time of}} examination, and the level of the parietal was distortedly crushed upwards to the side. The different bones of the skull could be easily defined, {{with the exception of the}} parietals and nasal bones. Brown found that the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the already described genus Saurolophus is very similar overall to, but also smaller than the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> P. maximus. A unique feature of a shortened frontal in lambeosaurines is also found in Prosaurolophus, and the other horned hadrosaurines Brachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Saurolophus. Although they lack a shorter frontal, the genera Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus share with saurolophins an elongated dentary.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons of the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> this species with modern {{crocodiles}} {{show the same}} rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{when only}} a few number <b>of</b> <b>skulls</b> from Wusun {{territory}} were known, the Wusun were recognized as a Caucasoid people with slight Mongoloid admixture.

50|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Vikings drank out <b>of</b> the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches <b>of</b> <b>skulls).</b> This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century as referring to the <b>skulls</b> <b>of</b> the slain.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} {{so as to}} aid echolocation.

5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{study by}} Nicolás Campione and David Evans, the authors {{conducted}} {{the first ever}} morphometric analysis to compare the various specimens assigned to Edmontosaurus. They concluded that only two species are valid: E. regalis, from the late Campanian, and E. annectens, from the late Maastrichtian. Their study provided further evidence that Anatotitan copei is a synonym of E. annectens; specifically, that the long, low <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> A. copei {{is the result of}} ontogenetic change and represents mature E. annectens individuals.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} more rigid <b>skull</b> <b>of</b> Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which {{did not exist in}} most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. Tarbosaurus-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in Alioramus from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not Tyrannosaurus, is the closest relative of Tarbosaurus. Similarities between Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.|$|E
