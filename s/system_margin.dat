50|$|Being able to {{position}} a data signal {{relative to a}} clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in a BERT. This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds {{to the middle of}} the data signal's bit window, since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched. The capability is also used on the receiver side of a BERT where a separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data signal's bit cell. As the clock signal approaches either side of the data bit cell window, the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals. This type of analysis is called a Bathtub Curve, which demonstrates a degree of <b>system</b> <b>margin.</b> This is an example of a signal integrity physical-layer test, utilizing BER measurement capability combined with accurate time delay capability.|$|E
5000|$|Sagarin, {{like the}} {{developers}} {{of many other}} sports rating systems, does not divulge the exact methods behind his system. He offers two rating systems, each of which gives each team {{a certain number of}} points. One system, [...] "Elo chess," [...] is presumably based on the Elo rating system used internationally to rank chess players. This system uses only wins and losses with no reference to the victory margin. The other system, [...] "Predictor," [...] takes victory margin into account. For that system the difference in two teams' rating scores is meant to predict the margin of victory for the stronger team at a neutral venue. For both systems teams gain higher ratings within the Sagarin system by winning games against stronger opponents, factoring in such things as home-venue advantage. For the Predictor <b>system,</b> <b>margin</b> of victory (or defeat) factors in also, but a law of diminishing returns is applied. Therefore, a football team that wins a game by a margin of 7-6 is rewarded less than a team that defeats the same opponent under the same circumstances 21-7, but a team that wins a game by a margin of 35-0 receives similar ratings to a team that defeats the same opponent 70-0. This characteristic has the effect of recognizing [...] "comfortable" [...] victories, while limiting the reward for running up the score.|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} free-space optical (FSO) communications infrastructure {{will need to}} support {{a wide range of}} links from space-based terminals in low Earth orbit, geosynchronous Earth orbit, and deep space to the ground. Efficiently enabling such a diverse mission set requires an optical communications system architecture capable of providing excellent sensitivity (i. e., few photons-per-bit) while allowing reductions in data rate for increased <b>system</b> <b>margin.</b> Specifically, coherent optical transmission systems have excellent sensitivity and can trade data rate for <b>system</b> <b>margin</b> by adjusting the modulation format, the forward error correction (FEC) code rate, or by repeating blocks of channel symbols. These techniques can be implemented on a common set of hardware at a fixed system baud rate. Experimental results show that changing modulation formats between quaternary phase-shifted keying and binary phase-shifted keying enables a 3 -dB scaling in data rate and a 3. 5 -dB scaling in <b>system</b> <b>margin.</b> Experimental results of QPSK transmission show a 5. 6 -dB scaling of data rate and an 8. 9 -dB scaling in <b>system</b> <b>margin</b> by varying the FEC code rate from rate- 9 / 10 to rate- 1 / 4.
