40|$|A {{suite of}} 13 large Fortran {{benchmark}} codes were {{run on a}} Cray- 2 configured with memory pseudo-banking circuits, and floating point operation rates were measured for each {{under a variety of}} system load configurations. These were compared with similar flop measurements taken on the same system before installation of the pseudo-banking. A useful memory access efficiency parameter was defined and calculated for both sets of performance rates, allowing a crude quantitative measure of the improvement in efficiency due to pseudo-banking. Programs were categorized as either highly scalar (S) or highly vectorized (V) and either memory-intensive or register-intensive, giving 4 categories: S-memory, <b>S-register,</b> V-memory, and V-register. Using flop rates as a simple quantifier of these 4 categories, a scatter plot of efficiency gain vs Mflops roughly illustrates the improvement in floating point processing speed due to pseudo-banking. On the Cray- 2 system tested this improvement ranged from 1 percent for S-memory codes to about 12 percent for V-memory codes. No significant gains were made for V-register codes, which was to be expected...|$|E
5000|$|The ITU-T {{established}} a standard in its V-Series Recommendations, V.25 ter, in 1995 {{in an attempt}} to establish a standard for the command set again. It was renamed V.250 in 1998 with an annex that was not concerning the Hayes command set renamed as V.251. A V.250 compliant modem implements the A, D, E, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, X, Z, &C, &D, and &F commands in the way specified by the standard. It must also implement S registers and must use registers S0, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, and S10 for the purposes given in the standard. It also must implement any command beginning with the plus sign, [...] "+" [...] followed by any letter A to Z, only in accordance with ITU recommendations. Modem manufacturers are free to implement other commands and <b>S-registers</b> as they see fit, and may add options to standard commands.|$|R
