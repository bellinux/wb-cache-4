40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{medium-term}} budget planning process in Ukraine and the extent to which this approach is used within the environmental sector. It aims to assist the Ukrainian government to integrate environmental programmes more effectively into overall programming, financial planning and budgeting practices which could result into more adequate and predictable allocations to the environment sector. The study also seeks to analyse the implications of the progressive shift in aid modalities towards <b>sectoral</b> and general <b>budget</b> <b>support.</b> This report was prepared within the framework of the OECD Task Force for the Implementation of the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. The report also builds upon work that started within the OECD Task Team on Governance and Capacity Development for Natural Resource and Environmental Management, a joint Task Team of the OECD Development Assistance and Environmental Policy Committees. In addition, the report contributes to the debate on Green Growth, demonstrating the need for more adequate and well-costed environmental budgets, in the context of medium-term expenditure frameworks, as a means of promoting structural changes as part of the transition to green economy. budget systems, Ukraine, medium-term expenditure frameworks, environmental management, environmental investment programmes, development cooperation, direct <b>budget</b> <b>support,</b> environmental public expenditure management, medium-term budgeting, Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA) ...|$|R

40|$|New modern aid was {{initiated}} {{during the latter}} half of the 1990 s by most of the leading actors within the international donor community to make the whole aid-procedure more effective, more lucid and more on the receiving states’ conditions. <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> is a tool within this “partnership-aid” transformation where the distribution goes directly to the receiver state’s governmental budget and thus strengthens the institutions of the state. As the governmental institutions gain more power, other actors might gain less power than before. It is problematic if Civil Society gains less power because one prerequisite to obtain <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> is to have a well functioning Civil Society. So if <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> leads to a weaker Civil Society it undermines the initial prerequisites to obtain <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> in the first place. The core of this thesis is to see whether this possible paradox is a reality. The target for this thesis is Uganda, a country which has been a pioneer in implementing new aid initiatives by the donor community, with an elaborate <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> framework. The study focuses on effects from <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> on Anti-Corruption Organizations (AC-CSOs) within Civil Society. To make the effects visual, the AC-CSOs’ relation to donors and the Government of Uganda (GoU) after the <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation is investigated. Qualitative research interviews are made with 16 AC-CSOs. The findings show that most of the interviewed AC-CSOs are marginalized by the GoU after <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation and almost half of them are marginalized by donors. Thus, <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> tends to be a part of the marginalization process for AC-CSOs. The direct distribution of funds to the GoU increases the government’s power and the process tends to lead to a position/object relation with AC-CSOs. Also, donors tend not to give AC-CSOs the support to stop this process. In addition, donors favour Watchdog Organizations over Service Delivery Organizations. As Civil Society tends to be weakened with <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation, the structure of <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> could be considered as unsustainable in Uganda...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s a {{selection}} on policy approach to aid was advocated such that more aid should be allocated to countries with good policies, {{but there is}} little evidence that this has occurred. This paper argues that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality.

We test this for European Commission and World Bank <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> over 1997 – 2009 and find some support. Both donors have given <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> to almost half of the countries they give aid, and it is usually a significant share of their aid.

These variables did not, however, influence the amount of <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> given.

40|$|Several {{features}} of Tanzania''s budget system find {{their roots in}} the arrangements inherited from the United Kingdom. These include a legal framework that emphasizes accountability; a cabinet of ministers with strong budget decision-making powers; a parliament with very limited budget powers; and a similar external audit organization. In both countries, budget execution is decentralized to individual ministries, with accounting officers responsible to a parliamentary accounts committee. These similarities are blended with contrasts, including in Tanzania: a presidential system of government, one dominant political party, a written constitution, and some fragmentation in central budget decision-making within the executive.

40|$|Not for {{attribution}} or quotation <b>Budget</b> <b>support</b> {{has become}} an increasingly important instrument {{in the context of}} a partnership-based approach to development assistance. A growing number of donors and recipient countries are gaining experience with this aid modality that consists of financial assistance provided directly to partner country’s budget on a regular basis, using its own financial management systems and budget procedures.
