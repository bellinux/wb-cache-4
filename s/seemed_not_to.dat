5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} Test at Lord's, Shrewsbury played a {{remarkable}} innings of 164, the highest so far by an Englishman in Tests, on a pitch which, after a disruption for rain favoured the bowlers. His innings, which contained 3 chances, lasted for just under 7 hours. England scored 353. England lacked a fast bowler, but that <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> matter as Australia were bowled out cheaply for 121 and 126, with Johnny Briggs taking 11 for 74. England won by an innings and 106 runs.|$|E

As with the Lauria–Valenti shooting, however, there <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be any motive for the shooting, and police made little {{progress}} with the case. Many details of the Denaro–Keenan shooting were {{very similar to the}} Lauria–Valenti case, but police did not initially associate them, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs and were investigated by different local police precincts.|$|E
25|$|Ottawa’s three Talent {{units were}} built by Bombardier Transportation {{as part of}} a larger order for Deutsche Bahn’s {{regional}} network. The only significant difference between them and the German units is that their on-board toilets have been decommissioned. As well, the luggage racks have been blocked, although this <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a problem with the train's operation in Germany. Deutsche Bahn’s red-and-white colour scheme was similar enough to OC Transpo’s livery that the trains did not need to be repainted. The trains were purchased under an agreement under which they could be sold back to Bombardier if they were replaced or retired, but the agreement has since expired.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Rogers Hornsby, {{an alleged}} {{former member of}} the Ku Klux Klan, took over as manager of the Browns. Despite past accusations of racism, Hornsby was less {{hesitant}} to use Paige than Boudreau was four years before. Paige was so effective that when Hornsby was fired by Veeck, his successor Marty Marion <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> want to risk going more than three games without using Paige in some form. By July 4, with Paige having worked in 25 games, Casey Stengel named him to the American League All-Star team, making him the first black pitcher on an AL All-Star team. The All-Star game was cut short after five innings due to rain and Paige never got in. Stengel resolved to name him to the team the following year. Paige finished the year 12–10 with a 3.07 ERA for a team that lost ninety games.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E

A fellow performer {{on that show}} also auditioned for the part at {{what is now the}} Soho Theatre, then the old Soho Synagogue in Dean Street, and claimed that he would break Bathurst's legs if the latter got the job. In a 2005 interview, Bathurst recalls that the threat <b>seemed</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be entirely jocular.

Bathurst got the part and the pilot of Joking Apart was broadcast as an installment of the BBC 2 Comic Asides strand. It returned for two series in 1993 and 1995. Bathurst appeared as sitcom writer Mark Taylor in the series. After the first series was broadcast, a critic called Bathurst the [...] "Best Comedy Newcomer of 1993".|$|E

40|$|Introduction In the {{previous}} two chapters, we have ffl introduced the basic complexity classes, ffl summarized the known relationships between these classes, and ffl seen how reducibility and completeness {{can be used to}} establish tight links between natural computational problems and complexity classes.
