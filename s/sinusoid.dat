5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a <b>sinusoid.</b> Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled <b>sinusoid,</b> where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sinusoids</b> are an {{important}} type of periodic function, because realistic signals are often modeled as the summation of many <b>sinusoids</b> of different frequencies and different amplitudes (for example, with a Fourier series or transform). Understanding what aliasing does to the individual <b>sinusoids</b> is useful in understanding what happens to their sum.|$|R
50|$|If the {{waveform}} under analysis comprises two <b>sinusoids</b> {{of different}} frequencies, leakage {{can interfere with}} the ability to distinguish them spectrally. If their frequencies are dissimilar and one component is weaker, then leakage from the stronger component can obscure the weaker one's presence. But if the frequencies are similar, leakage can render them unresolvable even when the <b>sinusoids</b> are of equal strength. The rectangular window has excellent resolution characteristics for <b>sinusoids</b> of comparable strength, but it is a poor choice for <b>sinusoids</b> of disparate amplitudes. This characteristic is sometimes described as low dynamic range.|$|R

50|$|The {{main idea}} of {{stationary}} phase methods {{relies on the}} cancellation of <b>sinusoids</b> with rapidly varying phase. If many <b>sinusoids</b> have the same phase and they are added together, they will add constructively. If, however, these same <b>sinusoids</b> have phases which change rapidly as the frequency changes, they will add incoherently, varying between constructive and destructive addition at different times.|$|R
5000|$|Complex <b>sinusoids</b> are {{waveforms}} whose {{samples are}} complex numbers, {{and the concept}} of negative frequency is necessary to distinguish them. In that case, the frequencies of the aliases are given by just: [...] Therefore, as [...] increases from [...] to [...] goes from [...] up to 0. Consequently, complex <b>sinusoids</b> do not exhibit folding. Complex samples of real-valued <b>sinusoids</b> have zero-valued imaginary parts and do exhibit folding.|$|R
25|$|For example, for the Tschirnhausen cubic, {{there are}} two {{infinite}} arcs having the origin (0,0) as end point. This point is the only singular point of the curve. There are also two arcs having this singular point as one end point and having a second end point with a horizontal tangent. Finally, {{there are two}} other arcs each having one of these points with horizontal tangent as the first end point and having the unique point with vertical tangent as the second end point. In contrast, the <b>sinusoid</b> is certainly not an algebraic curve, having an infinite number of monotone arcs.|$|E
25|$|The cyclic prefix, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} during the guard interval, {{consists of the}} end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy {{of the end of}} the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of <b>sinusoid</b> cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT. In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of transmitted power, cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.|$|E
25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying <b>sinusoid.</b> If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.|$|E
40|$|Endotoxin, {{which is}} also called {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS), is a unique element of Gram-negative bacteria. Liver is the main site for removing bacteria and endotoxin. Meanwhile, {{it is also the}} most vulnerable organ. Liver injury initially occurs in the hepatic <b>sinusoids.</b> This article mainly introduces the impact of LPS on Kupffer cells, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, oxidant/antioxidant balance in the hepatic <b>sinusoids,</b> and liver blood flow.

40|$|Adhesion {{molecules}} {{known to}} be important for neutrophil recruitment in many other organs {{are not involved in}} recruitment of neutrophils into the <b>sinusoids</b> of the liver. The prevailing view is that neutrophils become physically trapped in inflamed liver <b>sinusoids.</b> In this study, we used a biopanning approach to identify hyaluronan (HA) as disproportionately expressed in the liver versus other organs under both basal and inflammatory conditions. Spinning disk intravital microscopy revealed that constitutive HA expression was restricted to liver <b>sinusoids.</b> Blocking CD 44 –HA interactions reduced neutrophil adhesion in the <b>sinusoids</b> of endotoxemic mice, with no effect on rolling or adhesion in postsinusoidal venules. Neutrophil but not endothelial CD 44 was required for adhesion in <b>sinusoids,</b> yet neutrophil CD 44 avidity for HA did not increase significantly in endotoxemia. Instead, activation of CD 44 –HA engagement via qualitative modification of HA was demonstrated by a dramatic induction of serum-derived HA-associated protein in <b>sinusoids</b> in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced hepatic injury was significantly reduced by blocking CD 44 –HA interactions. Administration of anti-CD 44 antibody 4 hours after LPS rapidly detached adherent neutrophils in <b>sinusoids</b> and improved sinusoidal perfusion in endotoxemic mice, revealing CD 44 as a potential therapeutic target in systemic inflammatory responses involving the liver...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sinusoids</b> {{are widely}} used to {{represent}} the oscillatory modes of musical instrument sounds in both analysis and synthesis. However, musical instrument sounds feature transients and instrumental noise that are poorly modeled with quasi-stationary <b>sinusoids,</b> requiring spectral decomposition and further dedicated modeling. In this work, we propose a full-band representation that fits <b>sinusoids</b> across the entire spectrum. We use the extended adaptive Quasi-Harmonic Model (eaQHM) to iteratively estimate amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM–FM) <b>sinusoids</b> able to capture challenging features such as sharp attacks, transients, and instrumental noise. We use the signal-to-reconstruction-error ratio (SRER) as the objective measure for the analysis and synthesis of 89 musical instrument sounds from different instrumental families. We compare against quasi-stationary <b>sinusoids</b> and exponentially damped <b>sinusoids.</b> First, we show that the SRER increases with adaptation in eaQHM. Then, we show that full-band modeling with eaQHM captures partials at the higher frequency {{end of the spectrum}} that are neglected by spectral decomposition. Finally, we demonstrate that a frame size equal to three periods of the fundamental frequency results in the highest SRER with AM–FM <b>sinusoids</b> from eaQHM. A listening test confirmed that the musical instrument sounds resynthesized from full-band analysis with eaQHM are virtually perceptually indistinguishable from the original recordings...|$|R
25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} (FT) decomposes {{a function}} of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. The Fourier transform of {{a function of}} time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic <b>sinusoid</b> in that frequency. The Fourier transform is called the frequency domain representation of the original signal. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time. The Fourier transform {{is not limited to}} functions of time, but {{in order to have a}} unified language, the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain. For many functions of practical interest, one can define an operation that reverses this: the inverse Fourier transformation, also called Fourier synthesis, of a frequency domain representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time.|$|E

40|$|Reprinted with permission. Evidence {{shows that}} {{leukocyte}} recruitment into inflamed liver <b>sinusoids</b> {{does not require}} selectins, with one notable exception: ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). We used intravital microscopy to directly visualize the liver microcirculation during I/R and localized endotoxemia (liver superfused with lipopolysaccharide). General anti-selectin therapy (fucoidan) or anti-adhesion therapy with an antithrombin inhibitor (hirudin) was also used. Many neutrophils rolled and adhered in postsinusoidal vessels and sequestered in the <b>sinusoids</b> during I/R and local endotoxin superfusion. Although fucoidan blocked rolling in both forms of inflammation, leukocyte recruitment into <b>sinusoids</b> was only blocked in I/R. Adhesion was also inhibited in postischemic <b>sinusoids</b> with a second anti-adhesive agent (hirudin). Because liver I/R inevitably induces ischemia upstream in the intestine, anti-selectin therapy may prevent intestinal injury, which could prevent downstream liver inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we completely removed the intestine and rerouted blood flow from the superior mesenteric artery to the superior mesenteric vein. I/R was induced in the liver microcirculation, and many leukocytes rolled and adhered in postsinusoidal venules and adhered in <b>sinusoids.</b> Although fucoidan significantly reduced the rolling in postsinusoidal vessels, adhesion persisted in the <b>sinusoids.</b> Our data suggest that anti-adhesion therapy is effective in liver I/R in the <b>sinusoids</b> and postsinusoidal venules, perhaps {{in part due to}} its beneficial effect on the intestine...|$|R

These periductal capillaries end by joining (a) interlobular veins, (b) terminal distributing veins, (c) <b>sinusoids</b> directly or, (d) <b>sinusoids</b> in common with branches of the portal vein. The capillaries arising from larger arterioles have well developed precapillary sphincters at their origins, while those arising from terminal arterioles have less prominent smooth muscle cuffs.
