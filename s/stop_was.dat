5|$|An {{additional}} tram <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} December 2016 in the Gogar area, between the Gyle Centre and Gogarburn tram stops. This stop, called Edinburgh Gateway, is built alongside a new railway {{station on the}} Fife Circle Line to form a transport interchange between Edinburgh Trams and the Fife Circle and Edinburgh to Aberdeen Lines.|$|E

5|$|By 1967, {{the band}} was {{traveling}} to performances in Redding's Beechcraft H18 aeroplane. On December 9, 1967, they appeared on the Upbeat television show produced in Cleveland. They played three concerts in two nights at a club called Leo's Casino. After a phone call {{with his wife and}} children, Redding's next <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Madison, Wisconsin; the next day, Sunday, December 10, they were to play at the Factory nightclub, near the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
50|$|The ejective and {{aspirated}} <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> articulated forcefully. The unaspirated voiceless <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> tense, {{while the}} voiced <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> lax.|$|R
50|$|Once the tuning <b>stop</b> <b>is</b> {{fully in}} tune with itself, {{the rest of the}} <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> tuned. Most <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> tuned to the tuning stop, though some <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> more easily tuned to stops other than a 4&prime; Principal.|$|R

5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the visit was to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons would be used to defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by Eisenhower and Dulles. He said the Americans would do so by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{announced}} on March 11, 2010 via his Twitter account {{that he would}} embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12. Even with the unconventional marketing campaign of a single Twitter announcement, many locations sold out {{within hours of the}} tweet and additional shows were added on to meet demand. During the tour, O'Brien announced that his new show, Conan, would debut on TBS in November 2010. A documentary following O'Brien during the tour, Conan O'Brien Can't <b>Stop,</b> <b>was</b> released in June 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Voss signed {{himself out}} on leave on his authority as Staffelführer. His first <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Berlin, {{where he was}} honored receiving an autographed photograph of Kaiser Wilhelm II from the emperor's own hands. From the 15th to the 17th, {{he was at the}} Fokker factory in Schwerin; he was accompanied by his girlfriend Ilse. His leave authorization also cleared him for Düsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited them. In any case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.|$|E

5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Yatton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, a <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> added at Yatton for a Royal Mail train {{to provide a more}} direct link to Bristol Airport. The service was ended in 2004 when the post office stopped transporting mail by train. When the railways were privatised in 1997, local services at Yatton were franchised to Wales & West, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, which was rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major difference from the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Admiral Jellicoe was {{tasked with}} helping {{to plan and}} {{coordinate}} the naval policies and defences of the British Dominions. New Zealand was made available for his transportation, and was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for the tour; the main changes were the removal of her flying-off platforms and the lower forward four-inch guns. The first <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> India, with New Zealand arriving in Bombay on 14 March 1919 and departing six weeks later. The battlecruiser arrived at Albany, Western Australia, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. New Zealand sailed via Melbourne and Hobart to depart from Sydney for New Zealand on 16 August.|$|E
5000|$|In dialects of {{northern}} Japan, standard voiced <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> prenasalized, and voiceless <b>stops</b> <b>are</b> voiced.

5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit {{stop on the}} 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen retired from the race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders had taken their stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane, triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the pit lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{construction}} {{began on}} a revamped Route 18 freeway through New Brunswick. The rebuild includes local and express lanes from Route 172 (George Street) to the interchange with Route 27 (Albany Street). Conti Enterprises was hired for the project, which was announced complete in August 2009 {{at a ceremony}} by governor Jon S. Corzine and Stephen Dilts, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation. During the construction, the New Street interchange and bridge were demolished and replaced. The area of the Paulus Boulevard intersection was upgraded for accessibility, and a bus <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> installed, but the roadway southbound is still three lanes at the traffic light. In adjacent Elmer Boyd Park a new entranceway and amphitheatre were added.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} sometimes serve {{military as}} well as commercial purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments. Canton Island Airport, for example, in the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), after serving as a military airport during World War II, {{was used as a}} refuelling stop by commercial aircraft such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s. The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non-stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii, meant that a mid-Pacific <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use. Other international airports, such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Jackson was {{eventually}} sent to Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan to help form the first Air Force Rifle Team and trained at Palm Beach Air Force Base in West Palm Beach, Florida {{during the winter}} months. His next international <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, where he took home gold in the 50 m rifle prone position with 60 (individual and team) and 40 shots (individual) and the bronze in the 300 m standard rifle (individual) and 50 m rifle prone position with 40 shots (team). He then traveled to the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 m rifle prone event and finished 12th {{in a field of}} 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions tournament. Upon his return to the United States, he discovered that he had been promoted to the rank of Captain.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc's next <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), {{where he}} resumed teaming with Paul LeDuc. Wrestling {{under the name}} The Canadian Lumberjacks, they were soon pushed to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in December 1973 by {{defeating}} Dusty Rhodes and Dick Slater. They defended the belts for two months before dropping them to Slater and his new partner Stan Vachon, a kayfabe brother of the Vachons from Montreal. This was the final time the LeDuc's held a title together, as Paul LeDuc sustained a legitimate injury that forced Jos to wrestle without him. Jos LeDuc also wrestled as a singles competitor in Florida. He was booked to win the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Rhodes in late 1973. He dropped the title to Rhodes in January 1974, however. LeDuc and Rhodes were placed in a heated feud at this time, and they frequently faced each other in Death matches.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2010, Rumble {{performed}} a free album launch {{concert at the}} Sky Tower in Auckland. The Experiment was released in New Zealand on 29 March 2010 by Rumble Music—Rumble's own record label—and Warner Music New Zealand. An Australian release followed on 1 April 2011, by Rumble Music and Hussle Recordings. Rumble embarked on The Edge Winter Jam: The Experiment Tour. Sponsored by radio station The Edge, it also featured appearances by J.Williams, Kidz in Space and Ivy Lies; it was later announced that American rapper B.o.B would join the line-up. The tour commenced on 15 July 2010 at Telstra Events Centre, Auckland. The second <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> at TSB Bank Arena, Wellington on 16 July, while the final show was on 17 July at Christchurch's Westpac Arena.

5|$|On 28 October 1999, Minister of Transport Dag Jostein Fjærvoll {{asked the}} {{directors}} of the three involved parties, Osmund Ueland of NSB, Sverre Quale of the inspectorate and Steinar Killi of the National Rail Administration, to meet at his office the following day if the issue was not resolved. The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E
5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard {{as if he had been}} studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next <b>stop</b> <b>was</b> Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
