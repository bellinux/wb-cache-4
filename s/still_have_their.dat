Under this grey stone is a red brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied {{for the first time}} ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. Near him are the remains of many De Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves.

After the Velvet Revolution, the armoury became the property of the university: it was then decided to accommodate the information centre in it. However, the building was in very poor condition and needed extensive reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|In Lower Brittany, {{the medieval}} style never totally disappeared. However, local {{innovations}} permitted some {{changes and the}} birth of a particular style. Its most distinctive feature is the parish close, which displays an elaborately decorated church surrounded by an entirely walled churchyard. Many villages <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> closes, they date from the 16th and 17th centuries and sometimes include an elaborately carved calvary sculpture.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the houses}} on the square <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> {{original}} coal holes and ornate cast iron covers. These small holes in the street outside each house lead to a coal house underneath the street. These elegantly solved {{the problem of how}} to quickly and cleanly deliver coal to the house, allowing the coal men to simply pull the hole open and empty their sacks of coal down through it hole. The basement of the house then had a doorway into the coal house, under the street.|$|E

Their sister organization, the Salem East India Marine Society (founded by Jonathan and John Hodges), created a museum which would eventually merge with the Essex Institute (which was founded by Edward Augustus Holyoke). Both museums have been connected to the tunnels for over 200 years.|$|E
25|$|Famous {{firms that}} were founded or had {{factories}} in Carlisle included Carr's of Carlisle (now part of United Biscuits), Kangol, Metal Box (now part of Crown Holdings) and Cowans Sheldon. Cowans Sheldon {{originated in the}} city in the mid 19th century and became one of the world's most important railway and marine engineering firms, manufacturing finally ceased in Carlisle in 1987. The Carr's and Metal Box factories are still going. The construction firm of John Laing and the hauliers Eddie Stobart Ltd. were also founded in Carlisle.

25|$|Brittany {{has a large}} {{quantity}} of medieval buildings. They include numerous Romanesque and French Gothic churches, usually built in local sandstone and granit, castles and half-timbered houses visible in villages, towns and cities. Several Breton towns <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> medieval walls, such as Guérande, Concarneau, Saint-Malo, Vannes, Fougères and Dinan. Major churches include Saint-Pol-de-Léon Cathedral, Tréguier Cathedral, Dol Cathedral, Nantes Cathedral and the Kreisker chapel. Most of the Breton castles were rebuilt between the 13th and the 15th century, such as the Château de Suscinio, the Château de Dinan, the Château de Combourg, the Château de Largoët, the Château de Tonquédec, the Josselin Castle and the Château de Trécesson. The most impressive castles can be seen {{along the border with}} France, where stand the Château de Fougères, the Château de Vitré, the Château de Châteaubriant and the Château de Clisson.|$|E

25|$|In Captain Carrot and the Final Ark (October 2007), {{written by}} Bill Morrison, with art by co-creator Scott Shaw, The Zoo Crew reunite {{in the midst}} of growing strife between the land and the sea creatures of Earth-26, sparked by Starro. Unfortunately, they {{encounter}} Starro and most of their powers are neutralized except for Pig Iron. Furthermore, that Earth is rendered uninhabitable and the Crew has an ocean liner loaded with refugees transported off the planet by the Just-A-Lot-Of-Animals. Unfortunately, the ship is accidentally sent to New Earth. Although the Justice League encounter the ship and land it safely, all the passengers, including The Crew are transformed into their animal forms indigenous to that Earth and, although they all apparently <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> human level intelligence, they are unable to speak. However, some time in the future, the Crew will discover that their powers have been restored. In Final Crisis #7, Captain Carrot is seen in the climactic battle with his humanity and powers restored, and Pig Iron is with him.|$|E
25|$|Burrolandia, or the Donkey Sanctuary of Mexico, is {{an animal}} shelter {{that specializes in}} donkeys and {{contains}} about twenty animals. Burrolandia was begun by the Flores family on land next to the family's home in 2006. It is not scenic, as donkeys wander around rusting 1940s era cars. Visitors are given donkey ears and tails to wear as they visit a small museum, along with papier-mâché burros. There are puppet shows and burro rides. Burroland is sustained by donations from visitors, local companies and international groups like Donkey Sanctuary in Britain. Despite the animals’ historical importance in Mexico, pick up trucks and tractors are preferred by farmers even in the poorest areas. While the animals may <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> place culturally, the lack of work has made them more of a burden than an asset. The donkey population plummeted from one million in 1991 to about 581,000 in 2007 as many were killed by their owners or sold to slaughterhouses. Another reason farmers {{get rid of the}} animals is that they are associated with backwardness, and now the animals are not even worth 500 pesos anymore. This has spawned the Otumba effort to create the sanctuary as well as other projects such as free veterinary care for those animals still on farms.|$|E
25|$|Several {{of these}} {{distinctive}} telephone boxes have been {{installed on the}} Norman, Oklahoma, campus of the University of Oklahoma, where they continue to serve their originally intended function. Elsewhere in the United States, a few have also been installed in downtown Glenview, Illinois. There is also one outside the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. A red telephone box {{can also be found}} on the Courthouse Square in Oxford, Mississippi. There are two in use in Tennessee. One is located on the square in Collierville, Tennessee, and the other is located next to Pepper Palace in The Village Shops shopping center in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. In Massachusetts, there is also a red telephone box in the student centre of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition, there is a red telephone box outside the town building (town hall/police station/post office) in the tiny mountain town of Rowe, Massachusetts, which is an original installation dating back to when the town of Rowe first got telephone service. Two red telephone boxes are on display at the World Showcase area of Disney's Epcot in Orlando, Florida, one located in the United Kingdom area and one in the Canada area. One is on display at English Gardens a Place for Weddings in Winter Park close to downtown Orlando.An original K6 can also be found outside of the Allied Building in Treasure Island, Florida. There are also a few red boxes at the Ellenton Outlet Mall, just off I-75, near Bradenton, Florida. These <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> original STD code cards in place and have working US payphone equipment. There is a red telephone box in Westminster Maryland on the corner of West Main Street and Rt. 27 outside of Johanson's Dining House.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} ban was welcomed by broadcasters. Michael Grade, who was then chief executive of Channel 4, said it had ended [...] "one of the most embarrassing attempts to censor coverage {{of the most important}} domestic political story of post-war years", while John Birt commented, [...] "We can once again apply normal and testing scrutiny to all sides in the debate". Sinn Féin also signalled their approval, but the ban's lifting was viewed with more caution by unionist politicians. Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party felt the decision was premature while the IRA remained an armed organisation. [...] "It gives de facto recognition to a body of men who <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> guns and bombs under the table, who still reserve the right to murder if they don't get their way".|$|E
500|$|The visitor {{today will}} find the shell {{of the church and}} monastic {{buildings}} around the cloister plus the abbot's house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot's house <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> vaults intact. Medieval heraldic polychrome tiles found on the site {{can be seen in the}} sacristy, and Henry III's foundation stone [...] remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of Netley and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an Ancient Monument protected by law.|$|E

500|$|Burcombe {{wanted to}} improve on the original's ship {{handling}} and introduce a new weapon, which led to new power-up ideas. Westcott {{said that it was}} a collaboration between the areas because of the strict deadline. The gameplay change that had most interest was what happened to ships that hit track edges. That ships stopped immediately in the original game was considered too harsh. It was desired that ships scraped the edges instead, and this took longer than expected to develop. Ghost vehicles were only featured in the European version because Atari had a patent on them from Hard Drivin' in the United States. The team wanted to make it possible to win races in any ship, and a challenge was to make them all feel different and to <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> worth. Months of work rebalancing the artificial intelligence was undertaken to ensure all vehicle and track settings were a challenge. Sony wanted a link-up feature, which proved difficult due to syncing issues and the frame rate differences between PAL and NTSC. Much extra content, such as harder tracks and a prototype ship, was added because, according to Westcott, the team were both enthusiastic and stressed, and described their development as [...] "a period of great energy and immense exhaustion at the same time".|$|E

The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel. The roof trusses, which date from the 15th and 17th centuries, are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered. [...] There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave (20th century additions), matching the window in the north wall of the chancel. [...] The east window, in the chancel, has three rounded lights set in a square frame; it dates from {{the latter part of the}} 16th century. [...] The windows <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> clear leaded glass but are now boarded up. There are no windows {{on the south side}}, which is the most exposed side. There is an empty bellcote on the roof at the west end of the nave.

500|$|The United States started {{exploring}} the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and {{the acquisition of}} the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{became interested in the}} canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as [...] "a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day." [...] Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins. They described the kivas as [...] "circular apartments sunk in the ground". Simpson briefly explored Chetro Ketl, documenting six of its round rooms and 124 rooms {{on the ground floor of}} the four-story building. He noted an especially well preserved room where [...] "the stone walls <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation." [...] Vivian credits Simpson's 1850 report detailing their brief exploration of the canyon and Richard H. Kern's lithographs as the beginning of Chacoan archeology. The scientific investigation of Chaco Canyon started when Richard Wetherill began his exploration of the canyon in 1895. Wetherill was well known for his discovery of some of the largest Ancestral Puebloan dwellings in Mesa Verde, and after an invitation from amateur archeologist Sidney Palmer to survey Chaco Canyon, organized a one-month expedition to the region. He secured financial backing for a full season soon afterward, and in 1896 full-scale excavations began at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
