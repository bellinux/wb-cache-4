The purpose of the structure is to prevent erosion in an open channel. The unsteadiness, or smoothness, of the water surface in the model basin was used as the criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of the structure for energy dissipation. The introduction of a short-pipe energy dissipater in the stilling basin has proven effective in dissipating energy. The stilling basin was designed for a fully <b>submerged</b> <b>pipe</b> outlet. The inflow pipe and the dissipator pipe were designed to be located on the same center line, at Y 1 /D 1 = 1. 5 above the stilling basin floor. The slit-width ratio, W/D 1, yielding the smoothest water surface was 0. 5 (W/D 1 = 0. 5). An optimum dissipator pipe diameter ratio of 2. 0 was established (D 2 /D 1 = 2. 0), while the optimum dissipator pipe length ratio was determined to be 1. 0 (L/D 1 = 1. 0). Three diameters of inlet pipe were used to determine scale effects. Within the accuracy of the measurements used in this study, no scale effects were detected. The expanding characteristics of a submerged jet were used in establishing the length of the stilling basin. Based on the dissipator pipe diameter ratio of 2. 0 (D 2 /D 1 = 2. 0) the stilling basin length ratio is 3. 5 (Lb/D 1 = 3. 5).

40|$|Improving {{methods of}} {{hydrocarbon}} production and developing new techniques {{for the creation}} of natural gas storage facilities are critically important for the petroleum industry. This dissertation focuses on two key topics: (1) mechanisms of sand production from petroleum reservoirs and (2) mechanical characterization of caverns created in carbonate rock formations for natural gas storage. Sand production is the migration of solid particles together with the hydrocarbons when extracted from petroleum reservoirs. It usually occurs from wells in sandstone formations that fail in response to stress changes caused by hydrocarbon withdrawal. Sand production is generally undesirable since it causes a variety of problems ranging from significant safety risks during high-rate gas production, to the erosion of downhole equipment and surface facilities. It is widely accepted that {{a better understanding of the}} mechanics of poorly-consolidated formations is required to manage sand production; which, in turn, enables the cost effective production of gas and oil resources. In this work, a series of large-scale laboratory experiments was conducted in fully saturated, cohesionless sand layers to model the behavior of a petroleum reservoir near a wellbore. We directly observed several key characteristics of the sand production phenomenon including the formations of a stable cavity around the wellbore and a sub-radial flow channel at the upper surface of the tested layer. The flow channel is a first-order feature that appears to be a major part of the sand production mechanism. The channel cross section is orders of magnitude larger than the particle size, and once formed, the channel becomes the dominant conduit for fluid flow and particle transport. The flow channel developed in all of our experiments, and in all experiments, sand production continued from the developing channel after the cavity around the borehole stabilized. Our laboratory results constitute a well constrained data set that can be used to test and calibrate numerical models employed by the petroleum industry for predicting the sand production phenomenon. Although important for practical applications, real field cases are typically much less constrained. We used scaling considerations to develop a simple analytical model, constrained by our experimental results. We also simulated the behavior of a sand layer around a wellbore using two- and three-dimensional discrete element methods. It appears that the main sand production features observed in the laboratory experiments, can indeed be reproduced by means of discrete element modeling. Numerical results indicate that the cavity surface of repose is a key factor in the sand production mechanism. In particular, the sand particles on this surface are not significantly constrained. This lack of confinement reduces the flow velocity required to remove a particle, by many orders of magnitude. Also, the mechanism of channel development in the upper fraction of the sample can be attributed to subsidence of the formation due to lateral extension when an unconstrained cavity slope appears near the wellbore. This is substantiated by the erosion process and continued production of particles from the flow channel. The notion of the existence of this surface channel has the potential to scale up to natural reservoirs and can give insights into real-world sand production issues. It indicates a mechanism explaining why the production of particles does not cease in many petroleum reservoirs. Although the radial character of the fluid flow eventually stops sand production from the cavity near the wellbore, the production of particles still may continue from the propagating surface (interface) flow channel. The second topic of the thesis addresses factors affecting the geometry and, hence, the mechanical stability of caverns excavated in carbonate rock formations for natural gas storage. Storage facilities are required to store gas when supply exceeds demand during the winter months. In many places (such as New England or the Great Lakes region) where no salt domes are available to create gas storage caverns, it is possible to create cavities in limestone employing the acid injection method. In this method, carbonate rock is dissolved, while CO₂ and calcium chloride brine appear as products of the carbonate dissolution reactions. Driven by the density difference, CO₂ rises towards the ceiling whereas the brine sinks to the bottom of the cavern. A zone of mixed CO₂, acid, and brine forms near the source of acid injection, whereas the brine sinks to the bottom of the cavern. Characterization of the cavern shape is required to understand stress changes during the cavity excavation, which can destabilize the cavern. It is also important to determine the location of the mixture-brine interface to select the place of acid injection. In this work, we propose to characterize the geometry of the cavern and the location of the mixture-brine interface by generating pressure waves in a pipe extending into the cavern, and measuring the reflected waves at various locations in another adjacent pipe. Conventional governing equations describe fluid transients in pipes loaded only by internal pressure (such as in the water hammer effect). To model the pressure wave propagation for realistic geometries, we derived new governing equations for pressure transients in pipes subjected to changes in both internal and external (confining) pressures. This is important because the internal pressure (used in the measurement) is changing in response to the perturbation of the external pressure when the pipe is contained in the cavern filled with fluids. If the pressure in the cavern is perturbed, the perturbation creates an internal pressure wave in the <b>submerged</b> <b>pipe</b> that has a signature of the cavern geometry. We showed that the classic equations are included in our formulation as a particular case, but they have limited validity for some practically important combinations of the controlling parameters. We linearized the governing equations and formulated appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Using a finite element method, we solved the obtained boundary value problem for a system of pipes and a cavern filled with various characteristic fluids such as aqueous acid, calcium chloride brine, and supercritical CO₂. We found that the pressure waves of moderate amplitudes would create measurable pressure pulses in the <b>submerged</b> <b>pipe.</b> Furthermore, we determined the wavelengths required for resolving the cavern diameter from the pressure history. Our results suggest that the pressure transients technique can indeed be used for characterizing the geometry of gas storage caverns and locations of fluid interfaces in the acid injection method.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyThis {{paper is}} based upon the project of {{renewing}} of Waste Water Treatment plant in Bykle Commune in Aust Agder, Norway. It has been decided {{that it is necessary to}} build a new plant to meet the load as well as requirements for treatment. The new plant is to be located in Hovden at the newly developed industrial area in the southern part of the lake Hartevann. The commune has decided to build a common plant for “Midregion” of the commune as well as Hovden. The sewage from Hovden will have to be pumped to the Industrial are by means of a <b>submerged</b> <b>pipe.</b> The fluid from the “Midregion” requires new sewage lines for transferring of the fluid over a distance of 18 km. with an elevation of 150 m. utilizing pumping stations incorporating buffer and storage tanks. The “Midregion” consists mainly of Vacation Homes where in vacation season the occupation is approximately 70 %. There are less than 50 permanent residences in the “Midregion”. The “Midregion” does not today have common water supply but consists of private wells as well as small pumping stations of water. In the NIVA Report from 2003 [Ref. :App. E] it is mentioned that in some area is not allowed for cabins to have an external water supply from private well or other source. The Commune intends to link all residential homes and cabins with a water supply from Hovden waterworks. The excavated ditch for the waterline will also contain the Sewage/fluid piping. The ditch has to be excavated at a minimum of 18 km in variable geological conditions ranging from gravel, more to solid rock. Hovden and the “Midregion” are facing the same challenge of an extensive variation of load as is common for all Vacation communities. The difficulty is evident when a small local population is to maintain a properly functioning sewage plant that can within the framework of national requirements meet the variation with proper cleaning. This paper is setting out to clarify the variable load problem by looking at available technology as well as assessing the communities’ decision of technology to be used. The paper further focuses on the environmental as well as the economic impact and consequences of the communes’ final decision. This paper further gives a conclusive advice to Bykle Commune in the aspects of plant and the economic impact. For the matter of accuracy some reports used for this paper is presented in original in Norwegian. The assessment papers are attaches as well as discussion with the communes’ consultant from Sweco Norge AS. The conclusion of this investigation and verification is that the “Midregion” should not be connected to a common plant at the Industrial Area in Hovden. It is both Environmentally and Economic advisable to build several Biodisk Sewage Plants using diffusion beds as receptacles for the effluent and letting the Biotope Biologically perform the end task of cleaning without any outlet into rivers or lakes. At the Hovden area it points itself out as the only solution both environmentally and economically to use the BioBooster from Grundfos of Denmark. The BioBooster can handle the variable load as well as the future expansion without large construction and unnecessary economic cost of concrete tank and building. The BioBooster using a ultra filtration membrane gives a total cleaning result and a extremely clean effluent. (See final paper “Hovden Renseanlegg. Kort Assessment.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{three issues}} regarding modeling of oshore pipelaying dynamics. These are: (i) {{the formulation of}} an oshore pipeline installation operation as a control problem, (ii) the development and passivity analysis of a robotic pipe model for a <b>submerged</b> <b>pipe</b> string, suitable for real{time applications in closed{ loop control systems, and (iii) the development and validation of a nonlinear FEM model for simulation {{and control of the}} elastic pipeline dynamics, including FEM dynamics of a pipeline combined with vessel dynamics, for simulation and control of pipelay operations under dynamic positioning. Pipeline installation is de ned as the operation of positioning a pipeline along a reference path on the seabed from a surface vessel. In control terms, this can be stated as a path{following control problem, where the pipe touchdown point tracks the reference path. However, the only controllers for the touchdown point are the pay{out of pipe into the water, and the motion of the surface vessel. Considering that the pipe is an elastic body, and that both the pipe and the vessel are subject to environmental loads, the control problem that must be considered is a dynamic target{tracking problem, where the surface vessel must track a moving target position on the surface in order to control the position of the touchdown point. A target{tracking controller may be implemented as a guidance system, by extending the dynamic positioning system that is common for pipelay vessels. An important component in the guidance system is the dynamic pipe model mapping touchdown and surface vessel position. Motivated by robotics, a compact system formulation is derived for the suspended pipeline by considering it as a hyper{redundant manipulator with an arbitrary number of links. This model captures the main dynamics of the pipe, including its geometric con guration and top tension. The model is in the state{ space, and on a vectorial form using minimal coordinates. A passivity analysis establishing input{output passivity of the system is performed. This model is applicable in simulations where the main dynamics are required, and the available computation time is limited. Static and dynamic analysis of pipelines during installation is characterized by a combination of geometrical nonlinearities and extreme exibilities of the system. A nonlinear PDE formulation for the pipeline is developed based on a three{ dimensional elastic beam model, taking into account the internal forces of longitudinal extension, shearing, twist and bending, as well as external loads from gravity, buoyancy, hydrodynamic drag, seabed interaction, and environmental loads. This highly exible system is then coupled to a dynamic model of the pipelay vessel. A passivity analysis establishing input{output passivity of these systems separately, and combined, is performed. A nonlinear FEM model, based on exact kinematics, is derived to approximate the solution of the PDE pipe formulation. The weak formulation of the PDE is semi{discretized in the curve parameter into a nite dimensional space to obtain an explicit set of ordinary dierential equations. This semi{discretized model is solved by using standard integrators for time. The set of ordinary dierential equations is a convenient representation for simulation and control of pipelay operations under dynamic positioning. The model is successfully validated against the natural catenary and the commercial FEM code RIFLEX. The model has potentially numerous applications in dynamical analysis, in control system design and simulation, and in tools for training and decision support.

It is also well known that passive means of decreasing the noise level, especially at low frequencies are generally not very effective.

Fuller et al 1997). Our interest resides mainly in the technological aspects of fluid-loading of a submerged vibrating structure {{in the range of}} frequencies where the compressibility of the fluid medium should be taken into account.

50|$|Staff {{from the}} Marine Mammal Center, researchers, Coast Guard personnel, and volunteers tried several methods to coax Delta and Dawn back downriver. The Marine Mammal Center was {{appointed}} by the California Office of Emergency Services as the lead rescue agency. Officials played recordings of the sounds of other humpback whales feeding and socializing to lure them, and banged on <b>submerged</b> metal <b>pipes</b> and sprayed high-powered blasts of water to repel them, {{but it is not}} clear whether any of these were particularly effective. There was heightened concern for the whales' well-being this time, because both of them had sizable gash wounds, most likely made from boat keel or propeller strikes. Veterinarians from the Marine Mammal Center and WHOI administered antibiotics to the whales to help heal these deep open wounds, and they took samples of skin lesions incurred during the whales' extended time away from seawater to analyze them for possible freshwater bacterial infection. This was the first time antibiotics had been administered to free swimming whales in the wild.|$|R
40|$|Experiments injecting liquid {{nitrogen}} {{into the water}} jet, which focused on their differences between both of boiling temperatures, were carried out to improve the thrust from nozzle water flow. Effects of jet acceleration were evaluated {{by means of the}} measurements of thrust loads added on the convergent-divergent nozzle connecting with or without the parallel <b>pipe</b> <b>submerged</b> into the water tank. The characteristics of liquid-vapor two-phase nozzle flow appeared to be somewhat compressible fluid because of the explosive vaporization of {{liquid nitrogen}}, so that considerable increment of water acceleration at the part of divergent region of nozzle resulted in apparently higher thrust by exhaust jet from the nozzle...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} 3 D nonlinear dynamic {{problem of}} an extensible, <b>submerged</b> catenary <b>pipe</b> conveying fluid is considered. For describing {{the dynamics of}} the system, the Newtonian derivation procedure is followed. The flow inside the pipe is considered inviscid, irrotational and incompressible with constant velocity along the complete length of the pipe. The hydrodynamic effects are taken into account through the nonlinear drag forces and the added inertia due to the hydrodynamic mass. Following the Newtonian derivation, {{the dynamics of the}} pipe element and the fluid element are considered separately and the final governing set is derived combining the equations of inertia equilibrium. The system is solved using an efficient, second-order accurate, finite differences numerical scheme. The effect of the steady flow inside the pipe on both the in-plane and the out-of-plane vibrations is assessed with the aid of numerical simulations using as a model a relatively small-sag submerged catenary. The output signals of the time varying components that govern the dynamics of the pipe, have been properly processed to assess the effect of the internal flow on both the in-plane and the out-of-plane vibrations.

5000|$|The song {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from music critics; many {{compared it to}} a Prince composition. Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "insidiously, almost obscenely hooky: a slithering riff on early-'80s Prince with a monster synth line." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated that [...] "The superb Prince hommages, [...] "Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "This Bed," [...] are experiments that pay off big, <b>submerging</b> Keys' <b>pipes</b> in unabashed 1980s synth cheese." [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH {{referred to it as}} a [...] "fever dream", citing it as a [...] "standout moment" [...] while Clover Hopes of Vibe magazine praised the song as [...] "instantly timeless" [...] and described it as a [...] "gorgeous drum-powered exercise in vocal discipline (with its whispered huffs and puffs) that deals with the loss of a man's mere presence". Dan Weiss of Popmatters, gave the song a seven out of ten rating and thought that [...] ""Sleeping" [...] is proof that Keys can find the warmth inside of a song even when she pushes away from the piano and the arrangement drifts into something colder and more abstract." ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{measuring}} heat flux {{of boiling water}} is designed and built to study critical heat flux (CHF) and observe the response of a heat flux sensor when CHF occurs. A high temperature heat flux sensor {{is embedded in the}} wall of a pipe to get a direct measurement of the surface heat flux and sensor temperature. By <b>submerging</b> the <b>pipe</b> in water and applying a controlled heat flux to the inside diameter over the area where the sensor is located, boiling is created on the outer surface while measuring the heat flux. The heat flux is gradually increased up to CHF and the heat flux response is observed to determine if the heat flux sensor could sense CHF when it occurred. The heat flux sensor is able to consistently measure the value for CHF, which is approximately 510 kW/m for this system. It is also observed during the experiments that the heat flux response undergoes an inflection of the heat transfer coefficient at a consistent temperature just before reaching CHF. This observed inflection caused the heat flux response to deviate from its cubic relationship with the temperature and drastically increase for a very small change in temperature. This inflection response can be used as an indication fo...|$|R
