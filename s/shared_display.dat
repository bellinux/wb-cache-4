40|$|Large screen <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> are a {{standard}} fixture {{in almost all}} command centers, but are generally under-utilized. Many problems stem {{from the fact that}} these displays are repeater displays from individual workstations. Scaling from workstation display to large screen display does not guarantee that text will be large enough to be visible to all users. Color reproduction on projection displays does not automatically match that on workstation displays; text and symbology overlays on maps are often not discernible. Because the <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> are repeaters, the operator’s navigation and control icons, menus and pallets are visible on the <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> and obstruct the view of <b>displayed</b> information. <b>Shared</b> <b>displays</b> often present what is called a common operating picture, or COP. The COP should be the basis of a common operational understanding, but they are often too cluttered, yet lack useful information. In today’s complex environment of asymmetric warfare, effects-based operations and coalition forces, decision quality information is needed to support collaboration and synchronization of operations. This means delivering the right information at the right time in a clearly visible and easily understandable format that supports cognitive processes associated with decision making and collaboration. The present paper will discuss perceptual and cognitive issues associated with <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> and COPs in command centers. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{tremendous}} amount of information is produced {{in the world around}} us, both as a product of our daily lives and as artifacts of our everyday work. An emerging area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on helping individuals manage this flood of information. Prior research shows that multiple displays can improve an individual user's ability to deal with large amounts of information, but it is unclear whether these advantages extend for teams of people. This is particularly relevant as more employees are spending large portions of their workdays in meetings My contribution to HCI research is empirical fieldwork and laboratory studies investigating how multiple <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> improve aspects of teamwork. In particular, I present an insight-based evaluation method for analyzing how teams collaborate on a data-intensive sensemaking task. Using this method, I show how the presence and location of multiple <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> impacted the meeting process with respect to performance, collaboration, and satisfaction. I also illustrate how multiple <b>shared</b> <b>displays</b> engaged team members who might not have otherwise contributed to the collaboration process. Finally, I present Mimosa, a software tool developed to visualize large volumes of time series data. Mimosa combines aspects of information visualization with data analysis, facilitating a deep and iterative exploration of relationships within large datasets. Ph. D.

40|$|Shared {{displays}} {{are important}} tools for promoting collaboration. Ubiquitous computing presents new {{requirements for the}} design of <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> systems. Contextualisation of information at shared displays is becoming more important. The ability to rapidly create <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> systems is motivated by the fact that shared displays play central roles in collaboration. Low level implementation issues, common to <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> systems can be an obstacle for this. A toolkit for creation of such systems is therefore needed to provide basic <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> functionality to developers. This master thesis presents a toolkit for creating <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> applications on UbiCollab, a platform supporting collaborative work in ubiquitous environments. The work shows the development of the toolkit and how the toolkit can be used to create a <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> system.

Hence, these patterns support the comprehensiveness of both the interaction design and implementation while easing code modification for groupware application. Groupware is used to describe {{a broad range of}} technologies that support person-to-person collaboration. How to design and develop a groupware in an effective manner remains a research question worth exploring. This paper introduces a reusable method, patterns, to develop a single <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> application. Nine different interactive patterns that allow participants to interact collaboratively or noncollaboratively in a single <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> application are introduced in this paper. This is followed by the presentation of our quantitative results on the usability of the interactive patterns and the reusability of the patterns in designing and maintaining a single <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> application.

Furthermore, we often acquire content for a spe-cific purpose, i. e., {{the acquisition of}} a phone number to place a call. We have developed a content transfer concept, Eye Drop. Eye Drop provides techniques that allow fluid con-tent acquisition, transfer from <b>shared</b> <b>displays,</b> and local positioning on personal devices using gaze combined with manual input. The eyes naturally focus on content we de-sire. Our techniques use gaze to point remotely, removing the need for explicit pointing on the user’s part. A manual trigger from a personal device confirms selection. Transfer is performed using gaze or manual input to smoothly transi-tion content to a specific location on a personal device. This work demonstrates how techniques {{can be applied to}} acquire and apply actions to content through a natural sequence of interaction.

40|$|Abstract. When several users {{interact}} with Single Display Groupware (SDG) (Stewart et al., 1999) applications over a <b>shared</b> <b>display,</b> the potential exists for one user’s actions to spatially interfere with another’s (Tse et al., 2004; Zanella and Greenberg, 2001). We empirically evaluate four techniques for mitigating spatial interference in SDG: <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> with object ownership, spatially split display, <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> with uniform transparency between users ’ data, and <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> with gradient transparency from one {{edge of the}} display to the other. Apart from time and error performance measures, we also consider the impact of each technique on user’s voluntary partitioning of the available display space. Results show that the best approach in terms of performance is to share the entire display with appropriate use of transparency techniques for minimizing interference, and allow users to decide for themselves how they wish to partition the space, rather than pre-partitioning it for them. Results also show that complete sharing may result in misuse of screen space and demonstrate the potential of gradient transparency as a technique that effectively balances {{costs and benefits of}} both sharing and partitioning...|$|E

40|$|When using mobile {{devices in}} support of {{learning}} activities, students gain mobility, but problems arise when group members share information. The small size of the mobile device screen becomes problematic when it is being used by two or more students to share and exchange information. This problem affects interactions among group members. To overcome the information sharing problem, the concept of <b>Shared</b> <b>Display</b> Groupware (SDG) has been proposed to support face-to-face collaboration using a <b>shared</b> <b>display.</b> However, little attention had been paid on {{the integration of the}} <b>shared</b> <b>display</b> with mobile devices in order to design a learning activity in the mobile learning environment.
