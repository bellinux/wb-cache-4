This method is known to improve livestock yields. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} in combination with grass to create protein-rich hay, or used for soil conservation. To improve soil, Macroptilium atropurpureum can be planted to improve nutrient-soil quality before planting something else. Once growing season is over, Macroptilium atropurpureum or its trimmings ideally will be left on the farmers’ field to act as a fallow (no work necessary) cover crop to prevent soil erosion. One problem with this method is that some seeds may be left in the soil, as the vine will reproduce on its own, dispersing seeds randomly into the soil. Macroptilium atropurpureum is very adaptable to <b>soil,</b> <b>drought</b> resistant, has good N fixation, and has a high palatability to domesticated animals.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to nitrogen {{as a factor}} of plant biomass partitioning, other environmental stressors such as water availability play a role. For example, plants that are growing in dry conditions often have a decreased total biomass production but they also contribute more of their biomass to the roots and develop a higher root:shoot. When plants allocate more of their biomass to their roots, {{they are able to}} enhance water absorption by tapping further down into the water table as well as extending further laterally with the aid of increased root hairs. But, when there is an extreme <b>soil</b> <b>drought,</b> there is not an increase in root:shoot biomass. This suggests that {{there is a limit to}} which plant biomass allocation responds to water stress and possibly other environmental factors as well. It is important for plants to be able to balance their absorption and utilization processes with differing water and nitrogen availabilities because they adjust their growth in order to accommodate the abundances of growth-limiting resources, such as water and nitrogen.|$|E

It was found that <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> causes an increase in lipid peroxidation both in Omskaya 33 and Tamoz 2. Stevioside more strongly reduced the content of malonic dialdehyde against the background of water stress in Omskaya 33 that showed more active lipid peroxidation processes during drought. To determine the effectiveness of the antioxidant system in plant cells under drought conditions, the activity of antioxidant enzymes of ascorbate peroxidase, soluble peroxidase and catalase, as well as the content of a nonenzymatic antioxidant proline were determined. <b>Soil</b> <b>drought</b> stimulated the activity of the antioxidant enzymes studied.

Here {{we tested the}} colonisation rates of soil-borne AMF and EMF after <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> treatments. Methods Forest and meadow soils were mixed to include AMF and EMF propagules. There were three soil treatments: soil moisture corresponding to 60 % (control) or 10 % in mass of maximum water retention, or air-dry. The bait plants were EM-forming silver birch (Betula pendula), dual-mycorrhiza forming grey alder (Alnus incana) and AM-forming white clover (Trifolium repens). After re-watering, bait plants were sown and grown in a growth chamber in favourable conditions. This way, hostplant responses to drought were eliminated. Results Previous <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> decreased EM colonisation in alder. The spore formation by AMF in clover was negatively affected after the most severe <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> treatment, suggesting slightly retarded AM formation.

40|$|In {{the context}} of global {{environmental}} changes, better understanding of tree response to <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> in young mixed species stands is needed to anticipate forest adaptation and management practices for the future. We investigated the functional response of five co-occurring broad-leaved tree species growing in a 15 - to 25 -year-old mixed stand in northeastern France during the 2006 summer drought. We measured functional traits related to water acquisition (phenology, rooting pattern and vulnerability of xylem to cavitation) and the ecophysiological response (sap flux density, leaf water potential) of these species to soil water shortage. Our study highlights contrasted drought response strategies among these species and a trade-off between leaf phenology, resistance of xylem to cavitation and root system depth.

40|$|A {{variety of}} indices {{have been used}} to measure soil and crop drought for {{irrigation}} scheduling. However, simple indices with physiological mechanisms from soil water content are still expected. Based on the water flow and supply in a soil-plant continuum, we examined the concepts of <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> intensity and drought degree and found an empirical correlation between soil water storage and depletion in a given layer. Accordingly, an index of <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> intensity (I) and degree (D) was established using the soil water data obtained from a field experiment conducted in Xianning, Hubei, China. Corn plants (Zea mays L., Yedan 13) were grown at field plots under a movable rain shelter. From the V 6 stage to R 1 stage, the corn plants were grown under seven soil water deficit levels, by no irrigation applied for 0 - 36 days in 2005 and 0 - 32 days in 2006. At the end of the irrigation withholding period, it was found that soil water below 70 cm still remained at high level, but the soil water was not easily transported to the root zone in the upper layer. The daily values of I in different soil layers reflected the soil water depletion rates in the drying course. The values of D in different soil layers, which were calculated from I, increased with the progressive soil drying course. The D index in different soil layers not only revealed the drought severity of the layer, but it was also inversely correlated with corn yields when D was less than the threshold values. When D went beyond the thresholds, for example 0. 68 in 2005 (soil dried 25 days) and 0. 70 in 2006 (soil dried 17 days) in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer, the corn yield was reduced significantly. Based on soil water changes, index D is the comprehensive result of antecedent soil water condition, crop growth and root development, soil properties, and potential atmospheric evaporation. It is also comparable to the development of drought hazard on a crop. The results suggest that <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> degree D, together with I, can be an index for monitoring and evaluating soil-crop drought, as well as complementing the crop water stress index (CWSI) in irrigation scheduling.

The aim of this work was to study the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> and the tapping of latex on the water relations of rubber trees. This study distinguished between untapped trees and trees affected by tapping activity. The experiment was conducted on 14 - 15 year-old rubber trees from the clone, RRIM 600, at the Chachoengsao Rubber Research Center (CRRC). Climatic measurement, soil water content, predawn and midday leaf water potential, stand transpiration and percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) were measured from January 2009 to January 2010, especially in the dry season. Under drought conditions, during the rainy season, stand transpiration and predawn leaf water potential decreased in response to <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> in August. The midday leaf water potential and PLC did not change following soil water stress. In the dry season, the plant water status was related to climatic variables and <b>soil</b> <b>drought.</b> The results indicated that drought induces {{a reduction in the}} plant water status of rubber trees.

The results showed that water potential, water content, photosynthetic rate, WUE of leaves, and plant growth rate decreased significantly with reduction in soil water content. At the level of adequate and medium soil water content, rapid growth and biomass accumulation in poplar occurred during May and June, whereas this phenomenon occurred only during May under severe <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> condition. Total {{water consumption}} and biomass growth were the greatest under adequate soil water condition, decreased under medium <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> condition, and lowest under severe <b>soil</b> <b>drought</b> condition. Total WUE was the highest under medium soil water condition and lowest under severe soil condition. Changing patterns of water consumption for daily rate, every 10 -day rate, and month rate were quite different under these three soil water regimes. For all these three treatments, the highest monthly water consumption rate occurred during July and June. The highest water consumption over a 10 -day period was during in the second 10 days of July, the first 10 days of July, and the last 10 days of June for these three treatments, respectively. The day for the highest water consumption in the medium and severe drought treatments occurred I or 2 months earlier than the adequate soil water treatment. The daily time for the greatest water consumption was different throughout {{the life span of}} poplar under these soil water levels.
