Recent work on searching objects and its closeness to other objects was presented as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor search technique. In <b>superseding</b> neighbor search, one of all other objects in the spatial database, which was more close to the querying point is called as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object. However there are cases where no object was unavailable to <b>supersede</b> to all other nearest neighbor object, ambiguity arises. To overcomes the situation of ambiguity, in this paper Marginal Object Weight(MOW) is introduced to all nearest neighbor object for any respective query point, from there on most highly ranked object is identified as <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object. The performance of MOW ranking on nearest neighbor search is carried out for optimal amount of query point in the spatial databases of real and synthetic dataset. The <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object obtained with MOW ranking scheme identify more optimal to the query points {{compared to that of}} unranked <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor object search scheme...|$|R

40|$|When agents violate norms, {{they are}} {{typically}} {{judged to be}} more of a cause of resulting outcomes. In this paper, we suggest that norm violations also affect the causality attributed to other agents, a phenomenon we refer to as ‘‘causal <b>superseding.</b> ’’ We propose and test a counterfactual reasoning model of this phenomenon in four experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 provide an initial demonstration of the causal <b>superseding</b> effect and distinguish it from previously studied effects. Experiment 3 shows that this causal <b>superseding</b> effect is dependent on a particular event structure, following a prediction of our counterfactual model. Experiment 4 demonstrates that causal <b>superseding</b> can occur with violations of non-moral norms. We propose a model of the <b>superseding</b> effect based on the idea of counterfactual sufficiency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new problem, called <b>superseding</b> nearest {{neighbor}} search, on uncertain spatial databases, where each object {{is described by}} a multidimensional probability density function. Given a query point q, an object is a nearest neighbor (NN) candidate {{if it has a}} non-zero probability to be the NN of q. Given two NN candidates o 1 and o 2, o 1 <b>supersedes</b> o 2 if o 1 {{is more likely to be}} closer to q. An object is a <b>superseding</b> nearest neighbor (SNN) of q, if it <b>supersedes</b> all the other NN-candidates. Sometimes no object is able to <b>supersede</b> every other NN candidate. In this case, we return the SNNcore — the minimum set of NN-candidates each of which <b>supersedes</b> all the NN-candidates outside the SNN-core. Intuitively, the SNN-core contains the best objects, because any object outside the SNN-core is worse than all the objects in the SNN-core. We show that the SNN-core can be efficiently computed by utilizing a conventional multidimensional index, as confirmed by extensive experiments...|$|R

5|$|Vashon was <b>superseded</b> on 26 March 1801, and the {{following}} day Captain Edward Brace arrived to take command. Neptune became the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Gambier during this period. Brace's period of command was brief, he was <b>superseded</b> by Captain Francis Austen on 12 September. With the draw down in hostilities prior to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, Neptune was one of the many ships of the Mediterranean fleet to be ordered home, arriving at Portsmouth on 24 February. Austen paid her off on 29 April, but recommissioned her the next day. Neptune then underwent a brief refit, during which £5,728 was expended, £2,895 of which was spent on her hull, masts and yards. Austen was <b>superseded</b> on 30 September 1802 and {{the following}} day Captain William O'Bryen Drury took command. With Neptune fully refitted and stored, she sailed from the dockyard and joined the Channel Fleet at Spithead on 29 October.|$|E
