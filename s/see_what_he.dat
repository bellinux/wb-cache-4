5|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a {{hallucination}}. Macbeth {{had already seen}} a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E

During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E

One of their trysts is accidentally recorded and Scott Griffin (Eamonn George) finds it and shows at Charlie's. Ringo is devastated and leaves for Sydney. Donna begins university and during her second lecture, Saffron turns up as a guest speaker. Saffron turns Donna's classmates against her, but Donna stands up to her. While going through her mother's diary, Donna discovers {{that there are two}} men, Nick Nixon and Nicholas McKay, who could be her biological father. She contacts them both and she gets a job in Nick Nixon's restaurant to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is like and she eventually tells him that she might be his daughter. They take a DNA test, which confirms that they are related. Donna tries to be nice to Ringo's new girlfriend, Naomi (Kate Bell), but she struggles. Ringo breaks up with Naomi and Donna discovers that Naomi has been following her. Naomi's trashes Donna's university project and steals her own medical file from the hospital. Donna is arrested, but Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) and Ringo find the file at Naomi's house and Donna is released.|$|E

25|$|Edward III {{continued}} {{to focus on}} France, though he made clear his intentions of addressing Scotland when time permitted. But {{at the same time}} that Edward III was considering how best to deal with the French, the French were continuing to pour supplies into Scotland, and as the year progressed the Scottish forces began to encroach even into northern England, laying waste to Cumberland. Such actions forced Edward III to take the Scottish threat seriously, and in October he sent William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, to Scotland to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do to contain the situation.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even these}} {{seemingly}} conciliatory gestures did not quell unease by his critics at his election. Some {{have pointed out}} that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC.

25|$|In 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg {{was taken}} by a source, William Youngworth, an antiques dealer who {{had served as a}} fence for property stolen by Connor and Donati, among others, to a Brooklyn warehouse where he was allowed to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed to be Storm on the Sea of Galilee; tests of paint chips he was allowed to take were only able to demonstrate that it dated from that era. It is the only possible sighting of any of the stolen works since the theft. Youngworth told Mashberg that Donati and Houghton had masterminded the theft, with Donati as one of the two fake police officers in the museum and Houghton driving the van the works were loaded into.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} {{puzzled by}} all this. But they were all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} it was all right. Then the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But {{it was too late}} then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E
25|$|Dessalines and Pétion {{remained}} {{allied with}} France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and {{fought against the}} French. As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do as an actor, and this is a character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|Pérez {{moved up}} to the double-AA New Haven Ravens where he batted [...]253 and {{improved}} his fielding percentage to [...]967 and was considered the Rockies' top prospect at shortstop. The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox {{at the end of}} the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year. In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to [...]316. Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor: [...] "He is the guy who had the year that traditionally earns a call up. I want to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can do." [...] Pérez hit [...]156 over 17 games and returned to the Sky Sox for the beginning of the 1997 season.|$|E

[...] He viewed Howe's defenses as essentially sound, but a local slave told him that there was a path through the swamp on Howe's right. [...] Campbell ordered Sir James Baird to take 350 light infantry and 250 New York Loyalists and follow the slave through the swamp, while he arrayed his troops just out of view {{in a way that would}} give the impression he would attempt a flanking maneuver on Howe's left. [...] One of his officers climbed a tree to observe Baird's progress. [...] True to the slave's word, the trail came out near the Continental barracks, which had been left unguarded; the Continentals were unaware they had been flanked. [...] When they reached position, the man in the tree signaled by waving his hat, and Campbell ordered the regulars to charge.|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2016, it was {{reported}} that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. John Carpenter is set to executive produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things. I’ll have to see the movie to see what it requires." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.

As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears.

After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing.
