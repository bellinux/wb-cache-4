2500|$|A better {{approach}} {{replaces the}} rectangles {{used in a}} Riemann sum with trapezoids. The trapezoid rule is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights {{the first and last}} by one half, and again multiplies by the <b>step</b> <b>width.</b> This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 210 pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further. Simpson's rule approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function. Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called Newton–Cotes formulas. The degree [...] Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree [...] polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to Runge's phenomenon. One solution to this problem is Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.|$|E

40|$|Falls {{among older}} adults (OA) is {{becoming}} increasingly more prevalent. One third of OA fall each year; of those fallers, 20 - 30 percent endure various injuries ─ fatal and nonfatal. Older women are especially at risk and {{are twice as likely}} than men to sustain a fatal injury following a fall, including severe hip fractures. This study aimed to explore and confirm balance-enhancing evidence for thin and hard midsoles/insoles through an experimental environment with a single data collection session. It was hypothesized that balance would improve while wearing hard insoles in combination with a hard midsole when compared to standard insole and barefoot conditions during inclined walking by providing increased somatosensory feedback on the sole of the foot and mechanical advantage. Nine (n= 9; mean age= 71. 7, 65 - 81 years) female OA completed various walking tasks including gait termination (GT), normal walking (NW), and cognitive walking (CW) along a 2 m inclined walkway. Participants completed these walking trials while either wearing footwear with standard insoles, wearing the same footwear with hard insoles, or walking barefoot. The cognitive task that was required to be completed by the participants during walking trials included counting in reverse order by multiples of seven beginning from a 4 -digit number. Multiple variables were examined to determine overall balance and stability including maximum and minimum medial/lateral (ML) center of mass (COM) - center of pressure (COP) differences (COM-COP), vertical force rates of loading (ROL), <b>step</b> <b>widths,</b> <b>step</b> lengths, and average gait velocity differences between steps. Analysis was performed on the first three steps that were completed on the beginning of the inclined walkway.

50|$|<b>Step</b> <b>width</b> {{refers to}} the {{distance}} between the feet. A connection exists between <b>step</b> <b>width</b> and gait instability, though it is difficult to discern the difference between correlation and causation. Increased <b>step</b> <b>width</b> is commonly accepted as an indicator of gait instability because it is a coping mechanism to deal with external or environmental balance perturbations. A similar widening of <b>step</b> <b>width</b> and concordant slowing of gait speed has been observed between populations of elderly, obese, pregnant women, and amputees. Physically widening the distance between feet in a standing posture increases the structural stability of the body by widening the base of support or foundation. External lateral support mechanisms have been used to isolate the variable of balance in able-bodied subjects and succeeded in reducing both metabolic cost and <b>step</b> <b>width.</b> A similar experimental setup was used on transtibial and transfemoral amputees: transtibial amputees had reduced energy cost and <b>step</b> <b>width,</b> but transfemoral subjects had increased cost and a more marginal reduction in <b>step</b> <b>width,</b> possibly due to the harness interfering with necessary pelvic movements.|$|E
