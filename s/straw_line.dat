40|$|Field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in order to study the genotypic variation in nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and utilization by barley. The study included nine Bulgarian genotypes of two-rowed barley: three cultivars Krami, Krasen, Kristi and six perspectives breading lines. The genotypes were sown in a randomized, complete block design with four replications after maize as predecessor with the size of experimental plots of 7 m 2. It was found that barley genotypes differed in the uptake efficiency of both elements - nitrogen and phosphorus. Genotypes were divided into two groups in regard to nitrogen. Cultivars Krami, Krasen, Kristi and lines 2390300, 24102400, 22506999 uptake 170 - 186 kg N*ha- 1, and lines 704112296, 24201900, 689069970 demonstrated higher nitrogen uptake efficiency 213 - 241 kg N*ha- 1. Most of the new lines had higher phosphorus uptake efficiency in a range 90 - 111 kg Р 2 О 5 ha- 1 compared to the varieties. The ratio total N/total Р 2 О 5 uptake was close to 2. 0 for the most of genotypes. The obtained mean values of nitrogen utilization efficiency were 81. 6 kg biomass and 34. 0 kg grain per kg N, respectively. The mean values of phosphorus utilization efficiency were 171. 3 kg biomass and 71. 4 kg grain per kg P 2 O 5, respectively. The barley genotypes utilized more efficient phosphorus then total uptake nitrogen for producing grain and <b>straw.</b> <b>Line</b> 24102400 demonstrated higher nitrogen utilization efficiency for biomass and grain from all studied genotypes, followed by variety Krami. These two genotypes could be recommended as perspective in future improves of nitrogen efficiency in barley. Uptake efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus positively correlated with the barley productivity and nutrients content in the grain and straw. In contrast, the relationship between total uptake of both elements at maturity and utilization efficiency of nitrogen or phosphorus for grain formation was negative...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Choranche Cave system (Vercors, France) is an {{excellent}} locality for measuring the growth rates of large numbers soda straws. This is especially {{the case for the}} Coufin Cave, as enlargement of the cave entrance in 1875 led to a change in stalactite color from brown to white, thus providing a reliable chronomarker. The date of this brown-to-white calcite transition has been confirmed by lamina counting. We measured and georeferenced the growth-lengths of 306 soda straws in a 1 m 2 area of the roof of the Coufin Cave entrance chamber. Because of the very slow and sometimes inexistent water feeding of those stalactites, hydrochemistry analysis were not achieved and drop rate effect on growth were neglected; this study is based on a geomorphological and geostatistical work. By measuring a large number of soda straws in a very small area for which most of the parameters affecting stalactite growth could be considered uniform, and because flow rates are very slow (frequencies are always superior to 1 drop per half hour), we could ascribe differences in growth rates to variations in the global increase of water flow through the unsaturated matrix. Statistical and geostatistical analyses of the measurements showed that this set of similarly shaped stalactites actually consisted of three Gaussian populations with different mean growth rates: fast growth rate (FGR- mean of 0. 92 mm. y- 1), medium growth rate (MGR- mean of 0. 47 mm. y- 1) and low growth rate (LGR- 0. 09 mm. y- 1). Plotting the lengths and spatial distribution of the 20 longest FGR soda straws revealed that there is a rough pattern to the water flow through the cave roof. Even if no direction is statisticaly different from others, the observed directional pattern is consistent with local and regional tectonic observations. Plots of the spatial distribution of the soda straws show that FGR soda <b>straws</b> follow <b>lines</b> of regional geological stress, whereas MGR and LGR soda straws are more disperse...|$|R

Given these considerations, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate different mechanisms for coverage mobilization on the sowing line and their effect on germination environment of maize seeds, mainly in relation to the dynamics of straw in the seedbed, water content and soil temperature. Treatments consisted on the combination of two mechanisms at front of furrow opener, composed of cutting disc and row cleaners, with three mechanisms behind the seed furrower for returning the soil, consisting of three covering mechanisms, commercial and prototype models. It was found that straw presence on the surface of sowing line contributed to germination of maize seeds, maintenance of temperature and soil water content. The cutting disc treatment, associated with prototype, introduced percentages of water content near the ones in bottom layer, and this soil water content was 29. 7 % with 93. 75 % of straw coverage and deeper seeding depth, granting better conditions for {{seed germination}}.

We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement.

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates {{large amounts}} of silicon which {{improves}} its growth and health due to enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Silicon uptake and loading to xylem in rice are predominantly active processes performed by transporters encoded by the recently identified genes Lsi 1 (Si influx transporter gene) and Lsi 2 (Si efflux transporter gene). Silicon deposition in rice during translocation to upper plant tissues is known to discriminate against the heavier isotopes (29) Si and (30) Si, resulting in isotope fractionation within the plant. We analyzed straw and husk samples of rice mutants defective in Lsi 1, Lsi 2 or both for silicon content and delta(29) Si using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and compared these results with those for the corresponding wild-type varieties (WT). The silicon content was higher in husk than in straw. All the mutant rice lines showed clearly lower silicon content than the WT lines (4 - 23 % Si of WT). The delta(29) Si was lower in straw and husk for the uptake defective mutant (lsi 1) than for WT, albeit delta(29) Si was 0. 3 per thousand higher in husk than in <b>straw</b> in both <b>lines.</b> The effect of defective efflux (lsi 2) differed for straw and husk with higher delta(29) Si in straw, but lower delta(29) Si in husk while WT showed similar delta(29) Si in both fractions.

O presente trabalho teve por objetivo estudar os efeitos do sistema de colheita e do manejo do palhiço residual sobre o desenvolvimento das soqueiras de cana-de-açúcar e sobre algumas propriedades físicas e químicas do solo. O experimento foi instalado em área de colheita mecanizada de cana-de-açúcar, variedade SP 91 - 1049, conduzido ao longo do ciclo da primeira soca, delineado em blocos completos casualizados, com quatro repetições e os seguintes quatro tratamentos: palhiço em área total (não manejado); remoção do palhiço de sobre as linhas de cana (desaleiramento); palhiço aleirado; e palhiço queimado. Uma medida mensal de temperatura do solo foi feita até o 9 º mês após o corte. A biometria foi feita mensalmente até 8 meses após o corte, avaliando-se o perfilhamento da cana e o crescimento inicial da parte aérea. Próximo ao final do ciclo foram feitas análises químicas de solo e de folhas de cana, análises físicas de solo não deformado, avaliação da distribuição da umidade e do sistema radicular no perfil do solo, e análises tecnológicas de amostras de cana para avaliação da maturação. Por ocasião da colheita, pesou-se a produção. O maior efeito do palhiço sobre a cana-de-açúcar foi reduzir o perfilhamento inicial, sendo que o desaleiramento mostrou-se a forma de manejo do palhiço mais eficaz em mitigar o efeito negativo do mesmo sobre o perfilhamento inicial. O aleiramento, além de ser menos eficaz nesse sentido, induziu um perfilhamento inicial deveras heterogêneo. Quanto às propriedades químicas do solo, o palhiço não causou efeito significativo sobre os teores de MO, CTC, Al e pH; entre os nutrientes, apenas o manganês sofreu efeito significativo dos tratamentos, apresentando menor teor sob palhiço em área total do que onde o palhiço foi queimado. Quanto às propriedades físicas do solo, o palhiço favoreceu uma pequena compactação, indicada por redução da aeração do solo na capacidade de campo; além da redução da temperatura do solo, significativa só nos primeiros 6 meses após o corte. Sobre a distribuição da água no perfil do solo, avaliada no 11 º mês após o corte e depois 2 semanas sem chuva, na camada de 0 - 20 cm a umidade foi significativamente maior sob palhiço em área total do que onde o palhiço foi queimado; e em profundidades maiores não houve diferença significativa devida aos tratamentos. Não obstante, sobre a distribuição do sistema radicular no perfil do solo, os tratamentos não produziram nenhuma diferença significativa. Replacing {{the manual}} harvesting of burnt sugarcane for green sugarcane mechanical harvesting, follows a great demand for research {{about the effects}} of straw on sugarcane ratoon and on the production environment. This work aimed to study the effects of the harvest and of straw management {{on the development of the}} sugarcane ratoon and on some physical and chemical properties of soil. The experiment was conducted on an area of mechanical harvesting of sugarcane, variety SP 91 - 1049, conducted during the first cycle of ratoon, the experimental design was randomized blocks with four repetitions and the following four treatments: straw in total area; straw removed from the sugarcane lines; with the <b>straw</b> between four <b>lines</b> moved to a ridge between two <b>lines</b> (<b>straw</b> tilling); and burnt straw. Measurements of soil temperature were made monthly, until the 9 th month after the harvest. Biometric measurements were performed monthly until 8 months after harvesting, evaluating the sugarcane tillering and the initial growth of the tillers. Near the end of the cycle, chemical analyses of soil and of sugarcane leaves, and physical analyses of not deformed soil samples were performed; the distribution of moisture and of root system into the soil profile were evaluated; and technological analysis of sugarcane samples were made to evaluate the maturity stage of sugarcane. At the harvest, the production was weighed. The biggest effect of straw on sugarcane was reducing the initial tillering, and the removal of <b>straw</b> from sugarcane <b>lines</b> proved to be the more effective management to mitigate the negative effect of straw on the tillering. The straw tilling, less effective in this sense, also induced a very heterogeneous initial tillering. Regarding the soil chemical properties, straw did not cause significant effect on the levels of organic matter, capacity of cations exchange, Al and pH; among the nutrients, only Mn had a significant effect of the treatments, with lower content under straw in total area than where straw was burned. Regarding the physical properties of soil, straw provided a little compaction, indicated by reduction of the soil aeration at field capacity; as well as significant reducing of soil temperature only in the first 6 months after harvest. On the distribution of water in the soil profile, measured 11 months after harvest and after 2 weeks without rain, in the depth of 0 to 20 centimeters, moisture was significantly higher under straw in total area than where straw was burned, and in bigger depths there were no significant difference due to treatments.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to reduce our {{dependency}} on fossil fuels, and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In recent years, a conversion of lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural wastes to biofuel has been considered a promising solution to provide sustainable liquid fuels without competing with food production. At present, this {{is limited by the}} cost effectiveness of the production process, due to the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass to digestion. One way to tackle this problem is to improve the digestibility of the biomass feedstock itself, which would help to decrease chemical and enzyme treatments necessary for converting biomass to fermentable sugars for bioethanol production. With this objective in mind, the aim {{of this study is to}} identify genes that affect the digestibility of rice straw. Rice (Oryza sativa), the third biggest cereal crop in the world, has a small diploid genome, and well-developed molecular genetic tools to underpin the use of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a powerful tool for identifying quantitative trait loci. The genotypic data of 151 varieties, containing 328, 915 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs), was analysed together with the phenotypic data from three different cell wall characterisation assays: (1) saccharification, (2) total lignin content, and (3) silica measurement by by X-ray fluorescence. This resulted in the identification of 10 significant QTL for saccharification potential, 3 significant QTL for Silica content, and 8 significant QLTs for total Lignin. The digestibility QTL regions identified include three strong potential candidate genes which determine on digestibility: OsAT 10 (Bartley, et al., 2013); OsIRX 9 (Chiniquy, et al., 2013); and OsMYB 58 / 63 -L (Noda, et al., 2015). A strong correlation between silicon content and digestibility was also identified. A QTL in chromosome 6 occurred in both GWAS for digestibility and silica, and revealed a contrasting bi-allelic effect between the amounts of sugar released and silica content. The OsAT 10 gene, located in this common QTL region was validated using the <b>straw</b> from overexpression <b>lines,</b> showing that OsAT 10 had large effect on both silica content and digestibility...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} interest in natural materials, connecting with so-called comeback {{of man to}} nature, couses an increasing consumption of raw-materials for their production. One {{of the most important}} resorts producing these source is agriculture. The growing of so-called alternative plants on arable soil for following processing in non-food industry, firstly provides renewable sources for processing industry and secondly it also solves a problem of agricultural overproduction in Western Europe. Flax surely belongs to a group of alternative plants. The traditional technology of growing, harvesting and processing consist in the long flax fibre production for production of natural, flax fabrics. New non-traditional technologies produce short fibre for production of mixed yarn (cotton-flax), but also for non-textile processing (building materials, plastic materials, biodegradable products and packing). The aim of this work was to do practical field testing of parameters of newly imported machinery for two-phase harvesting technology, and also test possibilities of using of non-traditional harvesting technologies and following processing. The field testing of imported machinery showed that this machinery operates with high quality of work, especially precise putting <b>straws</b> on the <b>line.</b> The measured figures in the field testing of the quality of desseding is not always satisfactory. The main reason of the high losses (20, 69 %) I assume, is incorrect adjustment of the machinery. Calculated efficiencies of measured machinery in the field testing failed to reach maximum values given by manufacturer of machinery. For the judging of non-traditional technology we choosed technique, which did not need any additional investment costs. This technique used machinery for harvesting stemmed materials. We compared two variants: one with moving and second with pulling. For deseeding we used combine harvester with picking adapter. Straws were during retting two times turned and on the end pressed to the gig square bales. The gained wirr-straw was processed on the tow processing line. The better variant was the mowing. The retted straw yield was lower (4, 11 %) and the seed yield was higher (25, 52 %) in compare with the variant of the puling. The harvest costs of the mowing variant are also more profitable (4 995 Ck per ha) while the costs of the pulling method were higher (5 941 Ck per ha) and the average costs of the traditional harvest technology were 6809 Ck per ha. In my opinion the non-traditional harvesting technology should be used in case of flax being of lower quality or damaged. In these cases not even the use of the new and powerful machinery can ensure production of first-rate-flax, which attracts costumers. On the other hand a little decline of retted straw quality means huge depreciation the price. The saved costs in non-traditional harvesting technology can compensate lower trade price. Because the Czech Republic wants to enter EU it is necessary to continue in subvention of growing flax, the subsidy in EU is 815 ECU per hectareAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
