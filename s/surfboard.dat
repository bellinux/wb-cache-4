5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} <b>surfboard.</b> Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{ride the}} wave {{and they see}} Mr. Krabs. He jumps up onto the board and drops Cashie into the ocean, so Jack Kahuna Laguna goes to {{retrieve}} it and acts as the sacrifice. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are seen flying on the <b>surfboard</b> and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon. A welcome home party has been thrown for SpongeBob, and Jack Kahuna Laguna returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a <b>surfboard,</b> it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
25|$|The <b>surfboard</b> fin, or keel, is {{the part}} of the back of a <b>surfboard</b> that enters the water. Similar to a rudder on a boat the <b>surfboard</b> fin works to steer the board and provide stability. The <b>surfboard</b> fin {{prevents}} a surfer from uncontrollably spinning in circles while trying to ride a wave. The <b>surfboard</b> fin was invented by Tom Blake in 1935.|$|E
25|$|A <b>surfboard</b> leash or leg rope is {{the cord}} that {{attaches}} a <b>surfboard</b> to the surfer. It prevents the <b>surfboard</b> from being {{swept away by}} waves and prevents a runaway <b>surfboard</b> from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to {{the tail end of}} the <b>surfboard.</b> The <b>surfboard</b> leash was invented in 1970 by Santa Cruz, California resident Pat O'Neill, son of wetsuit innovator Jack O'Neill, who fastened surgical tubing to the nose of his <b>surfboard</b> with a suction cup looped to the end of his wrist in order to leverage turns and cutbacks in the water. However, modifications in 1971 by O'Neill made the surf leash attached to the ankle and to a surfboard's tail, a practice still in use today.|$|E

2500|$|Surfing {{can be done}} {{on various}} equipment, {{including}} <b>surfboards,</b> longboards, Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP's), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. <b>Surfboards</b> were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to [...] long and [...] ). Lighter balsa wood <b>surfboards</b> (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the 1935 National Geographic photo-essay mentioned above ("Waves and Thrills at Waikiki"), {{in the same year}} Blake also published what {{is said to be the}} first book on surfing, Hawaiian <b>Surfboard,</b> a comprehensive study which treated the history and tradition of the sport, board construction, and surfing technique. He also wrote articles on <b>surfboard</b> construction for Popular Mechanics (1936) and Popular Science (1939). In 1961 he published his second book, Hawaiian Surf Riding.|$|E

50|$|In August 2007, Paskowitz {{launched}} the Surfing For Peace project to deliver <b>surfboards</b> {{to the small}} surfing community in Gaza. Paskowitz had to persuade the Israeli government to let him deliver the <b>surfboards</b> because after Hamas took over Gaza in June 2007, Israel has only let in essential humanitarian supplies. Paskowitz founded Surfing For Peace together with his own son David Paskowitz, as well as Arthur Rashovan and Kelly Slater, after reading {{an article in the}} Los Angeles Times which highlighted the lack of <b>surfboards</b> in Gaza.|$|R
50|$|At night, {{he would}} shape for Gordie <b>Surfboards.</b> Gordie (Gordon Duane) had a {{reputation}} for being a superb craftsman but very hard to get along with. Jones put up with him and learned some of Gordie's shaping techniques and most of all his dedication to perfection through using these techniques. He did a short stint with Dick Brewer in 1969, ghost shaping for him on Maui. He then went on to shape for Russell <b>Surfboards,</b> Newport Beach, California, and then Ole <b>Surfboards</b> in Sunset Beach, California, from where he launched his own business.|$|R

25|$|The {{sport of}} surfing now {{represents}} a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. The World Surf League (WSL) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors {{in some of}} the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers.Sixty-six surfboarders on a 42-foot <b>surfboard</b> set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a <b>surfboard</b> at one time.As for people who take it more seriously, such as Dale Webster, he consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of injuries, up to 66%, are caused by {{collision}} with a <b>surfboard</b> (nose or fins). Fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts, as well as bruising.
