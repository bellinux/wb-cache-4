50|$|Like the {{electric}} guitar, the bass guitar is played through a specialized amplifier {{which makes the}} instrument louder and permits the performer to change the tone. The bass began being used in popular music in the 1950s. While bass guitar <b>solos</b> are not common in popular music, some bands also include bass <b>solos</b> in some songs, particularly heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock bands. Some genres use bass guitar <b>solos</b> in most songs, such as jazz bands or jazz fusion groups. Bass <b>solos</b> are also common in certain styles of punk music. In a rock context, bass guitar <b>solos</b> are structured and performed {{in a similar fashion}} as rock guitar <b>solos,</b> often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. While bass guitar <b>solos</b> appear on few studio albums from rock or pop bands, genres such as progressive rock, fusion-influenced rock, and some types of heavy metal are more likely to include bass <b>solos,</b> both in studio albums and in live performances.|$|R
