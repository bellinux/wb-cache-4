50|$|While {{snow peas}} had been grown in Europe in the 19th century, sugarsnap peas were only first {{developed}} in 1952 by cross-breeding snow pea with a mutant <b>shell</b> <b>pea</b> plant.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} {{to provide a}} {{contribution}} about ploughing subject three ways were compared in a quadriennal rotation from Experimental Industrial Crops Institute in Osimo. During the years 1986 - 1999, in a factorial experiment with 4 replications, traditional (50 cm), shallow ploughing (25 cm) and chiseling (50 cm) plus reduced ploughing (25 cm) were compared with two crop rotations (sugar beet- wheat; shelling peas-wheat) and three nitrogen levels (0, 92, 184 kg ha- 1) in a split block experiment. The conventional and chiseling plus reduced ploughing did not influenced sugar-beet or peas yield or qualitative and quantitative crop traits; like it was emphasized in the previous seven years. Wheat seed yield was positively influenced by reduced ploughing done to the previous crop but not by rotation. Straw yield was higher after sugar beet than after peas. Nitrogen fertilisation allowed the best technical yield of wheat at the intermediate level of 90 kg ha- 1, whereas more nitrogen (180 kg ha- 1) improved only the biomass and heads per squared meter at harvesting, lowering the test weight of wheat. In conclusion we could affirm that, in this experience, the best ploughing for sugar-beet and <b>shelling</b> <b>peas</b> is at 25 cm. Moreover {{it was not possible}} to reduce fertilisation of wheat following <b>shelling</b> <b>peas</b> (leguminous crop) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the content of phytic acid (phytate) in soybeans (Glycine max), yellow <b>shelled</b> <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum) and lentil (Lens esculenta). Dry seeds were grounded to a fine powder. The moisture of samples was determined according to the Official Journal of the European Union (2009). The moisture of the samples was 8. 42 % in soybeans, 11. 19 % in yellow <b>shelled</b> <b>peas</b> and 10. 07 % in lentil. The content of phytic acid was determined by the modified Holt's method (1955) using the spectrophotometer. Standard curve was measured using the Na phytate standard solution (0. 2 [*]mM). The phytate content in G. max varied from 1. 28 to 1. 86 % in dry matter and from 1. 17 to 1. 70 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample. The content of phytate in P. sativum ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 86 % and from 0. 43 to 0. 77 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample. The phytate content in L. esculenta varied from 0. 45 to 1. 39 % in dry matter and from 0. 40 to 1. 25 [*]g per 100 [*]g of the sample. These obtained values could be influenced by many factors, e. g. climatic conditions, location, variety, etc...|$|R
