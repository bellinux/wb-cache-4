5000|$|Plaster {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based plaster can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most plaster sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed plaster packaged in a plastic bag because the plaster <b>spraying</b> <b>machine</b> {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that plaster is kept moist. The pre-mixed plaster also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the plaster from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed plaster can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|E
50|$|Spraying {{paint with}} {{compressed}} air {{can be traced}} back to its use on the Southern Pacific Railway in the early 1880s In 1887 Joseph Binks, the maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store developed a hand pumped cold-water paint <b>spraying</b> <b>machine</b> to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store. Francis Davis Millet, the decorations director for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, used Binks and his spray painting system to apply whitewash consisting of a mix of oil and white lead to the buildings at the Exposition, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting and tuning it into what has been called the White City. In 1949, Edward Seymour developed a type of spray painting, aerosol paint, that could be delivered via a compressed aerosol in a can.|$|E

In this sense, this paper aims to highlight the importance of spraying equipment in vineyards and orchards. The main goal {{of this paper was}} to determine and to evaluate the coverage degree for the Gamberini 500 orchard <b>spraying</b> <b>machine.</b> For the purpose of this paper, the machine Gamberini 500 was used in laboratory conditions to determine and evaluate the coverage degree. This <b>spraying</b> <b>machine</b> is a pneumatic one, with a special boom. In order to evaluate the degree of coverage, a special paper was used, which was placed at different heights (1; 2; 3 m). The paper was scanned, transformed in black and with the MathCad software the degree of coverage was evaluated using the READBMP function. The results obtained showed that the degree of coverage differs with respect to the height. The biggest degree of coverage was obtained at lower heights, due to the small distance to the target. This degree of coverage is mostly influenced by the orientation of the boom, the quantity of water sprayed and the droplets size. In order to achieve a higher degree of coverage it is important to use a fan which has a tower blower, because the distance from boom to target surface is relative equal...|$|E

40|$|To prevent local under- or over-application of chemicals, a {{spray boom}} {{must be kept}} {{parallel}} to the soil. On a slanted field, the operator, driving a sprayer equipped with a passive boom suspension, has to turn the boom manually in a skewed position. This paper presents {{the development of a}} slow active controller to do this automatically and to add damping to the suspension. A controller, designed for a cable suspension, captures the signals of two ultrasonic sensors, measuring the distance between the boom and the soil, and activates a low-power electrical DC motor which positions the boom automatically. Different control strategies have been tried out in simulation and in a laboratory experiment on a six-post electro-hydraulic shaking table.

The current portable spray gun use pressurize tank but in this design, peristaltic pump is used to create the pressure different to transfer polyol and isocyanate to the spray gun. The suitable devices are select and the design is draw in Solidworks. Using Fluent the outlet mass flow rate of polyurethane are determined for different inner tube diameter and using Algor, the casing strength is determined. The maximum mass flow rate for 6 mm tube diameter is 0. 393 kg/s, 8 mm is 0. 699 kg/s, 10 mm is 1. 092 kg/s and 12 mm is 1. 573 kg/s. The mass flow rate also increases when the motor speed is increase.

40|$|To {{correctly}} {{evaluate the}} vibration {{transmitted to the}} operators, {{it is necessary to}} consider each body’s point interested by the vibratory stimulus produced by machines. All the body’s part in contact to the vibration, when a portable device with internal combustion engine is used, are: hands, back and shoulders. Some information for wholebody vibration are available in the ISO 2631 - 1997 standard, which otherwise refers to a seated operator. ‘C’ type standards for the vibration analysis exist for some portable machines with an internal combustion engine which is comprehensive in the machine (chainsaw, brush-cutter, blower). If the engine is not inside the machine, but it is on the operator’s back, ‘C’ type standards on vibration measurements are quite incomplete. The IMAMOTER institute of CNR, the DISAFA Department (University of Turin) and the Occupational Medicine Department of the University of Catania started some tests to verify the vibration levels transmitted to an operator working with backed engine devices. Two machines have been examined: a blower and a <b>spraying</b> <b>machine.</b> Two operative conditions have been considered during all the tests: idling and full load. Three operators have been involved and each test has been repeated three times. The <b>spraying</b> <b>machine</b> has been tested both with the empty tank and with 10 litres of water, to simulate the load to be caused by the presence of liquid inside the tank. In this work the comfort condition of ISO 2631 - 1 standard was considered, using the frequency weighting Wc curve with the weighting factor 0. 8 for X axis (back-ventral direction) and the Wd curve for Y and Z axis (shoulder - shoulder and buttocks - head) with weighting factors 0. 5 and 0. 4 (respectively for Y and Z axis). Data were examined using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software package. The statistical analysis underlined that the running condition is the main factor to condition the vibration levels transmitted to the operator’s back, while the ballast and the operators are influent when the running conditions are distinguished. Concerning medical investigation, lower back and shoulders are the main critical part of the body interested by vibration transmitted to each operator...|$|E
