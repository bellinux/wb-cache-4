5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else.

5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> the country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> in {{the process}} of {{extending}} the local church This study looks at the biblical principal <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> in the context of building up the local church. The study starts with the methodological principles of Practical Theology and various models of the process of building up the local church. Traditionally stewardship was regarded as the principle that encouraged Christians to give monetary contributions towards extending the local church. The study makes it clear that a much broader and biblical understanding <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> is necessary. It looks at the different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> and the effect the stewardship principle has on the Christian’s use of resources, time, spiritual gifts, possessions, as well as on creation, life and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p...|$|R

5|$|Juan de San Buenaventura's {{small group}} of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695. In early November 1695, two Franciscans were sent to {{establish}} a mission at Pak'ek'em, where they were well received by the cacique (native chief) and his pagan priest. Pak'ek'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw {{the building of a}} church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B'atkab' to attend to over 100 K'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> a Spanish friar; a further church was established at Tzuktok', overseen by another friar.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} loudspeaker {{driven by the}} need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E

5|$|Another final appearance, {{the third}} of Messi's senior {{international}} career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone. In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Tiruvannamalai {{came under}} the {{dominion}} of the Nawab of the Carnatic. As the Mughal empire came to an end, the Nawab {{lost control of the}} town, with confusion and chaos ensuing after 1753. Subsequently, there were periods of both Hindu and Muslim <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> the temple, with Muraru Raya, Krishna Raya, Mrithis Ali Khan, and Burkat Ullakhan besieging the temple in succession. As European incursions progressed, Tiruvannamalai was attacked by French Soupries, Sambrinet, and the English Captain Stephen Smith. While some were repelled, others were victorious. The French occupied the town in 1757 and it {{came under the}} control of the British in 1760. In 1790, Tiruvannamalai town was captured by Tippu Sultan, who ruled from 1750–99. During the first half of the 19th century, the town came under British rule.|$|E
40|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement {{that both the}} configuration {{and the application of}} state authority in the health sector should be realigned in the interest of achieving agreed policy objectives. The desired outcome is frequently characterized as a search for good governance serving the public interest. The present paper examines the proposal in The World Health Report 2000 that the concept <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> offers the appropriate basis for reconfiguration. We trace the development <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> from its initial religious formulation to more recent ecological and sociological permutations. Consideration is given to the potential <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> for encouraging state decision-making that is both normatively based and economically efficient. Various dilemmas that could impede or preclude such a shift in state behaviour are examined. We conclude that the concept <b>of</b> <b>stewardship</b> holds substantial promise if adequately developed and effectively implemented...|$|R

5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|The club became {{owners of}} the Victoria Ground in 1919. The Butler Street stand was {{constructed}} shortly afterward, increasing the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. Following the restart of the Football League, Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in the 1921–22 season under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> Arthur Shallcross, although {{this was followed by}} relegation in the 1922–23 season. Unable to prevent the club's bad form, Shallcross resigned in March 1923. Tom Mather was appointed manager later in 1923, although Stoke were unable to mount another promotion challenge. They were instead relegated from the Second Division four years later in the 1925–26 season. The club's stay in Third Division North was brief, as Stoke won the championship during their first season in that league. In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status, and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City Football Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{post office}} opened in 1847 and {{was run by}} church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory. The building, which now forms part of a Grade II* listed private dwelling, {{is thought to be}} the second-oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847. The post office briefly moved to another location in The Street under the <b>stewardship</b> <b>of</b> local schoolmistress Fanny Harris (who operated the service from 1926); however, it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub-postmistress Irene Bugden and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976. Fanny Harris (then 92 years old and the village's oldest inhabitant) and Robin Leigh-Pemberton were passengers on the first postbus service on 4 March 1974. A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20years until it was closed in the 1990s. Today, the village retains only the Blacksmiths Arms and a traditional red post box.|$|E
