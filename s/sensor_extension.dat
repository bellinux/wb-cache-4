40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of the process sensors that supply real-time data to the safety systems in nuclear power plants (NPP) {{play a vital role}} in preventing plant accidents. If a critical process temperature, pressure, level, or flow experiences a step change, for example, the sensors that measure the process variable must act quickly to actuate the safety systems that will mitigate the consequence of an undesirable process excursion. The research conducted for this dissertation has been performed to ensure the prompt {{response of}} critical sensors by advancing, refining, validating, and implementing new methods for measuring the response time of temperature, pressure, level, and flow sensors in NPP safety systems. The essential significance of the new methods is that they can be performed remotely on installed sensors at operating conditions, thereby providing the actual in-service response time as opposed to the unrealistic response time provided by the manufacturer or by offline testing. The in-situ response time testing technique for temperature sensors is referred to as the Loop Current Step Response (LCSR) test. This technique is based on heating the sensor internally by applying a step change in the DC current to the <b>sensor</b> <b>extension</b> leads in the plant control room. The DC current heats the sensing element of the sensor, resulting in a temperature transient that is then analyzed to provide a true sensor response time, which accounts for all process conditions as well as for the effects of installation and aging. This dissertation presents the theoretical foundation of the LCSR, the details of the author’s extensive experimental research to validate and refine its use in multiple nuclear plant safety applications, and the assumptions that support the validity of the author’s research and experimental results. The in-situ response time testing technique for pressure, level, and flow transmitters is the so-called noise analysis method. This method is based on recording and analyzing the inherent process fluctuations present at the output of transmitters while the plant is operating. These fluctuations (noise) arise from random flux, turbulent flow, random heat transfer, process control action, and vibration. They are separated from the output of the transmitter by signal conditioning, recorded for about an hour, and analyzed in frequency and/or time domain to yield the response time of the pressure sensing system. This dissertation describes the theoretical foundation of the noise analysis technique, the details of the experimental research that the author has conducted for this dissertation to validate and expand the scope of this technique in actual plant applications, and the assumptions informing the author’s confidence that the research in this dissertation validates the noise analysis technique. The significance of the noise analysis technique is that it not only measures the in-service response time of the transmitter but also of its sensing lines. In contrast to other methods, it can thereby account for the effect of sensing-line length, blockages, and voids on sensor response time. As part of this research, both the LCSR and noise analysis techniques were validated through extensive laboratory measurements performed on temperature and pressure sensors of the types used in nuclear power plants. The author has used these results to indicate where these methods are most effective but also where they may pose significant uncertainties or may fail...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic vector sensors, which measure scalar {{pressure}} {{along with}} particle motion (a vector quantity), feature many advantages over omnidirectional hydrophone sensors. A sizable literature {{exists on the}} theory of processing signals for many vector sensor array applications. In practice, however, mismatch (the difference between the assumed and actual system configurations), several noise processes and low sample support can pose significant problems. Processing techniques should be robust to these system imperfections and practical complexities. This thesis presents analytical results which quantify the effect of system mismatch and low sample support on acoustic vector sensor array performance. All arrays are susceptible to perturbations in array element locations; vector sensor arrays, however, are also sensitive to changes in sensor orientation. This {{is due to the}} fact that the particle motion vector measurement must be placed in a global reference frame. Gilbert and Morgan (1955) developed a statistical analysis with system mismatch for an array of scalar, omnidirectional elements. This thesis includes a vector <b>sensor</b> <b>extension</b> to their analysis by including sensor orientation perturbations. Theoretical expressions for the mean and variance of the vector sensor array spatial response are derived using a Gaussian perturbation model, with excellent comparisons between theory and simulation. Such analysis leads to insight into theoretical limits of both conventional and adaptive processing in the presence of system imperfections. One noteworthy result is that the vector aspect of the array "dampens" the effect of array mismatch, enabling deeper true nulls. This is accomplished because the variance of the vector sensor array spatial response (due to rotational, positional and filter gain/phase perturbations) decreases in the side lobes, unlike arrays of omnidirectional hydrophones. (cont.) As long as sensor orientation is measured within a reasonable tolerance, the beampattern variance dominates the average side lobe power response. Results from random matrix theory are used to characterize the effect of low sample support on signal detection using a vector sensor array. When using vector sensors, the effects of low sample support potentially increase by a factor of four since each element in a vector sensor array consists of a scalar hydrophone and up to three spatially orthogonal particle motion sensors. Also presented is an analysis of vector sensor array performance in ocean noise given an arbitrary spatial array configuration, sensor orientation and particle motion sensor type (velocity or acceleration). Several different ocean noise models exist, including isotropic noise, directional noise and realistic surface generated noise. Theoretical expressions are derived for array data covariance matrices in these different noise models for arbitrary array configuration and sensor orientation, which can in turn be used with optimal MVDR beamforming weights to analyze array gain. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we present examples of signal, noise and array gain variability as a function of mismatch intensity. Our analysis suggests that vector sensor array gain performance is less sensitive to rotational than to positional perturbations in the regions of interest. Hydrophones and particle motion sensors have very different response and noise characteristics. For instance, particle motion sensors are more sensitive to non acoustic, motion-induced noise than hydrophones. In a towed line array configuration, those sensors orthogonal to the direction of motion are exposed to higher intensities of flow noise at low frequencies than those coincident to the array axis. (cont.) Similarly, different dipole sensors may be exposed to varying degrees of rotational mismatch. Sensors may also rest on the seafloor, creating asymmetries. Recognizing these practical issues, we derive a new adaptive processing method customized to the unique characteristics of vector sensors and robust to mismatch and finite sample support. This new approach involves using multiple white noise gain constraints. During the past couple of decades, stationary vector sensor arrays have been built and tested, demonstrating improved gain and ambiguity lobe attenuation. Up until recently, however, very few towed vector sensor arrays had been built and tested. As such, many of the advantages of vector sensor arrays had only previously been shown in theory and/or with stationary arrays. We present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay, CA (2006) and Dabob Bay, WA (2007) towing a relatively short vector sensor array. Results highlight several of the distinct practical advantages of vector sensor arrays: resolution of spatial ambiguity (e. g., port/starboard and conical ambiguity), the ability to "undersample" an acoustic wave without spatial aliasing, quiet target recovery via clutter reduction, immunity to mismatch, improved array gain and enhanced detection performance. by Andrew Joseph Poulsen.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of materials with molecular recognition properties {{has become a}} topic of great technological and scientific interest. Molecular imprinting {{is one of the}} most effective strategies in preparing highly selective synthetic receptors. The technique of molecular imprinting involves the copolymerization of functional and cross-linking monomers in the presence of a molecular template. Following polymerization and subsequent removal of the template, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) retains a “molecular memory” of the template. During rebinding, the resultant polymer shows higher affinity and selectivity towards the molecular template when compared to other structural analogs. Ease of preparation and high thermal and chemical stability of this class of materials offers a broad range of potential applications. Promising areas of application include separation, chromatography, catalysis, sensors, antibody mimics, and drug delivery etc. The thesis entitled “Molecularly Imprinted Polymers based on Fluorescent and Template binding Cross-linker” deals with the design and {{synthesis of}} several molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) using different functional and cross-linking monomers, the main focus being use of preformed template-monomer complex, use of fluorescent cross-linker and development of functional group containing cross-linker. Chapter 1 : An Introduction to Molecularly Imprinted Polymers. The first chapter provides an introduction to the field of molecularly imprinted polymers. It presents an overview of molecular imprinting process including a brief history of its discovery and its evolution to the present form. This chapter further elaborates on the principle of molecular imprinting with an emphasis on different parameters that directly affect their performance. It also provides a brief review of the applications of molecularly imprinted polymers. Chapter 2 : Highly Cross-linked Metal Ion Imprinted Polymers. The second chapter deals with the synthesis of series of highly cross-linked metal-ion imprinted polymers. The process of metal ion-imprinting usually involves carrying out the polymerization and cross-linking directly in presence of the appropriate metal ion. In the present study, chemical-immobilization method was adopted which involves the use of preformed metal complexes with polymerizable group for the imprinting. Acrylate complexes of various metal-ions, such as Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Pb 2 + and Cr 3 +, were synthesized prior to polymerization. These pre-assembled complexes were then used to prepare MIPs, in the anticipation that this would lead to enhanced selectivity. Ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was used as the cross-linking monomer. As a control, the respective non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) were also made in absence of the template metal ion. Following polymerization, the template metal ion was extracted from the resultant metal ion-imprinted polymer. The selectivity of the metal ion-imprinted polymers was examined by a batch process using analytical tools, such as, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP). The spectroscopic studies revealed significant selectivity of all the MIPs towards the template metal ion. Among all six metal ion-imprinted polymers, Pb 2 + and Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymer showed remarkable selectivity, followed by Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + ion-imprinted polymers. The Co 2 + and Ni 2 + ion-imprinted polymers exhibited comparatively poor selectivity. Representative plots depicting the selectivity exhibited by Pb 2 + and Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymers are shown in Figure 1. These observations were rationalized based on the size and geometric preferences imposed by the imprinted site on the ion that binds to it. Figure 1. Selectivity study for (a) Pb 2 + ion-imprinted polymer, (b) Cr 3 + ion-imprinted polymer. Chapter 3. Molecularly Imprinted Fluorescent Chemosensor for Copper (II). Cu(II) is a source of important pollutant and therefore, the development of sensors that can detect Cu(II) selectively as well as remove Cu(II) from contaminated samples is an important objective. The use of molecular imprinting technique is an appealing approach in this regard. For this, a fluorophore containing cross-linker, namely 9, 10 -bis-(acryloyloxymethyl) anthracene (BAMA) was synthesized. This fluorescent cross-linker was used along with the standard cross-linker, EGDMA, for preparing Cu 2 + ion-imprinted polymer. The complex of copper methacrylate (Cu-MAA) was prepared prior to polymerization used for the preparation of MIP. The resultant imprinted polymer exhibited quenching of the fluorescence in presence of Cu 2 + ion, both in organic and aqueous medium. The efficiency of quenching of NIP (prepared in absence of Cu 2 + ion) was significantly lower than that of MIP. A typical stack spectra showing the quenching process, along with a comparison of the quenching efficiency of MIP and NIP is shown in Figure 2. The imprinted polymers showed significant selectivity over other non-template metal ions, thereby reaffirming the importance of the imprinting process. The sensitivity of the fluorescence detection could be enhanced by increasing the level of the fluorophore incorporation. The increased sensitivity in detecting Cu 2 + ion, demonstrated by the MIP suggests that a statistically random incorporation of the fluorophore into MIP matrices could be a useful approach for imparting a sensing element to MIPs. Figure 2. Fluorescence spectra of the (a) imprinted (MIP- 1) and (b) non-imprinted (NIP- 1) polymers in the presence of various concentration of Cu(OAc) 2 in methanol. (c) Comparison of quenching efficiency of MIP- 1 and NIP- 1. Data were collected 3 h after addition of copper solution. I 0 and I are the fluorescence intensities at 399 nm of the polymers in the absence presence of copper respectively. Two individual runs are presented in (c). Chapter 4. Molecularly Imprinted Turn-Off-On Sensor. This chapter describes the design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted fluorescent turn-off-on sensor utilizing the same fluorescent cross-linker, BAMA. Combining the process of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with molecular imprinting technique, a novel turn-off-on sensor was developed. A molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared using a fluorescent template Coumarin- 30 (C- 30). C- 30 was chosen as the template to ensure a significant overlap of the emission spectra of BAMA and the absorption spectra of C- 30, thereby optimizing for FRET. Figure 3. Structures of relevant molecules. The C- 30 imprinted polymer exhibited simultaneous quenching in fluorescence (turn-off) of BAMA and enhancement in fluorescence (turn-on) of C- 30 (Figure 4). The imprinted polymer showed significantly better performance over the non-imprinted polymer (NIP). Figure 4. Fluorescence spectra of the (a) imprinted (MIP) and (b) non-imprinted (NIP) polymers with increasing concentration of the template Coumarine- 30 in methanol. The UV-vis studies revealed that the more effective quenching is indeed due to the affinity for C- 30 exhibited by the higher binding imprinted polymer. The imprinted polymer also showed significant selectivity over structurally analogous molecules. Therefore, both high sensitivity and selectivity were realized in such novel off-on <b>sensor.</b> <b>Extension</b> of this concept to other biologically relevant fluorescent templates could lead to potentially useful applications. Chapter 5. Design of New Template Binding Cross-linker. In molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP), high cross-linking density (~ 80 to 90 mole percent) is essential to ensure high selectivity, which limits the functional (binding) monomer to about 10 - 20 mole percent. Methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) are the most common combination of functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively, used in molecular imprinting. Generally a molecularly imprinted polymer made with this combination, contains only 10 - 20 % binding sites. This limitation of binding site density is an aspect that has largely been overlooked. In order to improve the efficiency of MIP materials by enhancing the number of binding sites, a new cross-linking monomer (CYDI, 1) with two carboxylic acid groups was designed and synthesized by coupling itaconic anhydride with cyclohexane dimethanol (Figure 5). Figure 5. Structures of relevant molecules. The new functional group bearing cross-linking monomer (1) Itaconate ester of cyclohexanedimethanol (CYDI), the template (2) theophylline (Theop) and the structural analogue of template (3) caffeine (Caff). This new cross-linking monomer was then employed for preparing molecularly imprinted polymer using a drug molecule, theophylline (Theop 2, a bronchodilator) as the template. Seven molecularly imprinted polymers were synthesized with different ratios of CYDI and EGDMA, keeping the cross-linking density constant. The binding efficiency and the selectivity of these imprinted polymers were thoroughly investigated. It was seen that while saturation binding values for theophylline increased continuously with functional cross-linker (CYDI) content, the optimum selectivity with respect to analogous substrate, caffeine, was attained at 40 mol% CYDI. These studies suggest that the approach of using functional group containing cross-linkers could lead to improved MIP performance...|$|E

The high fidelity model is more computation-ally demanding than the coarse approximation. In this context, including information from the lower fidelity model to build a surrogate model is desirable. Here, the study focuses {{on the design of}} a miniaturized photoa-coustic gas sensor which involves two numerical models. First, a multifidelity metamodeling method based on Radial Basis Function, the co-RBF, is proposed. This surrogate model is compared with the classical co-kriging method on two analytical benchmarks and on the photoacoustic gas <b>sensor.</b> Then an <b>extension</b> to the multifidelity framework of an already existing RBF-based optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the sensor efficiency. The co-RBF method brings promising results on a problem in larger dimension and can be considered as an alternative to co-kriging for multifi-delity metamodeling...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{controlling}} the unsteady flow separation over an aerofoil, using plasma actuators. Despite the complexity of the dynamics of interest, we show how the problem of controlling flow separation can be formulated as a simple output regulation problem, so that a simple control strategy may be used. A robust multivariable feedback control is designed and tested in a configuration with two actuator/sensor pairs. Accurate numerical simulations of incompressible flows on a pitching NACA 0012 at Reynolds Re = 20, 000 are performed in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Robust, fast flow reattachment is achieved, along with both stabilisation and increase/reduction of the lift/drag, respectively. The control system shows good dynamic performances, as the angle of attack is varied. The chosen output can be experimentally measured by appropriate <b>sensors</b> and the <b>extension</b> of the proposed approach to 3 D configurations is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} sensor system is implemented using inter-integrated circuit mode (I 2 C) software, utilizing the PIC 182585 MPLAB embedded control system utilizing hardware. The hardware implementation features {{high level of}} integration, reliability, high precision, and high speed communications. The system was demonstrated by temperature and CO 2 <b>sensors.</b> An <b>extension</b> for Zigbee system is proposed to enhance {{the security of the}} integrated system. A bi-directional air/liquid flow sensor is also added to detect the flow magnitude and direction that can be applied to heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC), local and national security within subway systems, and medical equipment. The hardware design of the flow sensor included one heating element and two sensing elements to detect the bi-directional flow. Platinum sensors were found to be of high sensitivity and linear characteristics within 0 ℃ to 100 ℃ range, and their high temperature coefficient (0. 00385 Ω/Ω/℃). Polyimide thin film heater was used as the heating element due to its high throughput and good thermal efficiency. Two bridge circuits were also designed to sense the temperature distribution {{in the vicinity of the}} sensing elements. Three high precision instrumentation low power amplifiers with offset voltage ~ 2. 5 µV (50 µV max) were used for the overall design. The system security is also enhanced with the detection of poison gas using Carbon Nanotube devices (CNT). An antenna system was designed, and a frequency shift was detected to designate the type of poison gas used for a general threat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks are {{networks}} {{suitable for}} data collection in harsh environments, {{where it would be}} difficult or costly the deployment of wired infrastructure. In spite of these advantages, such networks often rely on batteries to operate, which may lead to a serious limitation on the networks lifetime. Bearing this in mind, in this article is proposed and tested a hybrid polling approach that reduces the number of frames transmitted by the router node. Thus, the router node lifetime can be extended significantly and hence the network lifetime. The proposed technique becomes progressively more advantageous, when compared to classical polling technique, as the number of network nodes increases. The experimental results obtained using a network with four nodes indicate a network lifetime increase of about 32. 14 %. Importantly, the <b>sensor</b> network lifetime <b>extension</b> increases the economic viability of the technology and thus makes it more accessible to potential users 201...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the status of}} ongoing research towards the development of advanced algorithms for online calibration monitoring. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop the next generation of online monitoring technologies for <b>sensor</b> calibration interval <b>extension</b> and signal validation in operating and new reactors. These advances are expected to improve the safety and reliability of current and planned nuclear power systems as a result of higher accuracies and increased reliability of sensors used to monitor key parameters. The focus of this report is on documenting the outcomes of the first phase of R&D under this project, which addressed approaches to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in online monitoring that are data-driven, and can therefore adjust estimates of uncertainty as measurement conditions change. Such data-driven approaches to UQ are necessary to address changing plant conditions, for example, as nuclear power plants experience transients, or as next-generation small modular reactors (SMR) operate in load-following conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this paper are also {{published}} in [GYL + ar]. Abstract: In the recent past, tracking applications increasingly develop towards distributed sensor scenarios. In many cases, such schemes must cope with low observable targets in cluttered environments. Furthermore, such a setup suffers from communication delays and timely delayed sensor data. However, Track-before-Detect methodologies are not suitable for processing time delayed data yet. In this paper, we propose a new extension to a Dynamic Programming Algorithm (DPA) approach for Trackbefore-Detect in distributed <b>sensor</b> systems. This <b>extension</b> enables the DPA to process time delayed sensor data directly. Such delay might appear because of varying delays in the installed communication links. The extended DPA {{is identical to the}} recursive standard DPA in case of all sensor data appear in the timely correct order. In an experimental study, we show that the derived algorithm can compensate all occurring time delays very well. Keywords: Track-Before-Detect, Out-of-Sequence, Dynamic Programming Approach...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a transmission line (TL) approach {{developed in the}} field of metamaterials for planar devices and circuits. Materials under consideration are dielectric substrates, containing or not nanoscaled ferromagnetic inclusions, that can be arranged in a periodic way with specific impedances and phase velocities. They form photonic or periodic bandgap (PBG) substrates, on which planar guiding structures are deposited. These PBG substrates show some similarities with integrated Bragg reflector topologies previously investigated in the optical range. Using the TL concept, defect modes in PBG planar devices are studied. A theoretical explanation of defect mode operation, which is validated by measurement on a dielectric PBG structure, is proposed. It is then transposed to a magnetic PBG structure based on arrays of nanoscaled ferromagnetic nanowires. The effect on its frequency response of varying the defect length is discussed, in order to design planar <b>sensors</b> and filters. <b>Extension</b> of the magnetic PBG structure for applications in the optical range is finally proposed...|$|R
