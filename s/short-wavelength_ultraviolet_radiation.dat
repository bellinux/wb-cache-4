40|$|AbstractOzone, the triatomic form of oxygen, can be {{generated}} by exposing normal diatomic oxygen gas to energetic electrons, X-rays, nuclear gamma rays, <b>short-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UV) and electrical discharges. Ozone is toxic to all forms of life, and governmental regulations have been established to protect people from excessive exposures to this gas. The human threshold limit values (TLV) vary from 60 to 100 parts per billion (ppb) in air, depending on the agency or country involved. Much higher concentrations can be produced inside industrial electron beam (EB) facilities, so methods for ozone removal must be provided. Equations for calculating the ozone yield vs absorbed energy, the production rate vs absorbed power, and the concentration in the air of an EB facility are presented in this paper. Since the production rate and concentration are proportional to the EB power dissipated in air, they are dependent on the design and application of the irradiation facility. Examples of these calculations are given for a typical EB process to cross-link insulated electrical wire or plastic tubing. The electron energy and beam power {{are assumed to be}} 1. 5 MeV and 75 kW...|$|E
40|$|This project {{sought to}} deliver new {{understanding}} of the responses of pest insects to light {{for the purpose of}} improved agricultural pest control. Through access to experimental polyethylene horticultural films with novel transmission properties, I exploited new opportunities for exploring separate short- and long-wavelength mechanisms for pest suppression. The early experimental work of the project tested the effect of short- and long-wavelength ultraviolet light on the population growth of the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae, on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) plants. These polytunnel field experiments established new hypotheses for the role of long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation as an environmental cue for damaging <b>short-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> Through a series of methodological developments, I quantified both the dose-response of environmentally-relevant ultraviolet on M. persicae mortality, and proposed a colour behavioural model for the feeding behaviour of M. persicae under different illumination conditions. Through synthesising these findings into a model of aphid hazard-avoidance, I show that the behaviour of M. persicae may be manipulated to increase its exposure to solar short-wavelength radiation, with consequences for population growth rate. As such, this mechanism may be used in protected agricultural practice as part of a wider integrated pest management strategy...|$|E
40|$|Two {{atmospheric}} {{responses to}} simulated astrophysical ionizing radiation events significant {{to life on}} Earth are production of odd-nitrogen species, especially NO 2, and subsequent depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone depletion increases incident <b>short-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVB, 280 - 315 nm) and longer (> 600 nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400 - 700 nm). On the other hand, the NO 2 haze decreases atmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315 - 400 nm) and short wavelength PAR. Here we use the results of previous simulations of incident spectral irradiance following an ionizing radiation event to predict changes in Terran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The prediction {{is based on a}} spectral model of photosynthetic response developed for the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus), and remote-sensing based observations of spectral water transparency, temperature, wind speed and mixed layer depth. Predicted productivity declined after a simulated ionizing event, but the effect integrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into account the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0. 1 % of utilizable PAR), the decrease was at most 2 - 3 % (depending on strain), with larger effects (5 - 7 %) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer. The deeper integrations were most affected by the decreased utilizable PAR at depth due to the NO 2 haze, whereas shallower integrations were most affected by the increased surface UV.

40|$|Mouse 3 T 3 {{fibroblasts}} lacking c-fos {{were employed}} to demonstrate an essential function of the UV-inducible transcription factor AP- 1 (Fos/Jun) in {{the response to the}} cytotoxic effects of <b>short-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UVC) <b>radiation.</b> Clonogenic survival and proliferation of cells lacking c-fos were drastically reduced following UV irradiation. This UV hypersensitivity manifests itself primarily in increased cell death, partly by apoptosis, and prolonged recovery time from UV-induced cell cycle arrest. Co-culture with wild-type cells did not ameliorate the hypersensitivity of mutant cells. Transcriptional induction of the c-Fos target genes collagenase I, stromelysin- 1 and stromelysin- 2 by UV is almost absent in cells lacking c-fos which correlates with a reduced UV induction of AP- 1 DNA-binding and transactivation activity. The repair of UV-induced DNA lesions was not affected, as shown by unscheduled DNA synthesis and host cell reactivation assays. These data demonstrate that c-Fos is involved in a novel protective function other than DNA repair against the harmful consequences of UVC...|$|R

40|$|Exposure of {{mammalian}} {{cells to}} <b>short-wavelength</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVC) induces {{dramatic changes in}} gene expression (UVC response). To date, only few transcription factors are known to mediate the UVC response: AP- 1 (Fos/Jun), NF-#kappa#B, TCF/Elk 1, and Jun/ATF- 2. In this thesis, I present evidence that a ubiquitous transcriptional activator, the cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein (CREB), is also involved in mediating the UVC response. UVC irradiation causes phosphorylation of CREB at serine residue 133, an event which is invariantly required for the transactivation potential of CREB. In contrast to previous views, CREB and the proximal cAMP Responsive Element (CRE) in the promotor region of the proto-oncogene c-fos appear {{to play an important}} role in the UVC-induced transcriptional activation of this gene. A novel serine/threonine protein kinase with a molecular weight of 108 kD is responsible for this UVC-induced CREB phosphorylation. Furthermore, I show that, in HeLa cells, several growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Epidermal Growth Factor, basic Fibroblast Growth Factor, Interleukin- 1 #alpha#, Tumor Necrosis Factor-#alpha#, and a multi-component, UVC-induced, secreted activity, known as Extracellular Protein Synthesis Inducing Factor, EPIF) induce the same phosphorylation of CREB. I present data, which argue against the assumption that free cytosolic calcium is an induced 'second messenger' in the UVC-initiated signal transduction. Finally, the effects of UVC on the CREB-related transcriptional activator, ATF- 1, were also ivnestigated. In many respects, the mechanisms of UVC-induced signal transduction to CREB, described here, also appear to apply to this protein. In the second part of my thesis, I present data indicating that CREB is a target for repression by the activated glucocorticoid receptor in the regulation of the transcriptional induction of the c-fos gene by cAMP. In numerous cell types, elevated cytosolic cAMP levels differentially regulate the expression of several AP- 1 family members: They induce the transcription of c-fos and junB genes, but strongly repress c-jun. I describe here that glucocorticoids antagonize both the positive and the negative effects of cAMP, thus providing a novel level of regulation of AP- 1 expression. Taken together, these observations favour a mechanism of repression in which glucocorticoids down-modulate the transactivation potential of CREB via GR-induced conformational changes in the CREB molecule which, in turn, are likely to repress the formation of a functional CREB-CBP-basal transcriptional machinery complex.
