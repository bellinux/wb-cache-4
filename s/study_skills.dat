In this study, pre test post test from experiment models and semi experimental model with control group were preferred. The reason for the preference is our wish to make a comparison between the group on which curriculum was implemented (experiment group), and the group on which curriculum was not implemented (control group) in terms of academic achievement, and acquiring efficient <b>studying</b> <b>skills.</b> <b>Study</b> population of this research covers 7 th grade students from Refika Küçükçalık Primary School in Kocasinan district of Kayseri which is located in the middle of Turkey during 2011 2012 academic year (8 units, 320 students). Sample of the study was determined according to purposive sampling which is one of non probability sampling types. Obtained data were analysed employing Covariance Analysis (ANCOVA). As a result, this research indicated that students can acquire efficientstudying skills by means of Curriculum for Developing Efficient <b>Studying</b> <b>Skills</b> and they increase their academic achievements thanks to these studying habits. In this sense, if quality of education is desired to be increased, students with high level of academic achievements are intended and growing youth is expected to compete with the young population of other states with the effect of globalization, it is necessary to make students acquire efficient <b>studying</b> <b>skills...</b>|$|R
