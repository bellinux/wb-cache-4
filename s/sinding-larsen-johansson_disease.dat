He was voted into the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, {{but he could}} not participate due to injury. The Raptors did not fare well without their All-Star player. The team lost 17 of 18 games to drop to 30-38, then won 12 of their last 14 to finish at 42-40. On December 12, 2001, in a win against the Denver Nuggets, Carter recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals to become only the second player in NBA history to record at least 40 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists and 5 steals since the NBA started recording steals. Carter was injured during the 2002 NBA Playoffs, and his team was defeated in the first round by the Detroit Pistons, in five games. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Game, Carter gave up his starting All-Star spot to the Washington Wizards' Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star. During his Raptors tenure, news came out that Carter had developed <b>Sinding-Larsen-Johansson</b> <b>disease</b> also known as [...] "jumper's knee", which drew criticism and questions from local media outlets and fans about Carter's long term durability as a NBA scorer.|$|E
