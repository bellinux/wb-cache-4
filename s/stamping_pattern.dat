40|$|High {{temperature}} {{nanoimprint lithography}} has the drawback of long process cycle, demoulding difficulty, polymer degradation, thermal stress. Low temperature nanoimprint lithography (LTNIL) can avoid these problems. LTNIL is also ideal for manufacturing biological compatibility samples since the samples do not sustain high temperature. However, LTNIL need {{to optimize the}} press parameters in order to fully transfer patterns. Finite Element Method (FEM) is an excellent approach to examine the filling process.

5000|$|While some {{individual}} buildings have undergone contemporary remodeling, the district retains its fundamental architectural integrity. As {{is common to}} this region, many wood-frame buildings have been sided with either vinyl or aluminum. Some houses have also had windows replaced with modern sash, resulting in some loss of architectural detail. A much smaller number have had their original sliding sash replaced with large [...] "picture" [...] windows or bay windows. In other cases, Victorian-era porch posts and ornamental details like brackets have been replaced with simple square posts or iron rod supports. Some roofs, which originally were metal (either raised seam, corrugated or a <b>stamped</b> <b>pattern),</b> have been replaced with modern composite shingle. A modest number of these early 20th century metal surfaces, which were corrugated or <b>stamped</b> <b>pattern,</b> survive. Original slate roofs exist in more significant numbers. Perhaps half of these examples have been covered with a silver paint applied as a sealant and heat reflectant. Despite the results of contemporary maintenance, {{a large majority of}} buildings retain many other significant features, such as original windows, doors, porches, chimneys and rooflines. Other underlying characteristics, such as building scale, massing, setbacks and site location, remain intact as well. Overall, most of the common renovations, such as modern siding and inappropriate porch posts, are relatively superficial and reversible if desired.|$|R

30|$|UV-NIL is the lithographic method, {{offered by}} the {{custom-built}} machine, which offers the highest single exposure resolution. By first defining and etching a mould using EBL and reactive ion etching (RIE), one may cast a UV-transparent elastomer such as PDMS onto the mould, relieve it and mount it on the stepper head (with {{the assistance of a}} quartz or glass back plate) to create a UV-NIL stamp (the details of how to fabricate such a device are detailed in Section S 2 of Additional file 1). This style of stamp is advised because its elastomeric qualities act as a self-levelling system. Step-and-flash nanoimprint lithography (SF-NIL) may then be carried out using the machine.

40|$|Locally {{oxidized}} {{patterns on}} flat poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamps for microcontact printing {{were used as}} a platform for the transfer of a hydrophilic fluorescent ink to a glass substrate. The contrast {{was found to be}} limited. These locally oxidized patterns were conversely used as barriers for the transfer of hydrophobic n-octadecanethiol. In this case a good contrast was obtained, but the pattern was found to be susceptible to defects (cracks) in the barrier layer. Local stamp surface oxidation and subsequent modification with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane, for use as a barrier in the transfer of n-octadecanethiol, 16 -mercaptohexadecanoic acid, and octanethiol, resulted in remarkably good contrast and stable patterns. The improved ink transfer control is ascribed to the reduction of undesired surface spreading and a superior mechanical stability of the <b>stamp</b> <b>pattern.</b> This new approach substantially expands the applicability of microcontact printing and provides a tool for the faithful reproduction of even extremely low filling ratio patterns...|$|R
30|$|Anisotropic {{patterns}} with water wettability difference were formed simply by pressing nano-needle array with a PU stamp. It has been revealed by flattening the nano-needle array that the flattened array showed a small value of contact angle {{compared with the}} nano-needle array. The pattern of the PU stamp which had lines or alphabet letters has been successfully stamped onto the nano-needle array. One of the <b>stamped</b> <b>patterns</b> is shown in Figure 4 b. As shown {{on the right of}} Figure 4 a, the pressed area (the right side) is smooth and flat, in contrast to the unpressed area (the left side). Thus, the unpressed area in which nano-needles remain unaffected would be super-hydrophobic, while the pressed area in which nano-needles are made flat would show a much decreased hydrophobicity or a little of hydrophilicity due to the hydrophilic P 2 VP block. This anisotropic pattern with different wettability will be further applied as a template for electrical materials such as metals and semiconductors which are selectively deposited on the hydrophilic area.|$|R

For elliptic/circular stamps, it efficiently exploits the orientation information from pairs of edge points to determine its center position and area, without computing all the five parameters of an ellipse. In our approach, we considered the set of unique characteristics of <b>stamp</b> <b>patterns.</b> Specifically, we introduced effective algorithms {{to address the problem}} that stamps often spatially overlay their background contents. These give our approach significant advantages in detection accuracy and computation complexity over traditional Hough transform method in locating candidate ellipse regions.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionClosed {{reduction}} of secondary displacements of distal metaphyseal radius fractures {{is an easy}} procedure only when performed within the first ten to fifteen days post-trauma, prior to the occurrence of malunion. When a hard bony callus prevents proper reduction, an open osteotomy is generally advocated. HypothesisWe suggest {{the use of a}} less invasive technique which aims at correcting early malunion when closed reduction is made impossible: the percutaneous callus osteoclasis. Materials and methodsCallus osteoclasis consists in a series of multiple bone-drilling in a postage <b>stamp</b> <b>pattern</b> performed under image intensifier using a large diameter pin, at a distance from the growth plate. Once the bone has been weakened, reduction is obtained by using the pin as an intrafocal lever. The pin is then pushed through the opposite cortex to ensure postero-lateral stabilization.

In the μCP process, a microstructured elastomer stamp is coated with a solution of a nanomaterial and applied to a substrate of choice.

The elastomer stamps are made typically from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) by curing liquid prepolymers of PDMS on a lithographically prepared master. Since μCP technique is carried out under ambient conditions, different biomolecules have been directly transferred in a controlled way onto a variety of substrates while retaining their biological activity [130 – 134].
