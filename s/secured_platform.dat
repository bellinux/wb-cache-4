EMHS (developed in 2008) is capable {{to modify the}} privacy and efficiency with increasing number of sites. The efficiency of EMHS is discerned to be much better than MHS, particularly for databases with increasing number of sites. A second approach is also presented for the other types of datasets. It is important to solving the collusion of Initiator and Combiner. Om Kumar et al. (2013) used WEKA to predict the patterns in a single cloud.

40|$|Computing {{applications}} and data are growing {{so rapidly that}} increasingly larger servers and data centre are needed for fast processing within the required time. A fundamental shift in the way Information Technology (IT) and computing services are being delivered and purchased results {{in the development of}} cloud computing. The out of control cost of power in terms of electricity generation, personnel hardware and limited spaces in data centers have encouraged a significant number of enterprises to move more infrastructures into a third party provided Cloud. However, Cloud computing requires that organizations trust that a service provider’s platforms are secured and provide a sufficient level of integrity for the client’s data. Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory {{that can be used to}} create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys. An important factor is the key strength, i. e. the difficulty in breaking the key and retrieving the plain text. In this paper, we proposed Elliptic Curve Cryptography scheme as a secure tool to model a <b>Secured</b> <b>platform</b> for th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a SIMULINK block {{set for the}} behavioral modeling and high-level simulation of RF receiver frontends. The toolbox includes a library with the main RF circuit models that are needed to implement wireless receivers, namely: low noise amplifiers, mixers, oscillators, filters and programmable gain amplifiers. There is also a library including other blocks like the antenna, duplexer filter and switches, required to implement reconfigurable architectures. Behavioral models of building blocks include the main ideal functionality {{as well as the}} following non-idealities: thermal noise, characterized by the noise figure and the signal-to-noise ratio, and non-linearity, represented by the input-referred second-order and third-order intercept points, IIP_ 2 and IIP_ 3, respectively. In addition to these general parameters, some block-specific errors have also been included, like oscillator phase noise and mixer offset. These models have been incorporated into the SIMULINK environment making an extensive use of C-coded S-functions and reducing the number of library block elements. This approach reduces the simulation time while keeping high accuracy, which makes the proposed toolbox very appropriate to be combined with an optimizer for the automated high-level synthesis of radio receivers. As an application of the capabilities of the presented toolbox, a multi-standard direct-conversion receiver intended for 4 G telecom systems is modeled and simulated considering the building block requirements for the different standards.

40|$|Abstract — Building high {{assurance}} secure applications {{requires the}} proper use of security mechanisms and assurances provided by the underlying <b>secure</b> <b>platform.</b> However, applications are often built using security patterns and best practices that are agnostic with respect to the intricate specifics of the different underlying platforms. This independence from the underlying platform leaves a gap between security patterns and underlying <b>secure</b> <b>platforms.</b> In this PhD research abstract, we propose a novel approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, we propose reusable capability-specific design fragments for security patterns, which are specialization for patterns in a capabilitybased system. The focus is on systems that adhere to a capabilitybased security model, which we consider as the underlying platforms, to provide desired application-wide security properties. We also discuss assumptions and levels of assurance for these reusable designs and their use in the verification of application designs...|$|R
