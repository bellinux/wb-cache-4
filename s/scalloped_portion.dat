40|$|Analysis and {{experimental}} {{measurement of the}} electromagnet force loads on the hybrid rotor in a novel bearingless switched-reluctance motor (BSRM) have been performed. A BSRM has the combined characteristics of a switched-reluctance motor and a magnetic bearing. The BSRM has an eight-pole stator and a six-pole hybrid rotor, which is composed of circular and scalloped lamination segments. The hybrid rotor is levitated using only one set of stator poles. A second set of stator poles imparts torque to the <b>scalloped</b> <b>portion</b> of the rotor, which is driven in a traditional switched reluctance manner by a processor. Analysis was done for nonrotating rotor poles that were oriented to achieve maximum and minimum radial force loads on the rotor. The objective is to assess whether simple one-dimensional magnetic circuit analysis is sufficient for preliminary evaluation of this machine, which may exhibit strong three-dimensional electromagnetic field behavior. Two magnetic circuit geometries, approximating the complex topology of the magnetic fields {{in and around the}} hybrid rotor, were employed in formulating the electromagnetic radial force equations. Reasonable agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions was obtained with typical magnetic bearing derating factors applied to the predictions...|$|E
40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{can acquire}} diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins via ingestion of toxigenic dinoflagellates. The dynamics and fate of DSP toxins were investigated {{in the bay}} scallop Argopecten irradians exposed to cells of the epibenthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, a known producer of DSP toxins, in controlled laboratory microcosms. Toxin parameters determined were uptake and detoxification rates, and anatomical compartmentalization. Toxins in tissue and algal extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). No mortalities occurred and feeding inhibition was not observed for juvenile and adult bay scallops during the 2 wk exposure to P, lima cells. Clearance rates were similar for scallops exposed to equivalent biovolume cell concentrations of toxigenic P. lima and the non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii; however, absorption efficiency of organic matter was significantly lower with a diet of P. Lima than T. weissflogii, Although DSP toxin concentrations in viscera of bay scallop exceeded commonly accepted regulatory levels (0. 2 mug g(- 1) whole tissue) within 24 h of exposure to P. lima, after 2 wk of exposure total DSP toxin retained in scallop tissues was < 1 % of the total toxin ingested over the same period. Most of the total toxin body burden was in the viscera (76 %); however, in adult <b>scallops</b> a significant <b>portion</b> was associated with gonadal tissue (12 %). Toxin levels were relatively low in gill, mantle and adductor tissue (< 12 % of total toxin body burden). During the depuration period, rapid release of DSP toxins from scallops indicated that toxins were poorly bound to all tissues, {{with the exception of}} the viscera. Detoxification of viscera consisted of a rapid loss of weakly bound toxin components within the initial 3 d of depuration, followed by a much slower release of the remaining toxin at a rate of 8. 4 % d(- 1).
