40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} for {{the dynamics of}} slender sheets of viscoplastic fluid. First a model suitable for relatively small curvature is presented and applied to the fall <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquid bridge supported at its two ends. Second, order-one curvatures are considered, along with the <b>sagging</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> with <b>a</b> free end that is either emplaced or extruded horizontally. We then present a theory combining both limits of curvature, and consider the buckling <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearly vertical column. Analogous models for a circular viscoplastic thread are also discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Advancements in the design, {{manufacturing}} {{and testing of}} optical systems have created {{the need for new}} functional representations for aspheric surfaces. The representations must define surfaces that can compensate for <b>a</b> high degree <b>of</b> wavefront asphericity and represent steeply sloped surfaces as the surface normal becomes perpendicular to the optical axis. As the standard asphere is explicitly defined, the range of surfaces that it can properly describe is limited. This work develops both a parametrically defined surface approach and an implicitly defined surface approach. Whereas the surface <b>sag</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explicit surface is defined directly using one equation, the <b>sag</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parametric surface is defined using at least two equations. The <b>sag</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> implicit surface is defined indirectly using a surface function. The utility of these novel approaches is demonstrated using examples of current interest. Specifically, a truncated parametric Taylor surface and an implicit xyz-polynomial surface are shown to be more general definitions that represent highly aspheric surfaces better the standard explicit asphere. Ray tracing and optimization strategies for parametric and implicit surface representations are discussed. Additionally, this work shows that a Fourier series is not a useful optical surface and introduces the explicit superconic surface, which is <b>a</b> redefinition <b>of</b> the standard superconic surface. Finally, we compare the surface types discussed for ray tracing speed, optimization complexity, and ability to represent highly aspheric surfaces...|$|R

30|$|Resonance {{frequencies}} of beams with {{various types of}} end supports were examined for flexural vibration. Rectangular beams with dimensions of 300 (L) × 25 (R) × 5 or 10 mm (T) were used as the test specimens. Various compressing stresses were applied to the parts around both ends <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test <b>beam</b> and flexural vibration tests were conducted. The measured resonance frequency started to increase from the resonance frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> with simply supported ends and was stable around the resonance frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> with fixed ends as the compressing stress increased. The stable resonance frequency was lower than the theoretical value because perfect fixation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> to <b>a</b> post was difficult. From these results, the temporal change in resonance frequency itself, rather than the stable resonance frequency, is effective to examine whether <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> has enough strength as a guardrail.|$|R
