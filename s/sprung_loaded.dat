40|$|A {{test rig}} which {{replicates}} a one quarter vehicle of a {{rear wheel drive}} vehicle, including the suspension system, is used to investigate a low frequency noise. The cross beam is included along with the vehicle suspension spring which is loaded against a <b>sprung</b> <b>loaded</b> mechanism which represents the tire stiffness exactly and supports the brake geometrically as the tire would. Drive to the drum is from a DC motor through the wheel drive axle. Holographic interferometry is used to observe the modes of vibration of the drum with mirrors strategically placed to observe additional features such as the backplate, spring pan and cross beam. Initial results show the mode of vibration of the backplate to be of a diametral mode order and to be {{moving in the direction}} of drum rotation. Additionally it is seen that the spring pan and cross beam exhibit high amplitudes of vibration. Additional tests are then undertaken with the suspension members omitted and the brake arranged to allow visual access to the brake shoes...|$|E

40|$|A {{device for}} connecting, {{rotating}} and locking together {{a pair of}} structural half columns is described. The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical hub assemblies connected at their inner faces by a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> hinge; each hub assembly having a structural half column attached to its outer end. Each hub assembly has a <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes a latch member for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each hub assembly also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing hub assembly when the hub assemblies are rotated together.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> rack and pinion. This <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in <b>spring</b> <b>loading.</b> The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage <b>loaded</b> with linear <b>springs</b> or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length <b>load</b> <b>spring</b> with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> {{restrictions}} (SLR) impose {{restrictions on}} heavy trucks {{during the spring}} thaw period. Although the policies have been implemented for many years, their economic effects on truckers remain uncertain. This study {{provides an overview of}} practices around the world and sets up a framework to estimate the benefitâ€“cost of the SLR policy. A freight demand model in Minnesota was built to estimate the impacts of SLR on the freight transportation pattern. The model allows various policy scenarios to be tested before being put into practice. A preliminary result of the freight demand model indicates the SLR policy increased truck vehicle kilometers of travel in Lyon County, Minnesota, by about 13 %. <b>Spring</b> <b>load</b> restrictions (SLR) restrict the axle loading of heavy trucks during the spring thaw.

40|$|A linkage of rigid bodies under gravity loads can be statically counter-balanced by add-ing {{compensating}} gravity loads. Similarly, gravity <b>loads</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> can be counter-balanced {{by adding}} springs. In the current literature, among the techniques that add springs, some achieve perfect static balance while others achieve only approximate bal-ance. Further, {{all of them}} add auxiliary bodies to the linkage in addition to springs. We present a perfect static balancing technique that adds only springs but not auxiliary bodies, {{in contrast to the}} existing techniques. This technique can counter-balance both gravity <b>loads</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>loads.</b> The technique requires that every joint that connects two bodies in the linkage be either a revolute joint or a spherical joint. Apart from this, the linkage can have any number of bodies connected in any manner. In order to achieve perfect balance, this technique requires that all the <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> have the feature of zero-free-length, {{as is the case with}} the existing techniques. This requirement is neither impractical nor restrictive since the feature can be practically incorporated into any normal spring either by modifying the spring or by adding another spring in parallel.

40|$|The {{main problem}} of the {{presence}} of high velocity winds that will cause the unloader to move from its position and cause damages to the cargo and the machineryfor grab type ship unloader is solved using a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> hydraulic rail clamp mounted on a rail on which it can move to the ship and unload materials steadily. Data collected from the FACT department about the wind characteristic of the area for a particular period were used and the wind loads acting on the ship unloader is calculated. The maximum wind load that the ship unloader can withstand which has to be the one at which the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> hydraulic clamp will disable is calculated After carefully studying the already existing clamping system, we found that using an alternative spring concentrically, we can increase the wind load capacity which is the maximum load the clamp can withstand. After carefully analyzing different springs we found that with the use of concentric spring, the clamp can withstand a higher amount of wind load, thus increasing the performance of ship unloader. This is proved by <b>spring</b> <b>load</b> calculations and using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS software...|$|R
