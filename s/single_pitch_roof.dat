30|$|The tiled roof {{covering}} of the sacristy room consists of plain <b>roofing</b> tiles. The <b>single</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> pours water {{out along the}} fall line which {{is parallel to the}} longitudinal axis of the nave. This pitch interferes with the church projection that coincides internally with the niche wall where a painting was located. However, the solution of the insertion between the sacristy and the church caused seepages of water in the point of contact between the two spaces. This happened because the church projection formed a “plug” that prevents the water from draining regularly. As time goes by, this problem resulted in internal seepages of water causing an advanced degradation of the plaster underneath the painting.|$|R

50|$|Brown's {{first wife}} was Henrietta Hay, {{daughter}} of Edward Hay, a career diplomat, and granddaughter of George Hay, 8th Earl of Kinnoull. In 1802 she died and, the following year, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Boddington, a notorious apologist for the slave trade. When {{he died in}} 1818, he left a lifetime's interest in the hall to his wife, who lived for another 21 years. She continued Brown's benefactions, making sure the school continued. She also contributed {{the greater part of}} the cost of rebuilding the parish church, dedicated to St. Giles. In 1833, work began on the rebuilding, to a design by Francis Halley of Shifnal. The chancel and nave were reconstructed without division, under a <b>single</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> while a tower stood at the western end, above the entrance. The old materials were used where possible, although more sandstone was quarried on the estate to complete the work. Five years later, a new rectory completed the rebuilding. However, when William Smith died in 1837, Elizabeth nominated a relative, Thomas F. Boddington, as his successor. He lived for at least part of his incumbency at Shifnal.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the possibility and sustainability of retrofit and refurbishment design solutions on historical buildings converted to different uses and often clashing with their original purpose and architectural features. The building studied is an ancient monastery located in the historical center of Florence (Italy). Today the original cloister is covered over by a <b>single</b> glazed <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and used as a fashion showroom. Our proposed solution concerns a reversible and sustainable plant design integrated with an active transparent building casing. The existing glazed <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> was reconsidered and re-designed as part of the existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant system, based on the functioning of an active thermal buffer to control the high heat flow rates and external thermal loads due to solar radiation. Hourly whole building energy analysis was carried out to check the effectiveness and energy sustainability of our proposed solution. Results obtained showed, from the historical-architectural, energy and environmental points of view, its sustainability due to the building-plant system integration and interaction with its location, the external climatic conditions and defined expected uses, in particular with reference to indoor thermal comfort...|$|R
50|$|There is an unused {{weatherboard}} Earth Closet {{east of the}} lock-up. In addition {{there is}} a weatherboard shed facing Rectory Street, which is possibly the old stable that was recommended for conversion to motorcycle storage around 1956, although locals suggest that the stable was a different structure, now removed. The current shed has a casement/sash window facing the street, a <b>single</b> <b>pitch</b> skillion <b>roof,</b> and is timber framed and lined, with a double wooden door to the rear, and a recent roller door. Half of the shed stands on concrete stumps, with half constructed on a concrete slab.Vegetation on the property includes two large palm trees and one smaller palm {{in front of the}} 1934 police residence, and a bottle tree in front of the 1934 court house.

50|$|Farmers Market, {{also known}} as York Farmers' Market and Market & Penn Street Farmers' Market, is a {{historic}} public market located at York, Pennsylvania, York County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. It was built in 1876 and expanded about 1890. The original section is a simple 60 feet wide and 80 feet long gable roofed brick building. A 40 foot wide rectangular section was added in the expansion and the two sections were joined under a <b>single,</b> moderately <b>pitched</b> gable <b>roof.</b> With the expansion, a five bay wide false front was added to unify the building. The front facade features two ornamental circular windows. Attached to the main building are three auxiliary buildings including a Queen Anne style stable.|$|R
50|$|The church {{building}} is a particularly clear example of the Brick gothic style. All three naves were covered by a <b>single</b> especially large <b>pitched</b> <b>roof.</b> The west gable's extraordinary form and size derives from this design. It {{is divided into three}} stories, which each contain pointed arch windows arranged in pairs. The base line of these windows is a line of ornamental brickwork. At the apex of the gable is a cruciform window with a star of David. This has been in place since 1878, when the roof was repaired and the new gable installed, surmounted by a stone cross.The star of David was probably included as a result of horror vacui. No other symbolic significance at all is attested in church documents. One can, however, suggest that the star of David is symbolic of the Old Testament and the cruciform shape is symbolic of the New Testament. The two belong together and form the foundation of the church.|$|R
50|$|Downton {{station was}} 3 miles and 70 chains from Alderbury Junction and was located {{to the north}} of the eastern end of Downton High Street, the line {{crossing}} the road by way of a bridge. The station consisted of a passing loop with up and down platforms plus goods sidings. The main station building was a <b>single</b> storey <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> structure with mono-pitch canopy and was located on the up (north bound) platform. The signal box was a LSWR Type 1 box and was at the southern end of the down platform. The signal box was reduced to a ground frame when the station ceased to be a block post on 1 December 1922. A steel girder footbridge was installed in 1902; this was the first of its type on the LSWR. The station master's house was to the south east of the station, close to the signal box. Goods traffic was served with a cattle loading dock on the up side accessed by a lead {{to the north of}} the station and a small number of sidings for other goods, also on the up side, and served by a lead to the south of the station. After the station ceased to be a block post the down loop was converted to a siding with catch points installed at both ends. The station site today is a residential development with only the station master's house extant.|$|R
