40|$|This {{research}} {{describes an}} investigation of the correctness and speed of response that dyslexic children and matched controls perform on mathematical calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The participants were 120 boys divided into three age bands ranging from 9 : 5 - 11 : 4, 11 : 5 - 13 : 4 and 13 : 5 - 15 : 4 years of age of whom 60 were dyslexic and 60 non-dyslexic. Two sets of 144 multiplication sums, two sets of 75 addition and 75 subtraction sums and one set of 144 division sums were presented. In the case of multiplication and division, the numbers ranged from 1 to 12; in the case of addition and subtraction two separate effects were examined, viz. sums involving high and low addends / <b>subtrahends</b> in combination with sums that did and did not cross the ten barrier. Results showed that dyslexics in all age bands took longer and made fewer correct responses than non-dyslexics on all four mathematical operations. The performance of the younger dyslexics was differentially disadvantaged when compared to non-dyslexics and older dyslexics on speed and correctness. The dyslexics performed less well when no obvious algorithm was available to them and when answering questions that involved crossing the ten barrier. The dyslexics were less able, in all age bands, than non-dyslexics to respond instantaneously. The overall trend with both groups was an increase in scores with age; however on some occasions the dyslexics in the old age band did not perform as well as those in the middle-age band suggesting practice and automaticity effects. The order of difficulty (from greatest to least) of the four mathematical operations for dyslexics, as judged by number of correct responses was: division, subtraction, multiplication and addition. For the non-dyslexics this was: subtraction, division, multiplication and addition. For speed the order for both the dyslexics and non-dyslexics was: subtraction, addition, division and multiplication...|$|R
25|$|Formally, {{the number}} being {{subtracted}} {{is known as}} the <b>subtrahend,</b> while the number it is subtracted from is the minuend. The result is the difference.|$|E
25|$|Unlike addition, {{subtraction}} is not commutative, so {{the order}} of numbers in the operation will change the result. Therefore, each number is provided a different distinguishing name. The first number (5 in the previous example) is formally defined as the minuend and the second number (3 in the previous example) as the <b>subtrahend.</b> The value of the minuend {{is larger than the}} value of the <b>subtrahend</b> so that the result is a positive number, but a smaller value of the minuend will result in negative numbers.|$|E
25|$|The partial {{differences}} {{method is}} different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs {{depending on whether the}} minuend is greater or smaller than the <b>subtrahend.</b> The sum of the partial differences is the total difference.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian method {{does not}} reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it {{increases}} the <b>subtrahend</b> hundred's digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by asking what number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundred's place.|$|E
25|$|Like the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was {{indicated}} {{by placing the}} numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the <b>subtrahend,</b> and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms. The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known {{and it is possible}} that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source.|$|E
25|$|The {{additions}} method seem to {{be taught}} in two variations, which differ only in psychology. Continuing the example of , the first variation attempts to subtract 9 from 6, and then 9 from 16, borrowing a 10 by marking near the digit of the <b>subtrahend</b> in the next column. The second variation attempts to find a digit which, when added to 9, gives 6, and recognizing that is not possible, gives 16, and carrying the 10 of the 16 as a one marking near the same digit as in the first method. The markings are the same; {{it is just a}} matter of preference as to how one explains its appearance.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the origin}} of our present system of {{numerical}} notation is ancient, {{there is no doubt}} that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the <b>subtrahend</b> (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the minuend [...] minus the <b>subtrahend.</b> If the minuend {{is larger than the}} <b>subtrahend,</b> the difference is positive; if the minuend is smaller than the <b>subtrahend,</b> the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is0.|$|E
2500|$|How [...] "Elegant" [...] works: In {{place of}} an outer [...] "Euclid loop", [...] "Elegant" [...] shifts {{back and forth}} between two [...] "co-loops", an A > B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is {{less than or equal to}} the <b>subtrahend</b> S ( [...] Difference = Minuend − <b>Subtrahend),</b> the minuend can become s (the new {{measuring}} length) and the <b>subtrahend</b> can become the new r (the length to be measured); in other words the [...] "sense" [...] of the subtraction reverses.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{additions}} method, a 10 is borrowed to {{make the}} 6 into 16, {{in preparation for the}} subtraction of 9, just as in the borrowing method. However, the 10 is not taken by reducing the minuend, rather one augments the <b>subtrahend.</b> Effectively, the problem is transformed into [...] Typically a crutch of a small one is marked just below the <b>subtrahend</b> digit as a reminder. Then the operations proceed: 9 from 16 is 7; and 40 (that is, [...] ) from 80 is 40, or 47 as the result.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction is the {{mathematical}} operation which describes a reduced quantity. The {{result of this}} operation {{is the difference between}} two numbers, the minuend and the <b>subtrahend.</b> As with addition, subtraction can have a number of interpretations, such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction {{is neither}} {{commutative}} nor associative. For that reason, {{it is often}} helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and {{the opposite of the}} <b>subtrahend,</b> that is [...] When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.|$|E
2500|$|To {{subtract}} {{a binary}} number y (the <b>subtrahend)</b> from another number x (the minuend), the ones' complement of y {{is added to}} x and one {{is added to the}} sum. The leading digit [...] "1" [...] of the result is then discarded.|$|E
2500|$|Subtraction {{of natural}} numbers is not closed. The {{difference}} {{is not a}} natural number unless the minuend is {{greater than or equal}} to the <b>subtrahend.</b> For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches: ...|$|E
2500|$|The minuend is 704, the <b>subtrahend</b> is 512. The minuend digits are , [...] and [...] The <b>subtrahend</b> digits are , [...] and [...] Beginning at the one's place, 4 is {{not less}} than 2 so the {{difference}} 2 is written down in the result's one's place. In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend's hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is {{not less than}} 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place. We are now done, the result is 192.|$|E
2500|$|In this method, each digit of the <b>subtrahend</b> is {{subtracted}} from the digit above it starting {{from right to}} left. If the top number {{is too small to}} subtract the bottom number from it, we add 10 to it; this 10 is [...] "borrowed" [...] from the top digit to the left, which we subtract 1 from. Then we move on to subtracting the next digit and borrowing as needed, until every digit has been subtracted.|$|E
2500|$|Pingala (300-200 BCE) was {{a musical}} theorist who {{authored}} a Sanskrit treatise on prosody. There {{is evidence that}} in {{his work on the}} enumeration of syllabic combinations, Pingala stumbled upon both the Pascal triangle and Binomial coefficients, although he did not have knowledge of the Binomial theorem itself. A description of binary numbers is also found in the works of Pingala. The Indians also developed the use of the law of signs in multiplication. Negative numbers and the <b>subtrahend</b> had been used in East Asia since the 2nd century BCE, and Indian mathematicians were aware of negative numbers by the 7th century CE, and their role in mathematical problems of debt was understood. Although the Indians were not the first to use the <b>subtrahend,</b> they were the first to establish the [...] "law of signs" [...] with regards to the multiplication of positive and negative numbers, which did not appear in East Asian texts until 1299. Mostly consistent and correct rules for working with negative numbers were formulated, and the diffusion of these rules led the Arab intermediaries to pass it on to Europe.|$|E

Otherwise, m'i is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the minuend digit m'i+1 by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards {{until there is a}} non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the <b>subtrahend</b> digit s'i+1 by one.|$|E
