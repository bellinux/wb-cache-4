5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is the role gender plays in the {{production}} of cash crops versus subsistence crops. Here, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> effects of colonial influence on the practices of the Jola, and how traditional cultivation differs from modern cultivation of crops purely for export.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They {{look at each other}} briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man with a pair of binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> polo player over her shoulder and sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I can’t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1980s until present, Linares began {{extensive}} {{research in the}} Casamance region of Southern Senegal, the region located below the Gambia. [...] More specifically, this research focused on social organizations and food production of the Jola people (also spelled Diola.) <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> varying techniques of wet rice production and compares them with different modes of cultivation in the region. [...] She also examines how social organization shapes these differing methods.|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{reveals that}} he wants her {{to go with him}} and another woman to Utah (where {{polygamy}} is legal) so they can marry and support him while he writes. After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go. After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles). She then goes to Richard to say goodbye, saying she wants to stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated. Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday. After her grandparents tell her that her grandmother can see the future, she tells them her story. Her grandfather and his lodge friends then try a strange séance ritual to send her back to 1985.|$|E

60|$|Lancaster {{came out}} and dropped fifteen cents into Olive's hand. He could not help {{regarding}} with interest the occupants of the carriage, and Mrs. Easterfield <b>looked</b> hard <b>at</b> him. Suddenly Olive turned in her seat; <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little piazza {{by the side of}} the tollhouse. Yes, it was really the same place. For an instant she thought she might have been mistaken, but there was her window with the Virginia creeper under the sill where she had trained it herself. Then she made a motion to her companion, who immediately drove on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, [...] "you must be Unc Nunkie, {{known as}} the Silent One." [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boy. [...] "And you must be Ojo the Unlucky," [...] she added.|$|R
60|$|FANNY [crosses {{towards the}} windows. Her chief {{business}} is dabbing her eyes. The door closes with a click. She turns.

6000|$|... "They {{are rather}} a puzzle," [...] I admitted. [...] "I suppose they {{might very well}} be father and daughter. It is certain that she is fresh from some convent boarding-school.

60|$|As time flies {{her face}} is turned towards us, and lo! it {{is the face of}} Atene, and amid her dusky hair the aura is {{reflected}} in jewelled gold, the symbol of her royal rank. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shaven priest; she laughs as though in triumph; she points to the westering sun and to the river, and is gone.|$|E

6000|$|The lady's companion, being a man, {{took a more}} merciful view. [...] "She can't help being ugly," [...] he whispered. [...] "But see how <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{girl with}} her. A good old creature, I say, {{if ever there was}} one yet." [...] The lady eyed him, as only a jealous woman can eye her husband, and whispered back, [...] "Of course you're in love with that slip of a girl!" ...|$|E
60|$|How {{much more}} {{deceitful}} than her lover {{is the little}} nursery governess. The moment she comes into sight <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> post-office and sees him. Then she looks straight before her, and now she is observed, and he rushes across {{to her in a}} glory, and she starts--positively starts--as if he had taken her by surprise. Observe her hand rising suddenly to her wicked little heart. This is the moment when I stir my coffee violently. He gazes down at her in such rapture that he is in everybody's way, and as she takes his arm she gives it a little squeeze, and then away they strut, Mary doing nine-tenths of the talking. I fall to wondering what they will look like when they grow up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. Eaten {{out with}} listlessness. She's neither sick nor sorry, but how dull and dreary she is, only herself can tell. When I {{get there in}} the morning, there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don't care to get up; and then she makes me bring this book and that book, till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her, making her look, as she leans upon her elbow, like the stoning of Stephen. She yawns; then she looks towards the tall glass; then she {{looks out at the}} weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, a hundred and fifty words a minute; then <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock; then she asks me what I've been reading.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> question," [...] Isabel {{answered}} with much spirit. [...] "I'm {{not in my}} first youth--I can do what I choose--I belong quite to the independent class. I've neither father nor mother; I'm poor and of a serious disposition; I'm not pretty. I therefore am not bound to be timid and conventional; indeed I can't afford such luxuries. Besides, I try to judge things for myself; to judge wrong, I think, is more honourable than not to judge at all. I don't wish to be a mere sheep in the flock; I wish to choose my fate and know something of human affairs beyond {{what other people think}} it compatible with propriety to tell me." [...] She paused a moment, but not long enough for her companion to reply. He was apparently on the point of doing so when she went on: [...] "Let me say this to you, Mr. Goodwood. You're so kind as to speak of being afraid of my marrying. If you should hear a rumour that I'm on the point of doing so--girls are liable to have such things said about them--remember what I have told you about my love of liberty and venture to doubt it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you {{indebted to}} {{for what is}} going to happen to-day?" [...] he went on, more and more passionately. [...] "You are indebted to Me. Who among you all stood alone in refusing to believe that she was blind for life? I did! Who brought the man here who has given her back her sight? I brought the man! And I am the one person who is to be left in ignorance of how it ends. The others are to be present: I am to be sent away. The others are to see it: I am to hear by post (if any of you think of writing to me) what she does, what she says, how <b>she</b> <b>looks,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first heavenly moment when she opens her eyes on the world." [...] He flung up his hand in the air, and burst out savagely with a bitter laugh. [...] "I astonish you, don't I? I am {{claiming}} a position which I have no right to occupy. What interest can I feel in it? Oh God! what do I care about the woman to whom I have given a new life?" [...] His voice broke into a sob at those last wild words. He tore at the breast of his coat as if he was suffocating--and turned, and left me.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "And I don't {{know why}} I say it, now. It's because I'm so tired I don't know what I am saying. Do forgive me! It's this terrible Christmas spirit that gets into me.

You can help cheer Clarence up; you know his Christmas Eve dumps." [...] She runs to them and clasps them in her arms with several half-open {{packages}} dangling from her hands and contrasting their disarray with the neatness of their silk-ribboned and tissue-papered parcels which their embrace makes meet at her back. [...] "Minnie! Aggie! To lug here, when {{you ought to be}} at home in bed dying of fatigue! But it's just like you, both of you. Did you ever see anything like the stores to-day?
