40|$|Telecommunications {{operators}} {{in developing countries}} {{are faced with a}} problem of knowing their prepaid subscriber usage patterns. They have a challenge of reducing prepaid churn and maximizing the lifetime value of their subscribers. The prepaid subscriber is anonymous, and the only way a prepaid subscriber gives information to the operator is through call records of events {{on the use of the}} telecommunications network. Thus, the call details in their raw form do not provide any useful information. In addition, these details provide an overwhelming amount of data that is not easy to analyze. To assist the telecommunications operators, this study undertook to develop a visualization framework that helps telecommunication operators discover prepaid subscriber usage patterns. An exploratory approach was used to unravel subscriber usage patterns from call data records obtained from a local telecommunication operator in Uganda. Five visualization tools that were selected based on their functionalities. Based on the findings, a visualization framework for discovering subscriber usage patterns is presented. The framework is evaluated using call data with known knowledge obtained from the local telecommunication operator. Results outline the strengths of various visualization techniques as regards to <b>specific</b> <b>prepaid</b> usage patterns...|$|R
40|$|Prepaid {{products}} {{can become an}} effective instrument for banking the poor, {{as they can be}} used for collecting microdeposits and so operate as a low-cost account. Prepaid platforms have characteristics that make them especially useful for developing low-cost microfinance business models. Indeed, customers using prepaid systems do not need bank accounts or debit or credit cards. Prepaid issuers do not need to develop or invest in new technologies, as this mechanism can be used on a range of platforms, including PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Furthermore, prepaid products are specially designed for offering services demanded by the poor, such as micropayments, microdeposits and even microcredits. Lastly, they allow users to monitor their cash flow by receiving statements (some providers offer this feature online, others provide physical statements) or accessing balances through PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Besides collecting microdeposits, prepaid products (or SVCs as they are called in the United States) offer other services that can be very valuable for serving the unbanked population. As explained in this paper, prepaid products generally lack the identification and credit requirements that effectively bar millions of individuals from opening traditional bank accounts, especially in the United States. Moreover, prepaid {{products can}} be purchased and reloaded at a growing number of locations other than bank branches, such as check cashers, convenience stores and other retailers. <b>Prepaid</b> <b>instruments</b> can also provide immediate availability of funds at a cost that, in some cases, is lower than other alternatives for unbanked consumers. Also, prepaid products are difficult to overdraw, thus reducing the likelihood of unexpected fees. Lastly, many prepaid issuers offer some sort of bill pay option, especially branded cards that enable signature-based transactions, and a significant number of them offer remittances.

40|$|The Indian telecom {{industry}} is a very dynamic industry with very stiff competition amongst existing service providers in the telecom market. One of the major drivers of this industry has been mobile telephony. But due to increasing competi-tion, maintaining a loyal consumer base {{seems to be a}} challenge for the Indian cellular service providers. Customer loyalty and retention towards a specific brand have become important goals for them. In this context the present paper focuses on the influence of brand oriented factors to ensure customer retention and enhancing loyalty.

40|$|In this project, we {{are going}} to be {{analysing}} a large file of dataset (consumers’ complaints) to make sure that consumers are treated fairly by financial companies such as banks, lenders and so on. This data is made available by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this dataset provides consumers’ experience in their own words explaining what happened in different sectors of finance like in mortgage services, prepaid card services, student loan and so on. To do so, we analyse consumers’ complaints on <b>specific</b> services (<b>Prepaid</b> Cards and Student Loan) so by adding their consents, consumers help to improve the financial marketplace for better experience in the future and companies have a clear understanding in what must be done to improve their services or products to meet consumers’ need. Measuring sentiment will help us to understand the overall feeling of consumers on a specific subject, in this scenario student loan and prepaid card services. This helps in creating a complete image of the consumers’ feedback on the service. Sentiment is a point of view of an individual towards a specific subject, that point of view can be either positive, negative or neutral. Two algorithms (Score sentiment algorithm and Naïve Bayes algorithm) are used in order to produce sentiment from the consumers’ complaints dataset (Prepaid Cards and Student Loan) and to then classify the data of each service into “positive”, “Neutral” and “negative” sentiment. For this analysis 9, 403 consumers’ complaints have been collected on student loan service and 1, 271 consumers’ complaints on prepaid cards. Both of datasets have been collected on the 28 th April 2017, they both successfully classified using the score sentiment approach and the machine learning approach...|$|R
