40|$|Evidence for {{dark matter}} (DM) has been {{reported}} using astronomical observations in systems such as the Bullet cluster. Weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), in particular the lightest neutralino, {{are the most popular}} DM candidates within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Many groups in the world are focussing their attention on the direct detection of DM in the laboratory. The detectors should have large target masses and excellent noise rejection capabilities because of the small cross section between DM and ordinary matter (σWIMP−nucleon < 4 · 10 − 8 pb). Noble liquids are today considered {{to be one of the}} best options for large-size DM experiments, as they have a relatively low ionization energy, good scintillation properties and long electron lifetime. Moreover noble liquid detectors are easily scalable to large masses. This thesis deals with the development of a large (1 ton) LAr WIMP detector (ArDM) which could measure simultaneously light and charge from the scintillation and the ion- ization of liquid argon. Argon vacuum ultra violet (VUV) scintillation light has to be converted with wavelength shifter (WLS) materials such as TetraPhenyl Butadiene (TPB) in order to be detected by photomultipliers with bialkali photocathodes. This thesis de- scribes the research and developments performed to detect the 128 nm VUV light with high efficiency and low threshold. The scintillation light from α particles in gaseous (GAr) and liquid argon (LAr) was used for the development of an optimal WLS coated reflector. Different coating techniques were investigated and optimized. The best results were achieved using the evaporation technique, a teflon membrane (Tetratex) as reflector material, and a WLS surface density of 1 mg/cm 2 (TPB). The LAr scintillation light was studied for different projectiles. The relative intensities of the scintillation components were measured for α−particles, electrons and muons. Neutron induced argon nuclear recoils were also measured. An evaporator chamber was constructed for the evaporation of the WLS on large surfaces. This research and development was preparatory for the construction of the ArDM light readout which is composed mainly of two parts: the <b>side</b> <b>reflector</b> and the light detector. The <b>side</b> <b>reflector</b> was segmented in panels which were coated using the large evaporator. The light detector is composed of an array of 14 × 8 ” cryogenic photomultipliers (PMTs).

A light readout system with the <b>side</b> <b>reflector</b> and 8 PMT modules with different coatings on the photocathodes, was assembled at CERN at the end of 2007.

40|$|Simple diffuse rear reflectors {{can enhance}} the light path length of weakly absorbed near {{infrared}} light in silicon solar cells and set a benchmark for more complex and expensive light trapping structures like dielectric gratings or plasmonic particles. We analyzed such simple diffuse rear reflectors systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO 2 nanoparticles, white backsheets and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and rear side, textured front and planar rear side, and textured front and rear side. We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO 2 nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. The short circuit current density gains for a 200 mu m thick planar solar cell reached up to 1. 8 mA/cm(2), compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and up to 0. 8 mA/cm(2) compared to a high-quality silver mirror rear side.

40|$|Light {{trapping}} plays a {{key role}} in solar cell to enhance light confinement and then light absorption within the cell. The reduction of the optical losses reflects in photovoltaic solar cell efficiency enhancement. To this aim different and combined strategies can be adopted. Firstly a reflectance reduction of sunlight impinging on the cell is mandatory. Then a cell surface texturing can be very helpful to reduce the reflection by increasing the chances of reflected light bouncing back onto the surface rather than surrounding air. To this purpose different approach can be followed such as substrate and/or single layer texturing. Moreover particular care should be paid to the rear side of the cell where the introduction of a reflecting mirror can produce an optical path length enhancement over a wide wavelength spectrum. Rightly combining the front side texturing and the rear side mirroring it is possible to enhance this pathlength up to 50 times the device thickness indicating that light bounces back and forth within the cell many times performing a light confinement. To this purpose Bragg reflector formed using thin film technology is one of the most promising approach to the back <b>side</b> <b>reflector.</b> Also multi-junction cell, such as tandem micromorph, can receive benefit to the light management by the introduction of inner reflector within the two cells to enhance the spectral separation between the two cells and reduce the front cell thickness where the metastability problem still remain an open request.

The number and dimensions of coolant holes are varied to optimize the pressure drop, the inlet velocity, {{and the percentage of}} graphite removed from the PSR to create this inlet path. With the removal of ~ 10 % of the graphite from PSR the PVT is reduced from 541 0 C to 421 0 C. A new design for the graphite block core has been evaluated and optimized to reduce the inlet coolant temperature with the aim of further reduction of PVT. The dimensions and number of fuel rods and coolant holes, and the triangular pitch have been changed and optimized. Different packing fractions for the new core design have been used to conserve the number of fuel particles. Thermal properties for the fuel elements are calculated and incorporated into these analyses. The inlet temperature, mass flow and bypass flow are optimized to limit the peak fuel temperature (PFT) within an acceptable range. Using both of these modifications together, the PVT is reduced to ~ 350 0 C while keeping the outlet temperature at 950 0 C and maintaining the PFT within acceptable limits. The vessel and fuel temperatures during low pressure conduction cooldown and high pressure conduction cooldown transients are found to be well below the design limits.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the development of a systems-CFD model of the PBMR reactor that used the minimum number of grid points to achieve grid independence. The number of grid points is reduced by increasing the accuracy of the discretisation scheme in the reactor model. Any {{reduction in the number of}} grid points leads to an increase in calculation speed, which is critical for systems simulation codes that are used for optimisation or transient simulations. While some previous reactor models had been developed for systems simulation codes, their discretisation schemes have not been optimised to use the minimum number of grid points and some heat transfer phenomena were neglected without knowing the effect. Therefore, there was a need to optimise discretisation schemes as well as investigate the effect of including certain heat transfer mechanisms. Modelling methods for several phenomena were developed and implemented in a reactor model in the Flownex systems simulation code, which is used to simulate the PBMR. Subjects of investigation included pebble bed convection discretisation, fuel sphere discretisation, the effect of the radiation heat transfer modelling approach as well as conjugate conduction and radiation across the helium riser channels in the reactor <b>side</b> <b>reflector.</b> After testing the phenomenological models in isolation, the comprehensive reactor model was tested by simulating the SANA experiment and HTR- 10 reactor experiments published by the IAEA. Several sensitivity studies were performed to assess the effect of physical as well as numerical parameters. Two reactor discretisation schemes were also evaluated, namely the control-volume based scheme and the element-based scheme. The control-volume based scheme was found to provide a simpler and more intuitive framework for implementing mathematical models, but not to increase accuracy directly. The most significant finding was that the newly developed second-order accurate convection heat transfer scheme gives the greatest improvement in calculation speed by requiring the least number of pebble bed increments. The other important finding was that the methods currently used in many reactor simulation codes for fuel sphere discretisation and radiation heat transfer approximation are appropriate and give adequate accuracy.

ILBs with cold-side filters that transmit visible light but reflect infrared radiation {{back to the}} filament can surpass state-of-the-art light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in both efficiency and light quality (color rending index; CRI). However, practical challenges such as filter and filament thermal stability, filament evaporation and imperfect geometrical alignment (view factor) between the filament and cold-side filter can limit the maximum achievable efficiency and significantly reduce the effectiveness of cold-side filters. In this thesis, we first present {{a review of existing}} approaches to improve the {{efficiency of}} ILBs such as selective filters and emitters for incandescent lighting. We highlight different challenges in achieving an efficient and long lasting bulb, and discuss previous approaches used to address these challenges in ILBs. We then present the modelling framework as well as the experimental setup and methods use throughout the thesis to study these problems. Second, we show that the effect of imperfect view factor between the filament and filter on the system efficiency can be minimized by combining a cold-side optical filter with a selective emitter. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate energy savings of up to 67 % compared to a bare tungsten emitter at 2000 K, representing a 34 % improvement over a bare tungsten filament with a filter. Our work suggests that this approach can be competitive with LEDs in terms of luminous efficiency as well as CRI using selective emitters and filters already demonstrated in the literature, thus paving the way for next-generation high-efficiency ILBs. Third, we propose adding specular <b>side</b> <b>reflectors</b> between the filament and the cold-side filter to increase the view factor between the filament and filter which could further improve the efficiency of ILBs. We develop an analytical model to calculate the filament heat flux in 2 -D and 3 -D fully-specular enclosures consisting of a filament, a filter and <b>side</b> <b>reflectors</b> as a function of specular view factors and optical properties of the surfaces. Theoretical results show that significant improvements in luminous efficiency can be achieved using <b>side</b> <b>reflectors</b> in an ILB due to increased photon recycling. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate an 18 % reduction in filament power consumption after adding polished copper <b>side</b> <b>reflectors,</b> thus validating the potential of this approach. Finally, we highlight two remaining challenges to achieve a durable and efficient ILB using the current planar geometry with infrared filters and discuss ways to address them. The first challenge - the filter thermal stability, is numerically and experimentally investigated to optimize the filament temperature and system geometry for maximum system efficiency while satisfying the maximum filter temperature. Using a COMSOL model validated by experimental measurements, we find that the maximum achievable luminous efficiency in a best-case scenario (vacuum environment) is about 4. 8 % when the maximum filter temperature is limited to 800 'C, only slightly higher than without infrared filters. We then investigate the second challenge - the high rate of tungsten filament evaporation and the resulting reduction in the ILB lifetime. We observe that the tungsten filament evaporation leads to rapid darkening of the filters primarily because of the low filter to filament area ratio, which limits the lifetime of the system to a few hours only. Lastly, we suggest system-level improvements that could help address these challenges and extend the lifetime of the ILB with cold-side filters. by Arny Leroy. Thesis: S.
