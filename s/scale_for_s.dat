40|$|Projective cover (PC) and {{aboveground}} biomass (AGB) {{are the key}} traits {{with space}} attributes of individual plants. They are crucial {{to the understanding of}} the plant dynamics and plant patterns at population level. Spatial patterns based on individual plant positions (IND) have been extensively investigated in previous studies. However, very few have focused on PC and AGB. We tested the hypothesis that different plant traits represent different spatial patterns and plant-to-plant interactions. Two 40 m × 40 m plots of two typical desert shrub populations (Seriphidium terrae-albae and Artemisia songarica) were surveyed in the Gurbantunggut Desert of north-western China. Each plot was divided into a series of subplots (grids) at different scales (17 scales from 0. 5 m to 20 m) using GIS (geographic information system). The spatial patterns of IND, PC and AGB were determined using aggregation and information dimension analyses together with changes in the scales. The IND and AGB of the two populations exhibited clumped tendencies at all scales (except at the 0. 5 m <b>scale</b> <b>for</b> <b>S.</b> terrae-albae), whereas PC showed uniform distribution patterns at the moderate and small scales, (0. 5 m to 8. 0 m for S. terrae-albae and 0. 5 m to 4. 0 m for A. songarica), indicating that crown-to-crown competition for sunlight was strong at these scales. Although IND had a slightly higher coefficient of variation at the small scales, its information dimension was smaller than those of PC and AGB, indicating that PC and AGB had higher spatial complexities. In conclusion, the three parameters represented different spatial patterns across multiple scales; PC and AGB showed strong spatial complexities and PC was also an accurate indicator of plant-to-plant competition...|$|E

This is an experimental study using swimming skill tests as the data collection method. The populations in this research were the members of Tirta Taruna and Tirta Agung swimming associations who were in the ages of 5 and 7 years. The subjects were 32 children consisting 9 children in the age of 5 and 5 children in the age of 7 from Tirta Agung swimming association, and 7 children in the age of 5 and 11 children in the age of 7 from Tirta Taruna swimming association.

40|$|Good {{knowledge}} of a species' distribution and ecology is important for a successful management. The distribution of species is determined by many factors, among others climatic and topographic factors determining their potential distribution. Other factors such as dispersal mode further affects their actual distribution through the ability to disperse and establish in suitable habitats. In this thesis, the ecology of three species belonging to the nationally and globally rare mixed northern hepatic mat community is assessed in two separate studies, at a regional scale through species distribution modelling (SDM), and at a local scale Scapania nimbosa Taylor through micro-climatic comparison of presence and absence sites in addition to growth measurements. The results from the second study indicate that S. nimbosa grows approximately 4. 68 ± 2. 25 mm during one growth season, although this is probably an under estimate, and the variation between shoots is very large. In the fist study, the SDM for both Anastrophyllum donnianum (Hook.) Steph., Scapania ornithopodioides (With.) Waddell and S. nimbosa predicted highly suitable areas outside the known geographical range at the south-western Norwegian coast, although the model for S. nimbosa could not be interpreted with confidence. It {{was not possible to}} find any difference in micro-climate between presence and absence sites for S. nimbosa. These results indicate that all three species are limited by dispersal rather than habitat in Norway, with suitable absence sites both at a regional scale for all three species, and also at a local <b>scale</b> <b>for</b> <b>S.</b> nimbosa. Anastrophyllum donnianum seems to be limited from reaching highly suitable areas in northern Norway due to a barrier of unsuitable climate mainly due to insufficient summer rain. This area may become suitable if climate change leads to an increase in summer precipitation along the Norwegian coast. Scapania ornithopodioides is absent from northern Norway despite the presence of highly suitable habitats continuously scattered throughout large parts of the western coast. The results suggest that both A. donnianum and S. ornithopodioides prefer high rain frequency and high amount of summer rain, and medium summer temperatures at approximately 10 ͦ C. This is consistent with the current understanding of the ecology for these two species. Areas that stand out as interesting for the search of potentially undiscovered populations include northern Norway, the Fosen peninsula and the Lofoten Islands. Highly suitable areas may also be appropriate for tranlocation of turfs or plant fragments, with the aim at increasing the abundance and geographical range of threatened species. Other studies indicate that in situ regeneration from plant fragments of several mixed northern hepatic mat species is likely to be successful. This is especially relevant for the rare species S. nimbosa, which is vulnerable due to a presumably small geographical range in Norway which may be contracted in the face of climate change, and due to limited dispersal abilities...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} {{commercial}} {{banks in the}} United States has fallen by more than 50 percent since 1984. This consolidation of the U.

This paper presents new estimates of ray-scale and expansion-path <b>scale</b> economies <b>for</b> U. <b>S.</b> banks based on nonparametric local-linear estimation of a model of bank costs.

Seven scales out nine contained ordered response categories such as “ 1 = not at all”, “ 2 = to some extent”, “ 3 = a great deal”. The two remaining scales (the 3 rd and the 6 th) had a binary set of options as response categories: “agree” or “disagree”. The questionnaire containing the nine scales was administered to four establishments of a selected firm, with 103 respondents. The evaluation of each score for each section, classified in three categories (Low, Median, and Optimal), followed different criteria: location {{with respect to the}} corresponding thresholds, and the concentration and dispersion of scores in the optimal category. The evaluation of the performance of each scale was carried out considering: its internal consistency through the Cronbach’s alpha, the distribution of the scores in response categories with respect to the direction of the scale, semantic analysis of items to ascertain coherence with the polarity of the scale. The data analysis revealed some critical items in various sections and suggested further studies and applications to ascertain their foundation, stability, and robustness.

This paper explicitly models this observed heterogeneity using a generalized model of endogenous ordered switching. Our approach captures the endogenous choice that credit unions make when adding new products to their financial services mix. Failure to do so is likely to yield biased and inconsistent estimates. The model that we develop also allows for the dependence between unobserved effects and regressors in both the selection and outcome equations and can accommodate the presence of predetermined covariates in the model. We use this model to estimate returns to <b>scale</b> <b>for</b> U. <b>S.</b> retail credit unions from 1996 to 2011.

We show that the existing studies did not recognize heterogeneity amongst credit unions’ technologies as captured by (endogenously selected) differing output mixes.

The estimates are also likely to be biased due to unobserved credit union specific effects that the literature broadly ignores.

Since cones respond to both the wavelength and intensity of light, the cone's sensitivity to wavelength is measured in terms of its relative rate of response if the intensity of a stimulus is held fixed, while the wavelength is varied. From this, in turn, is inferred the absorbance. The graph normalizes the degree of absorbance on a hundred-point <b>scale.</b> <b>For</b> example, the <b>S</b> cone's relative response peaks around 420 nm (nanometers, a measure of wavelength). This tells us that an S cone is more likely to absorb a photon at 420 nm than at any other wavelength. If light of a different wavelength to which it is less sensitive, say 480 nm, is increased in brightness appropriately, however, it will produce exactly the same response in the S cone. So, the colors of the curves are misleading. Cones cannot detect color by themselves; rather, color vision requires comparison of the signal across different cone types.|$|R

If a routine oral prophylaxis is followed, its effect on the restorative materials and the plaque accumulation can be studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 disc shaped wax patterns were invested and casted for cast titanium (Group A) and the remaining 15 disk shaped for nickel-chromium (Group B). The obtained castings were finished and polished. All the specimens were subjected to hand and ultrasonic <b>scaling</b> <b>for</b> 15 <b>s.</b> Profilometer and scanning electron microscopic was used to analyze and evaluate the surface roughness. Specimens of each group were embedded on the anterior lingual aspects of the removable lower retention plates. 5 volunteers were asked to wear it in the mouth for 24 h for 7 days. After 7 days, the specimens were stained with plaque disclosing solutions and the photomicrographs were taken by the optical stereomicroscope and the plaque accumulations were assessed in percentage. Results: The difference in average surface roughness (μm) of the polished test specimens was maximum <b>for</b> ultrasonic <b>scaling</b> than hand <b>scaling</b> and maximum <b>for</b> Group A than Group B. Plaque accumulation in percentage on the treated specimens was found to be nonsignificant but, mean plaque accumulation was maximum on ultrasonic scaling surface than hand <b>scaling</b> and maximum <b>for</b> Group A than Group B. Surface roughness was found to be statistically significant after hand scaling (F = 9. 377, P = 0. 000) and ultrasonic scaling (F = 5. 373, P = 0. 0000) by Student t-test. Conclusion: The Surface roughness and plaque accumulation on the specimens were more for Group A than Group B and maximum produced by ultrasonic scaling than hand scaling...|$|R

40|$|We have {{observed}} two blank fields of approximately 30 x 23 arcmin(2) using the William Herschel Telescope. The fields {{have been studied}} {{as part of the}} Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (CNOC 2), and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 1125 galaxies in the two fields. We measured the lensing signal caused by large-scale structure, and found that the result is consistent with current, more accurate measurements. We study the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of three overlapping samples of lenses (one with and two without redshift information), and detect a significant signal in all cases. The estimates for the velocity dispersion of an L*(B) (z= 0) = 5. 6 x 10 (9) h(- 2) L-Bcircle dot galaxy agree well for the various samples. The best-fitting singular isothermal sphere model to the ensemble-averaged tangential distortion around the galaxies with redshifts yields a velocity dispersion of sigma(*) = 130 (- 17) (+ 15) km s(- 1), or a circular velocity of V*(c) = 184 (- 25) (+ 22) km s(- 1) for an L*(B) galaxy, in good agreement with other studies. We use a maximum-likelihood analysis, where a parametrized mass model is compared with the data, to study the extent of galaxy dark matter haloes. Making use of all available data, we find sigma(*) = 111 +/- 12 km s(- 1) (68. 3 per cent confidence, marginalized over the truncation parameter <b>s)</b> <b>for</b> a truncated isothermal sphere model in which all galaxies have the same mass-to-light ratio. The value of the truncation parameter s is not constrained that well, and we find s(*) = 260 (- 73) (+ 124) h(- 1) kpc (68. 3 per cent confidence, marginalized over sigma(*)), with a 99. 7 per cent confidence lower limit of 80 h(- 1) kpc. Interestingly, our results provide a 95 per cent confidence upper limit of 556 h(- 1) kpc. The galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis allows us to estimate the average mass-to-light ratio of the field, which can be used to estimate Omega (m).
