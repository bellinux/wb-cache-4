50|$|A <b>skip</b> <b>{{distance}}</b> is {{the distance}} a radio wave travels, usually including a hop in the ionosphere. A <b>skip</b> <b>distance</b> is a distance on the Earth's surface {{between the two}} points where radio waves from a transmitter, refracted downwards by different layers of the ionosphere, fall. It also represents how far a radio wave has travelled per hop on the Earth's surface, for radio waves such as the short wave (SW) radio signals that employ continuous reflections for transmission.|$|E
50|$|Radio {{waves from}} a {{particular}} transmitting antenna do not all get refracted by a particular layer of the ionosphere; some are absorbed, some refracted while a portion escapes to the next layer. At this higher layer, {{there is a possibility}} of this radio wave being bent downwards to earth again. This bending happens because each layer of the ionosphere has a refractive index that varies from that of the others. Because of the differing heights of refraction, or apparent reflection, the radio waves hit the earth surface at different points hence generating the <b>skip</b> <b>distance.</b> <b>Skip</b> <b>distance</b> is greatest during the night when the ionosphere is the highest.|$|E

This includes greater control of the stability of the far-field (FF) lobe pattern with operating frequency, and a considerably extended frequency range (3 : 1 ratio) over which Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation in the high frequency (HF) bands can be exploited. Furthermore, the FF lobe patterns at frequencies > 2 × the fundamental design frequency are such that advantage can be taken of conventional non-NVIS horizontal propagation at those frequencies using the same aerial. At the fundamental frequency, compactness of design and robustness of its NVIS FF pattern to orientation make the novel balanced aerial design a convenient replacement for a full-length low dipole in cluttered environments.

40|$|Meridional {{circulation}} is {{a crucial}} component of the Sun's internal dynamics, but its inference in the deep interior is complicated by a systematic center-to-limb effect in helioseismic measurement techniques. Previously, an empirical method, removing travel-time shifts measured for east-west traveling waves in the equatorial area from those measured for north-south traveling waves in the central meridian area, was used, but its validity and accuracy need to be assessed. Here we develop a new method to separate the center-to-limb effect, δτ_CtoL, and meridional-flow-induced travel-time shifts, δτ_MF, in a more robust way. Using 7 -yr observations of the SDO/HMI, we exhaustively measure travel-time shifts between two surface locations along the solar disk's radial direction for all azimuthal angles and all <b>skip</b> <b>distances.</b> The measured travel-time shifts are a linear combination of δτ_CtoL and δτ_MF, which can be disentangled through solving the linear equation set. The δτ_CtoL is found isotropic relative to the azimuthal angle, and the δτ_MF are then inverted for the meridional circulation. Our inversion results show a three-layer flow structure, with equatorward flow found between about 0. 82 and 0. 91 R_sun for low latitude areas and between about 0. 85 and 0. 91 R_sun for higher latitude areas. Poleward flows are found below and above the equatorward flow zones, indicating a double-cell circulation in each hemisphere. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Virus {{scanning}} involves computationally intensive {{string matching}} against {{a large number}} of signatures of different characteristics. Matching a variety of signatures challenges the selection of matching algorithms, as each approach has better performance than others for different signature characteristics.

An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average <b>skip</b> <b>distance,</b> while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV.

Isolating the effects of the magnetic field from thermal or soundspeed perturbations has proved to be quite complex and has yet to yield reliable results when extracting travel times from the cross-correlation function. One possible way to decouple these effects is by using a 3 D sunspot model based on observed surface magnetic-field profiles, with a surrounding stratified, quiet-Sun atmosphere to model the magneto-acoustic ray propagation, and analyze the resulting ray travel-time perturbations that will directly account for wavespeed variations produced by the magnetic field.

30|$|In our analysis, we {{have used}} the GB echoes {{identified}} using the standard technique (Blanchard et al. 2009). We have excluded the echoes originating behind the radar by interferometer data analysis (Milan et al. 1997). The technique for identification of such echoes is similar to those described in Bland et al. (2014). For reliable identification of one-hop GB echoes, we have considered a number of criteria for the slant range, effective reflection height, and power for a certain beam, local time, and date. More specifically, we have developed a GB model (GBM) for each radar data (Oinats et al. 2016). GBM is based on HF propagation simulation {{in the framework of}} the waveguide approach (Oinats et al. 2012) and IRI- 2012 ionosphere (Bilitza et al. 2014). It includes a set of the following HF GB characteristics: the slant range corresponding to the <b>skip</b> <b>distance,</b> elevation angle, true height of reflection, slant range, and ground distance to the ionospheric reflection region. All the characteristics have been calculated for each radar beam for the entire period under consideration. Using the model, we have determined possible slant ranges and effective heights for each HF channel. This makes it possible to separate the regular GB reflected by E and F 2 ionospheric layers from other echoes. Since all the radar range gates satisfying the mask are determined at a certain local time, we searched for the range gate, that received the maximum power, and recorded the corresponding slant range and elevation angle values.|$|E
40|$|Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) {{communication}} {{uses the}} ionosphere as a reflector {{to cover a}} continuous area with a radius of at least 150 km around the transmitter, on frequencies typically between 3 and 10 MHz. In developing countries, in areas lacking any other telecommunication infrastructure, it is used {{on a daily basis}} for voice and data communication. It may also be used in ad-hoc emergency (disaster) communication in other regions. This paper proposes optimum heights above ground for horizontal dipole antennas for NVIS, based on simulations and empirical data. First, the relationship between elevation angle and <b>skip</b> <b>distance</b> is obtained using ionospheric ray tracing. The high elevation angles found by simulation are confirmed by elevation angle measurements using a professional radio direction finder. The measurements also show the dominance of NVIS over ground wave propagation starting at a short distance.

A distinction is made between optimum transmit signal strength and optimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These optima are verified experimentally, demonstrating a novel evaluation method {{that can be used in}} the presence of the fading typical for ionospheric propagation. For farmland soil (20 mS/m, "r 17) the optimum height above ground for the transmit antenna is 0. 180. 22. If the antenna is lowered to 0. 02 a transmit signal loss of 12 dB occurs.
