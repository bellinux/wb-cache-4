5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] plug tap, whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the <b>spiral</b> <b>flute</b> tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. <b>Spiral</b> <b>flute</b> taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|E
5000|$|A screw {{extractor}} {{is a tool}} for removing broken or seized screws. There are two types: one has a <b>spiral</b> <b>flute</b> structure, commonly called an easy out after the trademarked name EZ-Out; [...] the other has a straight flute structure. Screw (and bolt) extractors are intentionally made of hard, brittle steel, and, if too much torque is applied, can break off inside the screw {{that is trying to}} be removed. Since the extractor is an extremely hard material, and a typical home shop drill bit {{will not be able to}} drill into it, a larger element of difficulty is added to the original screw extraction project. One way to avoid this added difficulty is to drill the hole completely through the screw or bolt (if there is access to the back). That way if it breaks a punch can be used to drive the easy out of the screw or bolt.|$|E

50|$|Palazzo Bevilacqua (under {{construction}} in 1529), {{the most famous}} of the three and often cited as an exemplar of Mannerism in architecture, is the richest façade of its generation, rivalling Giulio Romano's Palazzo Te. Its complex superimposed layers, its alternating superimposed rhythms of large and small bays and straight and <b>spiralling</b> <b>fluting,</b> the rich carved decor in its keystones and in the spandrels of the piano nobile arches, climax in the rich sculpture of its corbelled cornice.|$|R
50|$|A {{machine reamer}} {{only has a}} very slight lead in. Because the reamer and work piece are pre-aligned by the machine there is no risk of it {{wandering}} off course. In addition the constant cutting force {{that can be applied}} by the machine ensures that it starts cutting immediately. <b>Spiral</b> <b>flutes</b> have the advantage of clearing the swarf automatically but are also available with straight flutes as the amount of swarf generated during a reaming operation should be very small.|$|R
50|$|The Cardo Maximus of Apamea, Syria {{ran through}} {{the centre of the}} city {{directly}} from North to South, linked the principal gates of the city, and was originally surrounded by 1200 columns with unique <b>spiral</b> <b>fluting,</b> each subsequent column spiralling in the opposite direction. The thoroughfare was about 1.85 kilometres long and 37 metres wide, as it was used for wheeled transport. The great colonnade was erected in the 2nd century and it was still standing until the 12th. The earthquakes of 1157 and 1170 demolished the colonnade. The cardo was lined on both sides with civic and religious buildings.|$|R
50|$|Since {{this style}} of dagger was usually made en suite with a cup-hilted rapier, the {{decoration}} of the knuckleguard tended to reflect that of the cup of the rapier. The edges of the guard are usually turned over toward the outside, possibly to trap {{the point of the}} opponent's blade and prevent it from slipping into the defender's hand. The quillons are normally cylindrical with knobbed tips, and in many instances are decorated with <b>spiral</b> <b>fluting.</b> The pommel is normally decorated to match the quillons and made to resemble the pommel of its matching rapier, while the grip is usually made of wood and wrapped with twisted and braided wire.|$|R
50|$|The McMillan TAC-50 is a {{manually}} operated, rotary bolt-action rifle. The large bolt has dual front locking lugs, and {{its body}} has <b>spiral</b> <b>flutes</b> to reduce weight. The heavy match-grade barrel, made by Lilja barrels, is also fluted to dissipate heat quickly and reduce overall weight and fitted with an effective muzzle brake to reduce recoil. The rifle {{is fed from}} detachable box magazines, holding 5 rounds each. The stock is made from fiberglass by McMillan Stocks, and {{is designed to be}} used from a bipod only. The buttstock is adjustable for length of pull with rubber spacers, and can be removed for compact storage. The rifle has no open sights; it can be used with a variety of telescopic or night sights.|$|R
6000|$|... [449] {380} [The {{existing}} temple, {{now used}} as a chapel (St. Salvatore), can hardly be Pliny's templum priscum. Hobhouse, in his Historical Illustrations, pp. 37-41, defends the antiquity of the [...] "façade, which consists of a pediment supported by four columns and two Corinthian piers, two of the columns with <b>spiral</b> <b>fluting,</b> the others covered with fish-scaled carvings" [...] (Handbook for Central Italy, p. 289); but {{in the opinion of}} modern archæologists the whole of the structure belongs to the fourth or fifth century of the Christian era. It is, of course, possible, indeed probable, that ancient materials were used when the building was reconstructed. Pliny says the [...] "numerous chapels" [...] dedicated to other deities were scattered round the shrine of Clitumnus.] ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the <b>spiral</b> <b>flutes</b> to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern long {{guns are}} either rifles or shotguns. Both are the successors of the musket, {{diverging}} from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so {{named for the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>fluting</b> (rifling) machined into the inner surface of its barrel, which imparts a self-stabilizing spin to the single bullets it fires. Shotguns are predominantly smoothbore firearms designed to fire a number of shot; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2 mm #9 birdshot and 8.4 mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single slugs, or specialty (often [...] "less lethal") rounds such as bean bags, tear gas or breaching rounds. Rifles have a very small impact area but a long range and high accuracy. Shotguns have a large impact area with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area can compensate for reduced accuracy, since shot spreads during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for flying game.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{forestry}} requires healthy, well-formed {{trees that}} {{are resistant to}} diseases and parasites. The best wood has a straight, circular stem without a <b>spiral</b> grain or <b>fluting,</b> and small, evenly spaced branches. The chances of achieving these are maximised by planting good-quality seed {{in the best possible}} growing environment.|$|R
50|$|The {{other five}} temples built by Vagheli Mahakunvar form, {{along with the}} more lately built temple of Kalyanray, a row of six domes {{supported}} by fourteen pillars, and forty-eight pilasters, with carving on the bases, shafts, and capitals. The brackets are scrolled volutes and the side pillars of one dome serve to support the lintel of the next, and the corresponding pillars of the next act similarly for the third dome. The temples at the two ends have screen walls under their domes with doors, but the rest have a common verandah with entrances in the fronts the space on {{the two sides of}} each entrance being closed with a screen of wooden lattice. Each of the temples has an inscription. Lakshmiji's temple is without any special feature. Dwarkanath's or Ranchhodji's temple has a small shrine opposite to it with a large image of Garuda, holding a weapon whose point impales a cobra. The third shrine, to Govardhannath, is simple. The fourth, to Adinarayan, has a black stone pavement in the gallery. Opposite it is a small lately built shrine of Gopalji. The last, to Lakshminarayan, has silver-plated doors and an idol throne and canopy of silver. In a line with these five temples is the temple of Kalyanray built in 1828 (Samvat 1885) by Rao Deshalji II. The stone and wood frames of the entrance are richly carved, and the doors are plated with silver in which flowers, fruit, leaves, and creepers are carved with much skill. The canopy of the god stands on a pedestal, and is supported on four silver pillars with fine <b>spiral</b> <b>flutes</b> and richly carved friezes, bases, and shafts. The statue is of polished black marble.|$|R

50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any <b>spiral</b> in the <b>flutes</b> restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|R
40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of thread mills, instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of thread mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of thread mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of thread mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of thread mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of thread mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of thread mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of thread mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the <b>spiral</b> chip <b>flutes</b> and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions of thread mills. </p...|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Geyre CemeteryLocal Information: Old Geyre Cemetery in use {{at least}} up to 2003 Latitude: 37. 42. 44. 7 Longitude: 28. 43. 55. 5 Elevation: 543 mDimensions: overall {{exterior}} dimensions: approx. 16. 0 m (N-S) by 22. 5 m (E-W) ** Narthex approx. W: 3. 5 m ** Aisle W: 3. 4 m ** Nave W: 6. 4 m ** Apse diam: approx. 6. 0 mDescription: Situated along the ancient road {{leading from the}} Northeast Gate out toward the City Quarries, about 500 m northeast of the Northeast Gate, and about 150 m north of a concentration of Late Roman tombs; immediately south of the Karacasu-Tavas highway; within the modern cemetery of old Geyre. Numerous columns and colonettes {{as well as other}} architectural blocks are scattered throughout the area, most reused as gravestones. The Northeast Church appears to have a three-aisled basilica plan with a narthex to the west and a triple-apsed sanctuary to the east. ** Very little of the mortared rubble walls are visible above present ground level; where measurable, they are a uniform thickness of 0. 70 m. A pair of in situ double-engaged column bases used as doorjambs project 0. 20 m and 0. 30 m above the present ground level; this doorway is the main entrance to the narthex of the church. The southwest corner of the west wall is partially visible, providing the total width of the narthex, if reconstructed symmetrically along its east–west axis. A possible opening in the south wall may indicate a side entrance to the narthex. A second doorway in the eastern wall of the narthex, aligned with the west doorway, marks the entrance from narthex to the nave. The narthex wall is visible on both sides and better preserved toward the south. On this side, a second doorway interrupts the wall; a third doorway restored to the north would provide a triple entrance to the nave and side aisles from the narthex. An engaged pier between the central and the southern doorways marks the west end of the south colonnade. Aligned with that pier, the bases of two of the columns of the south colonnade remain in situ. They are bases for double engaged columns and are spaced 1. 30 m apart. The length of the nave thus allows for a five-column colonnade between the central nave and each of the side aisles. Since the interaxial of these colonnades is nearly 2. 0 m, the columns were likely spanned by masonry arches. Not coincidentally, many of the headstones used in the modern cemetery around the church are repurposed double-engaged half-columns, carved out of the mottled gray marble. The columns reused as headstones are usually erected upside down and are either fragmentary or partly buried, or both, so their original heights are unknown. ** The general plan of the east end of the building is legible in the crescent-shaped mound that covers it. The mound is concave on its west side, following the contour of the central apse. The southeast corner of the church is visible, as {{is the beginning of the}} curve of the southern apse, indicating that the basilica had a tripartite sanctuary and projecting apses. The rubble mound at the east end, perhaps the collapsed semidome over the central apse, extends about 4 m farther east beyond the southeast corner of the building. ** The plan of the Northeast Church is of a standard basilica type: the nave and aisles are divided by rows of columns, and each terminates in semicircular apses to the east. This plan finds numerous parallels dated to the fifth or sixth centuries A. D. Four octagonal floor tiles (0. 26 x 0. 26 m) were found scattered around a robber's pit near the east end of the nave. Octagonal floor tiles appear throughout the city in late Roman structures. Finds: Large double engaged columns - W: 0. 66 m; D: 0. 35 m; pres.
