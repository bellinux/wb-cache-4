50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, a process was {{developed}} which literally coats each {{grain of salt}} and keeps it from sticking together. Due to these changes in the processing of salt for consumer use, the open salt cellar and its accompanying <b>salt</b> <b>spoon</b> have become largely obsolete, having {{been replaced by the}} everyday salt shakers. They are, however, a highly collectable item and are still used today as a bit of nostalgia on many dining tables.|$|E
5000|$|Large, ornate master salts {{continued}} to be made through the Renaissance and Baroque periods, becoming more ceremonial. In England the ornamental master salt {{came to be called}} a standing salt, because it was not passed but remained in place. By 1588, reference is documented in England to the [...] "trencher salt"; by the early 18th century, these had mostly supplanted large salts. [...] Tiny <b>salt</b> <b>spoons</b> appear in the 17th century, and in increasing numbers as the use of trencher salts increased.|$|R

500|$|The Exeter Salt, a [...] tall salt cellar in {{the form}} of a castle, was {{presented}} to CharlesII after the Restoration by the city of Exeter. It was made in 1630 by a German goldsmith and is set with around 70 gemstones. Each of its four main compartments held about [...] of salt, and smaller compartments held pepper and spices. Eleven smaller salts named after StGeorge were originally made for a StGeorge's Day banquet of the Knights of the Garter and CharlesII in the 17thcentury. Another, the Queen Elizabeth Salt, was made in 1572 during the reign of ElizabethI for a member of the aristocracy; it was acquired by the Crown at the time of CharlesII.

5000|$|A <b>salt</b> <b>spoon</b> is a {{miniature}} utensil used {{with an open}} salt cellar for individual service. It is an historical and nostalgic item from a time before table salt was free-flowing, as it is today. The spoon itself ranges from 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) long and has a circular bowl measuring approximately 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.25 to 2 cm). They {{can be found in}} a wide range of materials including glass, Sterling silver, plastic, wood, ivory, bone and shell.|$|E

5000|$|Salt absorbs {{moisture}} from its surroundings, {{and had a}} tendency to clump together into one large lump. The head of the household usually presided over the distribution of salt at the dining table. This lump of salt was placed into a small dish, called by various names - open salt, salt cellar, Table salt. Today we also refer to these as Master salts. It was then broken up with a knife handle or other utensil and placed into smaller, individual salt cellars, often matching the larger one in design. Since it was such a precious seasoning, only small portions were given to each person at the table. The food was either dipped into the small individual salt cellars or was scooped out with the small <b>salt</b> <b>spoons</b> and sprinkled over the food.|$|R
50|$|The Exeter Salt, a 45 cm tall salt cellar in {{the form}} of a castle, was {{presented}} to Charles II after the Restoration by the city of Exeter. It was made in 1630 by a German goldsmith and is set with around 70 gemstones. Each of its four main compartments held about 29 g of salt, and smaller compartments held pepper and spices. Eleven smaller salts named after St George were originally made for a St George's Day banquet of the Knights of the Garter and Charles II in the 17th century.

40|$|The World Health Organization {{promotes}} salt reduction as a best-buy {{strategy to}} reduce chronic diseases, and member states {{have agreed to}} a 30 % reduction target in mean population salt intake by 2025. This systematic literature review {{identified a number of}} innovative population-level strategies, including promotion of a substitute for table salt, provision of a <b>salt</b> <b>spoon</b> to lower the amount used in home cooking and social marketing and consumer awareness campaigns on salt and health. In high-income nations, engagement with the food industry to encourage reformulation of processed foods-whether through voluntary or mandatory approaches-is key to salt reduction. Legislation of salt content in foods, although not widely adopted, can create concrete incentives and disincentives to meet targets and does not rely on individuals to change their behaviour. The important role of advocacy and lobbying to change the food supply is undisputed...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} they touched the deer?" [...] All rushed back to where the big deer had been left, hung up in a cool spot in the forest. Evidently the enemy had not seen this game, and it was untouched. Looking around near the water front they found a small box of <b>salt,</b> a <b>spoon,</b> and some {{scattered}} cartridges for the rifle. Evidently the marauders had left in haste and dropped the things on the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, when my orderly {{appeared}} before me, repeating: 'Won't your Honour {{be pleased to}} eat?... Won't your Honour be pleased to eat?...' I managed to keep my hold of it--I mean that gaping consciousness. He was offering me a sooty pot containing some grain boiled in water with a pinch of <b>salt.</b> A wooden <b>spoon</b> was stuck in it.|$|R
6000|$|His Royal Highness then {{proceeded}} to luncheon, which is described by a most amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account of it that I cannot forbear to copy. You may believe what he says, or not, just as you choose: [...] "So interested was his Royal Highness in the proceedings that {{he stayed in the}} ring {{three and a half hours}} witnessing these trotting matches. He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden shanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but whether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell. After much trouble he forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of ravenous animals. And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices of beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of lager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into thin shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar. There were neither <b>salt</b> <b>spoons</b> nor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in their stead; and, by the aid of nature's forks, the slices of beef and mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat. While your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle came in, and he sat looking too. He was evidently trying to look democratic, but could not manage it. By his side stood a man urging him to try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose. Henceforth, let the New York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and bad sherry rest in peace." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mountains}} {{areas have}} more corn-based dishes. Xalapa {{is known for}} its street foods of this type, such as picaditas and a related dish called garnadchas. Both are thick, bean-stuffed corn cakes. One notable dish of the mountain areas is zacahuil, which is generally described as a giant tamale often several feet long, able to feed between fifty and 150 people. Like tamales in Mexico, it consists of corn, flavorings and meat, which are wrapped then cooked. For sacahuil, the wrapping is either leaves from a plant called papatla or those from the banana tree, laid out. Roughly ground corn meal mixed with lard and chili peppers, seasonings and <b>salt</b> is <b>spooned</b> over the leaf wrapping. Pieces of meat, usually pork, are laid on top of this. The leaves are folded over the filling and tied in place then the zacahuil is placed in an oven to cook for ten to twelve hours. However, unlike most tamales, the consistency of the filling after cooking is not solid, but rather stew like. The dish is generally served for weddings, religious festivals and other special events. Prepared portions are often sold in traditional markets, restaurants and by street vendors.|$|R

Another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred: the brave eagle would have fallen in the ferret's trap! She would have moved now and screamed, but she dared not; for whilst she heard the {{soldiers}} approaching, she was looking at Percy and watching his every movement. He was standing by the table whereon the remnants of the supper, plates, glasses, <b>spoons,</b> <b>salt</b> and pepper-pots were scattered pell-mell. His back was turned to Chauvelin and he was still prattling along in his own affected and inane way, but from his pocket he had taken his snuff-box, and quickly and suddenly he emptied the contents of the pepper-pot into it.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout his career, Milan used a {{wide range}} of woods {{including}} domestic hardwoods such as maple, walnut, and black cherry, as well as exotic imported species such as zebrawood, padouk, cocobolo, bubinga, lapacho, and rosewood. [...] Buckridge items made from imported woods commanded higher prices. [...] He periodically capitalized on grain patterns, intensive figure, and contrasting heartwood and sapwood colors as design elements in his works. [...] Silver components occasionally were added to functional wooden works, and he made a few cheese boards with flat ceramic inserts as cutting surfaces. [...] He was frugal with wood and used scraps to make saleable functional and art objects. Cutouts from large bowl forms, for example, were used to make fish, birds, and abstract sculptures, and the remaining pieces were used to make small <b>salt</b> bowls and <b>spoons.</b>|$|R
