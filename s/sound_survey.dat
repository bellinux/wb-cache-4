5000|$|Although he wasn't still {{a member}} of the {{expedition}} during the Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>survey,</b> his name, {{as well as that of}} Samuel Stretch, were given to islands probably because they impressed Lt. Wilkes when they led a successful mission to get supplies to stranded shipmates earlier in the voyage while Wilkes had temporary command of Hartstein's ship, the Porpoise. Some of the confusion with spellings were caused by the man himself. Almost every time his name was published before 1855, the 'Hartstein' spelling was used, including the account he wrote himself of the Arctic expedition he led in 1855. Most maps from the 1840s to the 1890s spelled the island 'Hartstein'. In the 1850s, he started using the 'Hartstene' spelling. His biography was listed in a book published in 1994 called The Concise Dictionary of American Jewish Biography. The authors admit they included some of the 24,000 people in the book just because they had Jewish-sounding names. Whether he was Jewish or not, or if he and his wife just got tired of people mispronouncing the 2nd syllable of their name with a long [...] "i" [...] sound, they definitely made an effort to use the spelling 'Hartstene' from then on. And after he gained a little fame in the 1850s with his Arctic expedition, and then sailing HMS Resolute to the United Kingdom and presenting it personally to Queen Victoria in 1856, he used it almost exclusively. There's a photo of him autographed 'H.J. Hartstene'. But there is a Civil War photo of him labeled [...] "Capt. Hartstein". He, his wife, and daughter were each listed as Hartstein on the passenger list of the steamer Fulton, the ship that took them to Le Havre, France in 1867, the year before he died. This was probably because their legal names were required. But his obituary in 1868, his daughter's in 1880, and his wife's in 1903, all used Hartstene. Since map makers knew the island was named after him, they followed suit. The U.S. General Land Office's official map changed from Hartstein to Hartstene between 1883 and 1887. Many maps from the 1860s and throughout the 20th century used Hartstene. The Hartstine spelling appeared on a few maps in the 1890s, followed by Harstine in the early 1900s. The post office on the north side of the island that operated from 1892-1926 was probably always called 'Harstine Island', but who first used that spelling is unknown. The Captain's family lived in Newark, NJ most of his life, and his ships often sailed out of New York Harbor. The New York Times has digitized all of their newspaper articles since 1851. There are photos of the actual newsprint, and they are well indexed. In searching for every spelling of Harstine, this is how many instances of each spelling that come up pertaining to Henry or his family:Hartstein-39, Hartstene-7, Harstein-2, Harstene-1, Harstien-1, Hartstine-1, Harstine-0 Five of the instances of Hartstene come after his death.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at characterizing the {{subsurface}} geological and tectonic structure in Deir El-Adas area, by using Vertical Electrical <b>Sounding</b> <b>survey</b> (VES) and hydrogeological investigations, {{in order to determine}} the causes of the failure for the majority of the wells drilled in the area. The survey data was treated in three different approaches including direct VES inversion, pseudo- 2 D method and horizontal profiling, in order to maximize the reliability of the data interpretation. The results revealed the presence of a local faulted anticline structure at the top of the Paleogene formation, underneath the basaltic outcrops where Deir El-Adas village is situated. The appearance of this subsurface anticline structure has complicated the local hydrogeological situation, and most likely led to limitation of the groundwater recharge in the area. Moreover, the performed piezometric and discharge maps indicated the presence of a notable groundwater watershed, in addition to feeble water productivity of the wells drilled adjacent to Deir El-Adas, mostly related to the subsurface geological and tectonic settings in the area...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{explore the}} validity, reliability, and {{applicability}} {{of using a}} short, psychometrically <b>sound</b> <b>survey</b> instrument to measure population attitudes toward tobacco control policies.  DESIGN—Surveys.  SUBJECTS AND SETTING—Student respondents attending university in Australia (n = 403), Hong Kong (n = 336), the Netherlands (n = 351), South Africa (n = 291), the United Kingdom (n = 164) and the United States (n = 241); total n =  1786.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE—The Smoking Policy Inventory (SPI), a 35 -item scale. SPI scores were adjusted for age, income, gender, and smoking status. Estimates of internal consistency and tests of factorial invariance were conducted in each sample.  RESULTS—Across all six countries, the SPI {{was found to be}} highly reliable and to have a consistent factor structure, indicating that the SPI scale represents a higher order construct that assesses general attitudes about tobacco control policy with five dimensions. In general, the degree of endorsement of anti-tobacco policies as measured by the SPI reflected the extent and strength of tobacco control legislation in those countries. Dutch students were the least likely, and Australian and Hong Kong students the most likely, to support tobacco control policies.  CONCLUSIONS—It is possible to develop appropriate and meaningful measurement tools for assessing support of tobacco control policies. Strong evidence was found for internal reliability and structural invariance of the SPI. The SPI may be a useful mechanism for monitoring ongoing policy initiatives, making cross-cultural comparisons, and evaluating population receptiveness to proposed policy approaches.    Keywords: policies; tobacco control; Smoking Policy Inventor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The eastern Juan de Fuca Strait {{is subject}} to long-term, north–south-oriented shortening. The {{observed}} defor-mation is interpreted to result from the northward motion of the Oregon block, which is being driven north by oblique subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca plate. Seismic data, acquired during the Seismic Hazards Investigation in Puget <b>Sound</b> <b>survey</b> are used, with coincident first-arrival tomographic velocities, to interpret structural variation along the Devil’s Mountain fault zone in the eastern Juan de Fuca Strait. The Primary fault of the Devil’s Mountain fault zone developed at the northern boundary of the Everett basin, during north–south-oriented Tertiary compression. Interpretation of seismic reflection data suggests that, based on their similar geometry including the large magnitude of pre-Tertiary basement offset, the Primary fault of the Devil’s Mountain fault west of 122. 95 °W and the Utsalady Point fault represent the main fault of the Tertiary Devil’s Mountain fault zone. The Tertiary Primary fault west of 122. 95 °W was probably kinematically linked to faults to the east (Utsalady Point, Devil’s Mountain, and another to the south), by an oblique north–northeast-trending transfer zone or ramp. Left-lateral transpression controlled the Quaternary evolution of the Devil’s Mountain fault zone. Quaternary Primary fault offsets are smaller {{to the east of}} 122. 95 °W, suggesting that stress here was in part accommodated by the prevalent oblique compressional structures to the north. Holocene defor-mation has focussed on the Devil’s Mountain, Utsalady Point, and Strawberry Point faults to the east of 122. 8 ° but has not affected the Utsalady Point fault to the west of 122. 8 °W...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Survey {{estimates}} of mortality and malnutrition {{are commonly used}} to guide humanitarian decision-making. Currently, different methods of conducting field surveys {{are the subject of}} debate among epidemiologists. Beyond the technical arguments, decision makers may find it difficult to conceptualize what the estimates actually mean. For instance, what makes this particular situation an emergency? And how should the operational response be adapted accordingly. This brings into question not only the quality of the survey methodology, but also the difficulties epidemiologists face in interpreting results and selecting the most important information to guide operations. As a case study, we reviewed mortality and nutritional surveys conducted in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) published from January 2006 to January 2009. We performed a PubMed/Medline search for published articles and scanned publicly available humanitarian databases and clearinghouses for grey literature. To evaluate the surveys, we developed minimum reporting criteria based on available guidelines and selected peer-review articles. We identified 38 reports through our search strategy; three surveys met our inclusion criteria. The surveys varied in methodological quality. Reporting against minimum criteria was generally good, but presentation of ethical procedures, raw data and survey limitations were missed in all surveys. All surveys also failed to consider contextual factors important for data interpretation. From this review, we conclude that mechanisms to ensure <b>sound</b> <b>survey</b> design and conduct must be implemented by operational organisations to improve data quality and reporting. Training in data interpretation would also be useful. Novel survey methods should be trialled and prospective data gathering (surveillance) employed wherever feasible. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>surveying</b> is, scientifically speaking, an open problem.
