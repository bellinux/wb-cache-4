5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or <b>spool</b> line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or <b>spool</b> used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple <b>spool</b> shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E

Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
25|$|Direct-drive reels {{have the}} <b>spool</b> and handle {{directly}} coupled. When the handle moves forwards, the <b>spool</b> moves forwards, and vice versa. With a fast-running fish, {{this may have}} consequences for the angler's knuckles. Traditional fly reels are direct-drive.|$|E
25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the <b>spool,</b> but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary <b>spool.</b> Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating <b>spool,</b> much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E

50|$|Early DOS {{included}} no <b>spooling</b> sub-system {{to improve}} the efficiency of punched card and line printer I/O. By the late 1960s both IBM and aftermarket vendors began filling this void. IBM's <b>spooler</b> was an option called POWER, and Software Design, Inc., an independent software company, sold a <b>spooler</b> called GRASP.|$|R
50|$|Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 {{introduce}} print driver isolation, which {{improves the}} reliability of the print <b>spooler</b> by running printer drivers in a separate process to the <b>spooler</b> service. If a third party print driver fails while isolated, it does not impact other drivers or the print <b>spooler</b> service.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Spooler</b> was {{a systems}} {{software}} operating system package that provided <b>spooling</b> facilities for the IBM System/370 running DOS/VS, DOS/VSE environment, and IBM System/360 running DOS/360 or retrofitted with modified DOS/360, such as TCSC's EDOS. Other venders offering The <b>Spooler</b> {{as part of}} their OS were Amdahl, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Magnuson, and RCA.|$|R
25|$|Williamson {{completed}} his studies and departed the University with a Masters of Science in Computer Science and joined AT Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and took this cron with him. At Bell Labs, {{he and others}} incorporated the Unix at command into cron, moved the crontab files out of users' home directories (which were not host-specific) and into a common host-specific <b>spool</b> directory, and of necessity added the crontab command to allow users to copy their crontabs to that <b>spool</b> directory.|$|E
25|$|Spinning reels {{have two}} types of drag: front or rear. Front drags, which have the {{adjustment}} located on the <b>spool</b> itself, are mechanically simpler, usually more consistent in performance and capable of higher drag forces. Rear drags, with the adjustment screw {{on the back of}} the reel, are more complicated mechanically and usually not as precise or smooth as front drags since the drag itself is often part of the drive shaft and not the <b>spool.</b> They are however, easier to adjust in mid-fight.|$|E
25|$|Baitcasters {{are known}} as {{multiplier}} reels in Europe, on account of their geared line retrieve (one turn of the handle resulting in multiple turns of the <b>spool).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} doped-fiber's <b>spooling</b> on {{performance}} of short wavelength band erbium-doped fiber amplifier (S-band EDFA) is demonstrated. Changing the <b>spooling</b> diameter {{resulted in a}} variation of gain and noise figure characteristics of this amplifier. The optimum <b>spooling</b> diameter is obtained {{in the range from}} 5 to 7 cm. Beyond this range, an inevitable degradation of gain and noise figure characteristics is observed due to the changes of phase matching wavelength. Therefore, maintaining the optimum <b>spooling</b> diameter is the important issue for the S-band EDFA...|$|R

25|$|Applications {{which use}} the Windows Presentation Foundation for the display {{elements}} can directly print to the XPS print path {{without the need}} for image or colorspace conversion. The XPS format used in the <b>spool</b> file, represents advanced graphics effects such as 3D images, glow effects, and gradients as Windows Presentation Foundation primitives, which are processed by the printer drivers without rasterization, preventing rendering artifacts and reducing computational load. When the legacy GDI Print Path is used, the XPS <b>spool</b> file is used for processing before it is converted to a GDI image to minimize the processing done at raster level.|$|E
25|$|A {{nucleosome}} is a {{basic unit}} of DNA packaging in eukaryotes, consisting of a segment of DNA wound in sequence around eight histone protein cores. This structure is often compared to thread wrapped around a <b>spool.</b>|$|E
25|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) {{tethered}} to a diver is usually towed on {{a thin line}} attached to a reel, <b>spool</b> or other device which allows the diver to control the line length, so that excessive slack line can be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Output <b>Spooling</b> - Output <b>spooling</b> is {{the process}} of {{queueing}} files for printing. Files are scheduled for printing based on job priority and availability of the printing device(s). You can specify special printing forms and formats.|$|R
2500|$|The second experiment, however, {{started with}} ten <b>spools</b> of thread on the table, and <b>spools</b> were {{subtracted}} {{one at a}} time. In this experiment, one speaker used hÃ³i (the word previously supposed to mean 'one') when there were six <b>spools</b> left, and all four speakers used that word consistently when there were {{as many as three}} <b>spools</b> left. Though Frank and his colleagues do not attempt to explain their subjects' difference in behavior in these two experiments, they conclude that the two words under investigation [...] "are {{much more likely to be}} relative or comparative terms like 'few' or 'fewer' than absolute terms like 'one' [...] ".|$|R
50|$|PRINT: Print <b>spooler.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the core}} of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based printer driver which {{includes}} the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive the <b>spool</b> file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL post-processing, and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the <b>spool</b> file to the page description language supported by the printer.|$|E
25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the <b>spool</b> itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the <b>spool</b> for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free <b>spool.</b> They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free <b>spool.</b> It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

40|$|Spinning {{organs of}} Heteropoda venaatoria, a "hunter" spider, were histologically and anatomically studied {{in order to}} clarify the {{difference}} in spinning organs between the "snarer" ane "hunter" about which little information has been offered. Followings are the results obtained in the present study. In the adult female of H. venatoria, two ampullaceal glands open through two spigots of the C-type and pifiform glands through about 180 <b>spools</b> of the E-type on each anterior spinneret; two tubuliform glands open through two spigots and aciniform glands through about 36 <b>spools</b> of the F-type on each middle spinneret; and aciniform glands open through about 43 <b>spools</b> on each posterior spinneret. In the adult male of the same species, an ambullaceal gland opens through a spigot of the C-type and piriform glands through about 131 <b>spools</b> of the E-type on each anterior spinneret; an ampullaceal gland through a spigot, and aciniform glands through about 43 <b>spools</b> of the F-type on each middle spinneret; and aciniform glands open through about 55 <b>spools</b> on each posterior spinneret. The difference in spinning organ was discussed between adults and sub-adults of H. venatoria, and between the "hunter" and "snarer" of spiders...|$|R
