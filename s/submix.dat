5000|$|During the Zooropa {{sessions}} of February-May 1993, U2 revisited the song. At Windmill Lane Studios, producer Brian Eno {{began working with}} a stereo <b>submix</b> of the Berlin version, containing guitar, bass, bass pedals and drums, that Flood had created. Eno added {{about six or seven}} tracks of keyboards to the <b>submix,</b> mostly samples and strings from a Yamaha DX7 synthesiser. Some of the samples included Arabic voices and congas. According to Flood, [...] "The idea of his overdubs was to make up music out of non-musical noises, like loops of pieces of dialogue and video samples." [...] The Edge called Eno's additions [...] "fantastic." ...|$|E
50|$|Each {{channel on}} a mixer has a sliding volume control (fader) that allows {{adjustment}} {{of the level}} of that channel. Some smaller mixers may use a rotary control instead of a fader to save space. The signals are summed to create the main mix, or combined on a bus as a <b>submix,</b> a group of channels that are then added to get the final mix (for instance, many drum mics could be grouped into a bus, and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader). There may also be insert points for a certain bus, or even the entire mix.|$|E

50|$|Stem-mixing is {{a method}} of mixing audio {{material}} based on creating groups of audio tracks and processing them separately prior to combining them into a final master mix. Stems are also {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>submixes,</b> subgroups, or busses.|$|R
40|$|In this {{these the}} SST {{variability}} {{of the northern}} midlatitudes and the tropical Atlantic have been analysed. The analysis {{has been based on}} the comparison of the observations with a hierarchy of different coupled simulations. The analysis of the midlatitude SST variability has shown that the large-scale features of the SST variability cannot be simulated by a fixed depth mixed layer ocean model and that the spectral distribution of the SST is significantly different for an AR- 1 process on time scales from seasons to decades. The processes that are important for these differences are the seasonal variability of the mixed layer depth, the wind induced mixing, which entrains water from the <b>submixed</b> layer ocean, and the heat exchange between the mixed layer and the <b>submixed</b> layer ocean. The observed increase in the SST variance from the interannual to the decadal time scale is due to the heat exchange between the <b>submixed</b> layer ocean and the mixed layer and not, as in the MIX_ 5 _ 0 simulation, merely an effect of the integration of atmospheric noise. All these processes can be simulated by the local air-sea interactions in the dynamical ocean mixed layer MIX_d_y_n_a_m_i_c. The analysis of the seasonal predictability of the SST in the MIX_d_y_n_a_m_i_c simulation indicates that the knowledge of the actual mixed layer depth is important to predict the SST development in summer and fall.

40|$|We {{consider}} zero-sum stochastic {{games with}} perfect information and finitely many states and actions. The payoff {{is computed by}} a payoff function which associates to each infinite sequence of states and actions a real number. We prove that if the the payoff function is both shift-invariant and <b>submixing,</b> then the game is half-positional, i. e. the first player has an optimal strategy which is both deterministic and stationary. This result relies {{on the existence of}} ϵ-subgame-perfect equilibria in shift-invariant games, a second contribution of the paper...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{elucidate}} {{aspects of}} the one-loop anomalous dimension of so(6) -singlet multi-trace operators in N= 4 SU(Nc) SYM at finite Nc. First, we study how 1 /Nc corrections lift the large Nc degeneracy of the spectrum, which we call the operator <b>submixing</b> problem. We observe that all large Nc zero modes acquire anomalous dimensions starting at order 1 /Nc 2 with a non-positive coefficient and they mix only among the operators with {{the same number of}} traces at leading order. Second, we study the lowest one-loop dimension of operators of length equal to 2 Nc. The dimension of such operators becomes more negative as Nc increases, which will eventually diverge in the double scaling limit. Third, we examine the structure of level-crossing at finite Nc in view of unitarity. Finally we find out a correspondence between the large Nc zero modes and completely symmetric polynomials of Mandelstam variables...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarkov {{decision}} processes (MDPs) are controllable discrete event {{systems with}} stochastic transitions. Performances of an MDP are evaluated by a payoff function. The controller of the MDP seeks to optimize those performances, using optimal strategies. There exists various ways of measuring performances, i. e. various classes of payoff functions. For example, average performances can be evaluated by a mean-payoff function, peak performances by a limsup payoff function, and the parity payoff function {{can be used}} to encode logical specifications. Surprisingly, all the MDPs equipped with mean, limsup or parity payoff functions share a common non-trivial property: they admit pure stationary optimal strategies. In this paper, we introduce the class of prefix-independent and <b>submixing</b> payoff functions, and we prove that any MDP equipped with such a payoff function admits pure stationary optimal strategies. This result unifies and simplifies several existing proofs. Moreover, it is a key tool for generating new examples of MDPs with pure stationary optimal strategies...|$|R

5000|$|In {{live sound}} mixing {{the front of}} house mixing console often {{includes}} a matrix mixer section for optimizing the blend of sound going to various locations in the performance space. Subgroups, auxiliary mixes, <b>submixes</b> or even the main outputs are routed through the matrix mixer to different loudspeaker zones, making the matrix essentially a [...] "mix of mixes". A front-of-house matrix may be used at a concert to switch between the headliner's and the opening act's mixing consoles. A matrix mixer feature may be included on analog or digital consoles. For instance, the Midas Consoles XL4 concert mixing console has a built-in 8×8 matrix summing 8 subgroups into 8 matrix outputs; the same basic module is available separately as the Midas XL88 (see photograph). The digital Yamaha M7CL mixing console is another such product; it has a 19×8 matrix section summing 16 mixes {{as well as the}} main left/right/mono outputs (see screenshot). In the classic analog monitor mixer without faders, the console is set up as a large matrix mixer with the addition of equalization filters and other controls for each input.|$|R
5000|$|A rapid {{series of}} rhythmic and {{harmonic}} changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains {{the bulk of}} the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano and Timpani. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive <b>submixes.</b> According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: [...] "Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff." [...] The band wanted to create [...] "a wall of sound, that starts down and goes all the way up". The band used the bell effect for lyrics [...] "Magnifico" [...] and [...] "Let me go". Also, on [...] "Let him go", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the [...] "choir" [...] have stopped singing.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} changes in shortwave {{radiation}} penetration depth on the global ocean circulation and heat transport is studied using the GFDL Modular Ocean Model (MOM 4) with two independent parameterizations that use ocean color to estimate the penetration depth of shortwave radiation. Ten to eighteen percent increases in the depth of 1 % downwelling surface irradiance levels results {{in an increase in}} mixed layer depths of 3 – 20 m in the subtropical and tropical regions with no change at higher latitudes. While 1 D models have predicted that sea surface temperatures at the equator would decrease with deeper penetration of solar irradiance, this study shows a warming, resulting in a 10 % decrease in the required restoring heat flux needed to maintain climatological sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The decrease in the restoring heat flux is attributed to a slowdown in heat transport (5 %) from the Tropics and an increase in the temperature of <b>submixed</b> layer waters being transported into the equatorial regions. Calculations were made using a simple relationship between mixed layer depth and meridional mass transport. When compared with model diagnostics, these calculations suggest that the slowdown in heat transport is primarily due to off-equatorial increases in mixed layer depths. At higher latitudes (5 °– 40 °), higher restoring heat fluxes are needed to maintain sea surface temperatures because of deeper mixed layers and an increase in storage of heat below the mixed layer. This study offers a way to evaluate the changes in irradiance penetration depths in coupled ocean–atmosphere GCMs and the potential effect that large-scale changes in chlorophyll a concentrations will have on ocean circulation...|$|R
500|$|Jackson mixed Streisand's , using a Digidesign Venue digital {{mixing console}} at FOH for its smaller {{footprint}} (allowing more audience seats) and its plug-in audio effects. As well, the Venue mixing system {{was chosen for}} its integration with Pro Tools hardware and software, to make 128-channel hard disk recordings of the concerts directly from the three Digidesign consoles: one to mix strings, one to mix brass, reeds and percussion, and one under Jackson's control out in the audience, with Streisand's microphone inputs and stems (<b>submixes</b> of other microphones) from the other consoles. The recordings made in New York City and Washington, D.C. were remixed into the album Live In Concert 2006—Jackson was listed as sound designer. Sharing sound designer and FOH mixing duties with Chris Carlton, Jackson made certain that the custom soft dome monitor wedges were positioned correctly aiming up from under the stage to cover everywhere Streisand might walk. Clair Brothers supplied 18 Dolby Lake Processors for the tour, the majority used by Jackson to tune the main sound system, and the rest for control of monitor wedges used by Streisand and by the supporting artist, Il Divo. For Streisand's voice, Jackson auditioned several wireless microphones and ended up using a Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter equipped with a Neumann KK 105 S supercardioid capsule. He used the vocal microphone to test the sound system from different locations around the arena. When the tour hit the UK and continental Europe, Jackson changed from a Neumann to a Røde Microphones capsule, custom made to his requirements; one that Røde called the [...] "Jackson Special". Jackson used Millennia microphone preamps for any microphone that was required {{to be sent to}} multiple mixing consoles, such as at Madison Square Garden where cable runs to the recording trucks were [...] long. The use of only one preamp prevents the microphone output from being loaded down by too little resistance which can change its tone quality.|$|R
