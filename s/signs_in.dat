5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.

The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E

According to area folklore, and indicated on <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman.

5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, I-87 intersects NY9N again at exit34, the southernmost {{junction}} to feature bilingual guide <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> English and French {{due to the}} road's proximity to Quebec.

Just inside the town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY22 at exit36, a junction serving nearby Plattsburgh International Airport.

5|$|Until 2008, signs at exit43A in {{downtown}} Cumberland labeled the exit as {{providing access to}} WV28 Alt. Because of this, many truckers used this exit to get to WV28. This created problems on WV28 Alt. in Ridgeley, West Virginia, as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass, blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV28 Alt. from guide signs for exit43A and placed warning <b>signs</b> <b>in</b> Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit43B to MD51, which allows them to connect to WV28 via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim is {{to provide}} {{guidelines}} for the evaluation and management of adults with hypoglycemic disorders, including those with diabetes mellitus. EVIDENCE: Using {{the recommendations of the}} Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence is graded very low (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle ooo), low (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle oo), moderate (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle o), or high (plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle plus <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> circle). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend evaluation and management of hypoglycemia only in patients in whom Whipple's triad [...] symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of those symptoms or signs after the plasma glucose concentration is raised [...] is documented. In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies [...] drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is {{the most common cause of}} hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction [...] addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations [...] in persons with diabetes...|$|R
