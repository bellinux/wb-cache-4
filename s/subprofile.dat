Among the 69 isolates fingerprinted by PFGE, 17 were compared by HaeIII restriction endonuclease typing. The PFGE method demonstrated a higher degree of discriminatory power than restriction endonuclease typing with HaeII. Moreover, an impressive diversity of P. marneffei isolates was observed, as there were 54 distinct macrorestriction profiles among the 69 isolates of P. marneffei. These profiles were grouped into two large clusters by computer-assisted similarity analysis: macrorestriction pattern I (MPI) and MPII, with nine <b>subprofiles</b> (MPIa to MPIf and MPIIa to MPIIc). We observed no significant correlation between the macrorestriction patterns of the P. marneffei isolates and geographical region or specimen source. It is interesting that all isolates obtained before 1995 were MPI, and we found an increase in the incidence of infections with MPII isolates after 1995. We conclude that PFGE is a highly discriminatory typing method and is well suited for computer-assisted analysis.

40|$|We use ground {{geodetic}} and interferometric {{synthetic aperture}} radar satellite observations across the southern San Andreas (SAF) -San Jacinto (SJF) fault systems to constrain their slip rates and the viscosity structure of the lower crust and upper mantle {{on the basis of}} periodic earthquake cycle, Maxwell viscoelastic, finite element models. Key questions for this system are the SAF and SJF slip rates, the slip partitioning between the two main branches of the SJF, and the dip of the SAF. The best-fitting models generally have a high-viscosity lower crust (η = 10 ^(21) Pa s) overlying a lower-viscosity upper mantle (η = 10 ^(19) Pa s). We find considerable trade-offs between the relative time into the current earthquake cycle of the San Jacinto fault and the upper mantle viscosity. With reasonable assumptions for the relative time in the earthquake cycle, the partition of slip is fairly robust at around 24 – 26 mm/a for the San Jacinto fault system and 16 – 18 mm/a for the San Andreas fault. Models for two <b>subprofiles</b> across the SAF-SJF systems suggest that slip may transfer from the western (Coyote Creek) branch to the eastern (Clark-Superstition hills) branch of the SJF from NW to SE.

40|$|Motivation: Discovery of {{regulatory}} motifs in unaligned DNA sequences remains a fundamental problem in computational biology. Two categories of algorithms {{have been developed}} to identify common motifs from a set of DNA sequences. The first can be called a ‘multiple genes, single species’approach. It proposes that a degenerate motif is embedded in {{some or all of the}} otherwise unrelated input sequences and tries to describe a consensus motif and identify its occurrences. It is often used for co-regulated genes identified through experimental approaches. The second approach can be called ‘single gene, multiple species’. It requires orthologous input sequences and tries to identify unusually well conserved regions by phylogen-etic footprinting. Both approaches perform well, but each has some limitations. It is tempting to combine the knowledge of co-regulation among different genes and conservation among orthologous genes to improve our ability to identify motifs. Results: Based on the Consensus algorithm previously established by our group, we introduce a new algorithm called PhyloCon (Phylogenetic Consensus) that takes into account both conservation among orthologous genes and co-regulation of genes within a species. This algorithm first aligns conserved regions of orthologous sequences into multiple sequence alignments, or profiles, then compares profiles representing non-orthologous sequences. Motifs emerge as common regions in these profiles. Here we present a novel statistic to compare profiles of DNA sequences and a greedy approach to search for common <b>subprofiles.</b> We demonstrate that PhyloCon performs well on both synthetic and biological data.

A relatively new magnetic resonance (MR) technique, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), {{can be used to}} measure regional brain perfusion. We identified a Parkinson's disease (PD) -related perfusion and metabolic covariance pattern in the same patients using PCASL and FDG-PET imaging and assessed (dis) similarities in the disease-related pattern between perfusion and metabolism in PD patients. METHODS: Nineteen PD patients and seventeen healthy controls underwent [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. Of 14 PD patients and all healthy controls PCASL-MRI could be obtained. Data were analyzed using scaled <b>subprofile</b> model/principal component analysis (SSM/PCA). RESULTS: Unique Parkinson's disease-related perfusion and metabolic covariance patterns were identified using PCASL and FDG-PET in the same patients. The PD-related metabolic covariance brain pattern is in high accordance with previously reports. Also our disease-related perfusion pattern is comparable to the earlier described perfusion pattern. The most marked difference between our perfusion and metabolic patterns is the larger perfusion decrease in cortical regions including the insula. CONCLUSION: We identified PD-related perfusion and metabolic brain patterns using PCASL and FDG-PET in the same patients which were comparable with results of existing research. In this respect, PCASL appears to be a promising addition in the early diagnosis of individual parkinsonian patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: in {{this paper}} we present a general multivariate {{approach}} to the analysis of functional imaging studies. This analysis uses standard multivariate techniques to make statistical inferences about activation effects and to describe the important features of these effects. More specifically, the proposed analysis uses multivariate analysis of covariance (ManCova) with Wilk's lambda to test for specific effects of interest (e. g., differences among activation conditions), and canonical variates analysis (CVA) to characterize differential responses in terms of distributed brain systems. The data are subject to h 4 anCova after transformation using their principal components or eigenimages. After sigruficance of the activation effect has been assessed, underlying changes are described in terms of canonical images. Canonical images are like eigenimages but take explicit account of the effects of error or noise. The generality of this approach is assured by the general linear model used in the ManCova. The design and inferences sought are embodied in the design matrix and can, in principle, accommodate most parametric statistical analyses. This multivariate analysis may provide a statistical approach to PET activation studies that 1) complements univariate approaches like statistical parametric mapping, and 2) may facilitate the extension of existing multivariate techniques, like the scaled <b>subprofile</b> model and eigenimage analysis, to include hypothesis testing and statistical inference. o 1 % wiiq-uss, Inc.

Since these diseases progress slowly, they {{are not easy to}} diagnose at an early stage. Moreover, they portray similar disease features, which makes them hard to differentiate. In this thesis, the objective was to devise techniques to extract biomarkers from brain data for the prediction and classification of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular parkinsonian syndromes. We used principal component analysis in combination with the scaled <b>subprofile</b> model to extract features from the brain data to classify these disorders. Thereafter, the features were provided to several classifiers, i. e., decision trees, generalized matrix learning vector quantization, and support vector machine to classify the parkinsonian syndromes. A validation of the classifiers was performed. The decision tree method was compared to the stepwise regression method which aims at linearly combining a few good principal components. The stepwise regression method performed better than the decision tree method in the classification of the parkinsonian syndromes. Combining the two methods is feasible. The decision trees helped us to visualize the classification results, hence providing an insight into the distribution of features. Both generalized matrix learning vector quantization and support vector machine are better than the decision tree method in the classification of early-stage parkinsonian syndromes. All the classification methods used in this thesis performed well with later disease stage data.

Methods: We used FDG-PET scans of 18 healthy controls and 15 AD patients (identification cohort) to identify an AD-related glucose metabolic covariance pattern. In the confirmation cohort (n= 15), we investigated the ability to discriminate between probable AD and non-probable AD (possible AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective complaints). Results: The AD-related metabolic covariance pattern was characterized by relatively decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal regions and relatively increased metabolism in the subcortical white matter, cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed at a cut-off value of z= 1. 23, a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 94 % for correct AD classification. In the confirmation cohort, subjects with clinically probable AD diagnosis showed a high expression of the AD-related pattern whereas in subjects with a non-probable AD diagnosis a low expression was found. Conclusion: The Alzheimer's disease-related cerebral glucose metabolic covariance pattern identified by SSM/PCA analysis was highly sensitive and specific for Alzheimer's disease. This method is expected to be helpful in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral small-vessel damage manifests {{as white}} matter hyperintensities and {{cerebral}} atrophy on brain MRI and {{is associated with}} aging, cognitive decline and dementia. We sought to examine the interrelationship of these imaging biomarkers {{and the influence of}} hypertension in older individuals. We used a multivariate spatial covariance neuroimaging technique to localize the effects of white matter lesion load on regional gray matter volume and assessed the role of blood pressure control, age and education on this relationship. Using a case-control design matching for age, gender, and educational attainment we selected 64 participants with normal blood pressure, controlled hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension from the Northern Manhattan Study cohort. We applied gray matter voxel-based morphometry with the scaled <b>subprofile</b> model to (1) identify regional covariance patterns of gray matter volume differences associated with white matter lesion load, (2) compare this relationship across blood pressure groups, and (3) relate it to cognitive performance. In this group of participants aged 60 - 86 years, we identified a pattern of reduced gray matter volume associated with white matter lesion load in bilateral temporal-parietal regions with relative preservation of volume in the basal forebrain, thalami and cingulate cortex. This pattern was expressed most in the uncontrolled hypertension group and least in the normotensives, but was also more evident in older and more educated individuals. Expression of this pattern was associated with worse performance in executive function and memory. In summary, white matter lesions from small-vessel disease are associated with a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy that is mitigated by blood pressure control, exacerbated by aging, and associated with cognitive performance...|$|E
3000|$|... 18 F-FDG brain {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging is currently the quantitative imaging modality of choice for studying regional brain glucose metabolism and is increasingly being used for diagnostic and research purposes. Moreover, its clinical use has been established for specific diagnostic questions in neurodegenerative diseases [1, 2]. Over recent years, different methods {{have been developed to}} generate disease-specific metabolic patterns using 18 F-FDG brain PET imaging. These brain patterns facilitate the differential diagnosis by providing a score representing the pattern expression of a specific brain disease. Moreover, these disease-specific glucose metabolic patterns allow the identification of specific brain networks, and therefore, {{a better understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms and topology of different brain disorders. For this purpose, a scaled <b>subprofile</b> model (SSM) [3] was used to identify brain networks in Alzheimer’s disease [4], Huntington’s disease [5], and Parkinson’s disease [6, 7], while corresponding methodological issues, such as network selection criteria and data log transform, were discussed by Spetsieris et al. [8]. Furthermore, a support vector machine (SVM) and independent component analysis (ICA) were considered to construct a spatial connectivity pattern in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [9]. SVM, originally proposed by Vapnik et al. [10], is based on the theory of structural risk minimization and is very efficient for high dimensional input data with only a few data sets available for training. Therefore, a SVM approach is particularly well suited for the analysis and classification of neuroimaging data in general and brain PET data in particular which was already demonstrated, e.g., for the classification of ALS patients and healthy controls using 18 F-FDG PET [11], and for classification of healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using 18 F-flutemetamol brain PET [12].|$|E
