50|$|The {{electronics}} is {{a circuit}} {{composed of a}} <b>spark</b> gap, a <b>capacitor,</b> and the discharge through the nitrogen. First the spark gap and the capacitor are charged. The spark gap then discharges itself and voltage {{is applied to the}} nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|A rate {{of current}} {{rise of the}} order of 1013 A sec− 1 can be {{produced}} by inexpensive capacitors used in conjunction with a special, low inductance fuse and <b>spark</b> gap. The <b>capacitors</b> are discharged through the fuse until the current reaches a near maximum value at which time the current is transferred from the fuse into a load inductance of about 1 nH. The spark gap isolates the load until the moment of current transfer...|$|R
2500|$|Nikola Tesla {{patented}} the Tesla coil circuit April 25, 1891. {{and first}} publicly demonstrated it May 20, 1891 in his lecture [...] "Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination" [...] before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia College, New York. Although Tesla patented many similar circuits during this period, {{this was the}} first that contained all the elements of the Tesla coil: high voltage primary transformer, <b>capacitor,</b> <b>spark</b> gap, and air core [...] "oscillation transformer".|$|R
5000|$|Eastham {{was born}} in Oregon City, Oregon. After high school {{graduation}} from Portland Academy, he worked as electrician for a Portland street railway, then moved to New York City in 1905 where {{he worked for the}} Ovington X-ray Company. After noticing that the high-voltage spark coils used to excite X-ray tubes were becoming popular as transmitters for radio amateurs, he joined two other employees in 1906 to start the Clapp, Eddy, and Eastham Company (subsequently Clapp-Eastham) in Boston, to sell <b>spark</b> coils, variable <b>capacitors,</b> and other radio devices.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century digital {{electronic}} ignition modules became available for small engines on such applications as chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers. This was made possible by low cost, high speed, and small footprint microcontrollers. [...] Digital electronic ignition modules can be designed as either capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) or inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems. Capacitive discharge digital ignitions store charged energy for the <b>spark</b> in a <b>capacitor</b> within the module that can be released to the spark plug at virtually any time throughout the engine cycle via a control signal from the microprocessor. This allows for greater timing flexibility, and engine performance; especially when designed hand-in-hand with the engine carburetor.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the analysis, simulation {{and design of}} a peaking circuit comprising of a peaking <b>capacitor,</b> <b>spark</b> gap and load circuit. The peaking circuit is used along with a 200  kV, 20  J Marx generator for generation of sub-nanosecond pulses. A high pressure chamber to accommodate the peaking circuit was designed and fabricated and tested upto a pressure of 70  kg/cm 2. Total estimated values of the capacitance and inductance of the peaking circuit are 10  pF and 72  nH respectively. At full charging voltage, the peaking capacitor gets charged to a peak voltage of 394. 6  kV in 15  ns. The output switch is closed at this instant. From Analysis & Simulation, the output current & rise time (with a matched load of 85  Ω) are 2. 53  kA and 0. 62  ns...|$|R
40|$|Capacitors are {{important}} components of electronic circuits and of electrical machinery and power grids. You can find large oil-insulated capacitors on powerline poles or small ceramic-insulated capacitors in a radio. In each application the capacitor {{is used to}} store electrical charge and electrical energy - for example, sometimes {{for a short time}} in an alternating-current cycle, sometimes for a long time until the energy is needed, as in a strobe light for a camera. Your body can be a capacitor, storing up enough charge and energy to cause a painful <b>spark</b> when the <b>capacitor</b> discharqes. Practical capacitors are basically two conducting plates or sheets separated by an insulator (dielectric) such as air, oil, paper, plastic film, or even the oxide layer on one of the conducting surfaces. This module will treat the basic physics of capacitors...|$|R
2500|$|The spark {{generation}} {{story is a}} little more complicated. The purpose of the ignition coil is to make a spark that jumps the spark plug's gap, which might be [...] (it also has to jump the rotor-to-distributor-post gap). At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. Something must be done to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the <b>spark</b> plug. The <b>capacitor</b> (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|R
5000|$|Plauson was the {{director}} of the Fischer-Tropsch [...] "Otto Traun Research Laboratories" [...] in Hamburg, Germany during the Weimar Republic of the 1920s. He built on Nikola Tesla's idea for connecting machinery to the [...] "wheelwork of nature". Plauson's patent no. 1540998 describe methods to convert alternating radiant static electricity into rectified continuous current pulses. His systems mainly involved needle & radium- coated electricity conducting balloons or aerostats which were connected to complex converting systems consisting of coils, <b>capacitors,</b> <b>spark</b> gaps etc. He developed an electrostatic generator called Plauson's converter. In 1920, Plauson published a research journal on the subject, titled [...] "Production and Utilization of the Atmospheric Electricity" [...] (Gr., Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphärischen Elektrizität).A second, expanded edition of his journal was published later the same year. A copy of that edition is in the British Library at shelf mark 8754.b.36. A copy is also available in PDF-format, complete with Optical Character Recognition, through the books2ebooks service, here.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of already published reports on the observation of an anomalous force in a vacuum associated with vacuum <b>sparks</b> in asymmetric <b>capacitors</b> charged with “constant” high voltages. Known experimental details of these experiments are put forward and propulsion performance is compared with the only known propulsion system known to exist in a vacuum associated with sparks: the vacuum arc thruster (VAT). VAT's are known for decades and work on principles of momentum conservation. They vaporize particles from the electrodes themselves through a high spark current in one direction in order to develop a thrust in the opposite direction. However, the known performance trend for these thrusters does not account for the vacuum spark force values published by NASA. Furthermore, they have not observed the electrode erosion usually associated with VAT operation, even after extended testing. Therefore it is possible that a new propulsion mechanism might be at work, but that should be verified and confirmed experimentally in the future in order to resolve the question...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed corona above water technique {{is applied to}} water containing 10 mg l- 1 methylene blue (MB) or methyl orange (MO). The corona discharge pulses are created with a <b>spark</b> gap switched <b>capacitor</b> followed by a transmission line transformer. The pulse amplitude is 40 kV; its duration is 50 ns. At a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz this leads to an average power of 0. 6 W into the discharge. MB and MO are completely decolourized in ~ 20 min. This corresponds to a yield of ~ 4. 5 gr kW- 1 h- 1, which {{is much higher than}} obtained with other discharge techniques or sonoluminescence. The high yield is reflected in the observed temperature increase of only ~ 1 K. Tests with additional chemicals show that the initial speed of the conversion can be influenced but the total time required for total decolourization is constant. Further, it follows that the main oxidation path of the dyes is by direct ozone attack and the conversion products are strong acids...|$|R
2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage <b>capacitor,</b> <b>spark</b> gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or [...] "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|R
