The <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.|$|E

This study is a qualitative study conducted through interviews of senior citizen experiences of the life be-fore the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> installation and after the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> had been installed. The re-sults of the study are that life before the installation of the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> has been very gen-der segregated in Korpilombolo and especially troublesome for women. Life after the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> installation, on the other hand, has eased the labor, especially for women, but they are still performing the work in the homes. The washing machine in particular was revolutionary. In the discussion, I have compared conditions today based on previous research and my own experiences on this. In addition to the interviews, the study relies on contemporary sources films from 1940 to 1970 era in Korpilombolo and some documentary photographs that de-scribe what I have said in my study.

5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal.

Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E

5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> sending {{hundreds of millions of}} gallons of sewage into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E
5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Lilly {{and other}} civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected {{as its first}} president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city {{development}} goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric utility companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.|$|E

40|$|How can {{large-scale}} {{adoption of}} new technologies that lead to decreasing environmental pressure on the ecosystem be described and analyzed by help of models of influences {{on the behavior of}} actors? Here the case of on-site <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>sewage</b> treatment <b>systems</b> for one or a few households) represents a more general problem situation where decreasing environmental loads depend on the adoption of more environmentally benign technologies made by actors using, providing, controlling the regulations, or in other ways influencing the change of technology. In this case the specific on-site <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> and the actions of house-owners are studied. The research includes the identification and quantification of relative strength of influences that make the actors controlling the technology at the interface between technosphere and ecosphere actually change their behavior and adopt the technologies. We argue that one possible and valuable approach, driven by observations, to get this knowledge is a Bayesian modeling approach using influence diagrams. We present results from the first modeling efforts based on an initial interview study in three Swedish municipalities to find categories of influences, and a subsequent questionnaire to 3500 Swedish house-owners to get quantitative data {{that can be used to}} model the decision situation in the case of on-site <b>sewage</b> <b>systems.</b> The case of actors around on-site <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> is particularly interesting since it contains decision situations with few economic incentives for the individual. Instead, other influencing factors such as regulatory arrangements are important. Increasing the knowledge about this kind of influences on house-owners would likely improve the chances of making policy interventions that work, and actually lead to improved environmental performance of on-site <b>sewage</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
