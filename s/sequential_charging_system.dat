40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the EMFs in the human body exposed to the wireless inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> of electric vehicles such that the compliance of this <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> with respect to human EM exposure limits can be examined. A magnetic resonance imaging-derived and high-resolution model of the human body is used. An exposure assessment of a representative wireless inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system,</b> under a limited set of operating conditions, is provided to estimate the induced EMFs. The numerical analysis is performed with the finite element method. Numerical modeling of the system next to a standing human model shows that the EM exposure limits can be absolutely satisfied even when the transmitter coil is very close to the body. Furthermore, the worst configuration for the exposure evaluation of the wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> is taken into consideration. This paper provides a useful guideline for the industry to develop inductive <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> following the safety standards of radiation protection...|$|R

30|$|However, smart {{charging}} {{only works}} if the BEV user is fully {{integrated into the}} process. The algorithms of smart <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> require the user’s specific charging flexibility to schedule an optimal charging process. A BEV user can, for example, provide temporal charging flexibility if she is willing to postpone charging of the BEV in time. Since smart <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> usually cannot decide how flexible the user is (when and how far she wants to drive), the user must manually enter her charging flexibility into the smart <b>charging</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a 5 kW inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> for electric vehicles (EVs). Over 90 % efficiency is maintained from grid to battery across a wide range of coupling conditions at full load. Experimental measurements show that the magnetic field strength meets the stringent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for human safety. In addition, a new dual side control scheme is proposed to optimize system level efficiency. Experimental validation showed that a 7 % efficiency increase and 25 % loss reduction under light load conditions is achievable. The authors believe this paper is the first to show such high measured efficiencies for a level 2 inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of this order would indicate that inductive <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> are reasonably energy efficient when compared to the efficiency of plug-in <b>charging</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{wireless}} <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> now {{becomes one}} of the emerging technologies especially {{in the application of}} communication systems and beneficial to the wireless electronic appliances. Among them are mobile phones, cameras, personal digital assistance (PDA), cooler, torchlight and drill. Those wireless devices require battery to store and provide power before the device can be used. Hence, in order {{to solve the problem of}} short life of the battery of mobile phone, this project proposes adding a solar <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> base on inductive coupling method to the mobile phone to improve the usage of mobile phone in term of standby time, talk-time, online applications and power consumption especially in the remote area. Inductive coupling is among the effective method in wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> to <b>charge</b> electronics device and reduce the constraint of the power cord or wired system. Meanwhile, solar cell is among the energy harvesting devices that is widely employed in many electronics application. The outcome of the project describes the comparison of the power consumption between the wire <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> with solar-based wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system.</b> From the analysis of the results, solar-powered mobile phone with inductive coupling produced 21 h 46 min standby time after charging for 13 h 15 min compared to the existing <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> (wired system) which produce 17 h 5 min standby time after charging for 2 h 30 min. In addition, proposed system has high power consumption in term of standby time, talk-time and online application. Based on the results of the project, it could suggest that the wireless solar-powered mobile phone can replace the existing <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> in term of standby time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — According to the 3 GPP {{standard}} architecture up to Release 9, a <b>Charging</b> <b>System</b> is {{not supposed}} to interact directly with a Policy Server. The <b>Charging</b> <b>System</b> is responsible for rating and charging, while the Policy Server is responsible for determining the right policy depending on the kind of traffic. In reality, it appears that the decision about the right policy might be influenced by some real-time subscriber information, which might also be relevant for charging, and therefore stored in the <b>Charging</b> <b>System.</b> In this context, a direct interface between the <b>Charging</b> <b>System</b> and the Policy Server might be required. The goal {{of this paper is to}} study what such an interface would look like, based on an actual implementation. The main achievement is to validate a scenario where the policy should change in real-time during a data session because a volume threshold has been crossed...|$|R

A crucial step in the analysis is the inclusion of the effect of the spacetime curvature on the electrostatic self-interaction of the <b>charged</b> <b>system.</b> Comment: 8 page...|$|R

40|$|Congestion is a {{phenomenon}} that is becoming an increasing problem on road networks in and around many urban areas. As congestion causes a number of environmental, economic and social problems, policy and decision makers have started to consider a number of measures to tackle it. A number of cities have therefore implemented congestion <b>charging</b> <b>systems,</b> {{with one of the}} most recent being Valletta, Malta, in May 2007. Despite being part of a number of initiatives in attempting to curb Malta’s considerable congestion problems, there are indicators that the Valletta Controlled Vehicular Access system has not been as successful as originally envisaged in reaching its objectives. This thesis therefore analyses the Valletta CVA system, and other proposed and implemented congestion <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> around Europe, to discern the common factors of successful and unsuccessful congestion <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> and their implications for transport policy. This therefore enables the construction of a practical framework for the implementation and operation of a successful congestion <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> in the Maltese context...|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} to meet the {{challenge}} to calculate the electronic structure and total energy of charged states of atoms and molecules adsorbed on ultrathin insulating films supported by a metallic substrate using density functional theory (DFT), we have developed a simplified new DFT scheme that only describes the electrostatic interaction of an external <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> with a metal surface. This purely electrostatic interaction is obtained from the assumption that the electron densities of the two fragments (<b>charged</b> <b>system</b> and metal surface) are non-overlapping and by neglecting non-local exchange-correlation effects such as the van der Waals interactions between the two fragments. In addition, the response of the metal surface to the electrostatic potential from the <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> is treated to linear order, whereas the <b>charged</b> <b>system</b> is treated fully within DFT. In particular, we consider the classical perfect conductor model for the metal response, although our formalism is not limited to this approximation. To test the computational implementation of this new scheme, we have considered the case of a Na+ cation interacting with a perfect conductor. The application of this new methodology to realistic problems involving <b>charged</b> <b>systems</b> adsorbed on insulating films supported by a metal surface are deferred to a separate following publication...|$|R
