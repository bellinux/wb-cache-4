5|$|Cyclone Sam (JTWC designation: 03S) was {{an intense}} {{tropical}} cyclone that brought flooding rainfall {{to a wide}} swath of northern Australia in December2000. The first tropical cyclone of the regional season, Sam originated from a tropical low that formed in the Arafura Sea on 28November. Tracking generally westward, the initial low-pressure area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea, by which time it had strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5December. Though a subtropical ridge was forcing the cyclone westward at the time, an approaching shortwave trough caused Sam to track southward the following day, towards the Australian coast. During its southward progression, Sam rapidly intensified, and reached its peak intensity on 8December. Soon afterwards, the storm made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at the same intensity. Once inland, <b>Sam</b> <b>was</b> slow to weaken as it re-curved eastward, and persisted for nearly a week inland before dissipating on 14December.|$|E
