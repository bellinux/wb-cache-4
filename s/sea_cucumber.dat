5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> is unharmed.|$|E
25|$|A more bizarre {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the slim, eel-shaped pinhead pearlfish and a particular species of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber.</b> The pearlfish enters the <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber</b> through its anus, and spends the day safely protected inside the seacucumbers alimentary tract.

40|$|Except for coastal dwellers, most Filipinos do {{not know}} what <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> are, {{although}} most must have dined on them at some time. A description is given of what <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> are and how they look, how they are processed and how they are cultured. <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> which belong to the families Holothuridae and Stichopodidae, have a worldwide distribution and are found in large numbers in the Indo-West Pacific region. In the Philippines, <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> have never been cultured, although {{it is one of the}} sources of dried <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> in the international market.

25|$|Other coastal {{resources}} such as cowrie and cuttlefish play a nominal role, and can be sustainably exploited at the present level. However, resources that can be cultured such as giant clams, <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber,</b> some species of aquarium fish, and turtles, have considerable potential.|$|E
25|$|Fish species {{found in}} the islands include many species of shark, ray, moray eel, bream, jack, grunt, scorpionfish, triggerfish, grouper, goby, and blenny.

25|$|In March 1911, the Commonwealth Naval Forces {{became the}} Royal Australian Navy and Gayundah was redesignated HMAS Gayundah. From 22 April to 25 August 1911, at the {{instigation}} of the Departments of External Affairs and Trade & Customs, Gayundah sailed {{under the command}} of Commander G.A.H. Curtis from Brisbane to Broome, Western Australia, to enforce Australia's territorial boundary and fishing zone along the north-west coast of the continent. At Scott Reef, on 25 May, Gayundah boarded and detained two Dutch schooners with illegal catches of trepang (<b>sea</b> <b>cucumber)</b> and trochus shell, and escorted them into Broome on 29 May. She remained at Broome until mid-July so the ship's officers could appear as witnesses in the resulting court case against the masters of the schooners. For this cruise, the 6-inch bow gun was removed to provide greater bunkering for coal and thereby increase the ship's range.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{are typically}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber.</b> A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims {{by means of a}} long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.|$|E
25|$|Together with <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> (Holothuroidea), {{they make}} up the subphylum Echinozoa, which is {{characterized}} by a globoid shape without arms or projecting rays. <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> and the irregular echinoids have secondarily evolved diverse shapes. Although many <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> have branched tentacles surrounding their oral openings, these have originated from modified tube feet and are not homologous to the arms of the crinoids, sea stars, and brittle stars.|$|R
50|$|Dactylochirotida is {{an order}} of {{primitive}} <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers.</b> Unlike other <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> their tentacles are not divided into multiple branches, and the body is enclosed within a flexible shell-like structure called a test.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> (Holothuroidea) {{are known}} to host ectocommensal animals but {{echinoderm}} epibionts have never been reported nor their effects on hosts appraised quantitatively. At one location in New Caledonia, we found {{a high number of}} ophiuroids (Ophiothela cf. danae) and synaptid <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> (Synaptula media and Synaptula sp.) living on the bumpy external body wall of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> Stichopus herrmanni. Rates of midday sediment defecation (mean: 23 g h− 1) and short-term displacements (mean: 60 cm h− 1) by the hosts were not significantly affected by the number of echinoderm commensals they carried. The frequent relationships at the location suggest that such facultative commensalism between echinoderms could be more common than previously understood. Appreciable numbers of scaleworms, crabs and shrimps on the <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> show that <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> can act as hosts to echinoderms and other epibiotic taxa, bolstering the notion that they play important ecological roles in reef ecosystems...|$|R
25|$|On March 7, 2012, Cameron {{took the}} Deepsea Challenger {{submersible}} {{to the bottom}} of the New Britain Trench in a five-mile-deep solo dive. On March 26, 2012, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor before returning to the surface. Cameron is the first person to accomplish the trip solo. He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009 and by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, who were the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960. Cameron has made a three-dimensional film of his dive. During his dive to the Challenger Deep, the data he collected resulted in interesting new finds in the field of marine biology, including new species of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber,</b> squid worm, and giant single-celled amoeba, which are exciting finds due to the harshness of the environment. Cameron is also one of the two men in history to stand on Challenger Deep.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (<b>sea</b> <b>cucumber).</b> After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
500|$|The most {{dramatic}} deterioration has {{been caused by}} biological factors. It used to be thought that {{the depths of the}} ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mid-1980s has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. During the 1991 IMAX expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around Titanic. A total of 28 species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail fish up to a yard (1 m) long. Much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers. Some of Titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; James Cameron's 2001 expedition discovered a previously unknown type of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber,</b> lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent [...] "portholes" [...] along its side. A newly discovered species of rust-eating bacterium found on the ship has been named Halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. Henrietta Mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the Titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as 2025. The Canadian geophysicist Steve Blasco has commented that the wreck [...] "has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert." [...] In mid 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue-Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [...] Halomonas titanicae to survive the osmotic pressure that causes salt water on their membranes. Analysis by Henrietta Mann and Bhavleen Kaur, both of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the University of Seville in Spain, has determined that the wreck of Titanic will not exist by 2037 and that preservation of Titanic is impossible. [...] "Unfortunately, because Titanic is 2.3 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. It is film which will preserve it for history now," [...] says Mann. [...] "It has already lasted for 100 years, but eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain {{on the bottom of the}} Atlantic... I think Titanic has maybe 15 or 20 years left. I don't think it will have too much longer than that." [...] Other scientists have estimated that Titanic will last no longer than 14 years, as of 2017.|$|E
30|$|The osmotic {{pressure}} of coelomic fluid, ion concentrations, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and histological structures were measured and performed after the <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> {{were exposed to}} different salinities stress.

30|$|Based on {{previous}} studies of sea cucumbers’ adaptation salinity, two extreme salinities were designed as the aimed salinities (18 and 40  psu) for observing physiological indexes variations (Fu et al. 2014). The <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> living in natural sea water were included as control group (32  psu). The number of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> for each treatment was 30. After being transferred to the pre-prepared seawater at 18 and 40  psu, three randomly selected <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> in each group were sampled at 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48  h, respectively. Three repeats were applied and above samples were used to measured physiological indexes. Meanwhile 30 <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> which used in histological structure analysis were divided into five groups according to different salinity conditions (18, 23, 27, 32 and 40  psu). Each tissue was dissected from three randomly selected <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> of each salinity group which acclimatized the ambient environment for at least 48  h.|$|R

2500|$|Buckland was {{a pioneer}} of zoöphagy: his {{favourite}} research was eating the animal kingdom. This habit he learnt from his father, whose residence, the Deanery, offered such rare delights as mice in batter, squirrel pie, horse's tongue and ostrich. After the [...] "Eland Dinner" [...] in 1859 at the London Tavern, organised by Richard Owen, Buckland set up the Acclimatization Society to further the search for new food.

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) {{are large}} and {{abundant}} members of marine benthic communities. Overexploitation worldwide has raised concern because they have important functions within ecosystems. The ecological roles of commercially exploited <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> (Aspidochirotida and Dendrochirotida) are reviewed here, focusing on recent literature. Of the more than 70 species commercially exploited, at least 12 regularly bury into sand and mud, playing major roles in bioturbation. Most aspidochirotids are deposit-feeders, reducing the organic load and redistributing surface sediments, making them bioremediators for coastal mariculture. <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> excrete inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, enhancing the productivity of benthic biota. This form of nutrient recycling is crucial in ecosystems in oligotrophic waters such as coral reefs. Feeding and excretion by <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> also act to increase seawater alkalinity which contributes to local buffering of ocean acidification. <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> host more than 200 species of parasitic and commensal symbionts from seven phyla, thereby enhancing ecosystem biodiversity. They are preyed on by many taxa, thereby transferring animal tissue and nutrients (derived from detritus and microalgae) to higher trophic levels. Overexploitation of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> is likely to decrease sediment health, reduce nutrient recycling and potential benefits of deposit-feeding to seawater chemistry, diminish biodiversity of associated symbionts, and reduce the transfer of organic matter from detritus to higher trophic levels. Ecosystem-based fisheries management needs to consider the importance of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> in marine ecosystems and implement regulatory measures to safeguard their ecological roles...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bioturbators affect {{multiple}} biogeochemical {{interactions and}} have been suggested as suitable candidates to mitigate organic matter loading in marine sediments. However, predicting the effects of bioturbators at an ecosystem level can be difficult due to their complex positive and negative interactions with the microbial community. Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified the effects of deposit-feeding <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> on benthic algal biomass (microphytobenthos, MPB), bacterial abundance, and the sediment–seawater exchange of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. The <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> increased the efflux of inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, NH 4 +) from organically enriched sediments, which stimulated algal productivity. Grazing by the <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> on MPB (evidenced by pheopigments), however, caused a net negative effect on primary producer biomass and total oxygen production. Further, there was an increased abundance of bacteria in sediment with <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> suggesting facilitation. The <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> increased the ratio of oxygen consumption to production in surface sediment by shifting the microbial balance from producers to decomposers. This shift explains the increased efflux of inorganic nitrogen and concordant reduction in organic matter content in sediment with bioturbators. Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrates the functional role and potential of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> to ameliorate some of the adverse effects of organic matter enrichment in coastal ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> {{belonging}} to the class Holothuroidea, are marine invertebrates, habitually found in the benthic areas and deep seas across the world. They have high commercial value coupled with increasing global production and trade. <b>Sea</b> <b>cucumbers,</b> informally named as bêche-de-mer, or gamat, have long been used for food and folk medicine in the communities of Asia and Middle East. Nutritionally, <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> have an impressive profile of valuable nutrients such as Vitamin A, Vitamin B 1 (thiamine), Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B 3 (niacin), and minerals, especially calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc. A number of unique biological and pharmacological activities including anti-angiogenic, anticancer, anticoagulant, anti-hypertension, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antithrombotic, antitumor and wound healing have been ascribed to various species of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers.</b> Therapeutic properties and medicinal benefits of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> {{can be linked to}} the presence of a wide array of bioactives especially triterpene glycosides (saponins), chondroitin sulfates, glycosaminoglycan (GAGs), sulfated polysaccharides, sterols (glycosides and sulfates), phenolics, cerberosides, lectins, peptides, glycoprotein, glycosphingolipids and essential fatty acids. This review is mainly designed to cover the high-value components and bioactives as well as the multiple biological and therapeutic properties of <b>sea</b> <b>cucumbers</b> with regard to exploring their potential uses for functional foods and nutraceuticals...|$|R
2500|$|The {{seafloor}} {{was visited}} {{for the first}} time by a robotic vehicle in 2012.The most conspicuous aspect of the footage was the swarm of benthic amphipods. Some of these amphipods were collected by bait bags attached to the vehicle and were brought to the surface for further analysis. The samples recovered were Scopelocherius schellenbergi, a species of lysianassoid amphipod that have so far only been found in ultradeep trenches in the Pacific. Two invertebrate creatures were also observed in the video. One soft dark individual, estimated to be 10-20 centimeters long, has been identified by Dr. Stace E. Beaulieu of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a <b>sea</b> <b>cucumber,</b> tentatively assigned to genus Peniagone. The other individual, a small crustacean, is tentatively identified as a munnposid isopod, based on morphology and similar walking and jumping movements observed for other hadal munnopsid isopods. Because these individual were not collected, {{it is not possible to}} obtain species-level identifications. However, these sightings likely exceed the deepest known records for genus Peniagone and family Munnopsidae.|$|E
