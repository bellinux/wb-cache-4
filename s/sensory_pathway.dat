25|$|In {{central nervous}} system not all bHLH genes are {{involved}} in neurogenesis because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) {{is essential to the}} development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the proprioceptive <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway.</b> Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. Neurogenesis in the {{central nervous system}} depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the lateral inhibition process (see lateral inhibition). In the absence of Lateral inhibition some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron-specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network have an important role in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse.|$|E

We present a {{detailed}} computational model of interacting neuronal populations that mimic the hatchling Xenopus tadpole nervous system. The model includes four <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> integrators of <b>sensory</b> information, and a {{central pattern generator}} (CPG) network. <b>Sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> of different modalities receive inputs from an “environment”; these inputs are then processed and integrated to select the most appropriate locomotor action. The CPG populations execute the selected action, generating output in motor neuron populations. Thus, the model describes a detailed and biologically plausible chain of information processing from external signals to sensors, <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> integration and decision-making, action selection and execution and finally, generation of appropriate motor activity and behaviour. We show how the model produces appropriate behaviours {{in response to a}} selected scenario, which consists of a sequence of “environmental” signals. These behaviours might be relatively complex due to noisy <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> and the possibility of spontaneous actions. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Somatosensory {{organization}} {{is divided into}} the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract (the touch/proprioception/vibration <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway)</b> and the anterolateral system, or ALS (the pain/temperature <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway).</b> Both sensory pathways use three different neurons to get information from sensory receptors at the periphery to the cerebral cortex. These neurons are designated primary, secondary and tertiary sensory neurons. In both pathways, primary sensory neuron cell bodies {{are found in the}} dorsal root ganglia, and their central axons project into the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|Corollary {{discharge}} {{is characterized}} as an efference copy {{of an action}} command used to inhibit any response to the self generated sensory signal which would interfere with {{the execution of the}} motor task. The inhibitory commands originate {{at the same time as}} the motor command and target the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> that would report any reafference to higher levels of the CNS. This is unique from the efference copy, since the corollary discharge is actually fed into the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> to cancel out the reafferent signals generated by the movement. Alternatively, corollary discharges briefly alters self-generated sensory responses to reduce self-induced desensitization or help distinguish between self-generated and externally generated sensory information.|$|E

40|$|Electrophysiological and {{histological}} {{techniques were}} used to trace <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> for stretch mechanoreceptor fibres from the distal colon to dorsal root ganglia. Extracellular and intracellular recording techniques revealed <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> for mechanoreceptors to the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia but no further centrally. Histological studies involving the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase revealed <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> from the distal colon to the spinal cord, mainly {{to the level of}} the second lumbar vertebra. Few (less than 2000) fibres were involved; their perikarya were small (ca. 25 micron). Sensory perikarya in spinal ganglia in the guinea-pig could be categorized into two populations, F and H cells, after a previously defined nomenclature for murine spinal ganglion cells. F and H cells were distinguished initially by their times to decay by 50 % of the action potential. H cells took three times as long to repolarize. F and H cells were distinguished further by their electrical properties including membrane potential, input resistance and amplitude and duration of the after-potential following the action potential. Both F and H cells showed unusual time-dependent rectification following either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulses. Threshold currents to show rectification were different for F and H cells. When taken in conjunction with conduction velocities, the electrophysiological evidence may assist in identifying sensory neurones. For example, H cells appeared to have slow conducting (C fibre) axons. From the lack of electrophysiological evidence and limited histological support for major central <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways,</b> it is concluded that stretch mechanoreceptor information from the colon of the guinea-pig is referred mainly to the prevertebral ganglia with minimal involvement of the spinal cord...|$|R

However, these fish display corollary discharges that inhibit the ascending <b>sensory</b> <b>pathway</b> at the first CNS relay point.

40|$|Overview. Neurophysiologic {{methods are}} {{used to assess the}} {{functional}} status of the CNS and are important adjuncts to the clinical examination. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records spontaneous electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. Visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials probe the <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> in the spinal cord, brainstem, subcortical regions, or cerebral cortex. Information concerning motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways</b> in these regions is provided by brainstem reflexes (blink, acoustic, and oculographic). Spinal cord and spinal root function is assessed via somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Somatic reflex studies provide motor and sensory information about specific segments in the arm (C 6) and leg (S 1). Needle EMG is an established method for providing clinically useful and segmentally specific information in radicular disease affecting arms and legs. The major limitation of EMG, however, is that this technique evaluates only the motor component of radicular function and many patients with radiculopathy only exhibit sensory complaints. SEPs are typically elicited by stimulating mixed nerves (median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal) to assess <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways.</b> Therefore, the application of standard SEPs to study radicular disease is necessarily limited to investigating the lumbar and cervical regions because of the limited number of sites to stimulate.

40|$|Serine proteases are {{considered}} to be involved in plasticity-related events in the nervous system, but their in vivo targets and the importance of their control by endogenous inhibitors are still not clarified. Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of a potent serine protease inhibitor, protease nexin- 1 (PN- 1), in the regulation of activity-dependent brain proteolytic activity and the functioning of <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways.</b> Neuronal activity regulates the expression of PN- 1, which in turn controls brain proteolytic activity. In PN- 1 -/- mice, absence of PN- 1 leads to increased brain proteolytic activity, which is correlated with an activity-dependent decrease in the NR 1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Correspondingly, reduced NMDA receptor signaling is detected in their barrel cortex. This is coupled to decreased sensory evoked potentials in the barrel cortex and impaired whisker-dependent sensory motor function. Thus, a tight control of serine protease activity is critical for the in vivo function of the NMDA receptors and the proper function of <b>sensory</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
