25|$|The <b>Spallation</b> <b>Neutron</b> Source (SNS) is a {{particle}} accelerator {{that has the}} highest intensity neutron pulses of any man-made neutron source. SNS was made operational in 2006 and has since been upgraded to 1megawatts with plans to continue up to 3megawatts. High power neutron pulses permit clearer images of the targets meaning smaller samples can be analysed and accurate results require fewer pulses.|$|E
25|$|The {{laboratory}} is home {{to several}} of the world's top supercomputers including the world's fourth most powerful supercomputer ranked by the TOP500, Titan, and is a leading neutron science and nuclear energy research facility that includes the <b>Spallation</b> <b>Neutron</b> Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor. ORNL hosts the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, the BioEnergy Science Center, and the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light-Water Reactors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and the <b>Spallation</b> <b>Neutron</b> Source. HFIR {{provides}} neutrons {{in a stable}} beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are particle accelerators. HFIR went critical in 1965 and {{has been used for}} materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. As part of a US non-proliferation effort the HFIR is scheduled to switch from highly enriched uranium (>90%, weapons grade) to low-enriched (3–4%) in 2020; the last reactor in the US to do so. Berkelium used to produce the world's first sample of tennessine was produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.|$|E

High-energy protons (100 MeV) obtained from the fixed field alternating gradient accelerator are injected onto a tungsten target, whereby the <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons</b> are generated. For neutronic characteristics of <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons,</b> the reaction rates and the continuous energy distribution of <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons</b> are measured by the foil activation method and by an organic liquid scintillator, respectively. Numerical calculations are executed by MCNPX with JENDL/HE- 2007 and ENDF/B-VI libraries to evaluate the reaction rates of activation foils (bismuth and indium) set at the target and the continuous energy distribution of <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons</b> set {{in front of the}} target. For the reaction rates by the foil activation method, the C/E values between the experiments and the calculations are found around a relative difference of 10 %, except for some reactions.

50|$|An accelerator-driven {{subcritical}} reactor is {{a nuclear}} reactor design formed by coupling a substantially subcritical nuclear reactor core with a high-energy proton accelerator. It would use thorium as a fuel, which is more abundant than uranium. The neutrons needed for sustaining the fission process would be provided by a particle accelerator producing <b>neutrons</b> by <b>spallation.</b> These <b>neutrons</b> activate the thorium, enabling fission without needing to make the reactor critical. One benefit of such reactors is the relatively short half-lives of their waste products. The high energy proton beam impacts a molten lead target inside the core, chipping or “spallating” neutrons from the lead nuclei. These <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons</b> convert fertile thorium to fissile uranium-233 and drive the fission reaction in the uranium.|$|R

50|$|Most current ADS designs {{propose a}} high-intensity proton {{accelerator}} with an energy of about 1 GeV, directed towards a spallation target or <b>spallation</b> <b>neutron</b> source. The source {{located in the}} heart of the reactor core contains liquid metal which is impacted by the beam, thus releasing neutrons and is cooled by circulating the liquid metal such as lead-bismuth towards a heat exchanger. The nuclear reactor core surrounding the <b>spallation</b> <b>neutron</b> source contains the fuel rods, the fuel being preferably Thorium. Thereby, for each proton intersecting the spallation target, an average of 20 neutrons is released which fission the surrounding fissile part of the fuel and enrich the fertile part. The neutron balance can be regulated or indeed shut off by adjusting the accelerator power so that the reactor would be below criticality. The additional neutrons provided by the <b>spallation</b> <b>neutron</b> source provide the degree of control as do the delayed neutrons in a conventional nuclear reactor, the difference being that <b>spallation</b> <b>neutron</b> source-driven neutrons are easily controlled by the accelerator. The main advantage is inherent safety. A conventional nuclear reactor's nuclear fuel possesses self-regulating properties such as the Doppler effect or void effect, which make these nuclear reactors safe. In addition to these physical properties of conventional reactors, in the subcritical reactor, whenever the neutron source is turned off, the fission reaction ceases and only the decay heat remains.|$|E

40|$|Accelerator driven transmuters use {{a buffer}} region {{to protect the}} {{structural}} and the cladding materials of the transmuter from the radiation damage caused by the high-energy <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons,</b> to accommodate the coolant channels of the self cooled targets, and to have an insignificant effect on the neutron utilization for the transmutation process. These functions are contradicting {{with respect to the}} buffer thickness. An extension of the target region in the axial direction (the proton beam direction) is also required to act as a neutron multiplier for the forward component of the high-energy <b>spallation</b> <b>neutrons</b> and a reflector to minimize the neutron leakage. The buffer assessment was performed as a function of its thickness with different proton energies for a self-cooled Lead-Bismuth Eutectic and a sodium-cooled tungsten targets. The analyses show that the number of generated neutrons per proton has a low sensitivity to the buffer thickness. However, the number of neutrons reaching the transmuter is significantly reduced as the buffer thickness is increased.
