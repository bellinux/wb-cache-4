5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).|$|E
5|$|The two armies met on {{opposite}} {{banks of the}} River Bug. Yaroslav's forces may have taken position with archers covering the crossing points. Bolesław <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> his time, allowing his army to rest, and started work on makeshift bridges. The Battle of the River Bug finally occurred around July 23.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660, he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle. The King announced that the castle's artillery {{would be sent to}} Cowes, unless the town of Yarmouth agreed to take over the financial responsibility of running the site themselves. The town declined to do so, but Charles repeated the offer in 1666; this time Yarmouth <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> action, appointing four soldiers for a garrison, although the town did not assign an officer to command them, or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle.|$|E

5|$|Marriage {{negotiations}} {{constituted a}} key element in Elizabeth's foreign policy. She turned down Philip's own hand early in 1559 but for several years entertained the proposal of King Eric XIV of Sweden. For several years she also seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Archduke Charles of Austria. By 1569, relations with the Habsburgs had deteriorated, and Elizabeth considered marriage to two French Valois princes in turn, first Henry, Duke of Anjou, and later, from 1572 to 1581, his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, formerly Duke of Alençon. This last proposal was tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the Southern Netherlands. Elizabeth <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the courtship seriously for a time, and wore a frog-shaped earring that Anjou had sent her.|$|E
5|$|When David's brother Alexander I died in 1124, David chose, {{with the}} backing of Henry I, to take the Kingdom of Scotland (Alba) for himself. He was forced to engage in warfare against his rival and nephew, Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair. Subduing the latter <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> David ten years, a {{struggle}} that involved the destruction of Óengus, Mormaer of Moray. David's victory allowed expansion of control over more distant regions theoretically part of his Kingdom. After the death of his former patron Henry I, David supported the claims of Henry's daughter and his own niece, Empress Matilda, to the throne of England. In the process, he came into conflict with King Stephen and was able to expand his power in northern England, despite his defeat at the Battle of the Standard in 1138.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 827, {{the allied}} fleets sailed from the Bay of Sousse, and {{after three days}} they reached Mazara in southwestern Sicily, where they landed. There they were met with {{soldiers}} loyal to Euphemius, but the alliance soon began to show rifts: a Muslim detachment mistook some of Euphemius' partisans for loyalist troops, and a skirmish ensued. Although Euphemius' troops were ordered to place a twig on their helmets as a distinctive mark, Asad announced his intention to wage the campaign without them. Soon after that, Balata, who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> over the functions, if not the title, of the imperial strategos on the island, appeared nearby with a Byzantine force. The two armies clashed on a plain south-east of Mazara, where Asad's men, after exhortations by their leader, gained a victory. Balata retreated first to Enna {{and from there to}} Calabria on the Italian mainland, where he may have hoped to gather more troops. Instead, he died there shortly after his arrival.|$|E

25|$|Pumpkin {{juice is}} a cold drink favoured by the Wizarding world, and among the {{students}} at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is drunk at any occasion, such as breakfast, lunch, at feasts or on other occasions. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> on the same role that orange juice has to Muggles.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the Wilson Foundation {{made use}} of {{newspaper}} advertising and planned a fundraising canvas in connection with its January 1922 endowment drive. Rather than a door-to-door drive, this canvas <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the form of volunteers from various organizations, frequently women, operating fundraising tables at banks, drug stores, and other well-trafficked places.|$|E
25|$|By birth Jeanne was {{connected}} to Clan Forbes. The marriage <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place {{a few years before}} Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken away to be raised protestant. These events {{may or may not have}} something to do with the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I.|$|E
25|$|Another NH {{interests}} company, the Westchester Northern Railroad (WN), was chartered in 1910 {{to build}} a northward extension of the NYW from White Plains to Pound Ridge, with one branch to Danbury, Connecticut and one to Brewster, New York. The NYW White Plains terminal was built with this extension in mind. The WN was consolidated with the NYW on June 8, 1915. Most activity was limited to acquiring real estate for the right of way, on which no significant construction <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place. The WN project was officially cancelled by 1925 and the property gradually sold off.|$|E

25|$|The Bromleys had {{property}} at Sheriffhales, a parish then divided between Shropshire and Staffordshire, and Sir Edward {{had left a}} small sum for the poor of the parish. Lady Margaret settled at Sheriffhales after his death and it became her base {{for the support of}} Puritan ministers. Her presence locally is first noted in the parish register in 1630, when her servant Robert Cowper died. She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> steps to manage and invest her wealth. In 1636, for example, she leased a meadow at Worfield from a consortium of businessmen: William Whitmore, George Whitmore and John Weld of Willey.|$|E
25|$|When he was 15, {{a case of}} measles left young Hal {{with what}} doctors {{believed}} to be an early case of tuberculosis. His divorced mother moved with Hal and two brothers to {{the country for a}} year, {{while the rest of the}} family lived with his father in Philadelphia and attended school there. While his mother raced off to Wilmington every week to speak and organize literature sales, she being the Delaware state organizer for the Socialist Party, Hal <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> fondly to rural life. Although he would return to school in the big city the following year, his orientation towards the countryside was firmly established.|$|E
25|$|On 25 November 1661, the Pension or {{governing}} council ordered that Wolryche {{be called to}} the bar, {{as part of a}} large batch of students, on condition that he deposit £4 as surety for performing his bar moot. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> chambers at his Inn: he was listed as occupying a room on the third storey of Cage's Buildings in 1668. In 1670 he received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University. In 1676 he was appointed recorder of Bridgnorth – a post he held until his death. On 26 November 1680 the Pension of Gray's Inn admitted him to the Grand Company of Ancients, its body of most learned and experienced members.|$|E
