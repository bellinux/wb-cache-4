40|$|Tight blood {{pressure}} control decreases apoptosis during renal damage. BackgroundAn excess rate of apoptosis {{could lead to}} the gradual loss of renal mass. In this study, we investigated the role of apoptosis in the renal damage secondary to hypertension. MethodsSpontaneously hypertensive rats with 5 / 6 renal mass reduction (<b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy) were distributed to receive no-treatment, 200 mg/L quinapril, 360 mg/L losartan, or triple therapy (200 mg/L hydralazine, 4 mg/L reserpine, and 100 mg/L hydrochlorothiazide) for 5 weeks. Sham-operated spontaneously hypertensive rats served as controls. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, with or without <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy, were also studied. ResultsNontreated spontaneously hypertensive rats + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy developed proteinuria, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial lesions. In comparison to spontaneously hypertensive rats, an increment in the number of [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ]-positive and apoptotic [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) -mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) ]-positive tubular and glomerular cells was observed. By contrast, WKY + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy rats showed less severe morphologic lesions, and only the number of proliferating cells increased. By Western blot, an up-regulation of renal Bax (apoptosis inducer) was noted both in spontaneously hypertensive rats + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy and WKY + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy rats. By contrast, Bcl-xL (apoptosis protector) was up-regulated in WKY + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy rats but not in spontaneously hypertensive rats + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy. The administration of appropriate doses of quinapril, losartan, or triple therapy to spontaneously hypertensive rats + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy normalized systolic {{blood pressure}}, partially prevented proteinuria, renal lesions and apoptosis, and decreased Bax, but no changes were noted in Bcl-xL. The Bax/Bcl-xL index was significantly increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats + <b>subtotal</b> nephrectomy compared to sham-operated spontaneously hypertensive rats and decreased in treated groups. ConclusionThe combination of renal mass reduction and hypertension caused severe renal lesions associated to an increment of apoptosis rate, mainly in tubular epithelial cells. Tight blood pressure control decreased the apoptosis rate and morphologic lesions. These studies suggest that changes in the expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes contribute to the progressive damage in hypertensive rats with renal mass reduction...|$|R

40|$|Lynch {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant disorder and {{is characterized by}} a life-time risk to develop colorectal carcinoma (CRC) of approximately 80 %. Mutation carriers are advised to participate in intensive colonoscopic surveillance programs. The aim of these programs is to detect and remove adenomatous polyps, the premalignant lesions of CRC. If CRC is detected while under surveillance in a patient under the age of 60 years a <b>subtotal</b> colectomy is advised because of the high risk of a metachronous CRC after partial colectomy. <b>Subtotal</b> colectomy reduces this risk and subsequently leads to a higher life expectancy. When CRC is detected above the age of 60, partial colectomy is probably justified because of the lower risk of developing metachronous neoplasia during the remaining life. Moreover, in a patient over 60 years a <b>subtotal</b> colectomy more often causes fecal incontinence. 	To date there are no studies that examined the quality of life (QoL) and functional outcome after both types of surgery in patients with the Lynch syndrome. The question whether QoL differs between partial and <b>subtotal</b> colectomy is becoming more important because of diminishing risks to develop CRC under surveillance. If there is a substantial difference in QoL between both procedures the advice to perform a <b>subtotal</b> colectomy might be revised. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate QoL after partial colectomy and <b>subtotal</b> colectomy in patients with the Lynch syndrome. Methods 	Two questionnaires about QoL (SF- 36 and EORTC QLQ CR- 38) and a questionnaire about functional outcome (COREFO) were send to 168 operated patients with the Lynch syndrome. Surveillance reports were reviewed on development of metachronous CRC. Results 	The response rate was 70, 24 %. None of the scales of the SF- 36 showed a significant difference between both groups. The EORTC QLQ CR- 38 presented more problems with defecation after <b>subtotal</b> colectomy (p= 0, 012). Analysis of the COREFO revealed that after <b>subtotal</b> colectomy patients have a significant higher frequency of defecation compared to patients who underwent a partial colectomy. The 10 years cumulative risk of developing a metachronous CRC was 12, 8 % after partial colectomy compared to 0 % after <b>subtotal</b> colectomy. Conclusions 	Although the stool frequency is higher after <b>subtotal</b> colectomy compared to partial colectomy, QoL does not differ between both types of surgery in patients with the Lynch syndrome. The risk of developing metachronous CRC after surgery is substantially lower after a <b>subtotal</b> colectomy. Therefore, for young patients that develop a CRC under surveillance a <b>subtotal</b> colectomy should be recommended. Patients need to be informed about possible differences in functional outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Ultrasonographic {{discrimination}} of <b>subtotal</b> stenosis from occlusion of {{the internal}} carotid artery (ACI) is frequently extremely complicated. Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3 D US) is more reliable than color duplex ultrasonography. However, due to possible errors {{in the evaluation of}} <b>subtotal</b> stenosis and occlusion, 3 D US should be complemented either by three-dimensional CT angiography (3 D CTA) or classic angiography. Correct evaluation is extremely important for operative treatment of <b>subtotal</b> stenosis. Methods. In 22 patients, 3 D US revealed occlusion of the ACI and in 11 patients <b>subtotal</b> stenosis. In all cases, the ultrasonographic findings were compared with 3 D CTA findings, in 8 cases also with those of conventional angiography. Results. In two patients, 3 D US evaluated the blockage as an occlusion while 3 D CTA as well as angiography showed it to be a <b>subtotal</b> stenosis. In one patient, lumen reduction was so marked that it was not revealed by 3 D CTA but only by angiography. In another case, the filiform ACI stenosis was covered by a distinct acoustic shadow of calcinated plaque. When compared, the remaining findings showed no significant differences. Conclusions. It is our opinion that 3 D US is a good screening diagnostic method for diagnosing <b>subtotal</b> stenosis and occlusion of the ACI. However, owing to possible errors, it should be combined with 3 D CTA or classic angiography. A precise evaluation is very important as <b>subtotal</b> ACI stenosis requires early operative treatment while ACI occlusion only requires conservative treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Prior work {{documented}} that surgical removal of approximately 70 % of the bladder (<b>subtotal</b> cystectomy) in 12 -week-old female rats induced complete functional regeneration of the bladder within 8 weeks. To determine whether animal age affects bladder regeneration, female F 344 rats aged 12 weeks (young) and 12 months (old) underwent <b>subtotal</b> cystectomy, {{and then were}} evaluated from 1 to 26 weeks after <b>subtotal</b> cystectomy. At 26 weeks after <b>subtotal</b> cystectomy, bladder capacity in young animals was indistinguishable from that in age-matched controls, but bladder capacity in old animals was only approximately 56 % of that in age-matched controls. There was no detectable difference in residual volume among treatment groups, but the diminished regeneration in old animals {{was associated with a}} corresponding increase in the ratio of residual volume to micturition volume. The majority of old animals exhibited evidence of chronic kidney damage after <b>subtotal</b> cystectomy. Maximal contraction of bladder strips to electrical field stimulation, as well as activation with carbachol, phenylephrine, and KCl, were lower in old than in young animals at 26 weeks after <b>subtotal</b> cystectomy. Immunostaining with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Von Willebrand factor revealed delayed and/or diminished proliferative and angiogenic responses, respectively, in old animals.

40|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of Basedow's disease {{is the most}} rapid and effective therapeutic approach to obtain the long-term remission of disease. Controversy persists regarding the choice of total or <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy. The authors report their experience in 38 cases of Basedow's disease undergoing surgery, of which 20 were treated with total thyroidectomy and 18 with <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy. No hemorrhages, wound infections, recurrent lesions, or definitive hypoparathyroidism were observed {{in the two groups}} of patients. Those patients undergoing <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy reported a 44. 5 % incidence of hypothyroidism. In particular, hypothyroidism was clinically manifest in 16. 7 % of cases and subclinical in 27. 8 %, namely only revealed by the assay of thyroid hormones.

On the basis of these results and owing to the high incidence of hypothyroidism and the relatively high percentage of recurrent hyperthyroidism after <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy, the authors conclude that total thyroidectomy may be considered the {{surgical treatment}} of choice in Basedow's disease in that there were no major complications following this type of surgery compared to <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo avoid asplenic state, many {{approaches}} {{preserving the}} spleen {{have been proposed}} in the literature: splenorraphy, partial splenectomy with or without preservation of hilar vessels and splenic tissue auto-implants. <b>Subtotal</b> splenectomy, preserving the upper spleen pole nourished only by splenogastric vessels is an alternative when the splenic pedicle must be ligated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of partial, <b>subtotal</b> and total splenectomies on the distribution of Escherichia coli in the mononuclear phagocytic system. MethodThirty-two rats divided into four groups were studied: sham operation (total spleen preservation), partial splenectomy, <b>subtotal</b> splenectomy and total splenectomy. Five weeks after surgeries, an aliquot of E. coli marked with tecnetium- 99 m was injected intravenously. The animals were killed 20 min later and the spleen, lungs and liver were removed in order to determine the distribution of labeled bacteria. ResultsThe amount of E. coli in the splenic tissue was greater in the intact spleen group than in the partial or <b>subtotal</b> splenectomy groups. Phagocytosis through the spleen did not differ between the partial and <b>subtotal</b> splenectomy groups. The amount of bacteria in the lungs was greater in the partial than in the <b>subtotal</b> splenectomy group. The distribution of labeled bacteria was greater in the liver of animals submitted to <b>subtotal</b> splenectomy than in the other groups. ConclusionThe upper splenic pole, supplied only by splenogastric vessels, has the ability to remove live bacteria from the blood stream, showing that effective blood clearance occurs even without vascularization through the splenic pedicle.
