25|$|Increasing {{levels of}} the <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> {{cortisol}} late in sleep (often during REM sleep) causes this decreased communication. One stage of memory consolidation is the linking of distant but related memories.

These include the physiologic <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> cortisol and commonly used medicines for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or connective tissue disorders. Other steroid hormones and drugs are also implicated. In contrast, the thyroid hormone decreases cholesterol production. Hence, hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone) causes hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

In turbulence, repeated downward movements of the plane trigger one release of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> after another. A build-up of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> can cause a person to be terrified despite having every reason to know logically that the plane is not in danger. In such cases, therapy — in addition to education — is needed to prevent the release of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> so that the anxious flier may gain relief.|$|R

For example, sodium salicylate {{has been found to}} suppress proliferation of lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate, breast, and melanoma human cancer cells. Jasmonic acid, a plant <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> that belongs to the jasmonate family, induced death in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Methyl jasmonate has been found to induce cell death in a number of cancer cell lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{limbic system}} can also {{significantly}} impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, {{it is not}} unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.|$|E
30|$|Research {{from both}} the human and animal literatures {{converge}} {{in support of the}} notion that <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> play a role in solidifying memory of material learned just prior to the arousal induction. For example, when rats were administered <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> after a training phase, they subsequently exhibited enhanced memory for their training; however, when the <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> were blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists, their behavior indicated impaired memory compared to counterparts who received <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> without beta-adrenergic antagonists (Liang, Juler, & McGaugh, 1986). In another study, rats who had access to a running wheel immediately after extinction training (following fear conditioning) exhibited lower freezing behavior when re-exposed to the fear-conditioned context (Siette, Reichelt, & Westbrook, 2014). Similarly, when human participants were intravenously administered doses of epinephrine immediately after viewing a series of pictures, they freely recalled more items a week later than did those participants who were injected with saline instead (Cahill & Alkire, 2003). Because the administration of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> occurred after learning, their impact could not be attributed to changes in motivation, emotion, or attention during encoding. Notably, the impact of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> on memory consolidation is not uniform across all individuals: a growing number of studies have documented sex differences in the modulatory impact of stress on memory (e.g., Andreano, Arjomandi, & Cahill, 2008; Andreano & Cahill, 2006; Felmingham, Fong, & Bryant, 2012; Jackson et al., 2005; Nielsen, Segal, Worden, Yim, & Cahill, 2013; Wolf et al, 2001).|$|R
40|$|Stress {{levels in}} {{wildlife}} species are an accurate indicator of an animal’s well-being and can reflect decreases in habitat quality. Stress levels {{can be measured}} {{by the presence of}} the <b>stress</b> response <b>hormones</b> cortisol, cortisone, and corticosterone. Analysis of these <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> in fecal samples has been widely used because feces can be easily obtained and non-invasively collected in the field. Methods of detecting stress levels from fecal samples of wildlife species are currently limited to enzyme immunoassay testing. This method uses antibodies to bind to target <b>stress</b> <b>hormones.</b> However, immunoassay testing can be time consuming and very expensive 2. We propose that Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) offers a new method to quantify levels of the <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> from fecal samples that is less expensive and time consuming than traditional immunoassays 1. As part of the Idaho Science Talent Expansion Program (STEP), we are developing a simple, accurate, and relatively inexpensive method to detect <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> in fecal samples from free-ranging pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) and sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) using LC-MS/MS...|$|R

25|$|Akil {{continued}} {{research in}} the area of opioid peptides and their receptors at the University of Michigan Mental Health Research Institute where she was employed as a basic scientist. Her group combined their research efforts with those of her husband, who was also employed at the University of Michigan as a biological psychiatrist. After characterizing the anatomy of four opioid peptides, beta-endorphin, dynorphin, methionine enkephalin, and leucine enkephalin, and their receptors, the two groups cloned two types of receptors and performed structure-function analyses in order to determine the molecular basis of high affinity and selectivity towards endogenous ligands. Over the years the two laboratories have conducted extensive research in a variety of molecular and neural mechanisms associated with stress reactivity and their relation to anxiety and depression, focusing on the link of opioids and their receptors in stress induced analgesia as well as the role of steroid <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> receptors in emotionality. Furthermore, Akil and Watson were the first to demonstrate that there is an abnormal, decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoid fast feedback that occurs at the level of the brain, rather than the pituitary in depressed patients.|$|E
500|$|Many breeders take {{a variety}} of {{preventive}} measures to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a <b>stress</b> <b>hormone,</b> in amounts that may indicate welfare problems. [...] Excessive stress can compromise the immune system. [...] "Shipping fever" [...] (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur {{as a result of}} stress, notably during transport and (or) handling. [...] Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria. [...] Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management. [...] Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present thesis was to {{study the effects of}} <b>stress</b> and <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> on the {{retrieval}} of emotional memories in healthy humans. In addition, we were interested in the effects of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> on post-retrieval processes like reconsolidation. That is, are there only acute and temporary effects of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> on memory retrieval, or are there also long-term effects? Studying effects of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> can be done in two ways; either by (experimentally) inducing stress in humans, or by exogenously administering doses of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones.</b> In the present thesis both ways were used. Furthermore, when investigating emotional memories, we can make use of memories that are created in a laboratory setting or those that derive from real life experiences, i. e. autobiographical memories. Again, both methods were investigated. We found acute stress and a single cortisol administration to have direct and long-term impairing effects on memory for neutral and emotional information that was learned and reactivated in a controlled laboratory situation. Future studies should shed more light on the generalizability of these findings to real life settings and clinical practice. Promotores: Ph. Spinhoven, W. T. A. M. Everaerd, Co-promotor: B. M.

2500|$|The {{effect of}} AAS on muscle mass is caused {{in at least}} two ways: first, they {{increase}} the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of <b>stress</b> <b>hormone</b> cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. AAS can also decrease fat by increasing basal metabolic rate (BMR), since an increase in muscle mass increases BMR.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Sapolsky has {{extensively}} studied baboons {{in their}} natural environment in the Serengeti in Africa. He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans. They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs leaving them with time to develop their social network. In primates mental stresses {{show up in the}} body. Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that overtime can make them sick. Sapolsky observed the baboon's ranks, personalities and social affiliations then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (<b>stress</b> <b>hormone)</b> levels of the baboons then matched social position to cortisol levels. Most of the data have been collected from male baboons because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant. [...] Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels; friendships, perspective and rank. [...] Baboons that played with infants and cultivated friendships, could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell {{if they were going to}} win or lose, and were top ranking had lower levels of cortisol. Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels. [...] Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both. Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease sex drive, effect sleeping patterns and elevate blood pressure but it can also stimulate and motivate. When animals experience stress they are generally more alert than when they are not stressed. It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments. [...] Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by and inverted U-shape graph. [...] According to the Yerkes-Dodson Law performance increases as does cognitive arousal but only to a certain point. The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance but to a certain point. [...] When stress becomes too great performance and efficiency decline. Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects. Rats that were exposed to human handling (stressful situation) had finely tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled. In short stress can be adaptive. The more exposure to stressful situations the better the rat can handle that situation.|$|E

All patients were adults aged between 18 and 45 years, ASA I and II with epidural anaesthesia for a surgical procedure.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{catecholamine}} <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> and inotropes {{to stimulate the}} growth of infectious bacteria is now well established. A major element of the growth induction process {{has been shown to}} involve the catecholamines binding to the high-affinity ferric-iron-binding proteins transferrin (Tf) and lactoferrin, which then enables bacterial acquisition of normally inaccessible sequestered host iron. The nature of the mechanism(s) by which the <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> perturb iron binding of these key innate immune defense proteins has not been fully elucidated. The present study employed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemical iron-binding analyses to demonstrate that catecholamine <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> form direct complexes with the ferric iron within transferrin and lactoferrin. Moreover, these complexes were shown to result in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the loss of protein-complexed iron. The use of bacterial ferric iron uptake mutants further showed that both the Fe(II) and Fe(III) released from the Tf could be directly used as bacterial nutrient sources. We also analyzed the transferrin-catecholamine interactions in human serum and found that therapeutically relevant concentrations of <b>stress</b> <b>hormones</b> and inotropes could directly affect the iron binding of serum-transferrin so that the normally highly bacteriostatic tissue fluid became significantly more supportive of the growth of bacteria.
