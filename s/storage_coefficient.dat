40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> was {{discussed}} {{based on the}} theory of poroelasticity. Several different storage coefficients can be defined by different mechanical boundary conditions and assumptions on the physical properties of constitutive materials. The specific storage, which is usually used {{in the field of}} hydrogeology, is shown to be defined when the representative elementary volume is maintained in a state of zero lateral strain and constant stress perpendicular to that plane. This means that the specific storage is not measured in most laboratory pore pressure tests because the boundary condition of zero lateral strain is not satisfied. Instead, we measure a three-dimensional <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In the latter sections of this paper, we present a new method to determine both the hydraulic conductivity and the <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> through simultaneous measurements of fluid pressure and strains. In this study, a new endplug with a built-in valve was developed to accurately measure the poroelastic parameters. Our experimental assembly significantly reduces the extra volume of the system and is readily adapted to the various pore-fluid boundary conditions. The three-dimensional <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> was calculated from the volumetric poroelastic parameters obtained from quasi-static strain data, and the hydraulic conductivity from the transient pore pressure diffusion data. Transient strain behavior during the pore pressure diffusion stage was used to self-check the accuracy of the parameters obtained.

40|$|Traditional {{analysis}} of aquifer tests uses the observed hydrograph at one well caused by pumping at another well for estimating transmissivity and <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> of an aquifer. The analysis relies on Theis' or Jacob's approximate solution, which assumes aquifer homogeneity. Aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at different scales. If the observation well taps into a low permeability zone while the pumping well {{is located in}} a high permeable zone, the resulting situation contradicts the homogeneity assumption embedded in the traditional analysis. As a result, a practical but important question we ask: What do we derive from the traditional analysis? Using numerical experiments in synthetic aquifers, we answer this question. Results of the experiments indicate that the effective transmissivity, Teff, and <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Seff, values vary with time, as well as the principal directions of the transmissivity, but both values approach their geometric means of the aquifer at large times. Analysis of the estimated transmissivity (T) and <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> (S) using well hydrographs from a single observation well shows that at early times, both the estimated T and S values vary with time. At late times, both estimates approach local averages near the observation well. The T value approaches but does not equal Teff, representing an average value over a broad area {{in the vicinity of the}} observation well while the S value converges to the value dominated by the <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> near the observation wells (i. e., its average area is much smaller than that of the t value) ...|$|E

40|$|We investigate, through {{numerical}} experiments, {{the viability}} of three-dimensional transient hydraulic tomography (3 DTHT) for identifying the spatial distribution of groundwater flow parameters (primarily, hydraulic conductivity K) in permeable, unconfined aquifers. To invert {{the large amount of}} transient data collected from 3 DTHT surveys, we utilize an iterative geostatistical inversion strategy in which outer iterations progressively increase the number of data points fitted and inner iterations solve the quasi-linear geostatistical formulas of Kitanidis. In order to base our numerical experiments around realistic scenarios, we utilize pumping rates, geometries, and test lengths similar to those attainable during 3 DTHT field campaigns performed at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS). We also utilize hydrologic parameters that are similar to those observed at the BHRS and in other unconsolidated, unconfined fluvial aquifers. In addition to estimating K, we test the ability of 3 DTHT to estimate both average storage values (specific storage Ss and specific yield Sy) as well as spatial variability in <b>storage</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The effects of model conceptualization errors during unconfined 3 DTHT are investigated including: (1) assuming constant <b>storage</b> <b>coefficients</b> during inversion and (2) assuming stationary geostatistical parameter variability. Overall, our findings indicate that estimation of K is slightly degraded if storage parameters must be jointly estimated, but that this effect is quite small compared with the degradation of estimates due to violation of “structural” geostatistical assumptions. Practically, we find for our scenarios that assuming constant storage values during inversion {{does not appear to have}} a significant effect on K estimates or uncertainty bounds...|$|R

For unconfined aquifers, this is simply expressed by {{the product of the}} volume of the aquifer lying between the water table at the beginning {{and at the end of}} a specified period of time and the average specific yield of the formation. The value of storativity for water table aquifers varies from 0.01 to 0.35, while for confined aquifers, it varies from 0.00001 to 0.001 (Ramakrishnan 1998). Besides, storativity normally varies directly with aquifer thickness, and depends on grain size, shape and distribution of pores, compaction of the stratum, and time of discharge (McQueen 1973). In the study area, results show that the <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> varied from values below the measurable level to 0.005.

30|$|In {{the last}} two or three decades, many {{computer}} methods have been proposed for analyzing data from pumping tests. Balasubramanian (1986) reviewed the availability and suitability of numerous digital techniques for analyzing pumping test data of wells. Numerical methods can be helpful where there is large variability in flow patterns and porous media properties (Prodanoff et al. 2006). Important aquifer parameters, like transmissivity (T), the <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient,</b> specific capacity, optimum yield, and time required for full recovery, have been calculated using BASIC programming software. In this study, a freely available program called aquifer performance analysis (APE) was used (Balasubramanian and Sastri 1989).

The <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient,</b> optimum yield, recovery time, and aquifer thickness were calculated from the drawdown and recovery measurement data, well dimensions, water level, and discharge. Transmissivity can help us understand the groundwater potential, secondary porosity, and hydrogeological conditions of an area for groundwater development. Besides, to understand the aquifer disturbance and deviation in the observed drawdown values, the APE software provides automated values for the least-squares fit of the well yield and transmissivity, <b>storage</b> <b>coefficient</b> and average drawdown error by sensitivity analysis (McElwee 1980 a, b).|$|E
