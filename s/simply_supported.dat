25|$|When a <b>simply</b> <b>{{supported}}</b> beam {{is loaded}} in flexure, the top side is in compression, {{and the bottom}} side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E
2500|$|C'b is a {{modification}} factor {{used in the}} equation for nominal flexural strength when determining lateral-torsional buckling. [...] The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced. [...] The conservative value for C'b can be taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, {{but in some cases}} it may be excessively conservative. C'b is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the free end is unbraced, Cb is equal to 1. Tables of values of C'b for <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> beams exist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final design}} for the bridge was {{approved}} in January 1952 by the New York State Department of Transportation (previously named The New York State Department of Public Works). The design described a [...] crossing consisting of five <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> spans with nominal lengths of , , , , and [...] The bridge was supported with pier frames along with abutments at each end. The pier frames were constructed of two slightly tapered columns with tie beams. The columns were fixed in place within a lightly reinforced plinth positioned on a shallow, reinforced spread footing. The spread footing was to be protected with a dry layer of riprap.|$|E

2500|$|The two spans are {{lenticular}} trusses {{with the}} top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the bottom chord comprises a pair of chains. Each of the trusses is <b>simply</b> <b>supported</b> and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial {{in view of the}} curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also seventeen much shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , , , , , , , , , , and seven on the Devon side of (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , , , , [...] This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of [...]|$|E
