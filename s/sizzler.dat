25|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy {{for about a year}} in the Toronto Second City Training Centre, where he began taking improv classes and met Kevin McDonald, who gave him a job as an usher at a local art house movie theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the miniseries Anne of Avonlea. Foley, McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson formed The Kids in the Hall, which debuted on television from 1988 to 1995. Foley played some characters, including Hecubus, one of the <b>Sizzler</b> sisters, the A. T. & Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with , he left the troupe {{in the middle of the}} writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the NewsRadio cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe to get paid for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlit, Foley did the film because he was contractually obligated. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer. Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project Death Comes to Town. Paul Simms, creator of NewsRadio, happened to be a huge fan of Foley's work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom Green Acres.|$|E

She eventually signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004. She started out in OVW as a fan favorite—gaining the nickname [...] "Chronically Cute"—and {{had a series of}} matches against Alexis Laree. After wrestling sporadically in OVW throughout 2004, Hall returned to OVW in January 2005 as a villain, complete with a slimmer physique, breast implants, and straightened, bleached blonde hair. The villainous turn was motivated in an angle where her implants [...] "leaked into her brain", causing her to become psychotic. As a villain, she managed the OVW Southern Tag Team Champions Blonde Bombers (Tank and Chad Toland) alongside her bodyguard Melissa Coates and went on a spree of blinding people with rubbing alcohol in storyline.|$|E

Interest in the <b>Sizzlers</b> line began to increase once again. They were taken off the market after Mattel {{filed a lawsuit against}} Playing Mantis.

500|$|Jon Pareles, {{a writer}} for The New York Times, viewed [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] as a song about a [...] "groupie who latches onto the narrator, mixes the sexual fears of 'Billie Jean' with the hard-rock lead guitar of 'Beat It'." [...] In his Bad review, Thom Duffy, music critic for the Orlando Sentinel, wrote that [...] "Dirty Diana, a tale of a maliciously seductive fan, finds Jackson doing {{credible}} heavy-metal rock wailing," [...] which, the critic said, was [...] "accompanied by a solo from Steve Stevens, the guitarist from Billy Idol's band." [...] Jonathan Takiff of The Philadelphia Inquirer also noted elements of heavy metal in [...] "Dirty Diana", writing, [...] "Plus, to tap the rock crowd (in {{the style of the}} 'Thriller' crossover smash 'Beat It' with Eddie Van Halen), Michael cut a heavy metal-tinged 'Dirty Diana' featuring Billy Idol's guitar <b>sizzler</b> Stevie Stevens." [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] is written in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 131 beats per minute. Jackson's vocals are sung on a range of B3 to G5.

Also noted, Token's W.T.F attire is resembled to the attire of WWE wrestler R-Truth. A wrestling try-out held by the boys resembles scenes from the Broadway musical A Chorus Line, which involves Broadway dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line. One of the people trying out sings a musical number about why {{he wants to be a}} wrestler, which parodies the song [...] "Nothing" [...] from A Chorus Line. The episode also includes references to the musical Fame, the film Waiting for Guffman and the reality television series American Idol.

2500|$|Foley and McDonald {{played two}} clearly insane people (although they always {{introduced}} themselves as [...] "not two clearly insane people"), who wore large wigs and {{identified themselves as}} Jerry <b>Sizzler</b> and Jerry <b>Sizzler,</b> the <b>Sizzler</b> Sisters. They were usually seen doing insane things, such as posing as a capella lounge singers, robbing a bank {{in order to make}} a deposit and then forcing people to mix up their shoes. In one sketch, Foley's character (whose real name is revealed to be Lister) has become sane through medication and is happily married. McDonald's character (whose real name is revealed to be Jean-Pierre) comes to Lister's apartment and urges him into become insane again, causing him stress and then withholding his medication. McDonald mentioned in an interview that he and Foley thought up the characters while running through the Kathie and Cathy beauty pageant sketch ("T.G.I.N.P.!"). Because they were bored, they started improvising that they were crazy people who escaped from an asylum; using the wigs (that they were wearing as background pageant contestants in the sketch) as their [...] "disguises".

5000|$|The <b>Sizzlers</b> were a 1970s Hot Wheels {{spin off}} with a {{built-in}} motor and a tiny rechargeable battery. (The X-V racers of the 1990s were similar.) They were introduced in 1970 and became immediately popular. <b>Sizzlers</b> run on the regular [...] "orange" [...] Hot Wheels track, and Mattel created special race sets with U-Turns, multi-level spirals and loops {{to take advantage of}} the cars' electric motor. Two lane race sets such as the California/8 race set were developed that allowed <b>Sizzlers</b> to race side-by side, until Mattel created the black Fat Track which is three lanes wide with steep banked curves and designed to allow <b>Sizzlers</b> to run free. In action, <b>Sizzlers</b> display a unique, competitive [...] "passing action" [...] when running on the Fat Track, as if each car were piloted by an impatient driver trying to jockey ahead of the rest.

2500|$|A <b>sizzler</b> is a metal chain or {{combination}} of chains that is hung across a cymbal, creating a distinctive metallic sound when the cymbal is struck {{similar to that}} of a sizzle cymbal. Using a <b>sizzler</b> is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a [...] "sizzler" [...] chain is that the chain can be removed and the cymbal will return to its normal sound (in contrast, a cymbal with rivets would have to have the rivets removed).|$|E

In 1971 Raduga began working on the air-launched Kh-55, which first flew in 1976. That same year, RK-55 first flew. NPO Novator would work on the submarine- and ground-launched versions.

Glannon disputed the valuation by the Garrett's and alleged they failed to pay him the remaining $205,000 for the <b>Sizzlers.</b> The case was originally heard in 1991 at the Shawnee County, Kansas District Court, who sided with Glannon, saying he did not misrepresent {{the sale of the}} <b>Sizzlers.</b> Furthermore, the jury ruled that the Garret's had to pay Glannon the remainder owed to him.|$|R
