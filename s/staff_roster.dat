5000|$|Campbell was {{the tight}} ends coach with the Miami Dolphins until {{he took over}} as the interim head coach when Joe Philbin was fired on October 5, 2015. Owner Stephen M. Ross stated [...] "The grit that Dan {{possesses}} will do wonders in that locker room." [...] The situation was a bit more complex for Campbell as he basically had to convince team owner Stephen Ross and vice president Mike Tannenbaum to keep him on as head coach. Campbell's competence and popularity with the team lead to two wins, and Campbell {{was able to take}} over Philbin's staff and roster with immediate effect, largely because of his familiarity. However a decisive defeat to the New England Patriots in late October had the sobering effect of stalling the momentum Campbell had built with those first two wins. Moreover, the Dolphins star defensive end, Cameron Wake tore his Achilles tendon, effectively sidelining him {{for the rest of the}} season. Although the Dolphins were improved under Campbell, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh both showing significant improvement; overall team performance was only nominally improved. It can be argued that Campbell can't be judged as a head coach on the basis of inheriting a roster, staff and an offensive and defensive system from Philbin. Campbell has yet to build his own program, but there is evidence, in his ability to win games and inspire his players, that he could be viable in a head coaching position where he is able to build out a <b>staff,</b> <b>roster</b> and playbook, like any coach who gains his position in a more traditional manner.|$|E

Methods Data for analysis was the counts of daily patient attendances at the ED of an acute care regional general hospital from July 2005 to Mar 2008. Patients were stratified into three acuity categories; i. e. P 1, P 2 and P 3, with P 1 being the most acute and P 3 being the least acute. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method was separately applied {{to each of the}} three acuity categories and total patient attendances. Independent variables included in the model were public holiday (yes or no), ambient air quality measured by pollution standard index (PSI), daily ambient average temperature and daily relative humidity. The seasonal components of weekly and yearly periodicities in the time series of daily attendances were also studied. Univariate analysis by t-tests and multivariate time series analysis were carried out in SPSS version 15. Results By time series analyses, P 1 attendances did not show any weekly or yearly periodicity and was only predicted by ambient air quality of PSI > 50. P 2 and total attendances showed weekly periodicities, and were also significantly predicted by public holiday. P 3 attendances were significantly correlated with day of the week, month of the year, public holiday, and ambient air quality of PSI > 50. After applying the developed models to validate the forecast, the MAPE of prediction by the models were 16. 8 %, 6. 7 %, 8. 6 % and 4. 8 % for P 1, P 2, P 3 and total attendances, respectively. The models were able to account for most of the significant autocorrelations present in the data.

40|$|MBA 2013 Abstract Introduction: Short-term layover {{maintenance}} activities at an airline base generally involve {{the execution of}} significant numbers of high-frequency, short-duration routine inspections in between flights on aircraft that are deployed to ongoing flight operations. The problem of scheduling labour supplies {{for this type of}} maintenance activity requires an operations manager to consider issues such as the number of scheduled flights each day, the timing constraints for the tasks that must be implemented on aircraft that are departing from or arriving at the base of operations, the employee skills and certifications that are needed to implement the required maintenance actions, as well as the potential for the planned flight schedule and associated maintenance schedule to be disrupted by unforeseen events such as flight delays. Published literature in the operations research subject area of ‘personnel scheduling’ covers a range of computational and mathematical techniques that can be adapted to solve or optimise this type of scheduling problem. This study has explored whether there is a significant knowledge gap between state-of-the-art developments in published research in this subject area and practical application at aircraft maintenance organisations on the African continent. Furthermore, the study has sought to establish whether computational models for the optimisation of an airline’s short-term layover maintenance labour resources that are based on a fixed flight schedule and thus a fixed task demand profile are sufficiently robust to the effects of flight schedule disruptions (e. g. delays) that occur routinely in real-life operations to support their practical application. Methods: A case study method has been employed in this study. In this regard, a case airline company based in Johannesburg, South Africa (with an in-house maintenance division) has been used for data collection purposes and for the implementation and testing of an experimental labour scheduling model for the short-term layover maintenance staffing problem. This labour scheduling model has been developed by adapting modelling concepts and techniques from contemporary operations research literature to the case setting. Initially, the experimental model has been used to generate an optimised <b>staff</b> <b>roster</b> for short-term layover {{maintenance activities}} under the ideal condition of 100...|$|E
40|$|Background Disclosure of HIV {{positive}} sero-status {{to sexual}} partners, {{friends or relatives}} is useful for prevention and care. Identifying factors associated with disclosure is a research priority as {{a high proportion of}} persons living with HIV&AIDS never disclose. HIV counseling and testing programmes as well as post test care services such as of antiretroviral therapy and pre-ART care emphasize HIV status disclosure among persons living with HIV&AIDS. Objective The broad objective {{of this study was to}} establish organizational factors influencing non disclosure among sexual partners attending Care and Treatment Clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital Dar es salaam Tanzania. Methods A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted at the Muhimbili National Hospital Care and Treatment Clinic. A total of 215 respondents participated in this study (207 clients, 5 Counselors and 3 Administrators). Non probability purposive sampling technique was used to select counselors and the administrators. Exit interviews were conducted to the clients using a structured questionnaire to get information on organizational factors contributing to non disclosure of HIV status among sexual partners attending Care and Treatment Clinic. A review of various documents/records such as job allocation book, staff attendance book, <b>staff</b> <b>roster</b> and client register book, HIV&AIDS policy and guideline was conducted at the study site to get information on availability of personnel, work schedules, workload per care provider per day, number of clients and attendance and availability of policy and guidelines materials. Observations were conducted throughout the study on the issues like number of clients, client flow, availability of equipments and guidelines, client- provider interaction and emerging issues during the course of data collection. In-depth interviewing was conducted with the MNH administrators and the counselors to generate information on issues like availability of funds, vii staff availability, training, user involvement and their evaluation of the working environment they have at MNH. The questionnaire contained both close and open ended questions to generate data needed. The data was entered into a computer and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16 programmes and output was presented in tables. Results The results showed that 72. 8 % of the study population disclosed HIV status to their sexual partners, only 27. 2 % did not disclose. Counselors were seen as a source of disclosure information to the majority of respondents (79. 4 %) but only few 10. 6 % got disclosure information from the doctors and only 1. 7 % got information from other sources. Long time was also reported by the majority of respondents (53. 3 %). Absence of workers’ involvement was responded by majority of counselors interviewed. Also counselors stated that there was not enough counseling rooms, clients were congested in one room and there was no confidentiality during counseling. Counselors reported working in poor environment, face staff shortage and lacked necessary equipments. Conclusion Poor organizational leadership existing at the MNH strongly influences low level of disclosure among sexual partners attending the Care and Treatment Clinic Muhimbili National Hospital that need to be addressed. Recommendations This study did not cover all organizational factors that would influence disclosing of HIV status among the CTC MNH clients a gap that is recommended for further research. The MNH management should strongly improve the existing CTC conditions making sure that all the organizational factors are well addressed to encourage clients develop HIV status disclosing behaviors...|$|E
