However, there is a lock of design codes and experimental procedures developed for vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper proposes an experimental setup for testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints,</b> which use metal gaskets, in vibratory conditions. Also, a flexible piezoelectric film sensor is introduced into this test rig for monitoring of stress in pipes. With the proposed test rig, vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> can be conducted, therefore further investigations such as fatigue analysis of the contact surfaces, and computational analysis of metal gaskets and seal devices are readily available. Finally, some experimental results of a gasketed flange joint, which uses a 1. 5 -inch diameter stainless steel gasket, were reported...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdhesively bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> are {{extensively}} used in pipelines. In {{the present}} work, cohesive zone model (CZM) based analytical solutions are derived for the bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> under torsion. The {{concept of the}} minimum relative interface rotation ϕm is introduced and used as the fundamental variable to express all other parameters, such as external torsion load, distribution of interfacial shear stress, length of elastic zone and softening zone, etc. It is found that when the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is longer than a certain value, further increase in bond length cannot bring any significant increase in torsion load capacity. Given that the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is long enough, the torsion load capacity is indeed independent of the shape of cohesive laws and the bond length. Consequently, simplified expressions of the torsion load capacity are derived {{as a function of}} the interface fracture energy, torsion stiffness of the pipe, and the geometric properties of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> Depending on the torsion stiffness ratio of the pipe and the coupler, the macroscopic-debonding can initiate at the right end, left end or both ends simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the maximum torsion load capacity is achieved when the torsion stiffness of the pipe and the coupler are identical. Good agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) result validates the accuracy of the current model. Fracture energy based formulas of the torsion load capacity derived in the present work can be directly used in the design of adhesively bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

In the presently developed smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system, the mechanical loading induced structural deformation can be detected and monitored by integrated sensing piezoelectric layers, and then the signal is fed back to the integrated actuating piezoelectric layers to adaptively produce additional forces and moments so as to decrease the maximum peel and shear stresses in the adhesive layer. In order to theoretically predict {{the efficiency of the}} developed smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system, an electro-mechanical theoretical analytical model was established to investigate the characteristics of the joint system under end tension load in terms of first-order shear deformation theory.

Finally, some detailed numerical results were obtained to demonstrate the optimal design method of such smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system and further validate the integrity of this joint system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed. In addition, results are compared with the conventional analysis. To carry out the investigation, a flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> subjected to bending has been modeled using finite element method, which also includes contact simulation. In this analysis, shell element has been used for the modeling of pipe and flange. Non-linear spring has been used to model contact surface and bolt.

It has been validated that the integrated piezoelectric ceramic layers can smartly reduce stress concentration in the adhesive layer bond-line under bending or axial tension loads. In this study, piezoelectric particle/fiber reinforced polymer composite was utilized to construct adhesively bonded smart composite <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> systems, in order to overcome the brittle characteristic of the piezoelectric ceramic layers and to facilitate joint construction.

40|$|Pipe jacking is a trenchless {{construction}} {{technique for}} {{the installation of}} underground pipelines. Although pipe jacking is widely used, fundamental research is still needed to understand fully the factors affecting the process and to prevent unexpected failure. With the time and financial limitation, {{it is difficult to}} explore all aspects of these factors with experiments; and it is also difficult to study them by analytical methods because of the complexity of the problem. This thesis describes the use of the finite element technique to study the pipe performance under different environments and the laboratory tests of several different joint designs. The emphasis of the current research is on the performance of the concrete pipes during jacking under working conditions and to seek possible improvements in the design of <b>pipes</b> and <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> by numerical modelling. In the finite element modelling, a simplified two-dimensional model is used for a preliminary study, then the analyses are carried out with three-dimensional models A, B and C representing a complete pipe, a pipe with surrounding soil and a symmetric three-pipe system respectively. Several factors affecting the pipe performance have been examined, for example, the properties of the packing material, the stiffness of the surrounding soil, the misalignment angle at the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint,</b> and the interaction between the pipe and surrounding soil. The numerical results show that the misalignment of the pipe is the dominating factor inducing both tensile stresses and localized compressive stresses in the concrete pipe, especially with a high misalignment angle which results in separation between packing material and the pipe. The packing materials with high Poisson's ratio and high stiffness also induce higher tensile stresses in the pipe, and the influence of Poisson's ratio is significant. Under 'diagonal' loading, both the stiffness of the surrounding soil and the interaction between the pipe and the surrounding soil {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses within the concrete pipe. Under 'edge' loading, the greatest potential damage is at the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> due to the tensile stresses in the hoop direction; while under 'diagonal' loading, the damage is most likely the cracking on the external surface of the pipe along a line connecting the two diagonal loaded corners. The results show that the Australian model gives somewhat good prediction about the maximum normal stress and the diametrical contact width at <b>pipe</b> <b>joint.</b> Based on the numerical results, several different joint designs for improving the pipe strength have been proposed and tested in the laboratory.
