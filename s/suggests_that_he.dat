5|$|Bach used {{material}} from the chorales in his own composition, for example deriving the first horn motif {{from the beginning of}} the chorale tune of the first chorale. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had chosen the structure before he began the composition.|$|E
5|$|Maddy overhears Ric and Clifford {{talking about}} her. Clifford {{explains}} that Ric might be {{hit with a}} lawsuit if he denies Maddy an interview and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> interviews her without giving her the job.|$|E
5|$|At Hogwarts, the first-years are {{assigned}} by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the Hat <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> be placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "present subjunctive" [...] (morphologically {{identical}} with the bare infinitive) is regularly used in AmE in mandative clauses (as in They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{apply for the}} job). In BrE, this usage declined in the 20th century in favour of constructions such as They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should apply for the job (or even, more ambiguously, They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> applied for the job). However, the mandative subjunctive has always been used in BrE, especially in formal writing.|$|R
50|$|Stakeknife {{had his own}} {{dedicated}} handlers {{and agents}} and it was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was important enough that MI5 set up an office dedicated solely to him. Rumours <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being paid at least £80,000 a year and had a bank account in Gibraltar.|$|R
60|$|He stood {{listening}} in amazement, {{but the sound}} was not repeated. Ordinary prudence {{and a sense of}} the fitness of things <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should go home; inclination <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should seat himself in the deck-chair {{at the foot of the}} crow’s-nest and await events. He sat down to consider the matter.|$|R
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote them.|$|E
5|$|His origins are unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} not a native Englishman. He may have been German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been {{influenced}} by Turushkas: ...|$|R
60|$|Marius {{shrugged his}} shoulders; his face <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ill-humoured.|$|R
50|$|Inoue has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will {{continue}} the webcomic in the future.|$|R
5|$|However, modern {{historians have}} {{challenged}} existing information on Taksony's early life. A nearly-contemporaneous sourceLiudprand of Cremona's Retributionnarrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born considerably earlier than 931. His father's reign was preserved {{only in the}} Gesta Hungarorum; its anonymous author lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus wrote around 950 that Fajsz, Taksony's cousin, was grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.|$|E
5|$|In the far future, {{an office}} worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{go to the}} Trip Movie Corporationa company that enables its {{customers}} to experience a dream {{as though it were}} a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem, and to command a battlestar.|$|E
5|$|John Cabot was {{sponsored}} by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, {{looking for a new}} route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land. In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have.|$|E
50|$|It was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{the teacher}} of Nicholas of Verdun.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 it was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should be}} {{appointed}} a peer.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} three men looked at him, as also the two women. His {{appearance}} no more <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a seaman than the appearance of Mr. Harberry <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was what the village of Riprock believed him to be. [...] "I should not have taken you for a sailor," [...] said the blacksmith.|$|R
5|$|Karađorđe was feared by {{enemies and}} allies alike {{because of his}} {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko {{had been accused of}} raping a peasant girl. Another <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been attempting to seduce young women whose husbands were away at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
5|$|No written {{contemporary}} {{description of}} Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of {{as a good}} likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Canterbury or Petrus (died c. 607 {{or after}} 614) {{was the first}} abbot of the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul in Canterbury (later St Augustine's Abbey) and a {{companion}} of Augustine in the Gregorian mission to Kent. Augustine sent Peter as an emissary to Rome around 600 to convey news of the mission to Pope Gregory I. Peter's death has traditionally been dated to around 607, but evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was present at a church council in Paris in 614, so he probably died after that date.|$|E
25|$|It is also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{a son of}} Xochiquetzal and Mixcoatl.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used as}} a subjunctive: I <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> write a novel.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 2015, reports <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has been}} ordained as a priest.|$|R
5|$|Peter {{was born}} in Venice, the only son of Doge Otto Orseolo. His mother was a sister of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary; {{historian}} Gyula Kristó <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was born in}} 1010 or 1011. The Venetians rose up and deposed Otto Orseolo in 1026. Peter did not follow his father, who fled to the Byzantine court in Constantinople; he instead went to Hungary, where his uncle appointed him commander of the royal army.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} wedding, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), {{who wants}} another chance at Finn, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> reveal that they had sex to boost his {{popularity}} at school. He is unwilling to do so, as he truly loves Rachel, who recently admitted to him that she lied when she claimed to have slept with her then-boyfriend Jesse (Jonathan Groff); Finn also lied at the same time, by saying he never had sex with Santana.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E
60|$|Here we <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might skip his ancestry {{and come}} to the point.|$|R
5000|$|His {{full name}} is Abu Hatim Muhammad bin Idris bin al-Mundhir bin Dawud bin Mahran ar-Razi al-Handhali al-Ghatafani. Some sources <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{originally}} from Isfahan {{and was a}} mawla of the Ghatafan tribe. Other sources <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acquired his nisbat from a region of Ray called [...] "Darb Handhala". He died on the month of Sha’bân in the year 277H.|$|R
2500|$|... (3) William of Malmesbury <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Abbot of Malmesbury and Bishop of Crediton.|$|R
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an early {{archetype}} of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded {{in the last decade}} of the thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Robert California (James Spader) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> have an office pool party. There, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries to make Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) jealous by flirting with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home.|$|E
5|$|When Bart {{returns to}} school, Edna, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> take a make-up test, he {{immediately}} procrastinates. Grampa comes {{to pick him}} up and on the way home and references The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Again, Bart is unfazed. When he returns to school again, he is forced to take the test without any exception. Bart protests, but Edna ignores him. She places him alone outside the classroom, hands him the test, and leaves.|$|E
50|$|Later analysts <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was closely}} tied to Salafia Jihadia or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.|$|R
50|$|Some have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{thereafter}} {{targeted for}} assassination by the National Islamic Front.|$|R
5000|$|I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{not receive}} any more funding (the present subjunctive receive is negated) ...|$|R
