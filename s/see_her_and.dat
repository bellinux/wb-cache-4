5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E

They go to the {{hospital}} to gain answers, and it is revealed that Mercedes baby had died and they ask her to prepare for induced labour. Mercedes is devastated and later goes to find Joe for support but is left further heartbroken when his half-brother, Jason Roscoe (Alfie Browne-Sykes), tells her that he has left the village following their argument. She is left to face giving birth alone, but is relieved when her family arrive to support her. After giving birth to her son who she decides to name Gabriel, Mercedes is left overwhelmed with grief and the funeral costs.

Just hours after {{being told by}} a psychic that {{she was about to}} have the worst year of her life, her boyfriend Rick ran off with her best friend Melissa while Sophie was still {{pregnant}} with what she and Rick thought was Rick's baby. Soon afterward, she gave birth and discovered that the baby (named Robert) couldn't be Rick's child after all: he's half black. It turns out Robbie was conceived in a one-night stand Sophie had with André (played by Lyriq Bent in flashbacks), whom she met in a cab in New York City. At first, she did not have any contact with him and went as far as shredding his business card. But in the first season finale, he would later show up to <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be noticed {{that she was not}} entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa {{is a complicated}} person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: [...] "he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> whether what they see is what she really is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're {{going to tell the}} book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" [...] This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as sounding boards to question and explain herself.|$|E

Du Maurier then proposed to Browning, who accepted. They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow, Lanteglos-by-Fowey on 19 July 1932, and honeymooned on Ygdrasil. Their marriage produced three children: two daughters, Tessa and Flavia, and a son, Christian, known as Kits.|$|E
500|$|In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} shows in Fox's Animation Domination block, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club praised the episode for having [...] "some actual plot and continuity". She concluded her review, writing: [...] "Jillian has been a pretty good addition to the Family Guy universe, and I think I'm actually sad to <b>see</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> Brian break up." [...] She graded the episode B+, the second-highest grade of the night. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote that the episode [...] "managed to rise about the generic plotline and deliver a pretty solid half-hour of entertainment that told a cohesive (and somewhat sad) main story, with just enough gags {{to fill in the}} rest of the time." [...] Haque graded the episode 7.8 out of 10, and wrote that it was [...] "definitely sad to see the end of the Brian and Jillian relationship, especially considering the great performance put on by Drew Barrymore." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad called it [...] "a fairly pedestrian episode with a few cute gags".|$|E

After reaching the outpost at Aïn Séfra, Eberhardt meets a French officer, Major Hubert Lyautey (Peter O'Toole). Despite their differences, the two respect each-other and soon become friends.
