40|$|An {{advanced}} design of an all metal, fast response, bipropellant, shut-off valve {{for use on}} long duration space missions is reported. The valve provides the flow control capability for a 1, 000 lb thrust, bipropellant engine using oxygen difluoride and diborane as propellants. The shutoff seal selection is a soft-on-hard metal concept. The soft seal is a spherical shell that seats against a hard conical seat. Beryllium copper and beryllium nickel seals were selected to seal against an electrolyzed Inconel 718 <b>seat.</b> Poppet <b>shaft</b> sealing is achieved by use of hydroformed, Inconel 718 bellows. Two valve assemblies were fabricated and subjected {{to a series of}} tests including leak, response time, flow capacity, dry cycles, water cycles, liquid nitrogen cycles, liquid fluorine cycles, and lead-lag operation cycles. These tests demonstrated the ability of the valve to meet design goals...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical and experimental investigation performed on a barrelof a speargun equipped with two kinds of muzzle. In particular, a standard muzzle for speargun (having anelastic propulsion) has been compared with an innovative one called ‘roller’. This new muzzle is equipped withtwo rollers and special bands.

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} blades with {{integral}} shrouds, for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as sometimes also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are either inserted with their root into the <b>seat</b> on the <b>shaft</b> {{in such a way}} that small clearances remain between adjacent blade shrouds, so that the relative vibration amplitude is restricted by the contact between adjacent shrouds. This mechanism is called “snubbing mechanism”. Another technology for mounting blades on the shaft is to do it {{in such a way that}} the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds: this should allow the continuity of the contact without clearances also at rated speed and full load. In this case the blades are called “pre-twisted”. Field experience has shown that these kinds of blade rows has a “robust and smooth” behavior. But there is still some lack of theoretical/numerical investigation for defining its dynamical behavior in different operating conditions, both for the blades with clearance and with pre-twist. The aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the non-linear dynamic behavior of a couple of shrouded blades, taking account of contact forces and friction. An equivalent linear model has then been developed for analyzing the behavior of the complete blade row. Also some provisional experimental results on non-rotating blade rows are presented...|$|R
40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} blades with {{integral}} shrouds, for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are inserted with their root into the <b>seat</b> on the <b>shaft</b> {{in such a way}} that the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds. In long blades of low pressure stages the forcing can be obtained by the untwisting of twisted blades due to the effect of the huge centrifugal forces. The dynamic behavior of these blade rows is difficult to predict due to the nonlinear effect of the contact forces and due to friction. Different models for the contact are proposed and compared. The resulting natural frequencies of the blade row as a function of the different nodal diameter mode shapes are highly depending on the assumed models. For avoiding resonant conditions with engine order excitations, the natural frequencies must be calculated with good accuracy. Some of the modes of the blade row, typically for the last stage of the low pressure steam turbine, can couple with some vibration modes of the rotor: flexural vibrations of the shaft couple with 1 nodal diameter mode shape of the row in axial direction and torsional vibrations of the shaft couple with the 0 nodal diameter mode in tangential direction. Therefore analyses of lateral and torsional vibrations of low pressure steam turbine shafts require also an accurate analysis of the blade row vibration modes...|$|R
40|$|This study explores and {{discusses}} the constraints and prospects of {{horizontal and vertical}} expansion of Zimbabwe’s Kwekwe Central Business Expansion (CBD). Particular emphasis is put on assessing the impacts of gold mining on the constructability of the CBD. The study emanates from {{the view that the}} CBD of Kwekwe <b>seats</b> on mining <b>shafts</b> and tunnels where gold mining activities have been done and, in some instances, still being practised. The underground and open cast mining processes have immensely disturbed the stability and natural form of the ground. In obtaining data, the study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods in which a survey was conducted in the CBD. Interviews were also conducted with the local authority, estate developers and mine operators. The study shows that various stakeholders in the CBD are aware of the impact of mines especially the likelihood of ground subsidence. One important aspect which can be noted is that mining activities preceded the development of the City of Kwekwe thus posing a great challenge in as far as expanding the CBD is concerned. Illegal gold panners present another great threat to the CBD as they tend to destroy the reinforcements of underground mine tunnels. To avert this peril it is imperative that the local authority put in place a monitoring mechanism such as seismographs to detect possible seismic events in the CBD. There is also a need for all stakeholders in the CBD to engage in a memorandum of understanding regarding the issue of illegal gold panning to promote sustainable growth of the CBD...|$|R
40|$|The joining of {{rotationally}} symmetric {{machine parts}} using adhesive bonding, {{in either a}} basic way or in conjunction with shrinking, is longestablished in industrial engineering. For example, adhesives are used to secure roller bearings in their <b>seats,</b> gearwheels to <b>shafts,</b> and screws and bolts against loosening, with the latter being the most widespread industrial application. With {{the exception of the}} securing of screws/bolts, the other applications can be considered to be typical shaft/hub joints. The adhesives which are used are anaerobic curing acrylates. These are one-component products and are therefore simple to apply. They only cure in the absence of oxygen and in direct contact with metals, meaning that excess adhesive can be easily removed. The current state-of-technology for shaft/hub joints involves using similar types of materials for both the shaft and hub. However, if the shaft is made of steel and the joint of aluminum, then the different CTE of the materials leads to a lowering of the oversize and hence to a reduction in the load-bearing strength of the joint at elevated temperatures. This behavior will be discussed in this paper using the example of a drive shaft. This work has investigated whether a bonded joint between a load transfer element and aluminum tube can withstand the prevailing torsional loads. Firstly, the dimensions of a bonded joint for the case of static loads were estimated using an analytical approximation. Precise sizing was not possible under the given boundary conditions. It did become clear, however, that narrow tolerances for the dimensions of the substrates are imperative for an effective bonded joint. The subsequent experiments which were carried out on test specimens identified two adhesives with promising strength under static load conditions. It was also shown that test specimens having the theoretically determined oversize cannot be joined in practice. The application of a 'pseudo press fit', however, also leads to extremely effective bonded joints...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical and experimental investigation performed on a barrel of a speargun equipped with two kinds of muzzle. In particular, a standard muzzle for speargun (having an elastic propulsion) has been compared with an innovative one called ‘roller’. This new muzzle is equipped with two rollers and special bands. The rubber bands, fixed at the lower side of the barrel, run through the rollers and are engaged in suitable <b>seats</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> These bands are, therefore, longer than the traditional ones and, consequently, with equal force applied by the diver, the roller speargun has a longer range. Thanks to the particular geometry of the new muzzle, one of the front constraints of the elastic bands is moved to {{the lower part of the}} barrel or the handle. As a consequence, the scheme of the loads applied on the speargun remarkably changes passing from a standard muzzle to a roller one. All that has a great influence on the level of deformation of the barrel and, consequently, on the accuracy of the shot. Because of the low velocity of the spear (if compared with the firearms), in fact, the accuracy of the shoot if strongly influenced by the barrel bending due to the forces applied by means of the elastic bands. In this paper it is experimentally evaluated the bending of the barrel equipped both with the innovative muzzle and with the traditional one in order to compare their performances. The experimental analysis of the barrel was performed by electrical strain gauges suitably located at the section with the highest values of the strains. In order to find the barrel section with the highest strain values where to locate the strain gauges, a preliminary numerical FEM analysis has been performed. The loads and constraints scheme has been evaluated both for the standard and the new muzzle. In particular, the forces due to the elastic bands, their application points and directions have been experimentally obtained. To speed up the process of numerical simulation, without invalidating the results reliability, simplified FEM models have been used. In particular, a very accurate model of the barrel has been shaped, whereas the models of the muzzles and the handle have been simplified. The forces due to the elastic bands, experimentally obtained, have been applied on the FEM models. The maps of the maximum and minimum principal strains have allowed to find the area with the highest strain values, placed in rear part of the barrel (near the handle). The strain values experimentally measured on the speargun have been very similar to the ones calculated by means of the numerical simulations. That demonstrates the developed FEM models are very reliable and can ben used to predict the performances of the speragun under different loads conditions. The speargun with the new roller muzzle shows very lower strain values if compared with the ones measured in the standard one. Nevertheless, considering the two spearguns have different elastic bands setup, it has been thought the comparison of their performances should be made hypothesizing the same maximum force applied during the speargun charge. This condition, moreover, could be really obtained by changing the kind of the elastic bands in the speargun with the roller muzzle. For this reason, during the results analysis phase, the strain values measured on the roller speargun have been ‘normalized’ by increasing them of a value equal to the ratio of the maximum forces due to the rubber bands. The data post processing has allowed to evaluate the forces and the bending moments on the barrels with the standard muzzle and the roller one. Results show the barrel with the innovative muzzle has, also considering equal forces applied by the diver, a lower bending than the barrel with a traditional muzzle. To evaluate the maximum deflection of both the spearguns, a new numerical simulation has been set up. In particular, in this FEM analysis, the roller speargung has been loaded with a maximum force comparable with the standard one. The obtained results show that the standard speargun has a higher value of the maximum deflection respect to the roller one. Since higher deflection values of the barrel make worse the accuracy of the shot, these results demonstrate the novel speargun can be more precise than the traditional one...|$|R
