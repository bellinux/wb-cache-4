25|$|The {{use of a}} sighted guide {{by people}} in this class is {{dependent}} on the specific requirements of the sport. Guides are used in para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently from for B1 skiers as the skiers in this class have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> front of the skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what is ahead of them on the course. For cyclists in this class, a guide is used with the guide sitting at the front of a tandem bicycle.|$|E
500|$|Early skiers {{used one}} long pole or spear in {{addition}} to the skis. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741. Traditional skis, used for snow travel in Norway and elsewhere into the 1800s, often comprised one short ski with a natural fur traction surface, the andor, and one long for gliding, the langski—one being up to [...] longer than the other—allowing skiers to propel themselves with a scooter motion. This combination has a long history among the Sami people. Skis up to 280cm have been produced in Finland, and the longest recorded <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> Norway is 373cm.|$|E

Later, he briefly attends Eton College at [...] "12 or thereabouts", but is removed after two halves because of girl trouble with a maid. After being sent down from Eton, Bond was sent to Fettes College in Scotland, his father's school. On his first visit to Paris at the age of 16, Bond loses his virginity, later reminiscing about the event in [...] "From a View to a Kill". Fleming used his own {{upbringing}} for his creation, with Bond alluding to briefly attending the University of Geneva (as did Fleming), before being taught to <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> Kitzbühel (as was Fleming) by Hannes Oberhauser, who is later killed in [...] "Octopussy".|$|E
500|$|With skate skiing, {{the skier}} {{provides}} propulsion on a smooth, firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis {{away from one}} another at an angle, {{in a manner similar}} to ice skating. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus, sometimes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily [...] "dominant" [...] side ("V1") or with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side ("V2"). Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the [...] "V" [...] and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles. A variant of the technique is the [...] "marathon skate", where the skier leaves one <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.|$|E
500|$|A new {{technique}}, skate skiing, was {{experimented with}} {{early in the}} 20th Century, but was not widely adopted until the 1980s. Johan Grøttumsbråten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, {{one of the earliest}} recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. It became widespread during the 1980s after the success of Bill Koch (United States) in 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the skating style. Norwegian skier Ove Aunli started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Finnish skier, Pauli Siitonen, developed a one-sided variant of the style in the 1970s, leaving one <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> the track while skating to the side with the other one during endurance events; this became known as the [...] "marathon skate".|$|E

500|$|The classic {{style is}} often used on {{prepared}} trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It {{is also the most}} usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the [...] "diagonal stride" [...] variant the poles are planted alternately {{on the opposite side of}} the forward-striding foot; with the [...] "kick-double-pole" [...] variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion. On uphill terrain, techniques include the [...] "side step" [...] for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the [...] "herringbone" [...] for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.|$|E
500|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a grip {{section in the}} middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding <b>ski.</b> <b>In</b> classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.|$|E
500|$|While the noun ski {{originates}} {{from the}} Norwegian language, unlike the English skiing {{there is no}} corresponding verb in Norwegian. Fridtjov Nansen, for instance, describes the crossing of Greenland as På ski over Grønland, literally [...] "On skis across Greenland", while the English edition of the report was titled, The first crossing of Greenland. Nansen referred to the activity of traversing snow on skis as [...] (he used the term also in the English translation), which may be translated as ski running. Nansen used skilöbning, regarding all forms of skiing, but noted that ski jumping is purely a competitive sport and not for amateurs. He further noted that in some competitions the skier [...] "is also required to show his skill in turning his ski to {{one side or the}} other within given marks" [...] at full speed on a steep hill. Nansen regarded these forms (i.e., jumping and slalom) as [...] "special arts", and believed that the most important branch of skiing was travel [...] "in an ordinary way across the country". In Germany, Nansen's Greenland report was published as Auf Schneeschuhen durch Grönland (literally [...] "On snowshoes through Greenland"). The German term, Schneeschuh, was supplanted by the borrowed Norwegian word, <b>Ski,</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century. The Norwegian encyclopedia of sports also uses the term, skiløping, (literally [...] "ski running") for all forms of skiing. Around 1900 the word Skilaufen was used in German in the same sense as [...] In modern Norwegian, a variety of terms refer to cross-country skiing, including: ...|$|E

50|$|Fritz Steuri {{came into}} contact with <b>skiing</b> <b>in</b> the early 1890s when he saw the Englishman Gerald Fox (who lived at Tone Dale House) <b>skiing</b> <b>in</b> Grindelwald. In 1898, he bought his first pair of skis from a Grindelwald manufactory. The first ski race was held in Grindelwald {{before the turn of the}} century, in which Steuri, who pursued regular ski training, took part with other locals. Even in his job as a postman, which he held from 1899 until he became a {{mountain}} guide, he rendered valuable services to <b>skiing.</b> <b>In</b> 1902, he was among the founding members of the Grindelwald Ski Club.|$|R
500|$|Skate skiing was {{introduced}} to competition in the 20th Century. At the first German ski championship, held at the Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1900, the Norwegian Bjarne Nilssen won the 23km cross-country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiing—a technique unknown to the spectators. Johan Grøttumsbråten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, {{one of the earliest}} recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. Finnish skier Pauli Siitonen developed a variant of the style for marathon or other endurance events in the 1970s by leaving one <b>ski</b> <b>in</b> the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski (one-sided skating); this became known as the [...] "marathon skate". Bill Koch (USA) further developed the marathon skate technique in the late 1970s. Skate-skiing became widespread during the 1980s after Koch's success with it in the 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the technique. Norwegian skier, Ove Aunli, started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Skating is most effective on wide, smooth, groomed trails, using fiberglass skis that glide well; it also benefits a stronger athlete—which, according to Olav Bø, are the reasons that the technique made a breakthrough in the early 1980s. Athletes widely adopted skating to both sides {{by the time of the}} 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by the FIS in 1986—despite initial opposition from Norway, the Soviet Union and Finland—while preserving events using only classic technique.|$|E
