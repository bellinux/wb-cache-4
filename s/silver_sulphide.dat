40|$|Mineralogical {{characterisation}} {{is typically}} used {{to assist in}} the development of processing strategies for ores. This paper describes the application of mineralogical characterisation techniques in the development of flotation strategies for processing an ore from a low-grade silver deposit that contains a variety of rock types that have undergone hydrothermal alteration where zinc, lead and <b>silver</b> <b>sulphides</b> are typically the primary minerals of economic interest. Comprehensive mineralogical characterisation of the feed, concentrates and tailings from batch flotation tests was undertaken using both the mineral liberation analyser (MLA) and laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). The results of mineralogical characterisation of the feed (head grade, 116 ppm) indicated {{that the majority of the}} silver occurred as solid solution in pyrite which assisted in the development of the flotation strategy used for this ore which resulted in approximately 87 % of the total silver being recovered to rougher concentrate at a grade of 485 ppm.

During World War II, Lashkaryov worked in the city of Ufa on cuprous-oxide devices for defense needs.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of zinc and postnatal {{development of the}} rat amygdala were investigated by light and electron microscopy with Timm's <b>sulphide</b> <b>silver</b> method. By Timm's reaction and toluidine blue staining, the rat amygdala could be divided into cortical(CO), lateral(L), basolateral(ABL), basomedial(ABM), central(C), medial(M) and intercated(I) nuclear regions. CO was the most strongly positive to Timm's reaction, L, ABM and C were strongly positive, ABL was also positive, and I and M were weakly positive. In newborns, no positive Timm's reaction could be observed, but a very weakly positive reaction was observed from the 5 th postnatal day. The reaction became stronger with development, and reached the strength of that of the adult on the 30 th postnatal day. Electron microscopically, the deposits of silver grains were only located in the nerve fiber endings containing many small clear vesicles. This finding is quite similar to that described in the mossy fiber endings in the hippocampal formation. Deposits of silver grains {{could not be found}} in newborns, and only very few could be observed after the 5 th postnatal day. The number of deposits increased with age, and reached that of the adult from the 20 th to the 30 th postnatal days. It was elucidated that {{a significant increase in the}} number of silver grains per square 10 (- 8) centimeter of Timm's positive nerve fiber endings occurred between the 10 th and 20 th postnatal days.

40|$|The {{refractory}} {{character of}} complex ores and concentrates is at present {{one of the}} main problems of their metallurgical processing. The research activity in this sphere is aimed at the methods of improving the process of metal extraction from the sulphidic minerals representing the major components of these ores and concentrates. One of the sulphidics components of complex ores is tetrahedrite. It represents a compound of complicated structure containing several metals among which copper, antimony and arsenic prevail. Some deposits are aspecially rich in silver. The Peruvian complex sulphidic concentrate of provenience Casapalca is each from these rich deposits. In this study the physico-chemical transformations and leachability of <b>silver</b> from Peruvian <b>sulphide</b> concentrate mechanochemically activated by ultrafine alkaline milling in the attritor were investigated. The experiments with alkaline leaching of using samples have shown that this hydrometallurgical process represents an effective method to prepare of treated concentrate with physico-chemical means for further leaching process. Ammonium thiosulphate were used as agent for obtain of silver to leaching solution. The leaching of as-received concentrate with the alkaline thiosulphate solution afforded only 6 % Ag into leach. The use of milling in attritor as an innovation method of pretreatment brought about 57 % of structure degradation of tetrahedrite as silver-bearing mineral in concentrate {{as well as to the}} increase in specific surface area from the original value 0. 26 m 2 g- 1 to the maximum value of 16 m 2 g- 1. This pretreatment has been performed in an attritor using the method of experiment design. The physico-chemical changes had influence on the two step process of thiosulphate leaching of silver.

5000|$|It {{had long}} been known that some objects {{deteriorate}} when in storage or on display in museums. This {{is especially true of}} silver, copper/bronze and lead. It was thus no surprise when the director of the Wallace Collection sought the help of the British Museum Research Laboratory in 1972 to investigate the tarnishing of gold snuff boxes after they had been on display for only a few months. Tarnish (<b>silver</b> <b>sulphide)</b> was spreading from the settings of precious stones. Testing of the materials of which the showcase were made revealed that the main structural timber was an African pseudo-mahogany and that this caused silver to tarnish very quickly. Fresh samples of this timber were inert and it was assumed that the timber of the showcase had been treated with a chemical either as a fire retardant or insect repellent.|$|E
5000|$|Producing {{a strong}} clear yellow could be {{difficult}} in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions {{in order to}} create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment. The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility {{in the way in which}} colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313). Silver stain was a combination of silver nitrate or <b>silver</b> <b>sulphide</b> blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass. [...] This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.|$|E

30|$|The {{deterioration}} of archaeological objects from marine environments {{leads to the}} formation of thick layers of corrosion products and concretions [3]. The mixture of corrosion products frequently separates into two layers. The inner layer extends from the residual metal core to the original surface and does not contain calcareous or seabed materials. The outer layer extends from the original surface out onto the surrounding media. Concretion (a mixture of organic and inorganic calcite and aragonite (CaCO 3)) is often only weakly bonded to the corrosion product layer [3]. In marine silver artefacts, the main corrosion products are silver chloride AgCl, <b>silver</b> <b>sulphide</b> Ag 2 S and mixed silver chloride and bromide AgCl/Br. In aerobic conditions, concretions tend to protect silver artefacts. In anaerobic conditions, the main corrosion product is <b>silver</b> <b>sulphide</b> [3].|$|E
