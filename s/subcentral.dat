"FISSURES OF THE PARIETAL AND OCCIPITAL LOBES (LATERAL SURFACE).--The Postcentral Fissural Complex--In this hemicerebrum, the postcentral and <b>subcentral</b> are {{combined}} {{to form a}} continuous fissure, attaining a length of 8.5 cm. Dorsally, the fissure bifurcates, embracing the gyre indented by the caudal limb of the paracentral. The caudal limb of the postcentral is joined by a transparietal piece. In all, five additional rami spring from the combined fissure. A vadum separates it from the parietal; another from the central." ...|$|E
50|$|In May 2015, Conisur {{announced}} that it held a gathering of pro-road communities who called for Segment II to be built. Later that month, Emilio Noza of the <b>Subcentral</b> Isiboro Sécure-Tipnis and Fernando Vargas president of the <b>Subcentral</b> Tipnis declared that their member communities continue to oppose the road and stating that a <b>Subcentral</b> Tipnis representative had confirmed that no such gathering had been held, as claimed, in Santa Trinidad.|$|E

50|$|The {{park was}} made into a National Park by Supreme Decree 7401 on November 22, 1965 and {{recognized}} as an indigenous territory (formally as Native Community Land) through Supreme Decree 22610 on September 24, 1990, following pressure by local native peoples and the March for Territory and Dignity organized by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of the Bolivian East. Indigenous residents had organized the <b>Subcentral</b> Indígena del TIPNIS (<b>Subcentral</b> TIPNIS) in July 1988. Following clearing by the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA), operative collective title to the Isiboro Securé TCO, consisting of 1,091,656 hectares was awarded to the <b>Subcentral</b> TIPNIS on 13 June 2009. Some 124,000 hectares inside the park were adjudicated to agrarian colonists, most in the southern Polygon 7. Another 137,783 hectares are held by ranchers in the Beni department portion of the park.|$|E
