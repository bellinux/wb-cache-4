5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, Leporidae. Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> black, while its belly fur is pure white and fluffy. It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E

5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a small swallow that has grey-brown underparts {{becoming}} white on the throat and lower abdomen, dark grey-brown upperparts and a slightly forked tail. The underparts are heavily <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> black. It nests in small colonies anywhere with suitably sheltered sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and other plant material, and the normal clutch is two or three brown-spotted white eggs. The incubation and fledging times are unknown. The Mascarene martin has a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with glides, and frequently perches on wires. It feeds on insects in flight, often hunting low over the ground or vegetation. In eastern Africa, open habitats such as deforested areas are frequently used for hunting. A number of internal and external parasites have been detected in this species.|$|E

25|$|Descriptions of {{the time}} vary, but {{generally}} the beast was said {{to look like a}} wolf but be about as big as a calf. It had a large dog-like head with small straight ears, a wide chest, and a large mouth that exposed very large teeth.

25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations. The cough is often worse soon after awakening and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> specks of blood.|$|E
25|$|Underside: fuliginous (sooty) {{brown or}} {{brownish}} black, {{more or less}} suffused with pink along the costal margin, on apical area and along the outer margin of the discal markings on the forewing, broadly along the dorsal and terminal margins and at base on interspaces 6 and 7 on the hindwing; markings similar to those on the upperside but less clearly defined and somewhat more grey in tint. Hindwing black, inwardly red-margined spots superposed on the pink area in interspaces 6 and 7. Cilia very narrow, pale pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, thorax above and the abdomen on the sides <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> greenish grey; beneath: ochreous grey touched on the thorax with pink.|$|E

25|$|The {{donors are}} painted life size, {{and thus to}} a much larger scale than the saints; this is most {{noticeable}} in the relative sizes of their heads and hands. Their bright and warmly colored clothes contrast sharply with the grey of the lifeless saints. Van Eyck brings {{a high degree of}} realism to his portrayal of the Vijdts; his study of the ailing couple in old age is unflinching and far from flattering. Details that reveal their aging include Joost's watering eyes, wrinkled hands, warts, bald head and stubble <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> gray. The folds of both figures' skin are meticulously detailed, as are their protruding veins and fingernails. They are generally thought to be among the final panels completed for the altarpiece, and are so dated to 1431 or the early months of 1432.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked as if it might have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E
500|$|The cap of H.olivaceoalbus is [...] {{wide and}} is {{hemispherical}} in young fungi; they become flatter and wider with age, but {{they keep their}} characteristic dark umbo. Underneath the slimy grey to sooty-brown surface, the cap cuticle is <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> fine, dark grey radially arranged fibers. Young fruit bodies are covered by two velum layers; the inner velum, composed of dark fibrils, becomes a ring or sheath (annular zone) on the stem that is covered by the gelatinous outer layer.|$|E

500|$|The {{upper parts}} of the kakapo have {{yellowish}} moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the specific epithet habroptilus. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling {{the face of an}} owl; thus, early European settlers called it the [...] "owl parrot". The beak is surrounded by delicate vibrissae or [...] "whiskers", which the bird uses to sense the ground for navigation as it walks with its head lowered. The mandible is mostly ivory-coloured, with part of the upper mandible being bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, zygodactyl (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} is [...] long and weighs [...] The {{nominate}} race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish, {{and there is}} a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance or measurements. Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} is [...] long, with a {{wingspan}} of about [...] and a weight of , making it roughly 10% {{smaller than the}} house sparrow. The adult's crown and nape are rich chestnut, {{and there is a}} kidney-shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek; the chin, throat, and the area between the bill and throat are black. The upperparts are light brown, <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> black, and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars. The legs are pale brown, and the bill is lead-blue in summer, becoming almost black in winter.|$|E

500|$|The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were novel {{features}} for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{commented that the}} film's editing had [...] "a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation." [...] In The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity, author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film's [...] "odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [...] life had become." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tawny owl}} is a robust bird, [...] in length, with an [...] wingspan. Weight {{can range from}} [...] Its large rounded head lacks ear tufts, and the facial disc {{surrounding}} the dark brown eyes is usually rather plain. The nominate race has two morphs which differ in their plumage colour, one form having rufous brown upperparts and the other greyish brown, although intermediates also occur. The underparts of both morphs are whitish and <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> brown. Feathers are moulted gradually between June and December. This species is sexually dimorphic; the female is {{much larger than the}} male, 5% longer and more than 25% heavier.|$|E
500|$|The {{water pipit}} is [...] long and weighs [...] The adult of the {{nominate}} race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly <b>streaked</b> <b>with</b> darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium. The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks.|$|E
