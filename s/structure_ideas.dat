40|$|AbstractThe new Associative Language Description (ALD) model, a {{combination}} of locally testable and constituent <b>structure</b> <b>ideas,</b> is proposed, arguing that in practice it equals context-free (CF) grammars in explanatory adequacy, yet it provides a simple description and it excludes mathematical sets based on counting properties, which are rarely (if ever) used in compiler construction or in computational linguistics. The ALD model has been recently proposed as an approach consistent with current views on brain organization. ALD is a “pure”, i. e., nonterminal-free definition. The strict inclusion of ALD languages in CF languages is proved, based on a lemma which strengthens the Pumping Lemma for CF languages. Basic nonclosure and undecidability properties are considered and {{compared with those of}} CF languages. It is shown that the hardest context-free language is in ALD, that there exists a hierarchy of ALD languages and that each ALD tree language enjoys the noncounting property of parenthesized CF languages. Typical technical languages (Pascal, HTML) can be rather conveniently described by ALD rules...|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of convening {{a group of}} knowledgeable specialists together in a workshop setting to tackle a difficult problem can often be offset by an overabundance of unfocused and rambling discussion and by counterproductive group dynamics. In light of this workshop paradox, we have created a generic workshop framework based on the analytic hierarchy process, that efficiently elicits both workshop content and products. The 2 key components of this workshop structure are: (1) a straw document that is both generic and hierarchical and (2) pair-wise comparisons of elements at each level of the hierarchy. Top-down levels of the generic hierarchy include: primary topics, key questions, and responses to key questions. We applied this workshop structure to elicit and prioritize research needs for large-scale fire disturbances from a large (25 attendees) group of scientist and managers. Advantages of this approach are: (1) it allows for conceptual workshop facilitation and eliminates most traditional facilitation chores, which aim to mitigate undesirable group dynamics, (2) it does not hinder or burden technical discussions, but rather focuses and enhances them, (3) it allows workshop organizers to efficiently collect and <b>structure</b> <b>ideas</b> generated in technical discussions, and (4) it enables statistical comparisons between competing ideas...|$|E
40|$|Secondary storage ("SS") oers a signicantly dierent memory {{organization}} from RAM, {{which most}} of computer science is geared to support. This forces a revision of data structures and algorithms {{on one hand and}} of programming language on the other. Algorithms become simpler, but in the frequent situation that the data structure sizes exceed RAM capacity, even polynomial complexity becomes intractable unless it is sub-quadratic. Languages are obliged to abstract over looping, which presents opportunities for programming at a much higher level than allowed by the Neumann bottleneck " that restricts most languages geared for RAM. This paper describes the challenges of developing data structures and language which operate at the level demanded by SS. We look at some benets of abstracting over looping: enormous reductions in code for building large systems, intrinsic parallelization, and easy incorporation of the Internet. We note a diversity of SS applications, including expert systems, data mining, and semistructured data, as well as conventional organizational management. We will see that Computer Science SS also has benets for ordinary RAM programming, and will touch on some data <b>structure</b> <b>ideas</b> as illustration...|$|E
40|$|Following {{publication}} of the Willis Report (2012) and the Francis Report (2010, 2013), there is an increasing focus upon how compassionate care is addressed in undergraduate nursing programmes (Cornwell et al., 2013). This poster presentation illustrates an educational initiative involving peer support and nurse educator facilitation as one way of enabling students on undergraduate nursing programmes to consider their understanding and experiences of delivering compassionate care to service users. Peer support in nursing has been taking place informally {{for a long time}} with the “tea break/tear break‟ described by Butterworth (1998) as an example, helping student nurses not only with emotional release but also serving as a feedback mechanism. Whilst it cannot be claimed that this is a new approach to support, many staff peer support mechanisms have died out in the past due to lack of <b>structure,</b> <b>ideas,</b> facilitation, group skills, leadership or motivation (Bond & Holland 1998). The need to learn from mistakes of the past building up stronger structures for such support mechanisms is perhaps more important than ever given the findings of the Francis report (2010, 2013). The introduction of peer support {{at the beginning of a}} nurse’s career embeds this approach as an instinctive and accepted learning activity. As students begin to recognise the contradictions between learning in university and healthcare settings, peer learning and support offers a means of establishing personal and professional approaches for the delivery of person centred compassionate care. Exploring the context and background of compassionate care, the presentation offers a theoretical perspective of practice learning and, in doing so, attempts to articulate the learning that takes place as students consider their understanding of compassionate care...|$|E

40|$|Idea Analysis was {{investigated}} {{to determine its}} ability to organize scientific information and explain the results of specialists 2 ̆ 7 deliberations in designing new clinical trials. Ideas have long been recognized as the engine of creativity. By focusing on the capture of ideas from the scientific literature, idea analysis procedures enable {{the arrangement of the}} information into forms consistent with those developed by subject specialists. The most obvious example is the concept <b>structure.</b> <b>Ideas</b> containing a common frequently occurring term/phrase can be depicted as a primary node in the concept network. Related terms will appear as elements associated with that node. Ideas containing couplets of primary nodal terms/phrases can be used to link nodes, thus, completing the paths in the network. Using this methodology, information specialists can build and maintain knowledge structures for use by students, subject specialists and interested others. In contrast with expert systems, idea analysis does not attempt to duplicate thought processes performed by experts in a subject. Instead, it focuses on the management of ideas and the arrangement of those ideas using organizational models. The application of these techniques to the scientific literature dealing with brain tumors and to clinical trial protocols developed by subject specialists is illustrative. This study showed that, in the brain tumor literature and clinical trial protocols, the idea analysis approach was effective in accomplishing the two tasks required: 1. Organization of complex material into succinct and understandable descriptions [...] tabular and graphic; 2. provision of explanations of expert-derived research strategies and/or plans.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} {{a number of}} {{additive}} and multiplicative multilevel iter-ative methods and preconditioners {{in the setting of}} two-dimensional local mesh refinement. While standard multilevel methods are effective for uniform refinement-based discretizations of elliptic equa-tions, they tend to be less effective for algebraic systems, which arise from discretizations on locally refined meshes, losing their optimal behavior in both storage and computational complexity. Our primary focus here is on Bramble, Pasciak, and Xu (BPX) -style additive and multiplicative mul-tilevel preconditioners, and on various stabilizations of the additive and multiplicative hierarchical basis (HB) method, and their use in the local mesh refinement setting. In parts I and II of this trilogy, it was shown that both BPX and wavelet stabilizations of HB have uniformly bounded con-dition numbers on several classes of locally refined two- and three-dimensional meshes based on fairly standard (and easily implementable) red and red-green mesh refinement algorithms. In this third part of the trilogy, we describe in detail the implementation of these types of algorithms, including detailed discussions of the data structures and traversal algorithms we employ for obtaining optimal storage and computational complexity in our implementations. We show how each of the algorithms can be implemented using standard data types, available in languages such as C and FORTRAN, so that the resulting algorithms have optimal (linear) storage requirements, and so that the resulting multilevel method or preconditioner can be applied with optimal (linear) computational costs. We have successfully used these data <b>structure</b> <b>ideas</b> for both MATLAB and C implementations using the FEtk, an open source finite element software package. We finish the paper with a sequence of numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of a number of BPX and stabilized HB variants for several examples requiring local refinement...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{assessment}} {{is an important}} domain in psychology. The development of nonverbal cognitive assessment devices has been spurred by the increasingly multicultural nature of U. S. society and by legislation calling for early identification and treatment of children with cognitive disabilities. The Leiter-R is a non-verbal test of intelligence designed chiefly for use with language-and cognitively-impaired persons aged 2 - 21. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the Leiter-R was undertaken {{in an effort to}} (a) identify the factor structure of the Leiter-R, (b) verify general visualization (Gv) and fluid reasoning (Gf) as second-level factors in the Leiter-R, and (c) examine evidence for the hypothesis that cognitive abilities become increasingly differentiated with age. The EFA revealed a strong g influence in the Leiter-R, with one-factor model s predominating in each age group studied. General-factor loadings of four core Leiter-R subtests (those subtests common to all age groups) indicated subtests vary in how well they measure g among different age groups. Overall, these results are judged to support the Leiter-R as a g test of intelligence. In contrast to the findings of other researchers (Bos, 1995; Bos, Gridley, 2 ̆ 6 Roid, 1996), only modest evidence was found to verify Gf and Gv as second-level factors in the Leiter-R. However, analyses of certain age groups offered some evidence of a two-factor structure. This evidence offered support for the Leiter-R 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical structure, with separate Gf and Gv factors in the 2 - 5 age group and a distinct spatial visualization factor emerging in the 6 - 10 and 11 - 21 age groups. Little conclusive evidence was found for or against the age differentiation hypothesis. Limitations of the present study were noted, most importantly that not including all Leiter-R subtests in the analysis, which was done for statistical reasons, may have made it more difficult to extract factor <b>structure.</b> <b>Ideas</b> for future research were presented. At the time of this writing, research related to the Leiter-R is ongoing.
