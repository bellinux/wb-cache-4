40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} methodology for accelerated {{testing in the}} area of high-temperature creep and oxidation resistance for thin-gauge superalloy materials. Traditional long-term creep (stress-relaxation) and <b>oxidation</b> <b>tests</b> are completed to establish a baseline. The temperature range used in this study is between 1200 and 1700 °F. The alloys investigated are Incoloy MA 956, Waspaloy, Haynes 214, Haynes 242, Haynes 230, and Incoloy 718. The traditional creep test involves loading the specimens to a constant test mandrel radius of curvature, and measuring the retained radius of curvature as a function of time. The accelerated creep test uses a servohydraulic test machine to conduct single specimen, variable strain-rate load relaxation experiments. Standard metallographic evaluations are used to determine extent and morphology of attack in the traditional <b>oxidation</b> <b>tests,</b> while the accelerated <b>oxidation</b> <b>test</b> utilizes thermogravimetric analysis to obtain oxidation rate data. The traditional long-term creep testing indicates that the mechanically-alloyed material Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes alloy 214 may be suitable for long-term, high-temperature (above 1400 °F) structural applications. The accelerated creep test produced a continuous linear function of log stress versus strain rate which can be used to calculate creep rate. The long-term and traditional <b>oxidation</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that Al 2 O 3 scale formers such as Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes 214 are much more resistant to high-temperature oxidation than Cr 2 O 3 scale formers such as Waspaloy. Both accelerated tests can be completed within roughly one day, and can evaluate multiple test temperatures using standardized single specimens. These simple experiments can be correlated with traditional long-term tests which require years to complete. ...|$|R

This was coupled with examination of specimen cross-sections for cracking and signs of coating degradation. Isothermal oxidation showed sub parabolic oxide growth consistent with the literature. Detailed analysis of oxide thickness showed a normal distribution but with increasing standard deviation with increasing oxidation time. Both bond coats were dual phase, β + γ. The EBPVD applied bond coat only, was found to contain yttrium rich precipitates in the bond coat and TGO. Both coatings showed no increase in surface roughness after either isothermal or thermal cycle testing. Short sub-critical cracks were observed at the TGO/topcoat interface in the HVOF applied bond coat only associated with the flanks of asperities. Coating failure in both coatings occurred at the TGO/bond coat interface on cooling and was likely driven by the thermal expansion mismatch between the TGO, topcoat and substrate. The initial mechanism of crack formation was not determined conclusively but could be a wedge cracking type mechanism. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
