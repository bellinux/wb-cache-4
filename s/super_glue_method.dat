30|$|Cyanoacrylate, {{also called}} <b>super</b> <b>glue,</b> fuming is a {{chemical}} method {{for the detection}} of latent fingermarks on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastic etc. The method relies on the deposition of polymerized cyanoacrylate ester on residues of latent fingermarks.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the parametric uncertainty of artificial neural networks (ANNs) by employing the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (<b>GLUE)</b> <b>method.</b> The ANNs {{are used to}} forecast daily streamflow for three sub-basins of the Rhine Basin (East Alpine, Main, and Mosel) having different hydrological and climatological characteristics. We have obtained prior parameter distributions from 5000 ANNs in the training period to capture the parametric uncertainty and subsequently 125, 000 correlated parameter sets were generated. These parameter sets were used to quantify the uncertainty in the forecasted streamflow in the testing period using three uncertainty measures: percentage of coverage, average relative length, and average asymmetry degree. The {{results indicated that the}} highest uncertainty was obtained for the Mosel sub-basin and the lowest for the East Alpine sub-basin mainly due to hydro-climatic differences between these basins. The prediction results and uncertainty estimates of the proposed methodology were compared to the direct ensemble and bootstrap <b>methods.</b> The <b>GLUE</b> <b>method</b> successfully captured the observed discharges with the generated prediction intervals, especially the peak flows. It was also illustrated that uncertainty bands are sensitive to the selection of the threshold value for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency measure used in the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method</b> by employing the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test...|$|R
40|$|Quantification of {{uncertainty}} of hydrological models has {{attracted much attention}} in the recent hydrological literature. Different results and conclusions have been reported which result {{from the use of}} different methods with different assumptions. In particular, the disagreement between the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) and the Bayesian methods for assessing the uncertainty in conceptual watershed modelling has been widely discussed. What has been mostly criticized is the subjective choice as regards the influence of threshold value, number of sample simulations, and likelihood function in the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method.</b> In this study the impact of threshold values and number of sample simulations on the uncertainty assessment of GLUE is systematically evaluated, and a comprehensive evaluation about the posterior distribution, parameter and total uncertainty estimated by GLUE and a formal Bayesian approach using the Metropolis Hasting (MH) algorithm are performed for two well-tested conceptual hydrological models (WASMOD and DTVGM) in an arid basin from North China. The results show that in the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method,</b> the posterior distribution of parameters and the 95 % confidence interval of the simulated discharge are sensitive to the choice of the threshold value as measured by the acceptable samples rate (ASR). However, when the threshold value in the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method</b> is high enough (i. e., when the ASR value is smaller than 0. 1 %), the posterior distribution of parameters, the 95 % confidence interval of simulated discharge and the percent of observations bracketed by the 95 % confidence interval (P- 95 CI) for the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method</b> approach those values estimated by the Bayesian method for both hydrological models. Second, in the <b>GLUE</b> <b>method,</b> the insufficiency of number of sample simulations will influence the maximum Nash-Sutcliffe (MNS) efficiency value when ASR is fixed. However, as soon as the number of sample simulations increases to 2 x 10 (4) for WASMOD and to 8 x 10 (4) for the DTVGM model the influence of number of sample simulations on the model simulation results becomes of minor importance. Third, the uncertainty in simulated discharges resulting from parameter uncertainty is much smaller than that resulting from the model structure uncertainty for both hydrological models. Fourth, the goodness of model fit as measured by the maximum Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value is nearly the same for the GLUE and the Bayesian methods for both hydrological models. Thus this study provides useful information on the uncertainty assessment of hydrological models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
