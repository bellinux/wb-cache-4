40|$|This paper compares {{strategic}} abstention in ad hoc committees versus standing committees. Ad hoc committees meet {{only once}} and then dissolve, while standing committees. The central finding from {{this study is that}} most of the predictions of <b>swing</b> <b>voter</b> curse theory hold up in large elections conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. There is significant abstention, and significant balancing of partisans by uniformed voters; and vote balancing increases with the partisan imbalance. Elections with no partisan imbalance successfully aggregate information and lead to efficient outcomes. Consistent with <b>swing</b> <b>voter</b> curse theory, this efficiency falls off as partisan imbalance increases, but to a significantly greater extent than is predicted in equilibrium. It is instructive to compare these findings in large elections with results from the elections reported in Battaglini et al. (2007). All of the qualitative results are the same, concerning the comparative statics, balancing, and abstention. One slight difference is that there was less (irrational) voting for α in the small elections than in the large elections, except for the π = 5 / 9 m = 0 treatment, where we observed 20...|$|R

Monash University Publishing; Clayton, Victoria. 2015. [URL] chapter addresses Liberal and Labor Party efforts to understand <b>swinging</b> <b>voters</b> and how both parties use polling and focus groups to aid campaigning, particularly in marginal electorates. Internal party documents and accounts of interviews with party ‘campaign professionals’ have been used to illustrate the evolution of sophisticated polling methods. My argument questions the obsessive use of polls and the implications for party organisation of the carefully stage-managed nature of modern election campaigns. Arguably the work of campaign professionals tends to foster such a high degree of cynicism among voters that more votes are probably lost than are won by their efforts. The assumptions made by campaign professionals about voters may, however, lack firm foundation. This chapter questions the emphasis that campaign professionals have placed on the <b>swinging</b> <b>voter</b> and further considers how the stress on opinion polls has affected the internal dynamics of modern parties, especially in relation to leadership...|$|R
25|$|The ninth congress, {{which opened}} on March26, {{began with an}} {{extraordinary}} session of the Congress of People's Deputies taking up discussions of emergency measures to defend the constitution, including impeachment of President Yeltsin.

Yeltsin narrowly survived an impeachment vote on March28, votes for impeachment falling 72 short of the 689 votes needed for a 2/3 majority. The similar proposal to dismiss Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was defeated by a wider margin (339 in favour of the motion), though 614 deputies had initially been in favour of including the re-election of the chairman in the agenda, a tell-tale sign of the weakness of Khasbulatov's own positions (517 votes for would have sufficed to dismiss the speaker).|$|E
25|$|Following the {{announcement}} that Haider would return to federal politics, analysts held different opinions on the likely effects of this change.

The race for third place between the Greens and the FPÖ was seen to be balanced (as Haider might draw votes from the FPÖ and the LIF from the Greens) or slightly in favour of the Greens. One analyst even expected that Haider would attempt to get the FPÖ to adopt a partner relationship with the BZÖ (similar to the Christian Democratic Union–Christian Social Union of Bavaria alliance in Germany), with the BZÖ only operating in Carinthia and the FPÖ in the rest of Austria, after the 2008 election.

However, in general, the opinion was that Kemp was helpful to the ticket's chances of catching Bill Clinton, and Kemp's advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign.
