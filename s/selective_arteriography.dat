40|$|BACKGROUND: Pseudoaneurysm {{is a rare}} but {{potentially}} life-threatening vascular complication of acute pancreatitis, with a mortality rate of 20 - 43 % in untreated patients. The treatment usually involves trans-arterial embolization or surgical resection. CASE REPORT: A 44 -year-old man {{with a history of}} acute pancreatitis developed a pseudoaneurysm of the pancreatic tail, diagnosed as a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm by CT. <b>Selective</b> <b>arteriography</b> performed with the purpose of embolization did not reveal the pseudoaneurysm. The day after, under CT guidance, human thrombin (1, 000 IU) was injected inside the aneurysmatic sac with its complete occlusion. A control MRI 6 months later confirmed a complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous coagulation of a post-pancreatitis pseudoaneurysm is a relatively easy and safe procedure, and it can be considered as an alternative to trans-arterial embolization when the pseudoaneurysm cannot be visualized on <b>selective</b> <b>arteriography...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the accuracy and safety of <b>selective</b> anterograde coronary <b>arteriography</b> for the identification of the origin and branching pattern of the three main coronary arteries in neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries. Background. Definition of coronary artery anatomy is important in neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries who are considered for the arterial switch operation. Balloon occlusion bortography defines coronary artery anatomy in most but not all cases. We have described a technique for <b>selective</b> anterograde coronary <b>arteriography.</b> Methods. Between March 1987 and May 1991, 17 neonates underwent <b>selective</b> anterograde coronary <b>arteriography</b> and 29 patients had balloon occlusion aortography. After venous access was gained, a mesenteric catheter was used to engage the coronary ostia for contrast injection. All angiograms were reviewed by three independent observers and the coronary artery diagnoses were compared with operative findings. Complications with the catheterization procedure were also recorded. Results. The accuracy of defining coronary artery anatomy with <b>selective</b> anterograde coronary <b>arteriography</b> (98 Â± 2 %) was significantly (p 0. 05) and was related to transient bradycardia induced by catheter manipulation in the right ventricle. No patient in either study group experienced cardiac ischemia.

40|$|Background. Small bowel hemorrhages {{are rare}} and account for 2 - 10 % of all {{gastrointestinal}} bleedings. In case that surgery is necessary, {{identification of the}} bleeding site {{is the most important}} problem. Case report. We presented here the case of a 65 -year old man, admitted for urgent care of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. After reanimation and normalization of vital parameters, <b>selective</b> <b>arteriography</b> was done. A contrast extravasation site was identified at the level of jejunal branches of a. mesenterica superior and labeled by means of methylene blue application.

Bleeding caused by small bowel angiodysplasia is a significant diagnostic problem in cases in whom urgent surgery is required.

40|$|Anomalous {{origin of}} the {{circumflex}} coronary artery from the proximal right coronary artery or right sinus of Valsalva was recognized in 20 of 2996 patients undergoing <b>selective</b> coronary <b>arteriography</b> (0. 67 %). The relative frequency of this anomaly demands {{a high level of}} anticipation during the performance of <b>selective</b> coronary <b>arteriography</b> to assure that an adequate study has been obtained. Failure to recognize and properly demonstrate the anomaly can be hazardous to patient management. Two angiographic signs have proved reliable in recognizing the anomalous artery before its selective demonstration. These signs are a profile view of the artery behind the aortic root during left ven-triculography (the-aortic root sign") and recognition of absent arterial inflow to a significant area of the posterior lateral left ventricle during selective injections of the main left coronary artery (the 'sign of non-perfused myocardium"). These angiographic signs are described and the clinical implications of proper demonstration of the anomalous circumflex coronary artery are discussed. Additional Indexing Words: Coronary arteriography RIGIN of the left circumflex coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva is a well known anatomic variation which has no clinical significance per se. Recognition and angiographic demonstration of the anomalous artery assumes high priority, however, in patients undergoing evaluation for direct coronary artery surgery or prosthetic valve replacement. This anomaly has been recognized in 0. 67 % of patients undergoing <b>selective</b> coronary <b>arteriography</b> in our laboratory. Certain angiographic signs during left ventriculography and selective opacification of the left coronary artery have proved reliable in recognizing the presence of the anomaly, thus allowing its proper demonstration.
