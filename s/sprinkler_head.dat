50|$|Fire {{sprinkler}} systems are installed in {{all types of}} buildings, commercial and residential. They are usually located at ceiling level and are connected to a reliable water source, most commonly city water. A typical sprinkler system operates when heat {{at the site of}} a fire causes a glass component in the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head</b> to fail, thereby releasing the water from the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head.</b> This means that only the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head</b> at the fire location operates - not all the sprinklers on a floor or in a building. Sprinkler systems help to reduce the growth of a fire, thereby increasing life safety and limiting structural damage.|$|E

50|$|Healthcare cubicle {{curtains}} are factory {{made and}} constructed from different woven fabrics stitched {{together with the}} top portion of open mesh of the curtain {{as required by the}} National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-701 large & small scale). The suggested fire prevention and regulatory codes are followed by local, state and Federal fire marshals with Healthcare patient safety in mind. The suggestion for mesh is seventy-percent (70%) open allowing for ceiling <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head</b> water penetration in event of fire. The vertical length requirement for mesh size is determined by the number of horizontal inches of the curtain ceiling track from the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head.</b> Example: If ceiling track is six (6") inches from ceiling <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head,</b> the required vertical length of the mesh is approximately six (6") inches. The maximum vertical mesh length required is eighteen inches (18") regardless of additional distance from the ceiling <b>sprinkler</b> <b>head.</b> The code for the vertical mesh requirement is found under National Fire Protection Agency code NFPA-701/large and small scale (NFPA-701). The lower portion of the cubicle curtain is opaque to ensure patient privacy. Cubicle curtain factory made fabric with an antimicrobial finish is not required by code but is becoming more common in medical treatment facilities to reduce the spread of germs within a facility. All cubicle curtains are required to be fire-retardant by NFPA code. The fire-retardant properties can be topically applied and/or inherent {{to a wide range of}} synthetic fibers used for cubicle curtains.|$|E

It was questioned whether <b>sprinkler</b> <b>heads</b> would be activated {{in the case of}} a fire. A fire modelling technique was applied to estimate the actuation time of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>heads</b> located in the atrium ceiling. The response time of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>heads</b> to a fire in a shop at a high level adjacent to the atrium roof was calculated. A self-developed FORTRAN code together with the CFD model CFX 4. 2 were used to simulate the atrium fire environment.

40|$|The U. S.

As the air velocities were increased, there were significant shifts in the total coverage areas and in the density distribution patterns, {{as well as in}} the maximum coverage densities, for all types of heads. The pendent and upright heads exhibited upstream shifts in total coverage in the direction of the airflow ranging from 4 to 6 ft, while the downstream coverage distances were extended up to 12 ft at the 800 ft/min airflow. The shift in upstream coverage distance for the sidewall heads ranged from 6 to 12 ft, while the downstream coverage was extended up to 22 ft at 800 ft/min. The results showed that airflow can have a significant effect on the coverage characteristics of automatic <b>sprinkler</b> <b>heads</b> and needs to be considered in the design of effective sprinkler fire suppression systems for ventilated areas.
