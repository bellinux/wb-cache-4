40|$|Standing column wells (SCWs) {{have the}} {{potential}} to deliver much higher rates of heat transfer to geothermal heating and cooling systems in buildings via heat pumps than can conventional vertical borehole heat exchange arrays. The development of a numerical model for clusters of standing column wells is described in this article. The model is three-dimensional, dynamic, and solves the governing equations using a finite-volume discretization scheme with a fully implicit algorithm. The slower-acting field equations are solved using a wider time interval than that used for the faster-acting well equations, and the two sets of equations are coupled through the field equation source terms. A groundwater bleed feature is incorporated. The model has been verified thermally and hydraulically using existing field data. Two test cases have been applied to reveal the advantages of using SCWs in U. K. conditions, competing with the conventional closed-loop system of vertical borehole heat exchangers. Results of the applications suggest that SCWs can deliver substantially higher rates of heat transfer than conventional closed loop borehole heat exchanger arrays, especially when groundwater bleed is operational. With appropriate earth conditions in the United Kingdom, SCWs can deliver space heating and direct cooling, for example, chilled beam or chilled ceiling, successfully to offer a substantial <b>saving</b> <b>on</b> carbon <b>emissions.</b> Another important practical consequence of this is that far less geotechnical drilling is needed when using standing column wells than is the case with closed-loop arrays...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{literature}} {{review of the}} large-scale ecosystem services (ESS) which green roofs and walls can provide for cities. A short overview of 17 ESS’s is given. Much {{research has been done}} on ESS’s meeting immediate physical human needs and providing long-term physical and socioeconomic security. Services meeting social and psychological needs have been less studied. In general, ground-level urban vegetation like parks can provide a higher level of ESS’s than green roofs and walls, but the latter are a valuable addition where ground-level room is scarce. Of roof and wall types, intensive green roofs provide the highest level of ESS’s. Extensive green roofs mainly satisfy physical needs, and green walls mainly satisfy social and psychological needs. Green roofs and walls can probably contribute the most to the reduction of the Urban Heat Island effect, and to the processing of annual rainfall. It is not possible yet to translate all ESS’s into a financial value, for easy comparison of their impact. Recent research points to health benefits and <b>savings</b> <b>on</b> energy and <b>emissions</b> as candidates for the largest effects of green roofs and walls in financial term...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} investigating the ageing behaviour {{and performance of}} different warm mix asphalt (WMA) pavement mixtures also called energy reduced pavements. The mixtures were either prepared in the laboratory or taken directly from a mixing plant. The study compared the rutting and fatigue behaviours of unaged material in comparison to long term laboratory aged material. In order to conduct the long term ageing, a special laboratory ageing protocol with different heating, cooling and watering cycles had been developed. The investigation revealed a quite controversial rutting behavior {{which could not be}} explained with the available data. While most aged energy reduced pavements showed increased rutting for other mixtures, lower rut depths could be found. As opposed to this finding, fatigue and stiffness of all aged energy reduced pavement samples compared to unaged samples improved significantly. The overall results led {{to the conclusion that the}} ageing of energy reduced pavement simulated in the laboratory is not very critical regarding their mechanical performance. Therefore, it was confirmed that the application of this type of pavement provides a good solution for <b>saving</b> <b>on</b> CO 2 <b>emissions.</b> Another advantage is that by using energy reduced pavements the road construction season can be significantly prolonged...|$|R
