5000|$|Theoretically, a spherical {{pressure}} vessel has approximately twice {{the strength of}} a cylindrical {{pressure vessel}} with the same wall thickness, and is the ideal shape to hold internal pressure. However, a spherical shape is difficult to manufacture, and therefore more expensive, so most pressure vessels are cylindrical with 2:1 semi-elliptical heads or end caps on each end. Smaller pressure vessels are assembled from a pipe and two covers. For cylindrical vessels with a diameter up to 600 mm (NPS of 24 in), it is possible to use <b>seamless</b> <b>pipe</b> for the shell, thus avoiding many inspection and testing issues, mainly the nondestructive examination of radiography for the long seam if required.

The experiment was carried out at the last step of the sizing process for seamless pipes. The corners of a product become sharper as the magnitude of total reduction increases.

40|$|Mill {{rolling process}} of <b>seamless</b> <b>pipe</b> was {{simulated}} {{with the aim}} of applying grain refinement through the formation of intragranular ferrite on VN precipitated inside austenitic grains, for production of as-hot rolled microstructures, which are currently attained only by in-line normalising. Tests were performed on V+N and V+N(Ti) steels using two types of schedules with long and short transfer/heating times prior to sizing between 930 - 830 °C. It was found that transfer/heating time between high temperature rolling and low temperature sizing could be used for precipitation of VN in austenite which in turn can nucleate intragranular ferrite grains on cooling. To facilitate the precipitation process of VN a sub-micro-addition of Ti was used which also helps to restrain austenite grain growth during piercing and pipe forming. Subsequent V(C,N) precipitation of the remaining vanadium in the ferrite contributes precipitation strengthening. Hot rolling followed by intragranular ferrite formation in 0. 1 %V- 0. 015 %N- 0. 005 %Ti steel is able to develop a fine ferrite-pearlite microstructure with an average ferrite grain size of 7 um...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Infrared {{thermography}} uses {{infrared energy}} radiated from any objects above absolute zero temperature, {{and the range}} of its application has been constantly broadened. As one of the active test techniques detecting radiant energy generated when energy is applied to an object, ultrasound infrared thermography is a method of detecting defects through hot spots occurring at a defect area when 15 ~ 100 kHz of ultrasound is excited to an object. This technique is effective in detecting a wide range affected by ultrasound and vibration in real time. Especially, it is really effective when a defect area is minute. Therefore, this study conducted thermography through lock-in signal processing when an actual defect exists inside the austenite STS 304 <b>seamless</b> <b>pipe,</b> which simulates thermal fatigue cracks in a nuclear power plant pipe.
