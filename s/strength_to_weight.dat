25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, {{or at least}} has a better <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|The topological {{dependence}} of mechanical properties in solids {{is of interest}} in disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science. Electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of molecules and elementary units in materials. The compressive strength of crumpled topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> of such structures that are mostly empty space. Topology is of further significance in Contact mechanics where the {{dependence of}} stiffness and friction on the dimensionality of surface structures {{is the subject of}} interest with applications in multi-body physics.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 the Navy {{announced}} that its new aircraft direction frigate HMS Llandaff {{was to be}} equipped with nylon and Terylene ropes instead of the traditional wire ropes. It was said that commercial shipping had been doing so for some time. Compared with wire they gave much more <b>strength</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>weight,</b> retained flexibility in the cold, withstood sudden shocks, and retained strength in the wet.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> explore muscle <b>strength</b> and its {{relation}} to exercise habits in Japanese. We used data from 3, 018 men and 6, 881 women aged 20 - 69 years and not using medications in a cross-sectional study. Exercise habits and muscle strength, i. e. grip strength and leg strength, were measured. Age-related changes in muscle strength were noted. Exercise habits were found in 984 men (32. 6 %) and 1, 664 women (24. 2 %). For subjects of both sexes over 50 years, grip strength was significantly decreased with age. However, the ratio of leg <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> body <b>weight</b> significantly decreased with age as early as 30 years in men and 40 years in women. Grip strength, leg strength and the ratio of leg <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> body <b>weight</b> in subjects with exercise habits were significantly higher than those without exercise habits after adjusting for age in both sexes. This standard mean value may provide a useful database for evaluating muscle strength in Japanese adult subjects. </p...|$|R
40|$|The obvious {{advantage}} of composite materials {{is in their}} high <b>strength</b> and stiffness <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratios. The anisotropy of the material allows <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> be utilized in a given design direction without the addition of extra weight resulting from strength in unnecessary directions, as is usually the case in isotropic materials. The use of these materials can yield dramatic weight savings over their more conventional metallic counterparts which can reduce fuel consumption and allow for carrying additional fuel or cargo...|$|R
25|$|The Solar Challenger was {{designed}} to be sturdier, more powerful, and more maneuverable than the Gossamer Penguin so as to be able to withstand sustained high-altitude flight and normal turbulence. It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3inches wide and 17inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a common shaft to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller. The design incorporated advanced synthetic materials with very high <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratios, including Kevlar, Nomex, Delrin, Teflon, and Mylar, all supplied by the aircraft's sponsor, Dupont.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantages}} {{of this type}} of construction include smooth surfaces (without the drag of rivets), the ability to do compound curves, and the ability to place fiberglass or carbon fiber in optimal positions, orientations, and quantities. Drawbacks include the need to work with chemical products as well as low strength in directions perpendicular to fiber. Composites provide superb <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight.</b> Material stiffness dependent upon direction (as opposed to equal in all directions, as with metals) allows for advanced [...] "elastic tailoring" [...] of composite parts.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{aluminum}} structures {{have shown}} to be more vulnerable to fatigue, either due to ineffective alloys, or imperfect welding technique being used. This contrasts with some steel and titanium alloys, which have clear fatigue limits and are easier to weld or braze together. [...] However, some of these disadvantages have since been mitigated with more skilled labor capable of producing better quality welds, automation, and the greater accessibility to modern aluminum alloys. Aluminum's attractive <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio as compared to steel, and certain mechanical properties, assure it a place among the favored frame-building materials.|$|E
50|$|When platypodes attack, {{they drive}} their hind legs {{together}} with considerable force {{so that the}} spurs are embedded in the flesh caught between and if venom is being produced, a few milliliters are injected by repeated jabbing. The spurs have enough <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> support the <b>weight</b> of the platypus, which often hangs from the victim, requiring assistance for removal.|$|R
40|$|The report {{describes}} a structure for a strong, lightweight corrugated sheet. The sheet is planar or curved {{and includes a}} plurality of corrugation segments, each segment being comprised of a generally U-shaped corrugation with a part-cylindrical crown and cap strip, and straight side walls and with secondary corrugations oriented {{at right angles to}} said side walls. The cap strip is bonded to the crown and the longitudinal edge of said cap strip extends beyond edge at the intersection between said crown and said side walls. The high <b>strength</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> of the structure makes it desirable for use in aircraft or spacecraft...|$|R
50|$|Many viscous liquids and solids {{stored in}} steel drums require {{considerable}} energy input prior to removing from the container for processing. It is sometimes beneficial to add heat {{directly to the}} underside of the drum, using a bast heater. These are available in various constructions, using induction heating, steam or silicone heater mats inside a body with sufficient mechanical <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> support the <b>weight</b> of a full drum.|$|R
2500|$|Titanium {{is perhaps}} the most exotic and {{expensive}} metal commonly used for bicycle frame tubes. It combines many desirable characteristics, including a high <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. Reasonable stiffness (roughly half that of steel) allows for many titanium frames to be constructed with [...] "standard" [...] tube sizes comparable to a traditional steel frame, although larger diameter tubing is becoming more common for more stiffness. Titanium is more difficult to machine than steel or aluminum, which sometimes limits its uses and also raises the effort (and cost) associated with this type of construction. As titanium frames are usually more expensive than similar steel or aluminium alloy frames, the cost puts them out of reach for most cyclists.|$|E
2500|$|Based on his {{experience}} with the Albatross, Geoffrey de Havilland believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification. Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (H-engine) as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of aluminium and steel but supplies of wood-based products were [...] "adequate." [...] Although inferior in Tension (physics), the <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{materials}} used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels {{have been used for}} frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind. More expensive bikes use carbon fibre due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than [...]|$|E
60|$|From these niches {{the workmen}} now {{suspended}} short ladders of twisted crimson silk, of sufficient <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> bear the <b>weight</b> of a man. They affixed these to heavy steel rings imbedded in {{the bases of}} the columns, and when the ladders were in position, they hung down low enough, that a man--standing on the ledge below--could just contrive to seize the ends and to swing himself aloft, up into the niche.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is increasing {{its use of}} composite materials because of their high: <b>strength</b> and stiffness <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratios. These attributes not only provide a direct incentive but have a “multiplier ” effect that operates {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and engine weight. In addition these materials possess other desirable properties such as: low thermal expansion, resistance to fatigue and corrosion. In the next generation of aircraft advanced composite materials could constitute a substantial portion of an airframe structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fibre metal {{laminates}} (FMLs) are hybrid materials {{based on}} stacked arrangements of several thin metal layers bonded {{with layers of}} a fibre-reinforced composite material. They offer high <b>strength</b> and stiffness <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio, and excellent fatigue resistance when compared to monolithic aluminium. In this paper a robust and computationally efficient predictive model which can capture the dynamic non-linear behaviour of FMLs using the finite element code Abaqus/Explicit is presented. Numerical predictions are in good agreement with experimental data on the back face-displacement and post-damage observations...|$|R
2500|$|The basic IU {{structure}} {{is a short}} cylinder, 36inches high and [...] in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material [...] thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure. The top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich. This type of construction was selected for its high <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio, acoustical insulation, and thermal conductivity properties. The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall {{and the weight of}} the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the Launch Escape Tower). To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft protective rings, 6inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels. These were removed in the course of stacking the IU into the Saturn vehicle. The structure was manufactured by North American Rockwell in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Edward A. Beasley was the I.U. Program Manager.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{weight of a}} shell-plated structure can be reduced in numerous ways. The current investigation presents an example of innovative lightweight design of the pontoon of an offshore platform by utilisation of corrugated structure. Corrugated shell plating is compared with a conventional stiffened panel with respect <b>to</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>weight</b> and cost. For this purpose, an optimisation methodology is developed for shell-plated marine structures. The procedure enables the analysis/comparison of various (structural) solutions with regard <b>to</b> <b>strength</b> characteristics, <b>weight</b> and cost. Here, strength characteristics include ultimate tensile strength, buckling stability and fatigue life analyses. Linear elastic finite-element analyses are carried out to generate input to the structural characteristics studies, which involve several design criteria according to classification rules. The results show that in competition with the traditional stiffened panel, corrugated shell-plated structure {{can be used as}} the more lightweight design solution. It can be manufactured and installed at a lower cost. Finally, the structural strength characteristics analyses show that, when designed properly, ABS and DNV classification rules are fulfilled without compromising with the safety margins...|$|R
40|$|Hollow {{concrete}} blocks {{are one of}} {{the widely}} used building elements of masonry structures in whichthey are normally loaded under combined action of shear and compression. Accordingly and due to theirstructural importance, the present study intends to numerically search for an optimum shape of such blocks. The optimality index is selected to be the ratio of block’s failure <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> its <b>weight,</b> a non-dimensionalparameter, which needs to be maximized. The nonlinear analysis has been done using a homemade code writtenbased on the recently developed Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) for the meso-scale simulation ofconcrete. This numerical approach accounts for the different aspects of concrete’s complex behavior such astensile fracturing, cohesive and frictional shearing and also its nonlinear compressive response. The modelparameters were calibrated against previously reported experimental data. Various two-core configurations forthe hollow blocks are examined, compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Griffin and Tversky (1992) {{suggest that}} individuals, when formulating {{posterior}} probabilities {{based on the}} available evidence, tend to overreact to {{a new piece of}} evidence's <b>strength</b> while underreacting <b>to</b> the relative importance of its weight. We test this prediction using the college football betting market, a market that is commonly employed in tests for efficiency and rationality. Using average points in excess of the spread and streak against the spread as measures for strength and weight, respectively, we find that bettors overreact <b>to</b> <b>strength</b> and underreact <b>to</b> <b>weight.</b> These results are consistent with the predictions of Griffin and Tversky, {{as well as with the}} findings of Sorescu and Subrahmanyam (2006) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) in financial market settings. Our work also provides insight into how behavioral biases might affect price-formation processes in other markets. ...|$|R
50|$|Strength/weight ratio - Construction {{materials}} are commonly categorized by their <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio, or specific strength. This {{is defined as}} the strength of a material over its density. This gives an engineer an indication as to how useful the material is in comparison to its weight, with the weight being a direct indication of its cost (typically) and ease of construction. Concrete is typically ten times stronger in compression than in tension, giving it a higher <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio in compression, only.|$|E

40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in components of various components of industrial equipment because of their superior material properties like high stiffness <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio and high impact strength and fracture toughness while compared to the conventional material. Due to the concepts of high <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> low <b>weight</b> ratio, Al 7075 was extensively applied in aircraft engine and wings. Even if Al 7075 has higher hardness, higher strength, excellent wear resistance, and high-temperature corrosion protection, it {{is in need of}} further enhancement of properties for increasing its applicability. This paper presents the mechanical behavior of aluminium 7075 reinforced with Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Titanium Carbide (TiC) through powder metallurgy route. These specimens were produced by powder metallurgy method. The hybrid composite was made by Al 7075 alloy as the matrix with Silicon Carbide and Titanium Carbide as reinforcement. Silicon Carbide and Titanium Carbide are mixed in different weight ratio based on the design matrix formulated through a statistical tool, namely, Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Enhanced mechanical properties have been obtained with 90 % of Al 7075, 4 % of TiC, and 8 % of SiC composition in the composite. Coefficient of friction appears to be more which has been determined by ring compression test...|$|R

The fabric made a minor structural contribution in tension but none in compression, and was there for aerodynamic reasons only. By considering the structure {{as a whole and}} not just the sum of its parts, monocoque construction integrated the skin and frame into a single load-bearing shell with significant improvements <b>to</b> <b>strength</b> and <b>weight.</b>|$|R

50|$|They provide {{extremely}} good <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratios, {{but are also}} very expensive.

40|$|The {{wellbore}} stability analysis during underbalance {{drilling operation}} leads to avoiding risky problems. These problems include (1) rock failure due to stresses changes (concentration) {{as a result}} of losing the original support of removed rocks and (2) wellbore collapse due to lack of support of hydrostatic fluid column. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to simulate the wellbore stability by incorporating finite element modelling and thermoporoelastic environment to predict the instability conditions. Analytical solutions for stress distribution for isotropic and anisotropic rocks are presented to validate the presented model. Moreover, distribution of time dependent shear stresses around the wellbore is presented to be compared with rock shear <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> select appropriate <b>weight</b> of mud for safe underbalance drilling...|$|R
50|$|One {{significant}} {{way in which}} different versions vary is in the arrangement for releasing the spikes for their lethal drop. This depends on the story that is built around the trick {{as part of the}} performance. Sometimes it is presented as having a timing device automatically release the spikes, while other performers have their assistants appear to cut through a securing cable or merely let go of the cable at the appropriate moment. In many performances, the rope which supports the spikes in their raised position is set alight, releasing the spikes when it has apparently burned through {{to the point where it}} no longer has the <b>strength</b> <b>to</b> support the <b>weight</b> of the spikes.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is increasing {{its use of}} composite materials because of their: high <b>strength</b> and stiffness <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> ratio, low thermal expansion and resistance to fatigue and corrosion. Furthermore, their elastic and thermal properties can be tailored to suit anticipated service loads. Unfortunately, {{the very nature of}} these fibre reinforced polymers makes them prone to several types of damage. Among these damage modes, interlamina disbonding, or delamination, {{has been found to be}} the most serious. This form of damage can be induced by relatively low energy impacts such as a carelessly dropped tool, runway stones, hail and once started the region of damage can grow with the load cycling incurred in normal operation...|$|R
