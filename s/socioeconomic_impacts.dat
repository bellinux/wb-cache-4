I employed a questionnaire with a likert response scale as my research tool, which resulted in quantitative data. By statistically examining the quantitative data, I determine the overall impact of the dam, as well as variables that influence impact including: urban versus rural location, and occupation based on industry sector.

40|$|Abstract In many {{developing}} countries, natural resource management {{is based on}} traditional, expert-based methods that often exclude a variety of stakeholders. This paper presents a conceptual model and methodology that represent {{a first step toward}} a more integrated evaluation and management of large basins. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impact</b> of the application of secondary water quality regulations in the Aysén River Basin of Southern Chile. We employ the concept of physical, ecological and social (PHES) -system as a conceptual framework. Three indices based on this framework were created to characterize different aspects of the Aysén Basin: an environmental vulnerability index, an index of the water quality impact of the different economic sectors, and an index that quantifies the economic contribution of these sectors. Finally the three indices were combined as a measure of the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impact</b> of the proposed regulations in what we referred to as the ‘applied assessment model’. Our results suggest that the applied regulations would have little <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impact</b> on the Aysén Basin. Finally we discuss challenges to integrated watershed assessment in the context of developing countries...|$|R

50|$|The Aymara {{people who}} have lived in this region since before colonial times have a special bond with the {{environment}} and landscape of the park. However, some may question the effectiveness of protected areas when considering <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> on surrounding communities. Regulating the use of protected land may harm the livelihoods and cultures {{of those people who}} cherish it the most. However, recent studies in Bolivia have shown no evidence that the establishment of protected areas has exacerbated poverty. If anything, these studies conclude, estimates indicate that communities that are affected by protected areas have experienced greater levels of poverty reduction when compared to similar unaffected communities. Therefore, the presence of Sajama National Park and its management committee may help the Aymara people, giving them power to protect their environment and the organisms that inhabit it.|$|E

50|$|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization {{launched}} a major project titled “Strategic Strengthening of Flood Warning and Management Capacity of Pakistan” (project period: 2011-2014, project cost: US$3.6 million), {{under the leadership}} of Prof. Shahbaz Khan (hydrologist), in cooperation with the Government of Japan. Primary objective of the proposed project was to reduce human and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> of flooding in Pakistan, to improve the social, economic, and ecological benefits of floods, and to foster safer human settlements near flood plains. Accomplishing this objective required enabling the country’s capacity to deal with floods and watershed management in a holistic manner by developing around three inter-related pillars i.e. strategic augmenting of flood forecasting and hazard maps, data sharing platforms, and capacity development. These pillars were further divided into five components which incorporated short-term and medium-term interventions to provide the much needed support for immediate strengthening of early warning systems, while building on lessons learned from the 2010 floods to address the long-term forecasting, disaster management and data sharing issues. Project is now successfully complete.|$|E

Based on qualitative interviews and observations, this paper looks at the socioeconomic benefits of ecotourism in a local community in the Monarch Butterfly Reserve in Mexico. It was found that ecotourism replaced most of the economic activities in the locality; the use of forest resources for individual consumption and local trade was largely replaced by ecotourism-related activities. Benefits included locals’ consciousness of natural resources and a more systematic organisation of economic activities. Acknowledging that qualitative methods somehow limit the generalisation of these findings, practical implications for the destination are suggested...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts</b> arising from the oil pollutions in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria, {{including}} a possible solution. Nigeria is a developing country with inherent government failures in legal enforcement, and petroleum companies are unable to comply with pertinent petroleum-related legislation. The study target oil spillage and gas flaring as the principal petroleum-related pollutions, and conducts a field study to determine the pollution impacts on the physical environment. The field study covered two oil and gas-hosting communities and the effects of gas flaring and oil spillage were studied and analysed. Farming and fishery are the main sources of livelihood in the study areas, likewise other oil and gas-hosting communities in the Niger Delta, and impacts on farming and fishery will impact on their livelihood. The study is multidimensional and therefore leans on scientific, law and social methods to prove to achieve its aim and objectives. It is necessary to investigate through laboratory experiments on how pollutions affect the physical environment before resulting to <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts.</b> The laboratory experiments are justified because they are the only scientific method to know how the pollutions impact on the soil, water and air, which negatively affect agriculture and fishery, and thereby causing <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts.</b> The study in addition conducts a secondary method of data collection through questionnaire technique to sample the opinions of the oil-bearing communities. Both the primary and the secondary data are presented in chapter three and research findings in chapter four. The study presents a legal argument (chapter 4. 3. 1) to attest community perceptions and claims. The major conclusions are firstly that oil-related environmental problems have <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>impacts.</b> Secondly, that solution can be sought through adequate regulatory measures, such as establishing an independent mediating institution, such as an environmental ombudsman, and creating a specialized environmental court or other adjudications...|$|E
