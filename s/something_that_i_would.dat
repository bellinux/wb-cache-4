On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ...

2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{said the}} minister, making himself heard through the {{approving}} murmur; [...] "but I stand {{in this place}} only to ask {{to be allowed to}} leave it. The friendly feeling which has been expressed toward me in the vote upon the resolution you have just rejected is all that reconciles me to its defeat. Its adoption might have spared me a duty which I find painful. But perhaps it is best that I should discharge it. As to the sermon which called forth that resolution it is only just to say that I intended no personalities in it, and I humbly entreat any one who felt himself aggrieved to believe me." [...] Every one looked at Gerrish to see how he took this; he must have felt it the part of self-respect not to change countenance. [...] "My desire in that discourse was, as always, to present the truth as I had seen it, and try to make it a help to all. But I am by no means sure that the author of the resolution was wrong in arraigning me before you for neglecting a very vital part of Christianity in my ministrations here. I think with him, that those who have made an open profession of Christ have a claim to the consolation of His promises, and to the support which good men have found in the mysteries of faith; and I ask his patience and that of others who feel that I have not laid sufficient stress upon these. My shortcoming is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have you overlook in any survey of my ministry among you; and I am not here now to defend that ministry in any point of view. As I look back over it, {{by the light of the}} one ineffable ideal, it seems only a record of failure and defeat." [...] He stopped, and a sympathetic dissent ran through the meeting. [...] "There have been times when I was ready to think that the fault was not in me, but in my office, in the church, in religion. We all have these moments of clouded vision, in which we ourselves loom up in illusory grandeur above the work we have failed to do. But it is in no such error that I stand before you now. Day after day it has been borne in upon me that I had mistaken my work here, and that I ought, if there was any truth in me, to turn from it for reasons which I will give at length should I be spared to preach in this place next Sabbath. I should have willingly acquiesced if our parting had come in the form of my dismissal at your hands. Yet I cannot wholly regret that it has not taken that form, and that in offering my resignation, as I shall formally do to those empowered by the rules of our society to receive it, I can make it a means of restoring concord among you. It would be affectation in me to pretend that I did not know of the dissension which has had my ministry for its object if not its cause; and I earnestly hope that with my withdrawal that dissension may cease, and that this church may become a symbol before the world of the peace of Christ. I conjure such of my friends as have been active in my behalf to unite with their brethren in a cause which can alone merit their devotion. Above all things I beseech you to be at peace one with another. Forbear, forgive, submit, remembering that strife for the better part can only make it the worse, and that for Christians there can be no rivalry but in concession and self-sacrifice." ...|$|E

We have got to respect the {{conventions}} and delusions of the public to a certain extent. An article written as you would naturally write it would {{be regarded as a}} fake and an imposition. Remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth. Write in as simple, plain and unembellished a style as you know how. Make your sentences short. Put in as much realism and as many facts as possible. Where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can. Give it LIFE and the vitality of FACTS.|$|R

During this period, Keel’s paintings and photography were exhibited in established galleries and museums throughout Europe and the United States. Speaking in an interview about his greatest influences he said, “As strange as it might seem, most of my inspiration comes from Los Angeles. You may find its irony, sadness, its absurd beauty and childish naïveté in my entire body of work. Here is where I think I will always create something new again and force myself to overcome the fear of trying <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be afraid of exploring in other hemispheres.” ...|$|E
5000|$|It was Dolly Casella, a close friend, who {{introduced}} Rainer {{to the dance}} classes of Edith Stephen, a modern dancer.

5000|$|Of [...] "Papa Won't Leave You, Henry," [...] Cave said in 2005, [...] "I {{like that}} song a lot. That {{was another one}} written in Brazil. It's this sprawling, lyrical thing. We were playing that 2000 as a very slow ballad on a {{different}} chordal structure altogether, which then became 'Darker with the Day' the 2001 album No More Shall We Part. It had a different melody, but very slow and it made for a haunting thing. That song was composed {{over a long period}} of time and <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sing to my little son, Luke. It was kind of a nasty fucked-up lullaby." ...|$|E

When we made it, I wanted to make <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt was meaningful to me, and <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>would</b> really speak for where my head was at. I suppose I used it as a self-help thing, because I was in a really dark place and I felt if I went back to writing songs as medication, it would help. Which it did. It’s a little autobiographical, which most of my work ends up being. I went to where my mom is from in New York and just holed up in the winter and wrote everything there as a way to feel I was in touch more with myself and where I came from. You tend to sometimes just be a zombie on a treadmill in this world, just going forward and doing whatever, and so I wanted to take a second and make sure I was okay. Or at least make myself feel a little bit better and get healthier as person. And I think writing these songs did that." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1981 {{conversation}} with Charles Amirkhanian, Hovhaness detailed the rather haphazard way Mysterious Mountain acquired its opus number, recalling: Stokowski {{called me up}} many times and {{talked to me about}} various things he wanted me to write and he said, 'Does it have an opus number? People like opus numbers. You know how dumb they are.' So I said, 'No, it doesn't have an opus number. I haven't catalogued my work.' 'Well how <b>would</b> 132'—or <b>something</b> like <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think—'how <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be, do you think that gives you enough room for the things you've written?' And <b>I</b> said, 'Sure, <b>that’s</b> okay. I’ll start making a catalogue.' And he said, 'I like your titles, give it a title.' And so I gave it the title, Mysterious Mountain.

5000|$|While 2002's Songs for the Deaf {{was said}} to be {{inspired}} by Josh Homme's tedious drive through the Southern Californian desert, the inspiration for Era Vulgaris came from Homme's daily drive through Hollywood. He described the record as [...] "dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker," [...] "…it's like dirt, clearly seen." [...] The album's title Era Vulgaris refers to the Latin term for Common Era. The title was chosen by Homme because he thought [...] "it sounds like 'the Vulgar Era', which I like, because that sounds like <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to be part of… I mean I think we're in it, and I'm stoked".|$|E

Truffaut later stated that [...] "In spite of the burlesque idea to certain scenes, it's never a parody (because I detest parody, except when it begin to rival the beauty of what it is parodying). For me its <b>something</b> very precise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call a respectful pastiche of the Hollywood B films from which I learned so much."

60|$|I {{read the}} other day <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>would</b> {{interest}} so great a sea-bather as yourself. You know that the fishes that we see, and catch, go only a certain way down into the sea. Below a certain depth there is no life at all. The water is as empty as the air is above a certain height. Even the shells of dead fishes that come down there are crushed into nothing by the huge weight of the water. Lower still, in {{the places where the}} sea is profoundly deep, it appears that life begins again. People fish up in dredging-buckets loose rags and tatters of creatures that hang together all right down there with the great weight holding them in one, but come all to pieces as they are hauled up. Just what they look like, just what they do or feed upon, we shall never find out. Only that we have some flimsy fellow-creatures down in the very bottom of the deep seas, and cannot get them up except in tatters. It must be pretty dark where they live, and there are no plants or weeds, and no fish come down there, or drowned sailors either, from the upper parts, because these are all mashed to pieces by the great weight long before they get so far, or else come to a place where perhaps they float. But I dare say a cannon sometimes comes careering solemnly down, and circling about like a dead leaf or thistle-down; and then the ragged fellows go and play about the cannon and tell themselves all kinds of stories about the fish higher up and their iron houses, and perhaps go inside and sleep, and perhaps dream of it all like their betters.|$|R

Surely, the intuition of the supreme ruler (Sultan) refutes that which should be known. You have said the truth, O aunt! How have you seen your journey?

I have memorized it just as I have memorized the Sura of al-Hamd,” one of them retorted. “Say it,” demanded Mu’awiya.|$|R
5000|$|Technicians of the Sacred (1968), which signalled the {{beginning}} of an approach to poetry that Rothenberg, in collaboration with George Quasha, named “ethnopoetics,” went beyond the standard collection of folk songs to include visual and sound poetry and the texts and scenarios for ritual events. Some 150 pages of commentaries gave context to the works included and placed them as well in relation to contemporary and experimental work in the industrial and postindustrial West. Over the next ten years, Rothenberg also founded and with Dennis Tedlock co-edited Alcheringa, the first magazine of ethnopoetics (1970-73, 1975ff.) and edited further anthologies, including:- Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North Americas (1972, 2014); A Big Jewish Book: Poems & Other Visions of the Jews from Tribal Times to the Present (revised and republished as Exiled in the Word, 1977 and 1989); America a Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the Present (1973, 2012), co-edited with George Quasha; and Symposium of the Whole: A Range of Discourse Toward An Ethnopoetics (1983), co-edited with Diane Rothenberg. Rothenberg’s approach throughout was to treat these large collections as deliberately constructed assemblages or collages, on the one hand, and as manifestos promulgating a complex and multiphasic view of poetry on the other. Speaking of their relation to his work as a whole, he later wrote of the anthology thus conceived as “an assemblage or pulling together of poems & people & ideas about poetry (& much else) in the words of others and in my own words. That imago - that representation of where we've been and what we've lived through - is <b>something</b> in fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> stand by - like any poem.” ...|$|R
