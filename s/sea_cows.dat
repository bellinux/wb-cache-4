5|$|Sirenians, the <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> became aquatic around 40 {{million years}} ago. The first {{appearance}} of sirenians in {{the fossil record}} was during the early Eocene, and by the late Eocene, sirenians had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, {{they were able to}} spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, †Prorastomus, was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was †Pezosiren from the early Eocene. The earliest known <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> of the families †Prorastomidae and †Protosirenidae, were both confined to the Eocene, and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared {{by the end of the}} Eocene. At this point, <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> were fully aquatic.|$|E
5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
50|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had a {{thicker layer}} of blubber than {{other members of}} the order. This {{adaptation}} was due to the cold waters of its environment. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> tail was forked, like that of cetaceans. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> did not have teeth, instead having an array of white bristles on its upper lip and two keratinous plates within its mouth for chewing. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> fed mainly on kelp, and communicated via sighs and snorting sounds. Evidence suggests that the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was a monogamous and social animal, living in small family groups and raising its young, similar to extant sirenians.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> spine is {{believed}} to have had 7 neck, 17 thoracic, 3 lumbar, and 34 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Its ribs were large, with 5 of 17 pairs making contact with the sternum; the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had no clavicles. As in all sirenians, the scapula of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was fan-shaped being larger on the posterior side and narrower towards the neck. However, the anterior border of the scapula was nearly straight, whereas those of modern sirenians are curved. Like other sirenians, the bones of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were pachyosteosclerotic, meaning they were both bulky (pachyostotic) and dense (osteosclerotic). [...] In all collected skeletons of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> the manus is missing: since Dusisiren—the sister taxon of Hydrodamalis—had reduced phalanges (finger bones), it is possible that Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> did not have a manus at all.|$|R
50|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was quickly}} {{wiped out by}} fur traders, seal hunters, and others who {{followed}} Vitus Bering's route past the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> habitat and to Alaska. It was also hunted to collect its valuable subcutaneous fat. By 1768, 27 years after it had been discovered by Europeans, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was extinct. In 1887 Stejneger estimated {{that there had been}} fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining at the time of Steller's discovery, and thus there was already an immediate danger of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> extinction.|$|R
5|$|An early trader, Emilian Basov, traded at Bering Island in 1743, {{collecting}} a {{large number}} of sea otter, fur seal, and blue Arctic fox furs. Basov made four trips to Bering Island and nearby Medny Island and made a fortune, inspiring many other traders. From 1743 to the founding of the Russian-American Company in 1799, over 100 private fur-trading and hunting voyages sailed from Kamchatka to North America. In total, these voyages garnered over eight million silver rubles. During {{the early part of this}} era, the ships would typically stop at the Commander Islands to slaughter and preserve the meat of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> a defenseless sea mammal whose range was limited to those islands. They were hunted not only for food, but also for their skins, used to make boats, and their subcutaneous fat, used for oil lamps. By 1768, Steller's sea cow was extinct. As furs were depleted on nearby islands, Russian traders sailed farther east along the Aleutian chain. By the 1760s, they were regularly sailing to Kodiak Island. Notable Russian traders in the early years of the trade include Nikifor Trapeznikov (who financed and participated in 10 voyages between 1743 and 1768), Maksimovich Solov'ev, Stepan Glotov, and Grigory Shelikhov.|$|E
500|$|Ocepeia {{has been}} placed in various {{positions}} within the group of archaic mammals known as [...] "condylarths" [...] as successive discoveries yielded ever-more complete material. When first described, known only from {{a total of four}} teeth, Ocepeia was assigned to an undetermined family (uncertain position, or incertae sedis), tentatively in the Phenacodonta, with noted dental similarities to the arctocyonid Lambertocyon as well as the phenacodontid Ectocion. Upon reviewing new material in 2010, which included a more complete jawbone and canine teeth, Gheerbrant suggested Ocepeia was more primitive than any phenacodontid, and placed it as family incertae sedis tentatively assigned to the Paenungulata (a group including proboscideans, <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> hyraxes, and extinct relatives).|$|E
2500|$|Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous {{marine mammals}} {{sometimes}} known as <b>sea</b> <b>cows.</b> There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing {{three of the}} four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to [...] long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like flippers. The etymology of the name is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin [...] "manus" [...] (hand), and to a word sometimes cited as [...] "manati" [...] used by the Taíno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning [...] "breast". Manatees are occasionally called <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.|$|E
50|$|The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis cuestae) is an extinct herbivorous marine mammal, and {{the direct}} {{ancestor}} of the Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas). They {{reached up to}} 9 m in length, making them among the biggest sirenians to have ever lived. They were first described in 1978 by Daryl Domning when fossils in California were unearthed. Its appearance and behavior are largely based on that of the well-documented Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> who, unlike the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> lived into modern times and was well described.|$|R
5000|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an {{extinct species}} of sirenian first {{discovered}} by Europeans in 1741. At {{the time of}} its discovery, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was found only around the Commander Islands, located in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia, however their range was more extensive during the Pleistocene epoch. It is possible that Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> and humans interacted before their discovery on the Commander Islands. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> would reach weights of 8 - 10 MT and lengths of up to 9 m. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was a part of the}} order Sirenia, and member of the family Dugongidae, of which its closest living relative, the 3 m long dugong (Dugong dugon), is the sole surviving member.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrodamalis is a genus of extinct herbivorous sirenian marine mammals, and {{included}} the Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas), the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis cuestae), and the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis spissa). The fossil genus Dusisiren {{is regarded as}} the sister taxon of Hydrodamalis: together, the two genera form the dugong subfamily Hydrodamalinae. They were the largest member of the order Sirenia, whose only extant members are the dugong (Dugong dugon) and the manatees (Trichechus spp.). They reached up to 9 m in length, making the Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> among the largest mammals other than whales to have existed in the Holocene epoch. [...] Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was first described by Georg Wilhelm Steller, Cuesta by Daryl Domning, and Takikawa by Hitoshi Furusawa. The Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{the only member of the}} genus to survive into modern times, and, although had formerly been abundant throughout the North Pacific, by the mid 1700s, its range had been limited to a single, isolated population surrounding the uninhabited Commander Islands. It was hunted for its meat, skin, and fat by fur traders, and was also hunted by aboriginals of the North Pacific coast, leading to its and the generas extinction 27 years after discovery. The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> along with the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were probably extinct at the end of the Pliocene due to the onset of the Ice Ages and the subsequent recession of seagrasses—their main food source.|$|R
60|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> went on schlooping {{and grazing}} and chumping in the weed, and Kotick asked them {{questions}} in every language {{that he had}} picked up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as human beings. But the <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk. He has only six bones in his neck where {{he ought to have}} seven, and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even to his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.|$|E
60|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> had {{separated}} and were browsing lazily {{along the edges}} of the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men had ever come there.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater <b>Sea</b> <b>Cows</b> have traits {{common to}} both {{manatees}} or <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> and dairy cows. They live in underwater tunnels {{as well as}} open water, and consume plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{used its}} forelimbs for swimming, feeding, walking in shallow water, {{defending}} itself, and for {{holding on to}} its partner during copulation. According to Steller, the forelimbs were also used to anchor the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> down {{to prevent it from}} being swept away by the strong nearshore waves. While grazing, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> progressed slowly by moving its tail (fluke) from side to side, while more rapid movement was achieved by strong vertical beating of the tail. They often slept on their backs after feeding. According to Steller, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was nearly mute and made only heavy breathing sounds, raspy snorting similar to a horse, and sighs.|$|R
50|$|A 2004 study {{reported}} that <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones discovered on Adak Island were around 1,700 years old, and <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones discovered on Buldir Island {{were found to be}} around 1,600 years old. However it is possible the bones were from cetaceans and were misclassified. Rib bones of a Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> have also been found on St. Lawrence Island, and the specimen is thought to have lived between 800 and 920 CE.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> {{head was}} small and short in {{comparison}} to its huge body. The animal's upper lip was large and broad, extending so far beyond the lower jaw that the mouth appeared to be located underneath the skull. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was toothless and instead had a dense array of interlacing white bristles on its upper lip. The bristles were approximately 1.5 in in length and were used to tear seaweed stalks and hold food. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> also had two keratinous plates located on its palate and mandible used for chewing. According to Steller, these plates (or [...] "masticatory pads") were held together by interdental papillae, {{a part of the}} gums, and had many small holes containing nerves and arteries.As with all sirenians, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> snout pointed downwards, which allowed it to better grasp kelp. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> nostrils were roughly 2 in long and wide. In addition to those within its mouth, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> also had stiff, 10 - 12.7 cm long bristles protruding from its muzzle. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had small eyes located halfway between its nostrils and ears with black irises, [...] eyeballs, and canthi which were not externally visible. The animal had no eyelashes, but like other diving creatures such as sea otters, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had a membrane which covered its eyes to prevent injury while feeding. The tongue {{was small and}} remained {{in the back of the}} mouth, unable to reach the masticatory (chewing) pads.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the decline of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{may have been an}} {{indirect}} effect of the harvesting of sea otters by the aboriginal peoples. With the otter population reduced, the number of sea urchins would have increased, in turn reducing availability of kelp, as kelp is also the main food source for sea urchins. Therefore, aboriginal hunting of otters {{may have contributed to the}} <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> disappearance from continental shorelines. In historic times, though, aboriginal hunting had depleted sea otter populations only in localized areas, and as the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> would have been easy prey for aboriginal hunters, accessible populations may have been exterminated with or without simultaneous otter hunting. In any event, the range of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was limited to coastal areas off uninhabited islands by the time Bering arrived, and the animal was already endangered.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was named}} for Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist who {{discovered}} the species in 1741. The discovery came on Vitus Bering's Great Northern Expedition when the crew became shipwrecked on Bering Island. Much {{of what is known}} about the behavior of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> comes from Steller's observations on the island, documented in his posthumous publication The Beasts of the Sea. Within 27 years of discovery by Europeans, the slow-moving and easily caught Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was hunted into extinction for its meat, fat, and hide. However, sightings have been claimed after 1768, the recorded year of its extinction.|$|R
50|$|Steller {{described}} an ectoparasite on the <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> that {{was similar to}} the whale louse (Cyamus ovalis), but the parasite remains unidentified due to the host's extinction and loss of all original specimens collected by Steller. It was first formally described as Sirenocyamus rhytinae in 1846 by Johann Friedrich von Brandt. It was the only species of cyamid amphipod to be reported inhabiting a sirenian. Steller also identified an endoparasite on the <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> which was likely an ascarid nematode.|$|E
