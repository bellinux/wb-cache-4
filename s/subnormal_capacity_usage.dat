Compared to the original as-cast alloy with internal friction (Q- 1) of 3. 0 × 10 - 2 at a strain amplitude ε = 2 × 10 - 4 and usage temperature of 43 °C, the largest Q- 1 (5. 0 × 10 - 2) and highest usage temperature (70 °C) can be obtained simultaneously by ageing treatment at 435 °C for 2 h, while homogenization-ageing, solution-ageing and overageing can just result in the limited improvement of damping <b>capacity</b> and <b>usage</b> temperature.

Based on several time series taken from the wireless and bandwidth industry, it is argued that <b>capacity</b> <b>usage</b> is the major uncertain component in telecommunications. It is found that price has low volatility when compared to <b>capacity</b> <b>usage.</b> A real options approach is then applied to derive a two dimensional partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) to value investments in telecommunication infrastructure when <b>capacity</b> <b>usage</b> is uncertain and has temporary sudden large variations. This real options PIDE presents several numerical challenges. First, the integral term must be solved accurately and quickly enough such that the general PIDE solution is reasonably accurate. To deal with the integral term, an implicit method is suggested. Proofs of timestepping stability and convergence of a fixed point iteration scheme are presented. The correlation integral is computed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. Techniques are developed to avoid wrap-around effects. This method is tested on option pricing problems where the underlying asset follows a jump diffusion process. Second, the absence of diffusion in one direction of the two dimensional PIDE creates numerical challenges regarding accuracy and timestep selection. A semi-Lagrangian method is presented to alleviate these issues. At each timestep, a set of one dimensional PIDEs is solved and the solution of each PIDE is updated using semi-Lagrangian timestepping. Crank-Nicolson and second order backward differencing timestepping schemes are studied. Monotonicity and stability results are derived. This method is tested on continuously observed Asian options. Finally, a five factor algorithm that captures many of the constraints of the wireless network capacity investment decision timing problem is developed. The upgrade decision for different upgrade decision intervals (e. g. monthly, quarterly, etc.) is studied, and the effect of a safety level (i. e. the maximum allowed capacity used in practice on a daily basis—which differs from the theoretical maximum) is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we assess the {{benefits}} of using statistical techniques to ascertain the shareability of protection channels when computing shared mesh restored lightpaths in optical mesh networks. These optical networks support wavelength conversion everywhere as a byproduct of the electronic nature of the switching in the OEO optical cross-connect used. Current deterministic approaches require a detailed level of information proportional {{to the number of}} active lightpaths. Although this is not an issue for good size networks in the foreseeable future, these approaches are not practicable for distributed route computation involving larger networks. On the other hand, distributed approaches that do not make use of shareability information require a significant amount of additional capacity compared to a centralized approach with access to complete shareability information. With the proposed approach we show that even with less information, independent of the amount of traffic demand, it is possible to predict the shareability of protection channels with remarkable accuracy. In addition, we propose a local distributed channel assignment scheme that is used in conjunction with our distributed route computation proposal to assign shared channels when provisioning the backup path. This channel assignment scheme {{can also be used to}} further optimize <b>capacity</b> <b>usage</b> in individual links upon certain events or at regular intervals.
