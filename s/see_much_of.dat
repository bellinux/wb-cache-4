5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, he did not <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. He had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where {{he had gone to}} live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 55,722, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the third minute when Cees de Wolf scored. They {{extended}} their lead in the 17th minute courtesy of a Johan Cruyff goal. Two more goals scored by forward Klaas Nuninga meant Ajax had a 4–0 lead at half-time. Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the match due to the fog's density and at times could only tell by the celebration of the team when a goal was scored.|$|E
5|$|Rashad (T.I.) is a teen {{living in}} Atlanta, Georgia with his Uncle, George (Mykelti Williamson) {{and his little}} brother Ant (Evan Ross). He and his brother were raised by their uncle George since their parents {{died in a car}} accident, and they work with him as part of his {{custodial}} company. When not working or finishing his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E

25|$|The Hanging Hills are {{a popular}} outdoor {{recreation}} resource. Hubbard Park features a bandshell and flower gardens {{and is the}} site of a variety of local festivals and concerts, most notably the spring Daffodil Festival. A park road leads to Castle Craig Tower and is open from April through October from 10:00a.m. to 5:00p.m. A number of trails, most notably the 51 mile (80k) blue-blazed Metacomet Trail (maintained by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association), traverse the range. Trails are open to hiking, backcountry skiing, and snowshoeing; roads are open to bicycling and mountain biking. Swimming is prohibited.

25|$|Hadrian did not <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Marcus in his childhood. He {{spent most}} of his time outside Rome, on the frontier, or dealing with {{administrative}} and local affairs in the provinces. By 135, however, he had returned to Italy for good. He had grown close to Lucius Ceionius Commodus, husband of the daughter of Gaius Avidius Nigrinus, a dear friend of Hadrian whom the emperor had killed early in his reign. In 136, shortly after, Marcus assumed the toga virilis symbolizing his passage into manhood, Hadrian arranged for his engagement to one of Commodus' daughters, Ceionia Fabia. Marcus was made prefect of the city during the feriae Latinae soon after (he was probably appointed by Commodus). Although the office held no real administrative significance—the full-time prefect remained in office during the festival—it remained a prestigious office for young aristocrats and members of the imperial family. Marcus conducted himself well at the job.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the character}} from both professionals and fans has been positive. In his DVD review for DVD Verdict, Bill Treadway called Patrick [...] "the village idiot, who sometimes gives SpongeBob some really bad advice, {{but he is a}} loyal friend and that's something we don't <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> these days." [...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the form}} of an {{extensive}} series of callbacks, Larkin returned to the studio on several different occasions over the next few months. While the audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase, the amount of actresses competing for the role gradually decreased accordingly as the audition process neared completion. Larkin's final audition lasted a total of four hours, during which she read through the entire script for the first time. The animators were also provided with an opportunity to animate to Larkin's voice for the first time. The actress was finally cast several months later, by which time she had nearly forgotten she had ever auditioned. Six months into recording, however, Larkin was forced to re-audition for the role by Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who felt that the actress' voice lacked the authority required to voice a princess. However, Clements and Musker disagreed with him, and managed to trick Katzenberg into not firing Larkin by staging a fake recording session during which they had the actress speak lower and slower in Katzenberg's presence, only to have her return to her natural voice thereafter. Larkin recorded only one scene alongside her co-stars Williams and Scott Weinger, voice of Aladdin. Apart from some rough, unfinished storyboards and drawings, Larkin did not <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> her character until the film was finally screened at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E

500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Carson's former lawyer Henry Bushkin stated, he [...] "was by {{instinct}} and upbringing definitely Republican, but of an Eisenhower sort that we don't <b>see</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> anymore.... Overall, you'd {{have to say}} he was anti-big: anti-big government, anti-big money, anti-big bullies, anti-big blowhards." [...] Carson served as MC for Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1981 at the request of Frank Sinatra.|$|E
