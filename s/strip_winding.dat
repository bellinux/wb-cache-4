40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of a vector- controlled, fault-tolerant, permanent magnet motor drive system adopting a vertically placed <b>strip</b> <b>winding</b> (VSW) which can limit inter-turn short-circuit (SC) fault current to its rated value regardless of the position in the slot containing the shorted turns. The drives’ dynamic behavior is simulated using a per-phase equivalent circuit model with the winding inductances and resistances analytical calculated based on the machine geometry and fault location. A simplified thermal model is also grafted into the system model to effectively simulate the dynamic behavior of the machine during healthy, inter-turn SC fault and post-fault controlled scenarios. The SC fault current limiting capability, the additional losses and thermal behavior of the winding are studied and compared with conventional winding adopting round conductors winding (RCW). The proposed winding design is verified with Finite Element (FE) analysis and then validated experimentally. Results show that the VSW inherently limits the SC current, reduces its dependence on the position of the fault within the slot but results in an increase in AC losses...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{investigations}} of two equipments for the cooling of metal strips {{are presented in}} the paper. The so called "brush cooling equipment" enables heat transfer coefficients up to 150 W/m 2 K. The cooling intensity depends on adapted <b>strip</b> <b>winding</b> force. Partial roughening of the strip has to be considered as unwanted concomitant phenomenon. An optimum for high cooling performance and moderate roughening was detected. Heat transfer coefficients of up to 600 W/m 2 K are demonstrated with the "gaseous cooling equipment". The designed cooling drum ensures high gas pressure up to 100 mbar inside the contact zone of the metal strip and the drum. Partially evacuation prevents high gas pressure in the vacuum process chamber. The realized pressure separation of six orders of magnitude enables the combination of "gaseous cooling equipment" with high-rate sputtering or electron beam evaporation. The demonstrated heat transfer coefficients describe a distinctive performance incr ease compared to known state of the art. Extensions concerning deposition rate or deposition of thick layers onto thin metal foils get feasible.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focuses on the mitigation of inter-turn short-circuit (SC) faults in Fault tolerant Permanent Magnet (FT-PM) machines. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the inter-turn SC fault current accounting for the location in the slot of the short-circuited turn(s). As a mitigation strategy to SC faults at the design stage, a winding arrangement called VSW (Vertically placed <b>Strip</b> <b>Winding)</b> is proposed and analysed. The proposed analytical model is benchmarked against finite element (FE) calculation and validated experimentally. The results demonstrate that the proposed winding arrangement in the slot improves the fault tolerance (FT) capability of the machine by limiting the inter-turn SC fault current regardless the fault location in the slot. Electromagnetic and thermal studies are conducted to verify the merits and drawbacks of the proposed winding compared to the conventional winding using round conductors (RCW). The study shows that the proposed winding scheme, {{in addition to being}} fault-tolerant, has an improved bulk radial conductivity, can achieve a good fill factor, but has a significantly higher frequency-dependent AC copper loss. To predict the AC losses an analytical model based on an exact analytical 2 D field solution is proposed. This model consists of first solving the two-dimensional magneto-static problem based on Laplace’s and Poisson’s equations using the separation of variables technique. Then, based on that solved solution, by defining the tangential magnetic field (Ht) at the slot opening radius, Helmholtz’ equation is solved in the slot sub-domain. Subsequently, an FE and MATLAB® coupled parametric design is undertaken to maximise the VSW wound machine’s efficiency whilst maintaining its FT capability. The proposed analytical models for prediction of the SC fault current and AC copper losses are integrated into the coupled optimisation. It is shown that the effective losses of the VSW can be minimised through the parametric design while maintaining the required level of machine performance. Using an existing FT-PM machine of which the rotor is kept unchanged two stators were designed, manufactured and wound with RCW and VSW respectively and experimental tests are carried out to validate the analytical models and the new winding concept...|$|E
