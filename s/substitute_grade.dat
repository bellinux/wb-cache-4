40|$|Bone {{material}} {{as an ideal}} biological composite consists of dense compact bone and spongy cancellous bone. It is characterized by high stiffness and light weight. The basic idea of the performed work is the adaption of biological bone remodeling processes to a technical concept of design and manufacturing of functionally graded cellular light weight structures. This concept was realized successfully for three different application scenarios, material classes and manufacturing techniques. The relevant criterion of success was a production time less than 7 - 14 days. A user-friendly software named PoreDesign was developed, implemented and tested which is able to control all stages of the production process. A weight reduction of up to 30 % without loosing structural stiffness could be reached in all scenarios.

30|$|Can we be {{sure that}} more {{intensive}} use of graded absence certificates really has a negative causal effect on overall absenteeism? And – perhaps even more important – that it also leads to lower social insurance dependency in the longer run? These questions are addressed by Markussen et al. (2012), who investigate the causal impacts of issuing graded rather than full-time sick leave certificates for workers in Norway who had been temporary disabled for at least 8 weeks. Since the use of graded (as opposed to full-time) absence certificates is anything but randomly assigned, the authors face an obvious endogeneity problem. This is handled by exploiting the variation in grading-propensity across family physicians, generating {{a significant source of}} random-assignment-like (from the employee’s point of view) variation in the probability of being subject to activity requirements during spells of sickness. Based on an instrumental variables model, Markussen et al. (2012) conclude that the use of graded instead of non-graded sickness absence certificates reduces the length of absence spells, and significantly improves the likelihood that the absentees are employed in subsequent years. The effects are large, both from an economic and a clinical perspective. Their most conservative instrumental variables estimates indicate that <b>substituting</b> a <b>graded</b> for a full-time absence certificate reduces the length of the absence spell by as much as 80 – 90 fulltime-equivalent days and also reduces social insurance claims the next two years – in terms of, e.g., new sickness or disability benefits – by around 80 – 85 days. Even more importantly, it raises employment propensity two years after by 16 – 18 percentage points.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Geotextiles are {{synthetic}} fabrics {{which may}} be <b>substituted</b> for <b>graded</b> aggregate to protect ocean and coastal structures from erosion and soil instability adjacent to the structure. They are commonly used as a filter and as a structural membrane between an undisturbed sediment surface below and an erosion resistant coarse aggregate above. Geotextiles provide a cost effective alternative to graded aggregate in marine foundations. The need for rational design procedures {{has led to a}} theoretical description of the combined soil-geotextile behavior which quantifies failure potential and facilitates optimum geotextile selection. A two-dimensional analytical model has been developed for a three layered system; two different soils separated by a geotextile. The soil response is modeled by Biot consolidation theory and an unsteady form of Darcy's equation in which each soil is considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The soil layers are coupled through the geotextile which acts as an elastic permeable membrane. Soil displacements and stresses and fluid pressures and flows are determined analytically. Potential failure conditions are identified from the cyclic shear stress ratio and from a Mohr- Coulomb stress analysis. Two series of laboratory experiments were conducted at the Oregon State University Wave Research Facility to verify the model. The large scale facility includes a wave channel which is 12 feet wide, 15 feet deep and 342 feet long. A test section 36 feet long was constructed in the wave channel and filled with approximately three feet of fine sand, a geotextile and one foot of gravel. The test section was exposed to simple harmonic and random waves with heights up to four and one-half feet and periods to eight seconds in water depths to eight feet. The pore water pressure was monitored continuously at seven to ten soil depths and three to five lateral positions and recorded on magnetic tape along with the displacement of the free surface. Four geotextile conditions were tested including woven, impermeable, semi-rigid and no geotextile. Wave-induced liquefaction was observed for a low permeability geotextile. The experimental results verify the soil-geotextile interaction model and also provide insight into the dynamic response of horizontally layered soils. Results indicate that for the permeabilities of commonly available geotextiles that the hydraulic properties of the geotextile are dominated by the adjacent soil properties. However, clogging of the geotextile increases the potential for soil failure. The pore pressure amplitude response is frequency selective, the higher frequencies being more highly damped. For a given soil condition a "worst" wave period may exist which produces maximum failure potential. Conversely, for a given design wave, there is a "worst" combination of backfill and armor in terms of potential failure...|$|R
40|$|Annual {{recycled}} fiber use has been predicted {{to grow at}} a rate of 6. 5 % per year from 22. 5 million tons in 1990 to 31 million tons by the year 1995. Two main areas of growth are as a pulp substitute in containerboard manufacturing and as deinked chemical fiber <b>substitute</b> in tissue <b>grades.</b> Environmental pressure and, in many cases, legislation are also stimulating very strong efforts to recycle old newsprint to supply 20 - 40 % of the 15 million ton per year newsprint market, and thus remove thls fiber from the solid waste stream.

This increased recycling of paper must be accompanied by appropriate technology to process the large volume of waste paper which will come on the market as a result of legislative mandate. We will review {{the state of the art}} for paper recycling and the deinking of paper prior to recycling. We have identified two major impediments for paper recycle. First, old newsprint often cannot be deinked adequately prior to its recycle into new newsprint to permit high quality standards to be met. We have been developing a deinking- process based partly on the use of enzymes to assist in the deinking. Second, as paper is recycled, the fiber strength is lost. We have researched the use of enzymes to upgrade the fiber and to restore in part the lost strength. Both of these topics will be discussed...|$|R

However, the development on emulsification technology especially without using surfactant is still not widely known. Therefore, in this study, a study into the application of non-surfactant W/D emulsion has been done with the objective to analyze the potential of non-surfactant W/D emulsion made from low grade diesel as a <b>substitute</b> for higher <b>grade</b> diesel. This study was conducted using light-duty diesel vehicle, a 1 ton truck tested in a chassis dynamometer. A variety of test fuels was used, comprises of Diesel Euro 5 (DE 5), Diesel Euro 2 (DE 2) and emulsion made from Diesel Euro 2 (EDE 2). EDE 2 was produced real time just before it is injected into the diesel engine, with water percentage of 6. 5 % and no additional surfactant. The testing was executed on a chassis dynamometer in accordance to the West Virginia (WVU) 5 Peak-Cycle standard. Among the data collected are fuel consumption, exhaust temperature, gas emissions (NOx, CO and CO 2) and smoke number. The {{results show that the}} EDE 2 improved the engine fuel consumption by 7. 39 % compared to DE 5. As for exhaust emissions, EDE 2 produced slightly higher NOx and CO compared to DE 5.

40|$|The {{potential}} of finishing cattle without grain was evaluated by comparing steers fed tub-ground grass hay and wet distillers grains (DGS) with steers fed a corn-based diet without DGS or the corn-based diet containing 40 % DGS. The experiment {{was done with}} 24 head of 840 lb Angus steers fed each diet. The replacement of corn and protein supplement in the control diet with 40 % wet DGS reduced feed intake and daily gain. The carcasses from steers fed DGS had reduced marbling and tended to have fewer Choice carcasses and lower carcass value determined with a marketing grid based on quality and yield <b>grade.</b> <b>Substituting</b> DGS {{for a portion of}} the corn and protein supplement in a corn-based diet resulted in reduced feed costs at all prices of corn evaluated ($ 2 to $ 4 /bu). However the reduced feed cost of gain was more than offset by the decrease in carcass value. There was economic advantage of feeding the diet containing 40 % DGS when corn price was greater then $ 3. 50 /bu and DGS was priced at 70 % the cost of corn on a dry basis. Steers fed the hay and DGS diet gained less, had poorer feed conversion and required an additional 62 days to reach the same end live weight. These steers had acceptable grading carcasses (62 % Choice) but less than carcasses from steers fed the control diet. Though feed costs and feed cost of gain were less for the steers fed hay and DGS, the cattle were not more profitable than either group of steers fed the corn-based diets at any price of corn ($ 2 to $ 4 /bu) or wet DGS (1, 0. 85 or 0. 70 times the price of corn on a dry matter basis) ...|$|R
40|$|Grains, leaves, sheaths, glumes and {{stalks of}} sorghum {{varieties}} were analyzed for total phenols, condensed tannins, flavan- 4 -ols, anthocyanins and in vitro antioxidant activity. Black sorghum bran {{was used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of organic acids and enzymes on extractability of phenols. Flavonoid profiles of grains and non-grain tissues were determined and characterized using HPLC-PDA and HPLC-ESI-MSn. The presence of a pigmented testa and spreader genes (B 1 B 2 S) is a predictor for polymeric flavonoids (tannins) but not for simple phenols such as flavan- 4 -ols, 3 -deoxyanthocyanins, flavones and flavanones. Simple flavonoids increased antioxidant capacity of sorghum, and were present in all sorghum except for the white pericarp sorghums that did not have flavanones. The "red turning into black" gene increased phenols in Type I sorghum. The leaves, sheath and glumes of sorghum had higher levels of phenols (78 - 600 times more), with in vitro antioxidant properties than commonly seen in grains. Pigmentation of plant components increased levels of 3 - deoxyanthocyanins but not flavones nor flavanones. The leaves of biomass sorghum, Collier variety, had 3. 4 times more 3 -deoxyanthocyanins than the leaves of Tx 430 Black x Sumac which had the highest levels (1810 ?g/g) of 3 - deoxyanthocyanins among the leaves. The use of 1 % HCl/ethanol provides a possible food <b>grade</b> <b>substitute</b> solvent for 1 %HCl/methanol in the extraction of phenolic compounds from sorghum. All enzymes evaluated broke down bran particles forming a gel-like material which had increased phenols and antioxidant activities but not 3 - deoxyanthocyanins as revealed by HPLC analysis. Microscopy examination showed the gel matrix rich in fiber and can possibly be used for nutraceutical applications. Careful understanding of enzyme activities is necessary for effective extraction of 3 -deoxyanthocyanins from sorghum. Sorghum leaves, sheaths and glumes are excellent sources of bioactive compounds, up to 600 times more than the grains of some varieties. Sorghum with the "red turning to black genes" is a potential source of 3 - deoxyanthocyanins and flavan- 4 -ols.
