50|$|High-resolution digital {{elevation}} maps generated by airborne and <b>stationary</b> <b>lidar</b> {{have led to}} significant advances in geomorphology (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, and to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.In 2005 the Tour Ronde in the Mont Blanc massif became the first high alpine mountain on which lidar was employed to monitor the increasing occurrence of severe rock-fall over large rock faces allegedly caused by climate change and degradation of permafrost at high altitude.|$|E

In this paper, the general case is derived where the orientation angles are not small; this case completes the theory of <b>stationary</b> <b>LiDAR</b> direct georeferencing.

40|$|<b>Stationary</b> <b>lidar</b> (Light Detection and Ranging) {{systems are}} often used to collect 3 -D data (point clouds) {{that can be used}} for terrain modelling. The lidar gathers scans which are then merged {{together}} to map a terrain. Typically this is done using a variant of the well-known Iterated Closest Point (ICP) algorithm when position and pose of the lidar scanner is not accurately known. One difficulty with the ICP algorithms is that they can give poor results when points that are not common to both scans (outliers) are matched together. With the advent of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) -based GPS/IMU systems, it is possible to gather coarse position and pose information at a low cost. This information is not accurate enough to merge point clouds directly, but can be used to assist the ICP algorithm during the merging process. This paper presents a method called Sphere Outlier Removal (SOR), which accurately identifies outliers and inliers, a necessary prerequisite to using the ICP algorithm. SOR incorporates the information from a low cost GPS/IMU to perform this identification. Examples are presented which illustrate the improvement in the accuracy of merged point clouds when the SOR algorithm is used...|$|E

40|$|The Water Vapor Lidar was {{modified}} and extended to make differential absorption measurements of ozone. Water vapor measurements {{make use of}} a weak molecular scattering process known as Raman scattering. It {{is characterized by a}} shift in wavelength of the scattered beam of light relative to the incident one. Some of the energy of the incident photon is converted to vibrational or rotational energy within the molecule leaving the scattered photon shifted to a slightly longer wavelength. When performing water vapor measurements, profiles are acquired of water vapor mixing ratio from near the ground to beyond 7 km every 2 minutes. By forming a color composite image of the individual profiles, the spatial and temporal evolution of water vapor is visible with vertical resolution of 75 to 150 m and temporal resolution of 2 minutes. The ozone lidar is intended for use as a cross calibration facility for other <b>stationary</b> ozone <b>lidar</b> systems. The ozone measurement employs the technique known as differential absorption. The backscattered laser radiation from two different wavelengths is measured. Successful measurements of 308 nm returns were made from 80 km with an averaging period of 6 hours. Using these data and a standard atmosphere density curve, an ozone number density profile was made which agrees very well with the standard ozone curve between 20 and 40 km...|$|R
40|$|MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local And Global Research Observations) is an {{international}} collaborative project to examine the behavior and the export of atmospheric emissions from a megacity. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) – one of the world's largest megacities and North America's most populous city – {{was selected as the}} case study to characterize the sources, concentrations, transport, and transformation processes of the pollutants emitted to the MCMA atmosphere and to evaluate the regional and global impacts of these emissions. The findings of this study are relevant to the evolution and impacts of pollution from many other megacities. The measurement phase consisted of a month-long series of carefully coordinated observations of the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere in and near Mexico City during March 2006, using a wide range of instruments at ground sites, on aircraft and satellites, and enlisting over 450 scientists from 150 institutions in 30 countries. Three ground supersites were set up to examine the evolution of the primary emitted gases and fine particles. Additional platforms in or near Mexico City included mobile vans containing scientific laboratories and mobile and <b>stationary</b> upward-looking <b>lidars.</b> Seven instrumented research aircraft provided information about the atmosphere over a large region and at various altitudes. Satellite-based instruments peered down into the atmosphere, providing even larger geographical coverage. The overall campaign was complemented by meteorological forecasting and numerical simulations, satellite observations and surface networks. Together, these research observations have provided the most comprehensive characterization of the MCMA's urban and regional atmospheric composition that will take years to analyze and evaluate fully. In this paper we review over 120 papers resulting from the MILAGRO/INTEX-B Campaign that have been published or submitted, as well as relevant papers from the earlier MCMA- 2003 campaign, with the aim of providing a road map for the scientific community interested in understanding the emissions from a megacity such as the MCMA and their impacts on air quality and climate. This paper describes the measurements performed during MILAGRO and the results obtained on MCMA's atmospheric meteorology and dynamics, emissions of gases and fine particles, sources and concentrations of volatile organic compounds, urban and regional photochemistry, ambient particulate matter, aerosol radiative properties, urban plume characterization, and health studies. A summary of key findings from the field study is presented...|$|R
40|$|Ground-based lidars {{can provide}} {{continuous}} observations of tropospheric humidity profiles using the Raman scattering of light by water vapour and nitrogen molecules. We will present specific humidity profiles obtained {{at the high}} Arctic location Ny-Ålesund (Spitsbergen, 79 °N). Under nighttime conditions the observations cover a range from about 500 m altitude up to the upper troposphere. Daylight limits the observations to the lower troposphere, depending on atmospheric transmission and the water vapour content. In a case study on 29 January, simultaneous observations of humidity and aerosol extinction show distinct differences in the various altitudes during the advection of aerosol-rich air masses. In the boundary layer, the aerosol is less affected by the humidity. In the free troposphere, the lidar ratio was observed {{to be up to}} 60 sr with some evidence for the uptake of water vapour by the aerosol particles. In another case study from 28 February 2002, the influence of the mean wind direction and the orography on the water vapour concentration near the ground and in the free troposphere will be discussed. During wintertime, a humidity inversion up to about 1. 5 km altitude with dry air near the ground has frequently been found with wind from the southeast. Such local effects and small-scale structures observed by <b>stationary</b> <b>lidar</b> mostly cannot be resolved by other sounding methods like passive satellite soundings...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{resonance}} lidar, atomic Na (sodium) can {{be observed}} in the 80 - 110 km altitude range of the atmosphere. Na belongs to the alkali metal group and is highly reactive, so one could expect that it would quickly react with other particles and leave its atomic state. Its actual behaviour however includes the formation of relatively dense layers which, {{from the perspective of a}} <b>stationary</b> <b>lidar,</b> form suddenly and can last for several hours before quickly disappearing again. Several theories on the formation of these layers have been developed, including temperature dependent chemical processes, but none of them seem to explain all of the observed events. In 2008, two articles about these sudden sodium layers were published by scientists who have worked with the Weber Na lidar at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR), located at Andøya, Norway (69 ^∘ 16 ' N, 16 ^∘ 00 ' E). Nesse et al. (2008) describe one particular Na layer observed 5 November 2005 and consider in turn how the most probable theories match the observed data during this event. Heinrich et al. (2008) identify all the sudden Na layers that have been observed on ALOMAR between August 2000 and June 2006 and investigate in particular how these coincide with sporadic E-layers (thin layers of several types of metallic ions). The fourth ECOMA (Existence and Charged State of Meteoric Smoke Particles in the Middle Atmosphere) rocket campaign took place at the Andøya Rocket Range during November and December 2010. The Na lidar was operated to the extent possible during this period, resulting in near real-time data for two of the three rocket launches and a total of 48 hours of measurements which are presented in this text. Using the two formerly mentioned articles as a starting point, I have studied available theory about sudden Na layers and the ALOMAR Na lidar in particular, and the upper atmosphere and resonance lidars in general. While we did not observe any sudden Na layers during the ECOMA measurements, I look into an older dataset as an example...|$|E
