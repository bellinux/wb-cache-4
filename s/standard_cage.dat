Unlike a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> match, there is no escape clause (and it has been fairly common for Hell in a Cell matches to spill out of the cell and even onto the ceiling of the cage), the match can only be won via pinfall or submission. There is no disqualification and the wrestlers are free to do whatever they must to win. The pinfall or submission can happen anywhere and anything not nailed to the floor may be used as a weapon. The cell may be used as a weapon. This type of match outside of the WWE is considered a cage match since most promotions do not consider escaping from the ring as a victory.|$|E

The cage setups were as follows: 1) a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> (105 cm long × 115 cm wide × 70 cm high) without digging substrates, which housed the control group; 2) a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> (105 cm long × 115 cm wide × 70 cm high) with a solid metal plate (210 × 297 mm) on the wall for digging and scratching; 3) a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> (105 cm long × 115 cm wide × 70 cm high) with a solid metal plate (210 × 297 mm) on the floor for digging and scratching; and 4) a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> (105 cm long × 115 cm wide × 70 cm high) with a metal sandbox for digging and scratching (80 × 40 × 14 cm, L×W×H). The sandbox had a 10 cm layer of sand (ca. 25 kg, particle size 0 - 18 mm) on the bottom. All animals grew well and reached normal body weights. No significant growth differences were found between blue and shadow types within the groups. Furthermore, skin length did not differ between colour types or between groups. Skin weight, on the other hand, was heavier in the blue than in the shadow type in the plate floor groups. No differences were recorded in the other groups. Fur quality was poorest in the blue type of the standard group and best in the shadow type of the plate wall group. Cover and mass were also best in the shadow type of the plate wall group. Furs were dirtiest in the sandbox groups, irrespective of colour type.

40|$|The primary {{visual cortex}} is widely used to study brain plasticity, which is not only crucial for normal brain function, such as {{learning}} and memory, but also for recovery after brain injuries such as stroke. In <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in the {{primary visual cortex}} declines with age and is compromised by a lesion in adjacent and distant cortical regions. In contrast, mice raised in an enriched environment exhibit lifelong ocular dominance plasticity and are protected from losing ocular dominance plasticity after a stroke-lesion in the somatosensory cortex. Since <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> mice with an access to a running wheel displayed preserved ocular dominance plasticity during ageing, we investigated whether physical exercise might also provide a plasticity promoting effect after a cortical stroke. To this end, we tested if adult running wheel-raised mice preserved ocular dominance plasticity after stroke and also if short-term running after stroke restored ocular dominance plasticity to <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> mice. Indeed, unlike mice without a running wheel, adult running wheel mice continued to show ocular dominance plasticity even after stroke, and a two weeks running wheel experience after stroke already restored lost ocular dominance plasticity. Additionally, the experience-enabled increase of the spatial frequency and contrast threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, normally lost after stroke, was restored in both groups of running wheel mice.

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} concern that {{particulate air pollution}} {{increases the risk of}} cranial nerve disease onset. Small nanoparticles, mainly derived from diesel exhaust particles reach the olfactory bulb by their nasal depositions. It has been reported that diesel exhaust inhalation causes inflammation of the olfactory bulb and other brain regions. However, these toxicological studies have not evaluated animal rearing environment. We hypothesized that rearing environment can change mice phenotypes and thus might alter toxicological study results. In this study, we exposed mice to diesel exhaust inhalation at 90 µg/m(3), 8 hours/day, for 28 consecutive days after rearing in a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> or environmental enrichment conditions. Microarray analysis found that expression levels of 112 genes were changed by diesel exhaust inhalation. Functional analysis using Gene Ontology revealed that the dysregulated genes were involved in inflammation and immune response. This result was supported by pathway analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed 10 genes. Interestingly, background gene expression of the olfactory bulb of mice reared in a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> environment was changed by diesel exhaust inhalation, whereas there was no significant effect of diesel exhaust exposure on gene expression levels of mice reared with environmental enrichment.

40|$|We {{tested the}} general {{assumption}} that enrichment {{of the housing}} environment is rewarding to laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus. We used the behavioural response {{in anticipation of a}} forthcoming reward as a measure of the rewarding property of a simple enriched cage. For this, a Pavlovian conditioning schedule was applied to announce the oncoming transfer to an enriched cage. The response of rats in anticipation of this transfer was compared with that of rats that expected sexual contact, transfer to a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> or forced swimming. We also characterized the behavioural profile of the anticipatory response, because until now only general descriptions of this behaviour have been available. The strong increase in activity in anticipation of both an enriched cage and sexual contact and the similar response in terms of the behavioural elements analysed indicate that the appraisal of access to an enriched cage shares a common denominator with the perception of sexual contact. Because sexual contact is generally accepted to have highly rewarding properties to rats, we concluded that the enriched cage is highly rewarding as well. The anticipatory response for sexual contact or an enriched cage was clearly different from the anticipation for access to a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> or a forced swim session, indicating that the anticipatory response is related to the positive nature of the stimulus. In general, anticipation appears to be quantifiable by the level of activity measured by the total frequency of behavioural elements displayed. Some behavioural elements, such as exploration, locomotion, arousal and grooming, seem to be more specifically related {{to the nature of the}} forthcoming stimulus.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Environmental {{stimulation}} consistently increases dentate neurogenesis in {{the adult}} brain and improves spatial learning. We tested the hypothesis whether specific rehabilitative training of an impaired forelimb influences these processes after focal cortical infarcts. Methods—Focal cortical infarcts were induced in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex using the photothrombosis model. One group of infarcted animals and sham-operated controls housed in <b>standard</b> <b>cages</b> received one daily session of skilled reaching training of the impaired or dominant forelimb, respectively. A second group was transferred to an enriched environment, whereas a third group remained in the <b>standard</b> <b>cages</b> without further treatment. Bromodeoxyuridine was administered from day 2 until day 6 postinfarct. Proliferation and differentiation of newborn cells was analyzed at day 10 and 42 using immunocytochemistry with neuronal and glial markers and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze between days 35 and 41. Results—After cortical infarcts in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, environmental enrichment as well as daily reaching training of the impaired paw both increase dentate neurogenesis and improve functional performance in the Morris water maze. Nevertheless, the reaching training-induced neurogenic response was significantly greater in nonlesioned controls associated with the best spatial learning performance in the water maze.

40|$|The {{infestation}} of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by ectoparasitic {{sea lice}} (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) presents {{a need for}} new approaches to parasite control. One option {{is the use of}} ‘snorkel’ sea lice barrier technology, which restricts salmon from accessing the surface except via a vertical chamber impermeable to sea lice larvae. This prevents the salmon from swimming at the depths where infective sea lice are most abundant. Before snorkels can be implemented in commercial sea-cages, knowledge is required about their effects on salmon welfare and growth. Here, we installed snorkels of 4 m depth into three 12 × 12 × 12 m 3 cages, and recorded the lice infestation of stocked fish along with their growth, behaviour, and snout and fin condition over a 12 -week period. Three standard sea-cages were utilised for comparison, and all six cages were stocked with ~ 3500 salmon (2. 3 ± 0. 6 kg). After 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks, fish in snorkel cages had 65, 24, 43, and 56 % lower lice levels than in <b>standard</b> <b>cages,</b> respectively.

Methods: We selected patients underwent DLIF, 125 cases used standard cages (standard group) and 38 cases used new cages (wide group). We followed them up for more than 6 months, and their radiological and clinical outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. For radiologic outcomes, lumbar lordotic angle (LLA), segmental lordoic angle (SLA), disc angle (DA), foraminal height change (FH), subsidence and intraoperative endplate destruction (iED) were checked. Clinical outcomes were compared using visual analog scale (VAS) score, Oswestry disability index (ODI) score and complications. Results: LLA and SLA showed no significant changes postoperatively in both groups. DA showed significant increase after surgery in the wide group (p< 0. 05), {{but not in the}} standard group. Subsidence was significantly lower in the wide group (p< 0. 05). There was no difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups.

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} find out whether {{furnished}} cages contribute to improving the welfare of laying hens, humerus quality and adrenal responsiveness were evaluated in laying hens reared in standard (S) and furnished cages (F). Four cage models were used: S 5, a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> model with 5 hens per cage; S 6, a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> model with 6 hens per cage; F 7, a furnished cage model with 7 hens per cage (with a nest, dust-bathing box, two perches, and claw-shortening) and F 15, a furnished cage model with 15 hens per cage (with a nest, dust-bathing box, two perches, and claw-shortening). At 72 weeks of age, maximal adrenal responsiveness was evaluated by measuring the changes in blood corticosterone level induced by the i. m. injection of 10 µg per hen of 1 - 24 ACTH (n = 15 hens per cage model). Hens (n = 15 to 23 hens per cage model) were slaughtered and the left and right humeri were used for measurement of weight, biomechanical characteristics in a flexion test, dry matter and ash percentage. Basal corticosterone levels did not differ significantly while the injection of ACTH produced a significant rise in corticosterone levels (P < 0. 001) of similar amplitude for all cage mod-els. Humeri weights, biomechanical characteristics (elastic strain, bioyield point, stiffness and break-ing strength), dry weight and percentage of dry matter were not significantly different between cage models.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of metabolic cage housing on the Wistar rat physiological state and to analyze the correlation between the minerals in blood and urine. Thirty male rats were used in the experiment. Fifteen rats (control group) were housed individually in <b>standard</b> polycarbonate <b>cages</b> and fifteen rats (experimental group) in metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy) for two weeks. Body weight, respiration rate, water and food consumptions were recorded for each animal at the beginning of the experiment. The same parameters, as well as blood and urine parameters of control and experimental animals were recorded during the experiment after 72 h, 168 h and 336 h of housing in <b>standard</b> <b>cages</b> and metabolic cages. Urine collection was measured only in the experimental group. Rats weight decreased from 3. 84 % to 18. 59 % (P< 0. 05), respiration rate from 18. 65 % to 24. 59 % (P< 0. 05) when rats were housed in metabolic cages. Consumption of food and water by the rat depended on how long the animal was kept in metabolic cage. Glucose concentration increased on average by 15. 37 %, WBC count decreased by 5. 83 % in the blood of rats housed in metabolic cages compared to the animals housed in <b>standard</b> <b>cages.</b> We did not observe significant changes of triglycerides concentration, red blood cells count and total protein between all rats. The positive moderate correlation of rat housing in a metabolic cage was between K blood and K urine, P blood and P urine, Na blood and K blood, between Na urine and P urine and significant negative moderate correlation was determined between K urine and P urine.

The weight development was normal in all groups. Capture test showed that the fox was caught ca. 3 seconds faster from the <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> than from the high cage. It took longest to catch a fox from the wide cage. The time it took to catch a fox increased in all groups as the foxes grew. At pelting, the capture time was longest in a high cage and shortest in a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> [...] The foxes remained healthy throughout the study and the results of small blood picture indicated of good general health in all groups. Right and left adrenal glands were heaviest in foxes with high cages. Raising the roof of the cage succeeded without difficulties. The door is traditionally situated on the roof of a cage which now had to be displaced on the front wall of the cage. The door needs more developing. When foxes grew, a second person was needed to hold the door when catching a fox, which prolonged the time needed to catch a fox. The two doors in the wide cage were situated on both ends of the cage, thereby complicating the capture. Only one door situated {{in the middle of the}} cage could ease the capture. The animal grew well, remained healthy and produced a good fur, so high cage seems to be suited for housing foxes. High cage also seamed to be the less stressful cage setup of all three. Because of the high roof, foxes are able to sit on the self and the roof does not wear down the fur on the back. Moreover, a great height makes it possible to attach another self on the wall. vo...|$|E
40|$|Age plays a {{mediating}} {{role and}} can intensify cardiovascular health changes resulting from sedentary and physically active lifestyles. The {{purpose of this}} study was to monitor age-related changes in physical activity and biomarkers of cardiovascular health in animals provided access to: 1) a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> (SED), 2) 1 -hr twice weekly in a large box (PA), and 3) alternate day running wheel (EX). Physical activity declined in all three groups with age. Biomarkers of cardiovascular health were maintained with age in all groups, with a few exceptions: total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure increased in SED and PA at 16 months. Animals in the EX group decreased their physical activity significantly with age, but daily activity was significantly greater compared with both PA and SED groups. Animals in PA and SED groups had extremely low activity levels throughout their life spans and showed signs of cardiovascular disease after age 1...|$|E
40|$|Experiences {{with early}} life pain and stress {{influence}} important pain pathways that affect adult pain sensitivity. This research looks specifically at {{the influences of}} environmental enrichment (enhancement {{of the social and}} physical environments) and neonatal pain on adult pain sensitivity in mice. A sample of 100 mice were divided into surgery, sham surgery or control conditions and were then housed in either an enriched or a <b>standard</b> <b>cage</b> for nine weeks. Testing included pain sensitivity through tail withdrawal; Von Frey filaments, and abdominal constriction tests, stress responsiveness through blood corticosterone measurements after the restraint stressor test, and hippocampal neurogenesis. Findings showed a significant interaction between the surgery condition and environmental enrichment in all pain modalities, suggesting that enrichment modulates the effects of neonatal pain. Corticosterone and neurogenesis results were inconclusive. Future directions include using morphine and naloxone to test initial influences of acute neonatal pain, as well as opioid-knockout mice to elucidate the mechanisms of enrichment in these effects...|$|E

40|$|The Committee for the Use of Animals in Research at International Budo University {{approved}} this study. Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 44) were individually housed for {{one week}} in <b>standard</b> plastic <b>cages</b> (W 29 ×D 44 ×H 20 cm) to acclimatize them to the laboratory environment (room temperature and humidity, 22 ± 2 °C and 60 % ± 5 %, respectively; 12 : 12 -h light-dark cycle). The rats {{were randomly assigned to}} the following groups at the age of five weeks: (1) 10 SC (n= 6, average body weight 126 g), sedentary controls housed in <b>standard</b> plastic <b>cages</b> until the age of 15 weeks; (2) 10 VE (n= 7, average body weight 131 g), housed in a YVN 95 voluntary-exercise (running-wheel) device equipped with a (W 20 ×D 30 ×H 20 cm) housing space (Yamashita Giken, Tokushima, Japan) until the age of 15 weeks (3) 30 SC (n= 7, average body weight 142 g), sedentary controls housed in <b>standard</b> plastic <b>cages</b> until the age of 35 weeks; (4) 30 VE (n= 7, average body weight 143 g), housed in the exercise device until the age of 35 weeks; (5) 10 C 20 E (n= 7, average body weight 146 g), housed in <b>standard</b> plastic <b>cages</b> until the age of 15 weeks, then in the exercise device from the age of 16 to 35 weeks and (6) 10 E 20 C (detraining) (n= 10, averag...|$|R
40|$|Barbering (incessant grooming) is an {{abnormal}} behavior causing alopecia and commonly affects various strains of laboratory mice, including C 57 BL/ 6 J. Barbering-induced alopecia {{is a potential}} symptom of brain impairment and can indicate a stressful environment. We compared alopecia prevalence and severity in mice housed in enriched or <b>standard</b> <b>cages.</b> Providing an enriched environment delayed the onset and reduced the prevalence and overall severity of alopecia in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Husbandry methods that reduce adult alopecia are likely to promote the wellbeing of the animals. We suggest that environmental enrichment is a simple and economic way to reduce alopecia in mouse colonies...|$|R
