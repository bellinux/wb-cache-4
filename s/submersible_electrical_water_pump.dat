40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} computational results obtained on an in line, six cylinder, naturally aspirated, gasoline engine. Steady state measurements were first collected {{for a wide}} range of cam and spark timings versus throttle position and engine speed at part and full load. Simulations were performed by using an engine thermo-fluid model. The model was validated with measured steady state air and fuel flow rates and indicated and brake mean effective pressures. The model provides satisfactory accuracy and demonstrates the ability of the approach to produce fairly accurate steady state maps of BMEP and BSFC. However, results show that three major areas still need development especially at low loads, namely combustion, heat transfer and friction modeling, impacting respectively on IMEP and FMEP computations. Satisfactory measurement of small IMEP and derivation of FMEP at low loads is also a major issue. Measurements of fuel consumption were then collected during warm up for different configurations of the cooling system, with a standard mechanical <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> (MWP) and an <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> (EWP), at a constant BMEP and engine speed. Simulations were performed by using the previous model to compute IMEP and FMEP. Modeling friction during warm-up, when temperatures of head metal, block metal, coolant and oil are well below hot steady values and decoupled to some extent (split or no flow coolant tests) proves to be challenging. Computational results complement the experimental data, demonstrating the utility of the integrated approach in improving the design of the cooling system for faster warm-up...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{water supply}} for human use in Brazilian {{rural areas of}} the Cerrado region depends greatly on local natural water resources. In the {{community}} of smallholder farmers, know as Agrovila Mambaí, located in Mambaí, GO, has been undergoing this type of situation. The objective of this work has been developed aiming at presenting technical alternatives to improve the current water system capacity to supply water the referred smallholder farmers. In older to support this analysis, there were used nearby hydrological data and digital map of the area to estimate the availability of water resources. Besides this, it was carried out local inventory to evaluate watershed conditions and the alternatives for improving the current water supply systems to increase the water availability for each smallholder farmer. It was concluded that it is feasible to increase the water supply for drinking usage by increasing the capacity of a local natural spring; installing a second piston-type water-pump driven by the installed water wheel; or an <b>electrical</b> motor-driven <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> to feed the existing elevated reservoir which currently is connected to water distribution system of the community. 200...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{control of}} the {{auxiliary}} units is a possible method to save fuel in heavy vehicles. Today, the auxiliaries are often mechanically driven by the engine, and are constrained to rotate with a fixed ratio to the engine speed. This mechanical constraint results in energy losses. In the paper, the benefits of driving the auxiliaries with electricity are evaluated. The output of an electrically driven auxiliary can at every time instant be controlled to match the actual need. Considered auxiliaries are <b>electrical</b> generator, <b>water</b> <b>pump,</b> cooling fan, air compressor, air conditioning compressor, oil pump and power steering pump. Upper limits on what fuel saving {{that can be achieved}} if the auxiliaries are redesigned are first discussed. Simulations indicate that the fuel consumption caused by the auxiliary units is in the range of 5 – 7 % of the total consumption. A Modelica library used for simulation of the energy consumption of the auxiliary units is presented. The cooling system of the library is described in some detail. A case study on optimal {{control of the}} cooling system is then performed. Control actuators are the electrical generator, the cooling fan and the <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> The fan and the pump are supposed to be electrically driven. The control design is based on a simplified model derived from physical principles. It is evaluated through simulations with external variables collected from experiments.

5000|$|On June 26, at 1:30 a.m., a 8 ft high, 2000 ft long water filled rubber [...] "flood berm" [...] that {{surrounded}} {{portions of the}} plant was punctured by a small earth mover ("Bobcat") and collapsed. The collapse of the flood berm allowed flood waters to surround the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, and also forced the temporary transfer of power from the external electricity grid to backup electrical generators. It was reported more than 2 ft of water rushed in around buildings and electrical transformers. Backup generators were then used to ensure the facility maintained electrical power for cooling. The rupturing of the flood berm also resulted in approximately 100 gal of petroleum being released into the river as many fuel containers were washed out. The fuel/oil containers were staged around the facility to supply fuel for <b>pumps</b> which remove <b>water</b> within the flood containment barriers. The rubber berm was a secondary measure not mandated by the NRC and {{was put in place}} by OPPD to provide additional room for work immediately outside the reactor buildings.

40|$|The use of {{multiphase}} flow meters (MPFMs) increase each year. The {{main reasons for}} this are the cost benefits connected {{to the use of}} such a meter by eliminating exclusive lines to the test separator and the test separator itself and the demand for a meter that can measure the produced fluids in real time without separating the phases. The MPFMs measures the flow rate by use of different measurement principles and techniques, and in combination of these, e. g. by means of Venturi and void fraction sensor. The scope of this thesis is to measure the flow rate of a two-phase flow by means of a flow meter device and a void fraction sensor and to check the applicability of several known calculation methods to the measurements. In order determine the flow rate of such a flow; a flow loop, flow meter, and a void fraction sensor are required to be designed and fabricated. The Venturi tube is a common flow meter and can offer high accuracy, high pressure recovery, a short straight pipe run is required upstream and has no moveable parts. No moveable parts are preferred throughout the industry, owing to expensive maintenance runs of any moveable part. The flow rate can be determined from the pressure drop over the Venturi from well known relationships. An impedance probe is used to determine the void fraction of the flow. This sensor is made from two full-ring electrodes flush mounted to the inner pipe wall making the impedance probe non-intrusive. To determine the mean void fraction from the impedance measurements the liquid holdup equation proposed by Andreussi et al. (1988) is used. Two rotameters are used as reference measurements in the flow loop, one for water and one for air. An <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> and an air compressor are used in order to obtain a wide range of flow rates. The flow rates used in this study are ranging from 1. 185 up to 1. 975 m 3 /h for water and 0. 347 up to 2. 1 m 3 /h for air. Flow characteristics that are encountered are defined as bubbly and transition to slug flow, and the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the mass quality obtained ranged up to 0. 12 %. The uncertainty of the Venturi and impedance probe is obtained by the use of 90 % confidence interval, which is a common method used to present the uncertainty of a MPFM, Johnsen (2010). From the measurements the Chisholm correlation proved to achieve the best performance in predicting the flow rate of the two-phase flow and the homogenous model gives reasonable predictions of the flow. The uncertainty of the meters ability to measure the flow rate by the use of Chisholm correlation is ± 3. 5 %, ± 10. 23 %, and ± 4. 19 % for water, air, and total flow rate, respectively. The study shows that the measurement of a low quality (χ < 0. 12 %) two-phase flow is possible by the means of simple Venturi and impedance probe, when the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the flow is within the bubbly and transition to slug flow. </p...|$|R
