5|$|The {{experiments}} {{continued in}} 1942, but were ultimately unsuccessful; the problems posed by impurities in the coke and uranium oxide {{had not been}} fully appreciated, {{and as a result}} too many neutrons were captured. But Laurence's efforts attracted <b>some</b> <b>attention,</b> and in the summer of 1940 he was visited by R. H. Fowler, the British scientific liaison officer in Canada. This was followed by a visit from John Cockcroft of the British Tizard Mission to the United States in the autumn.

5|$|After this, {{they were}} sent to Pernois for rest and re-organisation, and after being brought back up to about two-thirds strength, the 2nd Battalion's next {{involvement}} in the fighting came around Mouquet Farm when they were briefly put into the line on 18/19 August to provide reinforcement, before being quickly relieved a few days later. In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the Ypres–Commines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division {{were placed in the}} centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to draw <b>some</b> <b>attention</b> away from the fighting that was occurring on the Somme.|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} run for Governor of Oregon in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his {{candidacy}} {{going into the}} primary election. The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition. In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig Unander for the Republican nomination. In July 1958, after the primary election, Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now Portland State University). The marriage during the campaign drew <b>some</b> <b>attention</b> as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion. The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Vincent ("Visko"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by other Republicans for joint appearances.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving <b>some</b> <b>attention</b> again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of <b>some</b> <b>attention.</b> The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
