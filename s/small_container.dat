5|$|After the war ended, the {{graphite}} reactor {{became the}} first facility {{in the world to}} produce radioactive isotopes for peacetime use. On August 2, 1946, Oak Ridge National Laboratory director Eugene Wigner presented a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> of carbon-14 to the director of the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, for medical use at the hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Subsequent shipments of radioisotopes, primarily iodine-131, phosphorus-32, carbon-14, and molybdenum-99/technetium-99m, were for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the <b>small</b> <b>container</b> up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of urinals, be it for single users or as trough designs for multiple users, are often intended to be utilized from a standing position (rather than squatting or sitting), but designs exist which are intended {{to be used with}} other postures. The term may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> in which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the immediate trigger of the Rodney King verdicts, various other factors have been cited as causes of the unrest. In the years preceding the riots, several other highly controversial incidents involving alleged police brutality or other perceived injustices against minorities were intensely scrutizined {{by the media and}} activist groups. The fatal shooting of black teenager Latasha Harlins by Korean American shop-owner Soon Ja Du, during a scuffle after Du mistakenly assumed Harlins was trying to steal a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> of orange juice, came just 13 days after the beating of Rodney King. Du's sentence of 5 years probation and 400 hours of community service but no jail time was pointed to as a potential reason for the riots, particularly for the aggression rioters expressed toward Korean Americans. Publications such as Newsweek and Time suggested that the source of these racial antagonisms was derived from perceptions amongst blacks that Korean-American merchants were 'taking money out of their community' and refusing to hire blacks to work in their shops. According to this view, these tensions were subsequently intensified by Du's light sentence for manslaughter.|$|E

500|$|In {{the case}} of any such problems, those present at lambing (who {{may or may not}} include a veterinarian, most shepherds become {{accomplished}} at lambing to some degree) may assist the ewe in extracting or repositioning lambs. [...] After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. The licking clears the nose and mouth, dries the lamb, and stimulates it. [...] Lambs that are breathing and healthy at this point begin trying to stand, and ideally do so between a half and full hour, with help from the mother. [...] Generally after lambs stand, the umbilical cord is trimmed to about an inch (2.5 centimeters). Once trimmed, a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> (such as a film canister) of iodine is held against the lamb's belly over the remainder of the cord to [...] prevent infection.|$|E

In general, modern (circa 2013) microplates for HTS have either 384, 1536, or 3456 wells. These are all multiples of 96, reflecting the original 96-well microplate with spaced wells of 8 x 12 9mm [...] Most of the wells contain test items, depending {{on the nature of}} the experiment. These could be different chemical compounds dissolved e.g. in an aqueous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The wells could also contain cells or enzymes of some type. (The other wells may be empty or contain pure solvent or untreated samples, intended for use as experimental controls.) ...|$|E

Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geocaching was {{originally}} {{similar to the}} 160-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of Selective Availability from the Global Positioning System on May 2, 2000, because the improved accuracy of the system allowed for a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> to be specifically placed and located. The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer of Beavercreek, Oregon. The location was posted on the Usenet newsgroup sci.geo.satellite-nav as [...] By May 6, 2000, it had been found twice and logged once (by Mike Teague of Vancouver, Washington). According to Dave Ulmer's message, this cache was a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained software, videos, books, food, money, and a slingshot. A geocache and plaque called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque now sit at the site.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 January 1889, she {{was given}} the habit and {{received}} the name Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus. On 8 September 1890, Th√©r√®se took her vows.

In his [...] "A l'ecole de Therese de Lisieux: maitresse de la vie spirituelle, [...] "Bishop Guy Gaucher emphasizes that Therese saw the devotions to the Child Jesus and to the Holy Face as so completely linked that she signed herself [...] "Therese de l'Enfant Jesus de la Sainte Face"‚ÄîTherese of the Child Jesus of the Holy Face. In her poem [...] "My Heaven down here", composed in 1895, Therese expressed the notion that by the divine union of love, the soul takes on the semblance of Christ. By contemplating the sufferings associated with the Holy Face of Jesus, she felt she could become closer to Christ. She wrote the words [...] "Make me resemble you, Jesus!" [...] on a small card and attached a stamp with an image of the Holy Face. She pinned the prayer in a <b>small</b> <b>container</b> over her heart.|$|E
