40|$|In most cases, myopia is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} axial length of the eye, but the exact mechanisms for the axial elongation are still unknown. Higher intraocular pressure (IOP) has been associated with myopia and could be involved in eye enlargement. Also, some investigators have argued that the mechanical stresses generated by the ocular muscles during near work cause the eye to stretch out of shape. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of IOP on eye geometry, build a finite element model of the corneo-scleral shell of a chick eye, and verify if the eye could elongate due to increased IOP and hence become myopic. In the present study, myopia was induced in the right eye of chicks using - 15 dioptre (D) goggles. The in-vitro pressure-volume curves of normal and myopic chick eyes were obtained using a computer controlled syringe pump and a digital pressure gauge. The axial length and horizontal equatorial diameter of the chick eyes as pressure increased were measured from digital photographs. To build the finite element model, normal chick eyes were frozen, sliced using a microtome, and photographed. The image sequence was aligned using MATLAB software and imported into SolidWorks® and Mimics software packages for three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction. Three 3 D models were constructed and imported into Abaqus/CAE® software for finite element analysis. Isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic and exponentially <b>stiffening</b> <b>material</b> properties were used for the finite element models. The results of the finite element models were compared with the experimental data. The results showed that normal chick eyes elongated in the axial direction and initially contracted in the horizontal equatorial direction as IOP increased. Myopic chick eyes did not elongate as much in the axial direction and did not contract as much in the horizontal equatorial direction compared with normal eyes. The volumetric deformation of myopic eyes was similar to normal eyes suggesting that growth and remodelling of the ocular tissues was involved in experimental myopia in the chick. The 3 D reconstructed geometry of a chick eye was similar to a real eye although small geometric inaccuracies were present. The finite element model with isotropic, homogeneous, and exponentially <b>stiffening</b> <b>material</b> properties agreed well with the experimental strains {{in spite of the fact}} that the anisotropy of the ocular tissues was not included in the finite element model. This suggests that the oblate geometry of the chick eye was the main parameter dictating its deformation under increased IOP. The natural tendency of chick eyes is to elongate in the axial direction as IOP increases and this suggests that IOP could play a role in myopia onset and progression. The way chick eyes deformed as pressure increased is probably due to their oblate geometry. The finite element model could be used in the future to study the effect of different parameters such as ocular muscle forces and ocular tissues material properties on eye geometry. This way, an eye configuration more prone to eye elongation and myopia could be determined...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study of {{problems}} associated with fabric sewing, such as seam pucker and sewing damage, in commercial garment manufacture. Part 1 continues previous work by the author on seam pucker in structurally jammed fabrics; in particular {{it has been shown that}} initial Young's modulus of a fabric is a measure of the ability of the fabric to accommodate compressive forces during sewing. This result provides an additional means of predicting the tendency of a fabric to exhibit seam pucker. The static mechanism of seam pucker proposed previously, based upon the relative magnitudes of bending stiffness of thread and fabric, has been revised by establishing that sewing machine dynamics and pucker are closely related. It has been shown that presser foot bouncing in particular induces pucker and that the sewing thread needs to be positively controlled during stitch formation. These results were verified by simple experimental methods, suggesting that modifications to the sewing machine are needed. Such modifications are beyond the scope of this work. Following the earlier static mechanism of seam pucker, it has been shown that seam pucker in fabrics is reduced significantly when the bending stiffness and extensibility of the sewing thread is reduced. In addition seam pucker can be eliminated by improving fabric stiffness locally along the seam area, by incorporating a <b>stiffening</b> <b>material</b> in the seam; this is based upon the technique of pucker elimination found in the author's previous work. In this study this technique is implemented with considerable success in other types of seams and commercially available stiffening materials have been selected. Part 2 investigates sewing damage to fabrics due to sewing needle penetration. Preliminary studies suggested the need for a reliable testing facility. This was made by instrumenting an industrial overlock sewing machine. The instrumentation was based on measuring the force which is exerted by the sewing needle when penetrating the fabric. The testing facility consists of the sewing machine with a strain gauged sewing needle and plate, and a shaft encoder for stitch marking, which with proper signal amplification and conditioning could be fed to a transient recorder and osciloscope for signal capturing and plotting. Investigations with fabrics revealed that the magnitude of the peak force of each stitch cycle can be related to the degree of sewing damage in the fabric. Based on these results the most important variables in sewing damage were fabric softening and its effective application during finishing, and sewing needle size. Studies of sewing damage under dynamic conditions have shown that sewing damage is a frictional problem between yarns in the fabric and between yarns and the metal of the sewing needle, foot, plate and feed dog. The size of the needle plate of the sewing machine seems to affect the degree of damage and fabric "flagging" during sewing damage has been experienced. Finally in the latter section of this study a prototype routine sewing damage tester has been developed and each stage of its development is described. This tester is based on an instrumented overlock sewing machine, which is interfaced with an IBM PC for computerised data capture and analysis in real time. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of floating rings on the stability of longitudinally stiffened, thin-walled cylinders in axial compression. Mylar and Plexiglas were used as the skin and <b>stiffening</b> <b>materials,</b> respectively. The primary objectives of the investigation were: (1) to determine the increase in buckling stress that could be obtained by the addition of floating rings; (2) to determine the ring stiffness required for the maximum cylinder strength; (3) to determine what effect the number of longitudinal stiffeners had on the ability of the rings to increase the buckling stress; and (4) to examine the mechanism of buckling in the various ring-stringer combinations. A strength-weight analysis was also made. The addition of rings was found to be very effective in increasing the cylinder buckling load when 24 longitudinal stiffeners were used. The addition of three rings to a cylinder with 24 longitudinal stiffeners increased the buckling load 123 per cent with only a 20 per cent increase in weight. The ring stiffness beyond which there was no more increase in cylinder buckling strength was determined for the 24 stringer, two and three ring configurations. The ability of a ring to increase the buckling stress was markedly decreased when the number of longitudinal stiffeners was decreased from 24 to 12. The mechanism of buckling was also affected by the number of rings and longitudinal stiffeners. In the light of the experimental results, two analytical methods are suggested for predicting the buckling stress of floating ring stiffened cylinders...|$|R

500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious <b>stiffening</b> <b>materials</b> to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|R

This new model makes {{the assumption that the}} complementary energy {{is a function of the}} local stress and (the deviatoric part of) its first gradient. Its derivation (including boundary conditions) relies on a rigorous variational approach. However, the resulting set of equations is rather complex in general.

In this talk, we propose an analytical exploration of this simplified model. We will produce the closed-form solution to Eshelby's spherical inhomogeneity problem. From the analysis of the corresponding local fields, we will show that stress- and strain-gradient elasticity theories are not in duality, as one would be tempted to think.
