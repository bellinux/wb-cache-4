In the early nineteenth century, a shop called 2 ̆ 2 At the sign of the Turk 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Head</b> 2 ̆ 2 existed in the Building 2 ̆ 7 s location.

40|$|AbstractThe ribosomal {{translocation}} involves both intersubunit rotations {{between the}} small 30 S and large 50 S subunits and the intrasubunit rotations of the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> {{relative to the}} 30 S body. However, the detailed molecular mechanism on how the intersubunit and intrasubunit rotations {{are related to the}} translocation remains unclear. Here, based on available structural data a model is proposed for the ribosomal translocation, into which both the intersubunit and intrasubunit rotations are incorporated. With the model, we provide quantitative explanations of in vitro experimental data showing the biphasic character in the fluorescence change associated with the mRNA translocation and the character of a rapid increase that is followed by a slow single-exponential decrease in the fluorescence change associated with the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> rotation. The calculated translation rate is also consistent with the in vitro single-molecule experimental data...|$|R
