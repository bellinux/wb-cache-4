40|$|For {{a typical}} narrow bore (50 m) and wide bore (320 m) {{capillary}} column {{the effects of}} increased stationary phase film thickness (df) on the minimum detectable amount, Qo, {{as well as on}} the minimum analyte concentration, Co, are described. In treating the effect of an increased film thickness, two approaches can be followed; either the separation temperature is kept constant, resulting in larger values of the capacity ratio, k, or the column temperature is increased such as to keep k constant. For normalized chromatographic conditions the effects of both approaches on the minimum plate height, optimum carrier gas velocity, and required plate number are described, finally yielding expressions for Qo and Co for both mass flow and concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors.</b> At constant temperature, Co always increases with the film thickness for mass flow <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> (e. g. FID). Wide bore thin film columns offer the lowest value of Co attainable. For concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> (e. g. TCD), Co is affected neither by column diameter nor by film thickness. The Qo-df plot for constant temperature shows a minimum, suggesting an optimum film thickness for mass flow sensitive as well as concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors.</b> The corresponding capacity ratio has a value between 0. 5 and 1. 5. At elevated temperatures (k constant) in combination with mass flow <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors,</b> again an optimum film thickness exists, corresponding to a minimum value of Co. For constant capacity ratio Qo always increases with the film thickness for both types of detectors. As indicated above, in some situations the lowest values of Co and Qo are obtained at an increased film thickness, the effect being marginal. As an initial guideline, for the daily practice of capillary gas chromatography with respect to minimum values of Co and Qo, the use of thin film columns is to be preferred...|$|R

40|$|Expressions for {{the minimum}} {{detectable}} amount Qo and the minimum analyte concentration Co as {{functions of the}} chromatographic parameters are derived for both mass and concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors.</b> The effects of pressure drop, column inner diameter and film thickness are given. The minimum analyte concentration for mass flow <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors.</b> Com, can be reduced considerably by selecting the carrier gas velocity well above its optimum value (related to Hmin), however, {{at the cost of}} long columns and long analysis times. For Qo the improvements can be neglected, and so the analysis can best be performed at Uopt. When the flow rate in the detector, Fd, is equal to the column flow rate Fc, the maximum permissible detector volume of concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> is proportional to dc 2 up to dc 3, and so narrow bore columns require detectors of extremely small volume. Make-up gas has to be added when the actual volume is too large, thus deteriorating the detectability. Another approach, vacuum operation of the detector cel appears to be very attractive. On the other hand, when wide bore colums are used in combination with small volume concentration <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors,</b> very small values of Qoc and Coc are obtainable when the abundant carrier gas can be removed before entering the detector cell. Digital noise filtering can further reduce the obtainable Qo and Co values, especially for broad peaks and thus for wide bore columns...|$|R

2500|$|The {{computational}} {{conversion of}} the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position <b>sensitive</b> <b>detector,</b> to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed [...] "reconstruction". Reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. Most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and utilise empirical corrections to stereographic projection to convert detector positions back to a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, R3. By sweeping this surface through R3 {{as a function of}} the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2D detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.|$|E

40|$|International audienceContrast {{thresholds}} for discriminating {{orientation and}} direction of a drifting, oriented grating are usually similar to contrast detection thresholds, which suggest that the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> are labeled for both orientation and direction (Watson and Robson, 1981). This {{was found to be}} true in noiseless condition, but Arena et al. (2013) recently found that this was not true in localized noise (i. e., noise having the same spatiotemporal window as the target) as thresholds for discriminating direction were higher than for discriminating orientation. They suggested that this could be {{explained by the fact that}} there are more neurons selective to orientation than direction. Another possible interpretation is that, unlike contrast thresholds in absence of noise, the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> in localized noise were labeled for orientation, but not for direction. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings showing different processes operating in localized and extended noise (i. e., full-screen, continuously displayed noise, Allard and Cavanagh, 2011). In the current study, we evaluated contrast thresholds for orientation and direction discrimination tasks in noiseless conditions, and in noise that was either spatially localized or extended, and temporally localized or extended. We found similar orientation and direction thresholds in absence of noise and in temporally extended noise, but greater direction thresholds in temporally localized noise. This suggests that in noiseless and temporally extended noise the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> were labeled for both orientation and direction (e. g., direction-selective complex cells), whereas in temporally localized noise the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>detectors</b> were labeled for orientation but not direction (e. g., simple cells). We conclude that to avoid violating the noise-invariant processing assumption, external noise paradigms investigating motion processing should use noise that is temporally extended, not localized...|$|R
