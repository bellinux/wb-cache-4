25|$|Rather than {{engineer}} {{a completely}} new chassis for the Premier the then-new Renault 25's monocoque underpinnings were used as a basis and adapted for the new product. Using the Renault 25 chassis the suspension {{was derived from the}} Renault Medallion (Renault 21). The suspension featured a four-wheel independent system with MacPherson struts at the front wheels and two torsion bars at each rear wheel, with <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> in both front and rear.|$|E
25|$|The 2.0 {{part of the}} moniker {{refers to}} the updated aero package, which {{incorporates}} a bigger rear wing, new front dive planes, and a new carbon-fiber front splitter. The package improves downforce to 400 pounds at 150mph versus the 2014 Viper TA's 278 pounds at 150mph. The internal parts have also been improved, with a much better suspension setup, new two-piece Brembo rotors, and improved shocks, dampers, springs, and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars.</b> The car also has an improved X-brace.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and rear brake pads, <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> and rear lower control arms from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|E

40|$|For {{the study}} of the {{influence}} of hydraulic active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> to vehicle lateral stability under high speed steering maneuver, the hydraulic active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> HIL test platform is implemented. The HIL test platform is designed with single/double axles universal test bench to experiment on single or double axles active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> using MC 9 S 12 DG 128 microcontroller as the core controller and running vehicle dynamics model in the dSPACE. This HIL platform is used to study the effect of the hydraulic active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> on the vehicle roll stability under different types of the road and typical steering maneuvers. The experiment results illustrate that the hydraulic active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> HIL test platform can simulate the experiment environment and provide a powerful support for the development of active <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> system...|$|R

25|$|The SS {{was now a}} trim option {{limited to}} the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars,</b> 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus RC F {{is a high}} {{performance}} version of the RC with the 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8 engine with Atkinson cycle at cruising speeds, eight-speed automatic transmission sending the power to the rear wheels. The RC F is equipped with vertical G-sensor for VDIM, Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) with three operating modes, Standard, Slalom, or Track, front and rear coil-spring independent suspension, monotube gas-filled shock absorbers and ball-jointed <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars,</b> three new 19-inch diameter forged aluminum wheels, spindle grille with F-mesh pattern on the lower half, unique front hood which raises {{the peak of the}} vehicle, hood air vent from the LFA, front cooling ducts, front fender ducts in the L shape, exclusive combination meters from LFA (a large centrally mounted tachometer that alters according to drive mode, digital and analog speedometer, differential torque vectoring monitor, G-force meter, oil and water temperature gauges, mileage information and a stopwatch), elliptical cross-section thick grip steering wheel, all-new high back seats, ornamentation and pedals, Brembo four-wheel power assisted disc brakes with anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (BA), 19x9-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels, 255/35R19 front and 275/35R19 rear tires.|$|E
500|$|The {{redesigned}} LS 400 interior received upgraded features, varying from dual-zone climate {{controls to}} rear cupholders. A newly patented seat cushion design, {{similar to the}} car's suspension, utilized lightweight internal coil springs and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> to improve comfort. One of the first in-dash CD changers was offered as an option. Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones, three-point seat belts at all positions, and a new collapsible steering column. In Japan, the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same [...] "A", [...] "B", and top-spec [...] "C" [...] configurations as before, along with an additional selection of exterior colors. Several optional features, such as a compact disc-based Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system and reclining rear seats, were available only in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Torque arm' rear {{suspension}} {{is like that}} of the Monza 2+2, and the axle, from the Monza 2+2, gives a 3.73:1 ratio from a [...] ring gear. A limited slip differential was optional. Included were GT springs, shocks, and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> (larger at the rear than the Vega GT's); exclusive BR70-13 BSW radial tires on British-made 6inch, gold-painted cast aluminum wheels with Chevy center caps; black-finished wiper arms, H.D. radiator and provisions for “Fast Steer” option. The Cosworth was the first Chevrolet passenger car with electronic fuel injection. Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not offered. A pilot line 1976 model was built in September 1975, and volume 1976 production began in December 1975.|$|E
2500|$|... 1994: The first facelift: Front {{grill and}} {{headlamps}} were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available. [...] A major redesign to the dash added a {{passenger side airbag}} and made it less cluttered and more modern. [...] A new model was introduced, the Luxury Sport Sedan (LSS). [...] Engineers fitted bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), floor shifter and a center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) into the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. [...] Higher spring rates and larger diameter <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars</b> for {{the front and rear}} suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling.|$|E

The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet's new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating [...] at 3800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 5.7 liter (350 CID) V8. The 262 V8 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A mid-year option for the 1976 model year was a sport front end available for the Towne Coupe, which features the 2+2's polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder option package was first introduced in 1976. It features a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, F41 suspension with larger front and rear <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bars,</b> and special shock absorbers.

50|$|An {{anti-roll}} bar (roll bar, anti-sway <b>bar,</b> sway <b>bar,</b> <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar)</b> {{is a part}} of many automobile suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar</b> patent was awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919.|$|R

With the larger engine came a rear <b>stabilizer</b> <b>bar,</b> wider tires, and an optional automatic transmission with four speeds instead of three. A second airbag became standard in 1994; leather seats were an option on the LSi between 1994-1997.
