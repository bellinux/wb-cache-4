2500|$|Also in {{the first}} edition of the film, and removed from the second edition, when {{referring}} to the murder of Theo van Gogh a picture of the Dutch rapper Salah Edin is displayed instead of the murderer Mohammed Bouyeri. The picture was shot for the rapper's album 'Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie' (Netherlands' Worst Nightmare), which according to the singer's website, was shot to be 'exactly like the mugshot of convicted killer Mohamed B'. A 2007 article by Dutch newspaper De Dag had captioned an article about the killer with the shot. On that occasion, Salah Edin's received an out-of-court libel settlement for the publication. The photo was said by the rapper to be intended to depict [...] "the way the average white Dutch citizen <b>sees</b> <b>me,</b> as a young Moroccan Muslim radical. That's why I chose to do this picture and use it for the front cover of my album. It is in no way supporting the deeds of Mohamed B." [...] Edin has accepted a settlement of €25,000 for copyright infringement.|$|E

[...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends.

[...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E

2500|$|June 12, 2009: Both teams played {{each other}} {{for the first time at}} the new Yankee Stadium. The game had several lead changes, {{including}} Mariano Rivera giving up the go ahead run to the Mets in the 8th. In the bottom of the 9th, after Derek Jeter stole 2nd base and Mark Teixeira was intentionally walked, the Mets new closer Francisco Rodríguez (K-Rod) paired off against Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod). In what seemed a routine pop with two outs, Mets 2nd baseman and three time gold glove award winner Luis Castillo dropped the ball. Teixeira wound up scoring the winning run all the way from first on the error to give the Yankees the 9-8 victory. It would prove to be the Yankees' 7th walk off game that season and the first statistical blown save for K-Rod as a Met. After the game, injured Yankees pitcher Brian Bruney criticized K-Rod and his animated behavior on the mound to reporters. [...] " [...] couldn't have happened to a better guy on the mound, either", said Bruney. [...] "He's got a tired act. ... He gets what he deserves, man. I just don't like watching the guy pitch. I think it's embarrassing." [...] Rodriguez responded, [...] "Instead of sending a message in the paper, next time when he <b>sees</b> <b>me</b> at Citi Field, come up to me and say it. Don't be sending a message to the media. I don't even know who that guy is, somewhere in Double-A and not even pitching one full season." ...|$|E
