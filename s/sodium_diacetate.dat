40|$|Fluorescent reagent <b>sodium</b> 1 -naphthylamine <b>diacetate</b> (NADA) was {{assembled}} onto gold electrodes via its {{electrostatic interaction}} with cysteine (Cys) that was directly assembled on the gold electrode surface. Formation of the self-assembled bilayers was confirmed and primarily characterized by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The Cys {{modification of the}} gold electrode prevented direct adsorption of NADA onto the gold electrode and hence eliminated fluorescence quenching by gold. Strong fluorescence was observed from the NADA self-assembled bilayers at gold surface and was highly efficiently quenched by Cu 2 + that allowed for an extremely highly sensitive detection of Cu 2 + with a detection limit of 0. 2 ppt and quantitative detection range of 0. 5 - 9 ppt. The fluorescence from NADA/Cys/Au can be easily regenerated and therefore the present report showed a reusable method for immobilizing reagent in fabricating fluorescent chemosensors.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood ScienceKelly J. K. GettyListeria monocytogenes has the {{potential}} to contaminate ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products. Listeria monocytogenes contamination is a hazard that can potentially occur after post-lethality treatment in a processing environment during slicing or packaging of RTE meat products. United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) requires facilities to have intervention strategies to demonstrate control of this pathogen in RTE meat and poultry products. FSIS categorizes different intervention strategies into Alternative 1, 2, or 3. If an establishment chooses Alternative 1, it must use a post-lethality treatment that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product and an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of L. monocytogenes. If an establishment chooses Alternative 2, it can either use a post-lethality treatment or an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits growth of L. monocytogenes. Under Alternative 3, the establishment must have a detailed sanitation program as its intervention strategy. As establishments increase the number of interventions or change from Alternative 3 to 2 to 1, the frequency of FSIS sampling of RTE meat and poultry products for safety and wholesomeness decreases. The effectiveness of post-package decontamination technologies such as high-pressure processing, ultraviolet C light, and pre/post-package surface pasteurization have been researched for controlling L. monocytogenes in RTE products. Formulating meat products with antimicrobial additives such as lactates, sodium lactate and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate,</b> potassium lactate and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate,</b> sodium levulinate, lauric arginate, glucono-delta-lactone, or organic acids is another common approach to control L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products. Also, a combination of sodium lactate and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> in a formulation is an acceptable antimicrobial strategy to provide Alternative 2 status. Bacteriocins such as nisin can also be added to the formulation of RTE meat and poultry products for controlling L. monocytogenes. In addition nisin can be applied as packaging film coating. Another approach for controlling L. monocytogenes in products such as jerky, kippered steaks, snack sticks and turkey tenders is the use of packaging environments and holding times prior to shipping. In conclusion, there are various approaches for controlling L. monocytogenes in RTE meat and poultry products post-lethality and processors should consider these options rather than relying on sanitation alone...|$|E
40|$|Sodium nitrite {{has been}} always {{considered}} {{as one of the}} common additives due to its antibacterial effects on Clostridium botulinum and meat products' color, however it produces cancer creating nitrosamine.

Lactates also improve organileptic properties including color, texture and taste and antioxidant properties. Sodium lactate causes to more reduction of anaerobic spore former bacteria than nitrite, inhibits botulin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Sodium lactate produces a permanent reddish pink color through reduction of deoxymygloboline and producing deoxymyoglobuline. In this study, the decrease of sodium nitrite amount from 120 ppm to 15 ppm by adding sodium lactate / <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> led to achieve an acceptable product.

40|$|Fresh {{blue crab}} (Callinectes sapidus) meat was {{obtained}} from retail markets in Florida and sampled for viable Listeria monocytogenes. The pathogen was found in crabmeat in three of four different lots tested by enrichment and at levels of 75 CFU/g {{in one of the}} same four lots by direct plating. Next, crabmeat was steam sterilized, inoculated with a three-strain mixture of L. monocytogenes (ca. 5. 5 log 10 CFU/g), washed with various lactic acid bacterium fermentation products (2, 000 to 20, 000 arbitrary units [AU]/ml of wash) or food-grade chemicals (0. 25 to 4 M), and stored at 4 degrees C. Counts of the pathogen remained relatively constant in control samples during storage for 6 days, whereas in crabmeat washed with Perlac 1911 or MicroGard (10, 000 to 20, 000 AU), numbers initially decreased (0. 5 to 1. 0 log 10 unit/g) but recovered to original levels within 6 days. Numbers of L. monocytogenes cells decreased 1. 5 to 2. 7 log 10 units/g of crabmeat within 0. 04 day when washed with 10, 000 to 20, 000 AU of Alta 2341, enterocin 1083, or Nisin per ml. Thereafter, counts increased 0. 5 to 1. 6 log 10 units within 6 days. After washing with food-grade chemicals, modest reductions (0. 4 to 0. 8 log 10 unit/g) were observed with sodium acetate (4 M), <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> (0. 5 or 1 M), sodium lactate (1 M), or sodium nitrite (1. 5 M). However, Listeria counts in crabmeat washed with 2 M <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> decreased 2. 6 log 10 units/g within 6 days. In addition, trisodium phosphate reduced L. monocytogenes counts from 1. 7 (0. 25 M) to > 4. 6 (1 M) log 10 units/g within 6 days. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Fresh, boneless, vacuum-packaged pork loins were {{obtained}} from a commercial pork processor and used in a five-part study {{to examine the effects}} of sodium chloride (0,. 125,. 375,. 75, 1. 50 %), sodium phosphates (0,. 1,. 2,. 3 and. 4 %), sodium lactate (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 %), potassium lactate (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 %) and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> (0,. 05,. 10,. 15 and. 20 %) on the color, sensory characteristics, package purge, water holding capacity, and pH of pork chops stored in vacuum-packaging for 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. The first experiment examined the effects of sodium chloride and sodium phosphates (Brifisol 512, polyphosphate blend) in the aforemented attributes. The second experiment was designed like the first experiment except a different sodium phosphate (Brifisol 85, polyphosphate and pyrophosphate blend) was used. In the third experiment, sodium chloride was standardized at. 75 % and sodium phosphate and sodium lactate differed. In the fourth experiment, sodium chloride was standardized at. 75 % and sodium phosphate and potassium lactate differed. In the fifth experiment, sodium chloride and potassium lactate were standardized at. 75 % and 2 %, respectively, and sodium phosphate and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> differed. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that pork chops should contain. 2 % NaP +. 75 % NaCl to improve flavor, texture, and water holding capacity over storage time. Based on results from Experiments 3 and 4, it is recommended that pork chops contain approximately 2 % NaL or KL +. 2 % NaP to maintain positive sensory flavor, texture, color and minimize processed meatlike bite, package purge, and cook loss over time. The combination of approximately. 1 % NaDi +. 2 % NaP maximized desirable characteristics like pork lean/brothy, juiciness, tenderness, and color; and minimized processed meat-like bite when compared to the control chops in Experiment 5...|$|E
40|$|Ready-to-eat meat (RTE) {{products}} such as hotdogs represent a popular segment in convenience food purchases. Increased demand has led the processors to extend the shelf life by minimizing lipid oxidation and post-processing contaminants such as Listeria monocytogenes. There is a growing interest in the food processors and consumers {{regarding the use of}} natural alternatives in place of synthetic food additives to control the growth of foodborne pathogens and (or) lipid oxidation. In recent years, green tea (GTE) and grape seed extracts (GSE) are increasing choices as they have demonstrated antioxidant as well as antimicrobial properties in various food applications. Therefore, the main objective of this research study is to reduce conventional chemical preservatives [potassium lactate (PL) and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> (SD) ] by natural plant extracts (GTE and GSE) along with nisin and EDTA combinations.

40|$|ABSTRACT Turkey deli loaves were {{evaluated}} using organic marinades {{in the raw}} product to control the growth of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and improve meat quality in the cooked product. Treatments included so-dium tripolyphosphate (STP; 0. 45 %, control), sodium lac-tate (3 %), <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> (0. 25 %), sodium citrate (0. 75 %), and sodium lactate (3 %) /sodium diacetate (0. 25 %) combination, all containing 1. 5 % salt. Data col-lected in the 2 trials included pH; lightness, redness, and yellowness; bind ability; cookedmeatmoisture; oxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances); aerobic plate count (d 0 to 80); and sensory evaluation. Also, thirty-two slices from each loaf were inoculated with a 103 cfu/ mL surface inoculum streptomycin-resistant LM cocktail and analyzed for LM levels (d 0 to 77). The sodium lactate treatment was lower in pH (5. 84) postmarination. Lactate, citrate, and the combination treatments had significantl...|$|E
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used poultry marinades include salt and sodium tripolyphosphate, which {{have been shown to}} increase meat yield and water-holding capacity, as well as improve color and texture. Recently, several poultry further-processing facilities have begun using more acidic (pH ∼ 4) type marinades such as sodium lactate, sodium citrate, and <b>sodium</b> <b>diacetate</b> (alone or in combination) to combat the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in further-processed meat loaves. Because the acidic marinades currently used in turkey further-processing have a low pH (∼ 4) compared with the previously used salt and sodium tripolyphosphate (∼pH 9), these marinades may cause meat quality problems. This review paper will discuss aspects of poultry food safety and meat quality and how acidic marinades can be used to improve safety, specifically by controlling L. monocytogenes growth, and how they affect quality of the meat products. Current industry practices will be discussed and reviewed...|$|E
