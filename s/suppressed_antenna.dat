40|$|Minimizing {{impurity}} production {{associated with}} ion cyclotron {{range of frequency}} (ICRF) operation to an acceptable level in H-mode, particularly with metallic plasma facing components (PFC), is challenging. To identify important erosion and impurity source locations, we have vacuum plasma sprayed ~ 100 μm of boron (B) onto molybdenum (Mo) tiles. For ICRF heated H-modes, the core molybdenum levels have been significantly reduced and remained at low levels for increased injected RF energy. The core Mo level also no longer scales with RF power in L-mode. With boronization and impurity seeding (typically nitrogen or neon), the plasma and ICRF antenna performance were improved. Surprisingly, impurity seeding {{did not result in}} increased core Mo levels and also <b>suppressed</b> <b>antenna</b> faults. Spectroscopic monitoring of the plasma limiter found that the impurity profile at the limiter was centered near the plasma mid-plane and the profile did not change shape with plasma current. From post campaign inspection, the B coating was not significantly eroded except in locations where melting occurred or where it peeled. Trace material analysis also found that the B surface was contaminated with Mo and tungsten (W). Improved performance with impurity seeding, the lack of erosion, and metallic contaminatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of compact size reconfigurable harmonic <b>suppressed</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is crucial in}} today’s wireless communication system. One set of Harmonic <b>Suppressed</b> <b>Antenna</b> (HSA) and its reconfigurable configuration {{in the form of}} fractal dipole antenna that is integrated with the stubs and tapered balun has been designed and tested in this study. The Koch dipoles are double-sided structure while the tapered balun is triangular. Initial design is based on a 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole. The Koch dipole antenna has equal arm lengths of 128 mm. These are fabricated on a lossy FR- 4 material. Printed fractal dipole antenna is designed to operate at 670 MHz. This shows that the linear dipole can be miniaturized by employing Koch curve fractals onto the radiating structure. Fifteen bands reconfigurable antenna were designed to operate within 400 MHz to 3. 5 GHz. However, as the frequency of operation is a low microwave band, the antenna physical size is relatively large. Tapered balun thus significantly enlarged the antenna size. In addition, the far field radiation pattern resembles that of a linear dipole. The overall antenna is found to be large and has moderate gain and efficiency. Nevertheless, it can potentially have higher gain and higher efficiency {{with the use of a}} low loss Rogers RT/Duroid material. Thus, the study on the reduction of the tapered balun size is worthwhile. Four sets of wideband tapered baluns with reduced sizes have been designed and tested as a matching circuitry in all the designed antennas. All baluns are found to perform well in terms of scattering parameters and power loss, despite having sizes of 25 %, 50 % and 75 % smaller compared to the original structure. On the other hand, the feeding line method is also investigated. The first design takes into account of 38 � input impedance of the fractal curve while the second design is a direct connection from the 50 � SMA connector to terminal. The latter is then selected as it successfully eliminated the antenna’s higher order modes, while the former is suitable for designing an optimum typical dipole antenna. Both antenna and balun are fabricated on Rogers 4530 B. Four sets of HSA with reduced size have been designed and tested in this study. All sets were based on the 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole and have equal arm lengths of 132 mm. These are named as MFDB, MFDB 75, MFDB 50 and MFDB 25. The antennas operate at 691 MHz with low return loss and successfully suppressed their two harmonic frequencies. The MFDB 25 antenna is found to exhibit similar performance in terms of the S-parameters and gain. It is also a compact antenna compared to the corresponding proposed HSA structure while the antenna achieved size reduction close to 19. 7 %, 31. 4 % and 43. 4 %. Hence, four sets of harmonic suppressed reconfigurable antennas named TMFDB, TMDB 75, TMFDB 50 and TMFDB 25 have been designed and simulated. The total numbers of switches are 56, 54, 54, and 50 units respectively. TMFDB 25 antenna is then fabricated and tested. It is found that the antenna has successfully configured 15 frequency bands and simultaneously suppressed higher order modes. The first prototype of an active TMFDB 25 antenna is fabricated to enhance the performance. The suitability of this antenna for space–limited application of future communication system such as cognitive radio has been demonstrated.. The developed antenna can reduce the size of the front-end RF unit, reduce EMI interference and provide another additional characteristic for reconfigurable antenna. Hence the aim of this project has been achieved...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of satellite mobile communications, large antennas are now widely used. The precise pointing of the antenna’s optical axis is essential for many space missions. This paper addresses the challenging problem of high-precision autonomous pointing control of a large satellite antenna. The pointing dynamics are firstly proposed. The proportional–derivative feedback and structural filter to perform pointing maneuvers and <b>suppress</b> <b>antenna</b> vibrations are then presented. An adaptive controller to estimate actual system frequencies {{in the presence of}} modal parameters uncertainty is proposed. In order to reduce periodic errors, the modified controllers, which include the proposed adaptive controller and an active disturbance rejection filter, are then developed. The system stability and robustness are analyzed and discussed in the frequency domain. Numerical results are finally provided, and the results have demonstrated that the proposed controllers have good autonomy and robustness...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{principle}} of band <b>suppressing</b> an UWB <b>antenna</b> by attaching a small resonator is explained by developing its equivalent circuit. The realized UWB antenna is a conical monopole antenna that contains a split loop for band suppression. The conical monopole antenna corresponds to a transmission line terminated with load impedance, and the split loop is an LC resonator. The coupling between the conical monopole antenna and the split loop is represented as mutual inductance. Equivalent circuits for the UWB <b>antenna</b> <b>suppressing</b> single band [WLAN] and dual band [WLAN, WiMAX] have been suggested, and these equivalent circuits {{provide insight into the}} performance characteristics of the developed band <b>suppressed</b> UWB <b>antenna</b> to which a small sized resonator is installed. Simulation and measurement results on the input impedance and VSWR of the proposed equivalent circuit are closely matched. Thus, the validity of the equivalent circuit is confirmed. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed antenna exhibits a gain of over 3 [*]dBi in the working band and has an omnidirectional radiation pattern. Band rejection has been also implemented by split loops...|$|R

40|$|A {{harmonic}} <b>suppressed</b> fractal <b>antenna</b> {{suitable for}} energy harvesting system is presented. Sierpinski Carpet fractal antenna is designed and developed with {{the capability to}} eliminate the harmonics frequencies of the higher order modes. To accomplish this, three open circuit stubs as a stubs-filter have been integrated on the transmission feed line to suppress the frequency from 2 GHz to 5 GHz. This technique is suitable for developing antenna with harmonic suppression or for single band antennas. The antenna is designed on the FR- 4 board {{with the size of}} 38 mm x 38 mm which operates efficiently at 1. 8 GHz, suitable for wireless communication applications.

40|$|Space-based {{gravitational}} wave detectors {{based on the}} Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) design operate by synthesizing one or more interferometers from fringe velocity measurements generated by changes in the light travel time between three spacecraft in a special set of drag-free heliocentric orbits. These orbits determine the inclination of the synthesized interferometer {{with respect to the}} ecliptic plane. Once these spacecraft are placed in their orbits, the orientation of the interferometers at any future time is fixed by Kepler's Laws based on the initial orientation of the spacecraft constellation, which may be freely chosen. Over the course of a full solar orbit, the initial orientation determines a set of locations on the sky were the detector has greatest sensitivity to {{gravitational wave}}s as well as a set of locations where nulls in the detector response fall. By artful choice of the initial orientation, we can choose to optimize or <b>suppress</b> the <b>antennas</b> sensitivity to sources whose location may be known in advance (e. g., the Galactic Center or globular clusters).

40|$|A {{design of}} a planar microstrip-fed ultrawideband (UWB) printed {{circular}} monopole antenna with optically controlled notched bands is presented. The proposed antenna is composed of a circular ultrawideband patch, with an etched T-shaped slot controlled by an integrated silicon switch. The slot modifies the frequency response of the <b>antenna</b> <b>suppressing</b> 3. 5 – 5 [*]GHz band when the switch is in open state. The optical switch is controlled by a low-power near-infrared (808 [*]nm) laser diode, which causes {{the change in the}} frequency response of the antenna generating a frequency notch. This solution could be expanded to include several notches in the antenna frequency response achieving a fully reconfigurable UWB antenna. The antenna could be remotely controlled at large distances using optical fiber. The prototype antenna has been fully characterized to verify these design concepts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tapered baluns of microstrip-to-parallel strip transition using triangular structure with linear transition that {{suitable for a}} 3 -dimensional (3 -D) harmonic <b>suppressed</b> dipole <b>antenna</b> (3 D-HSDA). The original balun consists of linear profile {{with the size of}} a quarter-wavelength for both the height and width with broadband characteristic (from 0 to 7 GHz). However, for some application such as narrowband HSA design, the suppression of the high operating band is needed. By using three open circuit stubs and three rectangular element of defected ground structure (DGS), two tapered baluns have been produced having the stop band feature from 2. 1 GHz to 7 GHz of frequencies. They are named as balun-stubs and balun- DGS, respectively, that operate from 0 to 2 GHz. Simulated and measured results based on the return loss and insertion loss for these baluns were found to be better than - 10 dB and - 3 dB, respectively, from 0 to 2 GHz. The employment of the stubs and the DGS made these baluns the capability to reject the unwanted high frequency band. At last, these balun are integrated with dipole antenna for validation purpose. The results shows the antenna with balun-stubs and antenna with balun-DGS operates at 900 MHz and removed undesired higher order modes at 2. 75 GHz, 4. 47 GHz and 6. 2 GHz without affecting the operating frequency...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an efficient}} two-photon up-conversion process {{in more than}} one molecule coupled to an optical antenna. In the previous work [Y. Osaka et al., PRL 112, 133601 (2014) ], we considered the two-photon up-conversion process in a single molecule within one-dimensional input-output theory, and revealed that controlling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the efficient up-conversion with radiative loss in the <b>antenna</b> <b>suppressed.</b> In this work, aiming to propose a way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend the model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more than one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome the difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies that, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can enlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|For future {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) missions, digital beamforming (DBF) on receive in elevation to form a sharp high receive beam will be adopted to improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) level and suppress range ambiguities. However, in some special cases, range ambiguities may be received by grating lobes with the high receive beam gain, and range ambiguities would not be well suppressed and even may be increased. In this paper, a new receiving approach based on analog beamforming (ABF) and DBF is proposed. According to the spaceborne SAR imaging geometry and the selected pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the antenna patterns of all subapertures of the whole receive antenna in elevation are adjusted by ABF at first. Afterwards, signals from all subapertures in elevation are combined by a real time DBF processor onboard. Since grating lobes could be <b>suppressed</b> by the <b>antenna</b> pattern of the subapertures via ABF, range ambiguities would be well suppressed even if ambiguities are received by grating lobes. Simulation results validate the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{implemented}} {{an experimental}} GBAS test bed with three ground reference receivers at Braunschweig-Wolfsburg research airport. Its compliancy {{with respect to}} accuracy, integrity, and availability requirements of CAT-I precision approach has been demonstrated in several flight trials in 2009. The research ground station consists of three Topcon Net G 3 dual frequency GNSS receivers with multipath <b>suppressing</b> choke ring <b>antennas,</b> which deliver corrections for navigation {{at a rate of}} 2 Hz. However, in the current stage only range and carrier data from the aeronautically protected L 1 -band is used. Stations are separated by baselines between 740 and 770 meters. Due to its high modularity, the station is fully accessible and can be easily reconfigured for research purposes. Currently, reconfiguration to an enhanced infrastructure is taking place to comply with the more stringent requirements of CAT-III / GAST-D approaches. In preparation for this reconfiguration, we post-processed the data collected during the 30 approaches of the 2009 flight trials (flown with DLR´s VFW 614 aircraft) with respect to the GAST-D parameters and requirements defined in the ICAO draft SARPS and RTCA DO- 253 C. In addition to the CAT-I / GAST-C processing which is based on 100 s carrier smoothed code pseudoranges, these requirements now include a second smoothing filter and pseudorange correction processing with 30 s smoothing time on both, ground and aircraft subsystem. Moreover, a battery of new monitors on the airborne side is required to ensure a sufficient level of integrity. They include a dual solution ionospheric monitoring architecture (DSIGMA), differential correction magnitude check, bias approach monitor, reference receiver fault monitor and fault detection and exclusion. The dual solution ionospheric monitor architecture compares the position solution with 30 s smoothed and corrected pseudoranges with the one obtained using the 100 s Hatch filter. If the difference exceeds 2 meters, an ionosphere anomaly is considered present and the approach service is degraded to GAST-C. The differential correction magnitude check makes sure the broadcast differential corrections do not exceed 200 meters. The bias approach monitor compares the vertical projection of the 66...|$|R
