These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon {{is also known as}} a stacker rainbow. The supernumerary bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual <b>spectrum</b> <b>pattern.</b> The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours. Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in fogbows.|$|E
50|$|Binaural hearing {{learning}} is a bionic method. The sensor is a robot dummy head with 2 sensor microphones along with the artificial pinna (reflector). The robot head has 2 rotation axes and can rotate horizontally and vertically. The reflector causes the spectrum change into a certain pattern for incoming white noise sound wave and this pattern {{is used for the}} cue of the vertical localization. The cue for horizontal localization is ITD. The system makes use of a learning process using neural networks by rotating the head with a settled white noise sound source and analyzing the spectrum. Experiments show that the system can identify the direction of the source well in a certain range of angle of arrival. It cannot identify the sound coming outside the range due to the collapsed <b>spectrum</b> <b>pattern</b> of the reflector. Binaural hearing use only 2 microphones and is capable of concentrating on one source among multiple sources of noises.|$|E

The research subjects were 24 Javanese boys, who used standard and correct Bahasa Indonesia. They were divided into two age-based groups: 12 children of 9 years old and 12 children of 12 years old. These two groups pronounced the seven words in the list which have frequency in their dominant sounds on Angle class I malocclusion with crowding variation.

40|$|Progressive {{multifocal}} leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare, often fatal, opportunistic infection, {{associated with}} demyelinating process. PML {{is caused by}} John Cunningham (JC) polyomavirus, and predominantly affects patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other immunocompromised patients. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in establishing the diagnosis of PML. MRS with long and short echo time was performed in two patients with PML associated with HIV infection and in one PML patient associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The most prominent peak on the obtained spectra was for lactate; it showed 2 - 3 times higher concentration of lactate compared to choline, almost 4 - 6 times higher lactate concentration compared to creatine, and 4 - 11 times higher lactate in comparison to N-acetylaspartate concentration. Similar <b>spectrum</b> <b>pattern</b> was observed in all patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new finding that might be useful in early diagnosis of PML. Nevertheless, further confirmation of our results is needed, since we analyzed the <b>spectrum</b> <b>pattern</b> only in three patients. Overall, our results could help in early detection of PML, especially in non-HIV patients, and thus prevent the fatal outcome of the disease.

This alignment between two frequency axes is essentially a frequency domain correspondence of these two speakers. To establish the frequency domain correspondence, we formulate the task as an optimal matching problem. The local matching is achieved by comparing the local features of the spectrogram along the frequency bins. This local matching is actually capturing the similarity of the local patterns along different frequency bins in the spectrogram.
