40|$|The paper {{deals with}} diesel {{compressed}} air starting system calculation method based on the comparison between the compressed air efficient work and the work consumed by the air compression in the engine cylinder during the compression stroke. Approximate engine starting time duration depending on pressure in <b>starting</b> <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> correlations were found, as well as compressed air consumption. The approximate correlations for calculating pressure drop in receivers depending on the receiver volume and the volume of air consumption at engine starting were given. The calculation of starting process using found out correlations was made for six cylinder slow speed engine as an example...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIndia {{receives}} abundant {{radiant energy}} from the sun on account being located in the equatorial solar belt. Especially, an annual global solar radiation of about ≥ 2400 kWh/m 2 is received in Rajasthan and northern Gujarat. It can be harnessed, for instance, using linear and point focusing based concentrated solar thermal concepts. Parabolic trough and linear Fresnel based technologies belong to the first and heliostat based power tower and parabolic dish technologies belong to the latter category. As a part of research initiative at IIT Jodhpur heliostat based concentrated solar tower concept using an open volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> concept is preferred to achieve a high temperature. This can be employed as process heat. This technology includes sub-system, such as, thermal energy storage, and heat rejection/exchange systems. In particular, the presented paper describes the design, development and evaluation of an open volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receiver.</b> A computational fluid dynamics tool, namely, ANSYS-FLUENT is utilized for evaluation purpose. The obtained hot air (heat transfer fluid) can be employed, for instance, in metal processing applications. The presented design aspects of the open volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> are:•The flow instability in an open volumetric air receiver;•Influence of material property on modeling of open air receiver;•Heat transfer experiment with a porous body;•Design and evaluation of a mixer to obtain an uniform temperature at the open volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> outlet;•Design and evaluation of a re-circulating air injection system. Finally, a 4 kWth experimental facility, which is being commissioned at IIT Jodhpur to test solar thermal sub-systems, such as, receiver, heat exchanger, thermal energy storage is also discussed, in brief...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring the EU FP 7 -Solugas {{project the}} {{feasibility}} of the solar hybrid technology with a pressurized <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> and a gas turbine was demonstrated. Over the last years the coupling of solar heat to air-Brayton cycles {{has been identified as}} a way to accelerate the CSP market penetration competing directly with conventional combined cycle plants. The path to the commercialization of this hybrid CSP product goes through the scaling of the solarized gas turbine capacity and the increase of the receiver outlet temperature. The Soltrec project focuses on the development, manufacturing and testing of a volumetric receiver, capable to raise the maximum temperature of the compressed air up to 1000 °C. The concept of volumetric <b>air</b> <b>receivers</b> is the most promising option for getting high efficiencies at these temperature levels, with solar shares of up to 80 % at design point operation. Transforming solar radiation into hot pressurized air at these temperatures levels leads to thermal and mechanical stresses that requires an innovate receiver design and the application of new heat resistant materials. With the objective of significantly increasing the solar share and lower the costs and environmental impact of the hybrid plants the pilot Soltrec <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> has been commissioned at the Abengoa Solar R&D facilities at Sanlúcar la Mayor (Seville, Spain) ...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so air {{suspension}} has become popular in the custom automobile culture: street rods, trucks, cars, and even motorcycles may have air springs. They are used in these applications to provide an adjustable suspension which allows vehicles to sit extremely low, yet be able rise to a level high enough to manoeuver over obstacles and inconsistencies on paved surfaces. These systems generally employ small, electric or engine-driven air compressors which sometimes fill an on-board <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> tank which stores compressed air for use in the future without delay. These <b>air</b> <b>receiver</b> tanks aid in improving speed or torque. It is important that the tank is sized for the task and can be calculated using a specific formula involving the compressor output, standard atmospheric pressure and compressed pressure.|$|R
