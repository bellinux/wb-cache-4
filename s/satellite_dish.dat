5|$|GoldenEye was {{the last}} film of special effects {{supervisor}} Derek Meddings, to whom the film was dedicated. Meddings' major contribution was miniatures. It {{was also the first}} Bond film to use computer generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes into the tank, and the lake which hides the <b>satellite</b> <b>dish,</b> since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Natalya meet Wade in the Florida Keys and borrow {{his plane}} {{for the trip}} to Cuba, where the same night, they make love. The next day, while searching for GoldenEye's <b>satellite</b> <b>dish,</b> they are shot down. Onatopp rappels down from a {{helicopter}} and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, Bond shoots down the helicopter, which snares Onatopp and crushes her to death against a tree. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the <b>satellite</b> <b>dish.</b> They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (Misha), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path was widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a <b>satellite</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Automatic Tracking <b>Satellite</b> <b>Dishes</b> are <b>satellite</b> <b>dishes</b> used while {{a vehicle}} is in motion.

5|$|Russell Eugene Weston, Jr. (born December 28, 1956), {{also known}} as Rusty, grew up in Valmeyer, Illinois. Weston {{attended}} Valmeyer High School, the only high school in a town of 900 people. Shortly after graduating high school in 1974, Weston moved to Rimini, Montana, rarely returning to Valmeyer. The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it. Many of Weston's Montana neighbors had disliked him, and often ignored him. They considered him to be unusual, and sometimes eccentric. Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield.|$|E
5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree and, {{the next time he}} farts, a massive <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having found them to be the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E
5|$|The bungee jump {{was filmed}} at the Contra Dam (also {{known as the}} Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The film's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's {{demonstration}} were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M's office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – to reduce expenses and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards.|$|E

5|$|Bond awakens, {{tied up with}} Natalya in the helicopter, {{which has}} been {{programmed}} to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals {{the existence of a}} second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Boris' <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> to Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly {{responsible for the death}} of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> from the roof of his home.|$|E
5|$|Light {{rainfall}} and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the United States Virgin Islands, brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 (2000USD) was reported. Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where isolated locations experienced more than 12inches (300mm) of rainfall. The heavy precipitation resulted in mudslides and flooding, {{which in turn}} damaged roads, bridges, and houses. At least 406homes on the island were flooded, five of which suffered moderate to severe damage. Additionally, there were many car accidents in San Juan due to slick roads. One indirectly fatality was reported after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a <b>satellite</b> <b>dish.</b> Damage {{on the island of}} Puerto Rico reached $501,000. In Dominican Republic, the Civil Defense Force reported that severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700people. Overall, the storm caused roughly $35,000 in damage across the island. Impact was lesser in Haiti, where squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. Additionally, rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an 8month long drought impacting the region.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers {{were unable to}} use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, {{because it had been}} reserved for First Knight, so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a bungee jump, which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film's release; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory.|$|E

25|$|Galaxy 1 carried HBO on {{transponder}} 23 {{at a rate}} of 125 watts, with relay signals {{sent out}} at 6,385 MHz. Mother Jones magazine determined that MacDougall could have potentially taken over the signals of three additional satellites. He could have taken over the network feed of CBS had he positioned his <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> at the Telstar 301 satellite, operated by AT, tuned at 6,065MHz. He also could have taken over the foreign language feed of the Voice of America network by aiming his <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> at 72 degrees west longitude. The final theorized hijacking would have been aiming his <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> at 100 degrees west longitude, above the Galápagos Islands, with a frequency setting of 293.375MHz, thereby jamming the signal of United States Navy satellite Fleetsatcom 1. The magazine also posited that an amateur hobbyist could hijack the satellites that alerted American military forces to Soviet actions, creating confusion for world leaders and placing the world at risk of nuclear destruction.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> owners faced {{the prospect of having}} to purchase descrambling equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|E

25|$|When Home Box Office (HBO) began {{scrambling}} its signal on a 24-hour {{basis on}} January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either {{equal to or}} slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several <b>satellite</b> <b>dish</b> dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. <b>Satellite</b> <b>dish</b> owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E
