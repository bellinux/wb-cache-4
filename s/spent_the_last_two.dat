5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|As a spy {{working for}} the {{government}} of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German nuclear program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.|$|E

He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> {{years of his life}} in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E

Five days later, the Stanford White set out for New York, arriving back there on 4 November.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} half-season with Rovers, Hamilton made only three {{substitute}} appearances {{as the team}} finished fourth in the division. Over the next three seasons, he became a more {{integral part of the}} Blackburn side, playing 70 matches and scoring five goals. In the 1984–85 season, he found his first-team opportunities limited, being given just three starts. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> months of the season out on loan at struggling Cardiff City, who were eventually relegated to the Football League Third Division in May 1985 after finishing second-bottom of the Second Division. Upon return from his loan spell in south Wales, Hamilton stayed at Blackburn for one more season, making 33 league appearances and scoring three goals in 1985–86. After a total of 114 league appearances and seven goals for Rovers, he left the club prior to the 1986–87 season and joined Third Division club Wigan Athletic for a fee of £16,000. In his first season, he helped them to a fourth-placed finish and a place in the play-offs. After losing out to Swindon Town in the play-offs, Hamilton stayed at Wigan for two more seasons, missing just one league game for the Latics in the 1987–88 campaign. He played over 100 competitive appearances for Wigan before leaving to join Chester City in August 1989.|$|E

25|$|Prešeren <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> {{years of}} his life {{occupied}} with private life and his new job as a lawyer in Kranj. According to some accounts, he was planning several literary projects, including a novel in the realistic style and an experimental play, but he was struck with liver disease caused by his excessive drinking in prior years. The revolution of 1848 left him rather indifferent, although it was carried out by the young generation who already saw him as an idol of democratic and national ideals. Before his death, he did however redact his Zdravljica, which was left out from the 1847 volume of poems, and made some minor adjustments for a new edition of his collected poems.|$|E
25|$|Eggen had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> season {{managing}} Moss, {{where he}} first {{had won the}} Second Division and then the First Division.

Eggen was signed as coach, while Dokken took over as director of the new company. Two Bodø/Glimt players were signed, wing Mini Jakobsen and midfielder Ørjan Berg. The season saw Rosenborg claim the double, after beating Brann in two matches. It also saw Eldar Hansen return as president, after his period as NFF president was finished.|$|E

Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived.

40|$|The most {{important}} aspects of nuclear medicine imaging systems such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are the spatial resolution and the sensitivity (detector efficiency {{in combination with the}} geometric efficiency). Considerable efforts have been <b>spent</b> during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> decades in improving the resolution and the efficiency by developing new detectors. Our proposed improvement technique is focused on the readout and electronics. Instead of using traditional pulse height analysis techniques we propose using free running digital sampling by replacing the analog readout and acquisition electronics with fully digital programmable systems. This thesis describes a fully digital data acquisition system for KS/SU SPECT, new algorithms for high resolution timing for PET, and modular FPGA based decentralized data acquisition system with optimal timing and energy. The necessary signal processing algorithms for energy assessment and high resolution timing are developed and evaluated. The implementation of the algorithms in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSP) is also covered. Finally, modular decentralized digital data acquisition systems based on FPGAs and Ethernet are described...|$|R
40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is the main}} driver of total costs in the lifecycle of long-living software systems. Code clones, that is, the replication of code fragments across the system, decrease maintainability: It increases the code size and hinders manual code change, inspection, and analysis. Intensive research has been <b>spent</b> in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> decades to determine the nature of clones, specifically why and where they occur as well as whether they impair the maintenance of software systems. While recent studies expressed doubt on the general harmfulness of clones, it is commonly accepted that the awareness of existing code clones in software system is indispensable in any case. Recently, software product line engineering gained momentum since it provides a sys-tematic approach for reuse amongst a set of similar programs, {{commonly referred to as}} software product lines (SPL). An SPL allows the programmer to manage a set of pro-grams by describing variabilities and commonalities between them in terms of features. In this context, a feature is an increment in end-user visible functionality. As a result, a particular program can be derived by selecting the desired features and subsequentl...|$|R
