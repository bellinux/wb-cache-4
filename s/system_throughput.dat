Gans, Foschini and Emre Telatar {{have shown}} that the channel {{capacity}} (a theoretical upper bound on <b>system</b> <b>throughput)</b> for a MIMO system is increased as the number of antennas is increased, proportional to the smaller of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receive antennas. This is known as the multiplexing gain and this basic finding in information theory is what led to a spurt of research in this area. Despite the simple propagation models used in the aforementioned seminal works, the multiplexing gain is a fundamental property that can be proved under almost any physical channel propagation model and with practical hardware that is prone to transceiver impairments.|$|E

The old signals break down more easily, since some signals have outlasted their 50-year service life by up to 30 years, and signal problems accounted for 13% of all subway delays in 2016. Additionally, some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and cannot operate extra trains with the current Automatic Block Signaling system. Changes in assumptions about train performance, and changes in operational rules also had notable impact on <b>system</b> <b>throughput,</b> such as the prohibition of movement of trains past permissive signals at restricted speed (No Key-By without permission from Control Center.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughput is a {{variable}} which quantifies {{the number of}} parts produced in the unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional difficulty due {{to the presence of}} queues which can come from: machine breakdowns, processing time variability, scraps, setups, maintenance time, lack of orders, lack of materials, strikes, bad coordination between resources, mix variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending {{on the nature of the}} production system. One important example of how <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> is tied to system design are bottlenecks: in job shops bottlenecks are typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes sense to speak of [...] "the bottleneck" [...] since it can be univocally associated with a specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define capacity measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given production system, and capacity utilization.|$|E

Odownstream {{represents}} the <b>system</b> downlink <b>throughput</b> before each resource coordination, while O_downstream^' represents the <b>system</b> downlink <b>throughput</b> after each resource coordination.

40|$|Since mobile traffic {{has been}} growing recently, the {{deployment}} of indoor small cells has become an attractive solution to enhance coverage. However, the increasing density of cells makes inter-cell interference more considerable. In this paper, we propose a max-throughput Interference Avoidance (MTIA) centralized algorithm to improve the <b>system’s</b> <b>throughput.</b> Based on signaling and reports, a central controller connected to each base station can properly turn off base stations that may induce a relatively strong interference, and thus increase SINR. We implemented the MTIA algorithm in an LTE TDD network simulation and showed that MTIA effectively reduces inter-cell interference and improves the <b>system’s</b> <b>throughput...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{wireless}} networks or cellular systems, {{the system}} spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit, bit/s/Hz/site or bit/s/Hz/cell, is the maximum <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> (aggregate throughput) {{divided by the}} analog bandwidth and some measure of the system coverage area.|$|E
30|$|Our {{objective}} is to define an optimal energy management policy for the centralized dynamic power control problem for energy harvesting WMSN. Thus, at each time slot, the transmission powers of all the sensors are fixed by the base station to maximize the expected <b>system's</b> <b>throughput</b> under minimum energy consumption.|$|R
3000|$|The {{maximization}} of the WPSN <b>system</b> attainable <b>throughput</b> {{is described}} in this segment. To achieve this, a sum-throughput optimization strategy is employed. Based on the optimization technique, the timing schedules for the harvesting of energy and transmission of information by sensor nodes a and b were optimized in joint fashion. With this, an improved fairness in the allocation of harvesting timing, as well as fairness in the rates of the sensor nodes information transmission, is achieved. Consequently, an enhanced <b>system</b> overall <b>throughput</b> rate is achieved with minimal energy consumption. The general representation of the <b>system</b> attainable <b>throughput</b> is formulated as a maximization problem in (P 1). From (1), we have: [...]...|$|R
30|$|In {{the service}} {{disruption}} experiment, we measured {{the impact that}} a reconfiguration causes on the <b>system’s</b> <b>throughput</b> and latency, i.e., the time interval between the tuple being sent by the source node until it is received by the sink node. In order to measure the service disruption, we assess the throughput and the latency with 300 CNs and a tuple production rate of 15, 000 tuples/s. We performed two reconfigurations, at moments T 1 and T 2, and at each of them, we compared the <b>throughput</b> of the <b>system</b> with the <b>throughput</b> a second before these reconfigurations took place.|$|R
50|$|In {{communication}} networks, throughput {{is essentially}} synonymous to digital bandwidth consumption. In wireless networks or cellular communication networks, the system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit, bit/s/Hz/site or bit/s/Hz/cell, is the maximum <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> (aggregate throughput) {{divided by the}} analog bandwidth and some measure of the system coverage area.|$|E
50|$|Overhead {{information}} originated by {{the user}} is {{not considered to be}} system overhead information. Overhead information generated within the communications system and not delivered to the user is system overhead information. Thus, the user throughput is reduced by both overheads while <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> is reduced only by system overhead.|$|E
50|$|A {{multicore}} CPU {{architecture is}} commonly used to implement high-performance networking systems. These platforms facilitate {{the use of a}} software architecture in which the high-performance packet processing is performed within a fast path environment on dedicated cores, in order to maximize <b>system</b> <b>throughput.</b> A run-to-completion model minimizes OS overhead and latency.|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to note that this situation is very different from non-reactive stream processing, where the system is not subject to such stringent timing constraints. The challenge in dynamic power management for reactive stream processing is to save power at the right time, without violating the <b>system’s</b> <b>throughput</b> and latency constraints. This is a hard problem, because the future resource requirements can be unpredictable for many important applications.|$|R

In the proposed scheme, only two mini-slots are employed to create effective channels, while more channel candidates can be obtained via linearly combining the two effective channels obtained during the two mini-slots, thus increas-ing the multiuser diversity and the <b>system</b> <b>throughputs.</b> The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R

50|$|A {{multicore}} processor can provide additional performance improvement to a fast path implementation. In order {{to maximize the}} overall <b>system</b> <b>throughput,</b> multiple cores can be dedicated to running the fast path, while only one core is required to run the Operating System, the OS networking stack and the application’s control plane.|$|E
50|$|Arbitration {{enhancement}} ensures better <b>system</b> <b>throughput,</b> since {{control is}} passed more efficiently. Advanced interrupt handling {{refers to the}} use of level sensitive interrupts to handle system requests.

5000|$|Multiple-antenna: Multiple-antenna systems (such as MIMO) {{have been}} used to {{increase}} <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> and reception reliability. Since UWB has almost impulse-like channel response, a combination of multiple antenna techniques is preferable as well.

30|$|According to [4], the EXP/PF {{rule was}} {{implemented}} {{with the purpose}} of offering QoS promises over a shared wireless connection. The basic EXP was created to improve the real-time flow’s priority prior to the association of non-real-time flows [30, 31]. This is where the packet delay at the starting line is rather close to the thresholds delay [10]. EXP/PF not only guarantees a bounded delay but also maximizes the <b>systems</b> <b>throughput</b> at the same time ensuring proportional fairness between UEs [32].|$|R
30|$|We {{observe that}} all users' probabilities of not {{satisfying}} their short-term throughput constraints {{are very small}} (maximum value: 0.7 % average: 0.19 %) under DUA_UPRA, while under UPRA they are high and diverse (maximum value: 20.7 % average: 9.8 %). Furthermore, under DUA_UPRA real-time users' average achieved throughput remains very high compared to the one achieved under UPRA that exploits optimally <b>system's</b> <b>throughput</b> abilities without, however, providing short-term throughput constraints. Thus, all real-time users' average actual received throughput is almost the same under DUA_UPRA.|$|R

Rapid cycling provides several benefits, including, reduced time to result, increased <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> and improved reaction specificity.

50|$|Assigning {{different}} priorities {{to interrupt}} requests {{can be useful}} in trying to balance <b>system</b> <b>throughput</b> versus interrupt latency: some kinds of interrupts need to be responded to more quickly than others, but the amount of processing might not be large, so it makes sense to assign a higher priority to that kind of interrupt.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} {{that has become}} more popular recently is multithreading. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory, instead of stalling for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute.
