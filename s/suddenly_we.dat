500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) {{was founded}} in London in 1977 by Scottish vocalist Maggie Nicols from Centipede and English bassoonist/composer Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow. Nicols and Cooper first {{discussed}} {{the idea of an}} all-women improvising group at a musician's union meeting. Cooper said, [...] "we agreed that improvisation had become very important and no women were doing it. And <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> thought, well let's do it! Let's get women together and do it ourselves!" [...] While Nicols and Cooper had both performed frequently with men, they had little experience performing with other women, but their involvement in class politics as well as feminist and lesbian activism prompted them to pursue this project. The other members of the five-piece ensemble were cellist/bassist Georgie Born, also from Henry Cow, vocalist/pianist Cathy Williams from the British duo Rag Doll, and trumpeter Corinne Liensol from British feminist rock band Jam Today. They had originally intended to call themselves the [...] "Women's Improvising Group", but at their first engagement they discovered that the organisers had billed them as the [...] "Feminist Improvising Group". Nicols said that the [...] "political statement of the band's name never even came from us! But we just thought, 'OK, they've called us feminist, we'll work with that.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, Prime Minister Netanyahu {{said that}} {{returning}} the Golan Heights would {{turn it into}} [...] "Iran's front lines which will threaten the whole state of Israel." [...] He said: [...] "I remember the Golan Heights without Katzrin, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> see a thriving city in the Land of Israel, which having been a gem of the Second Temple era has been revived anew." [...] American diplomat Martin Indyk said that the 1999–2000 round of negotiations began during Netanyahu's first term (1996–1999), {{and he was not}} as hardline as he made out.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{will bring}} consistency. What I am passionate {{about is the}} {{international}} game being consistent. To me, {{it has always been}} illogical that we play as Great Britain for three or four years, and when the World Cup comes along, <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> become England. In the major competitions, which will be most years, we will play as England. That will also allow Scotland and Wales to develop. We have then floated the concept of Great Britain to tour in 2010. It would be a tour as opposed to playing a formal competition, and I wouldn't restrict that to just Australia and New Zealand." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 August 1999 Apollo {{accepted}} a takeover {{offer from the}} American entertainment corporation SFX for £158million, because: [...] "We were running a family business and <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> realised there were 5,000 people in the family." [...] Gregg and his family owned 80% of the company, and received between them £126million worth of shares and loan stock in SFX. SFX also agreed to acquire The Barry Clayman Corporation, 50% owned by the shareholders of Apollo, which promotes concert and entertainment events, and whose European tour artists include: Riverdance, Michael Jackson, Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones.|$|E

When it was offered that we do a show about our lives, my husband and I were like, [...] "Wow, nothing like this has even been on the air." [...] Nothing had depicted dwarfism in an everyday way.

2500|$|But {{perhaps more}} startling, and disturbing, was the {{tendency}} for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance, sometimes going as far as cannibalism. She says of this revelation, [...] "During the first ten years of the study I had believed [...] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [...] Then <b>suddenly</b> <b>we</b> found that chimpanzees could be brutal—that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature." [...] She described the 1974–1978 Gombe Chimpanzee War in her memoir, Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour, and were {{further evidence of the}} social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.|$|E
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} a reverie which I did not disturb, {{and it was}} not until another day that I learned of the other memory that he cherished. He reverted to it <b>suddenly</b> as <b>we</b> sat again in the hop-vine arbour, looking at the glimmering {{radiance}} of the September sea.|$|R

2500|$|After calling at Madras on 13 February, she {{departed}} for Suez; her captain, Captain Kirton, had {{been instructed to}} land at Trincomalee with about £5,000 of Government treasure. Mrs. Inglis had kept a diary of the events during the siege of Lucknow to which she added her account of the wreck:We made good progress all that day (Tuesday). It was eight o'clock, a beautiful night, and we were running along at a great pace. Finding it very hot in the saloon after tea, [...] had come on deck, and {{were sitting on the}} bulwarks behind the wheel. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>we</b> were startled by a loud grating sound something like the letting down of an anchor, and just then saw a large rock close to us. I said, 'We must have touched that.' Several men rushed to the wheel, and then again we heard the same sound, only louder, and a quivering of the whole ship. She then remained stationary, only heaving backwards and forwards.|$|E
2500|$|ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, [...] "hey began {{demolishing}} one house. We {{gathered around}} {{and called out}} to them {{and went into the}} house, so they backed out. During the entire time they knew who we were and what we were doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>we</b> saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel {{standing in the way of}} the front bulldozer." [...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, [...] "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians." [...] The United Nations said that 582 Rafah homes were demolished and 721 damaged, with 5,305 people made homeless.|$|E
2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>we</b> could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
