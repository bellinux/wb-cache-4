5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation <b>Store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of {{the show}} are also {{available}} online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes <b>Store</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 8. In 2007, NBCUniversal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes. In {{a statement to the}} press, Apple claimed that NBCUniversal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99. In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99. Recent episodes are available in streaming video on Fox's official House webpage and all 8 seasons are now on Netflix DVD.|$|E

5|$|In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets {{and son of}} {{the late}} Sir William Jenner, {{physician}} to Queen Victoria, bought Lytes Cary. At that time the Great Hall was {{being used as a}} cider <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great Parlour was full of farm equipment. Jenner's brother Leopold had just bought and started to restore Avebury Manor in Wiltshire, and Jenner was inspired by his brother's work there. He set about restoring Lytes Cary and decorating the interiors in period style, including fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles. He had the west range rebuilt in a plain William and Mary style by the architect C.E. Ponting, but left the historic core of the house mostly untouched. It incorporates carvings believed to be from the demolished St Benet Gracechurch.|$|E

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon Marché department <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet <b>Store,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E
