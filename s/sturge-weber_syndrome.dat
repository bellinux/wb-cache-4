40|$|International audienceCommon birthmarks {{can be an}} {{indicator}} of underlying genetic disease but are often overlooked. Mongolian blue spots (dermal melanocytosis) are usually localized and transient, {{but they can be}} extensive, permanent, and associated with extracutaneous abnormalities. Co-occurrence with vascular birthmarks defines a subtype of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis, a group of syndromes associated with neurovascular, ophthalmological, overgrowth, and malignant complications. Here, we discover that extensive dermal melanocytosis and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis are associated with activating mutations in GNA 11 and GNAQ, genes that encode Ga subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The mutations were detected at very low levels in affected tissues but were undetectable in the blood, indicating that these conditions are postzygotic mosaic disorders. In vitro expression of mutant GNA 11 (R 183 C) and GNA 11 (Q 209 L) in human cell lines demonstrated activation of the downstream p 38 MAPK signaling pathway and the p 38, JNK, and ERK pathways, respectively. Transgenic mosaic zebrafish models expressing mutant GNA 11 (R 183 C) under promoter mitfa developed extensive dermal melanocytosis recapitulating the human phenotype. Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis and extensive dermal melanocytosis are therefore diagnoses in the group of mosaic heterotrimeric G-protein disorders, joining McCune-Albright and <b>Sturge-Weber</b> <b>syndromes.</b> These findings will allow accurate clinical and molecular diagnosis of this subset of common birthmarks, thereby identifying infants at risk for serious complications, and provide novel therapeutic opportunities...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} filtering procedures supplemented with mitomycin C in children with glaucoma.  METHODS—All patients aged 17  or younger with glaucoma who underwent filtering surgery supplemented with mitomycin C at a tertiary care centre (n= 21) during a 5  year interval (1992  and 1996) were included. One eye for each patient was entered into the analysis. The postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), use of antiglaucoma medications, clinical stability of glaucoma, complications, and visual acuity were retrospectively evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate the probability of success.  RESULTS—At the time of surgery mean age was 5. 7  (SD 5. 0) years. The most common diagnoses were trabeculodysgenesis (n= 6) and aphakic glaucoma (n= 8). Mean IOP before surgery was 35. 7  (10. 5) mm Hg. Average length of follow up was 18. 6  (14. 7) months. The probability of having IOP less than 21  mm Hg with no antiglaucoma medications and with clinically stable glaucoma 1  year after surgery was 76. 9 % in phakic eyes (n= 13) and 0 % in aphakic eyes (n= 8). A phakic patient with <b>Sturge-Weber's</b> <b>syndrome</b> had choroidal effusion after surgery that resolved spontaneously. In the aphakic group one patient had retinal detachment and another developed an encapsulated bleb. Visual acuity deteriorated in one patient.  CONCLUSION—A guarded filtration procedure with mitomycin C is relatively successful in phakic children with glaucoma, but unsuccessful in aphakic ones.    Keywords: mitomycin C; filtration procedure; children; glaucom...|$|R

40|$|The B. N. S. shows certain {{similarities}} to other systemic diseases. these diseases are {{often referred to as}} "familial degenerative diseases" ln chapter 8 the common characteristic of theses syndromes are reviewed. The B. N. S. is often characterized by the presence of hamartomas and the tendency toward the growth of tumours in various organs. Thus the syndrome may be ranged with Neurofibromatosis, M. Pringle-Bourneville, M. von Hippel-Lindau, M. <b>Sturge-Weber,</b> Peutz-Jeghesr <b>syndrome,</b> Gardner's syndrome,etc. Eventually Van Der Hoeve (1938), Musger (1964) and Nicholls(1970) classified these lesions under the name of phacomatosis. Although patients have been described who have had additional symptoms of other syndromes (Neurofibromatosis, Turner's syndrome, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Marfan's syndrome) the basocellular naevus syndrome must be considered a distinct clinical entity. Though there is some similarity to other syndromes, transitional stages cannot be referred to between the different syndromes. When the symptomso f the B. N. S. are known, the actual diagnosis is not difficult. The characteristic symptoms are: multiple basocellular naevi/carcinomas, Mantoux's porokeratosis, multiple epithelial cysts of the skin, multiple primordial jaw-cysts, skeletal anomalies (sella turcica, shape and size of the skull, etc.) and ectopic calcifications. Additional occurrence of eye-lesions and neurological disturbances as well as familial incidence, may be useful for making a correct diagnosis. The expressivity of the responsible gene, however, is so variable(tables 7. 1, 7. 2) and age-dependent that it is possible that no cutaneous o jaw lesions are present. In these cases especially, skeletal anomalies contribute to a correct diagnosis. That is because they are not age-dependent. Recognition of the syndrome in an early stage is important for early treatment of basocellular carcinomas and primordial jaw-cysts. In this way the prognosis may be improved and extensive mutilations of tissue are prevented. Frequent and life-long control is necessary in order to recognize and treat new tumour formations as early as possible. ...|$|R

Great neurologists of the time worked at The National, including John Hughlings Jackson, David Ferrier, MacDonald Critchley, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, William Allen Sturge (discoverer of the <b>Sturge-Weber</b> <b>syndrome),</b> Sir Roger Bannister and many others.|$|E
50|$|Latanoprost (Xalatan), a prostaglandin, may {{significantly}} reduce IOP (intraocular pressure) {{in patients with}} glaucoma associated with <b>Sturge-Weber</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Latanoprost is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of race, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects. Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, vitreous loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of anterior uveitis, and diabetes mellitus. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable.|$|E
50|$|Port-wine stains, {{also known}} as nevus flammeus and {{sometimes}} mistaken for strawberry marks, are present at birth and range from a pale pink in color, to a deep wine-red. Irregular in appearance, they are usually quite large, and caused by a deficiency or absence in the nerve supply to blood vessels. This causes vasodilation, the dilation of blood vessels, causing blood to pool or collect in the affected area. Over time, port-wine stains may become thick or develop small ridges or bumps, and do not fade with age. Such birthmarks may have emotional or social repercussions. Port-wine stains occur in 0.3% of the population, equally among males and females. They frequently express unilaterally, i.e., on only one side, not crossing the midline of the body. Often on the face, marks on the upper eyelid or forehead may be indicative of a condition called <b>Sturge-Weber</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Additionally, port-wine stains in these locations {{may be associated with}} glaucoma and seizures.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment for <b>Sturge-Weber</b> <b>syndrome</b> is symptomatic. Laser {{treatment}} {{may be used}} to lighten or remove the birthmark. Anticonvulsant medications {{may be used to}} control seizures. Doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma, and surgery may be performed on more serious cases. When one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective, the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain (hemispherectomy). Physical therapy should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. Educational therapy is often prescribed for those with mental retardation or developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays.Brain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than pre-surgery. Surgeons may also opt to [...] "switch-off" [...] the affected side of the brain.|$|E
