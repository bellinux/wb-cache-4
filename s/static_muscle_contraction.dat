40|$|<b>Static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> {{activates}} metabolically sensitive muscle afferents that reflexively increase {{sympathetic nerve}} activity and arterial pressure. To determine if this contraction-induced reflex is modulated by the sinoaortic baroreflex, we performed microelectrode recordings of sympathetic nerve activity to resting leg muscle during static handgrip in humans {{while attempting to}} clamp the level of baroreflex stimulation by controlling the exercise-induced rise in blood pressure with pharmacologic agents. The principal new finding is that partial pharmacologic suppression of the rise in blood pressure during static handgrip (nitroprusside infusion) augmented the exercise-induced increases in heart rate and sympathetic activity by greater than 300 %. Pharmacologic accentuation of the exercise-induced rise in blood pressure (phenylephrine infusion) attenuated these reflex increases by greater than 50 %. In contrast, these pharmacologic manipulations in arterial pressure {{had little or no}} effect on: (a) forearm muscle cell pH, an index of the metabolic stimulus to skeletal muscle afferents; or (b) central venous pressure, an index of the mechanical stimulus to cardiopulmonary afferents. We conclude that in humans the sinoaortic baroreflex is much more effective than previously thought in buffering the reflex sympathetic activation caused by <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletal}} muscle exercise pressor reflex (EPR) induces increases in heart rate (HR) and {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) during physical activity. This reflex is activated during contraction by stimulation of afferent fibres responsive to mechanical distortion and/or the metabolic by-products of {{skeletal muscle}} work. The molecular mechanisms responsible for activating these afferent neurons {{have yet to be}} identified. It has been reported that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPv 1) receptor within skeletal muscle (localized to unmyelinated afferent fibres) elicits increases in MAP and HR similar to those generated by the EPR. Thus, we hypothesized that stimulation of the TRPv 1 receptor during muscle contraction contributes to the activation of the EPR. The EPR was activated by electrically induced <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> of the hindlimb in decerebrate Sprague–Dawley rats (n= 61) before and after the administration of the TRPv 1 receptor antagonists, capsazepine (Capz; 100 μg/ 100 μl), iodoresinaferatoxin (IRTX; 1 μg/ 100 μl), or Ruthenium Red (RR; 100 μg/ 100 μl). <b>Static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> alone induced increases in both HR (8 ± 2 bpm) and MAP (21 ± 3 mmHg). The HR and MAP responses to contraction were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) after the administration of Capz (2 ± 1 bpm; 7 ± 1 mmHg, respectively), IRTX (3 ± 2 bpm; 5 ± 3 mmHg, respectively) and RR (0 ± 1, bpm; 5 ± 2 mmHg, respectively).

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} analyze surface {{electromyography}} (EMG) signals, {{it is necessary}} to use techniques based on time (temporal) domain or frequency (spectral) domain. However, these techniques are based on the mathematical assumption of signal stationarity. On the other hand, EMG signal stationarity varies depending on analysis window size and contraction types. So in this paper, a suitable window size for an analysis of EMG during static and dynamic contractions was investigated using a stationarity test, the modified reverse arrangement test. More than 90 % of the signals measured during static contraction can be considered as stationary signals for all window sizes. On average, a window size of 375 ms provides the most stationary information, 94. 29 % of EMG signals for <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction.</b> For dynamic muscle contraction, the percentage of stationary signals decreased as the window size was increased. If the threshold of 80 % stationarity was set to validate stationarity for each window size, a suitable window size should be 250 ms or lesser.

40|$|In this report, we {{examined}} if the synchronization of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) with <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> {{is enhanced by}} limb congestion. To explore this relationship, we applied signal-averaging techniques to the MSNA signal obtained during short bouts of forearm contraction (2 -s contraction/ 3 -s rest cycle) at 40 % maximal voluntary contraction for 5 min. We performed this analysis before and after forearm venous congestion; an intervention that augments the autonomic response to sustained <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> via a local effect on muscle afferents. There was an increased percentage of the MSNA noted during second 2 of the 5 -s contraction/rest cycles. The percentage of total MSNA seen during this particular second increased from minute 1 to 5 of contraction and was increased further by limb congestion (control minute 1 = 25. 6 +/- 2. 0 %, minute 5 = 32. 8 +/- 2. 2 %; limb congestion minute 1 = 29. 3 +/- 2. 1 %, minute 5 = 37. 8 +/- 3. 9 %; exercise main effect < 0. 005; limb congestion main effect P = 0. 054). These changes {{in the distribution of}} signal-averaged MSNA were seen {{despite the fact that the}} mean number of sympathetic discharges did not increase over baseline.

40|$|In human {{subjects}} {{the length of}} the first complete cardiac cycle after the onset of static finger or hand <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> was recorded. Graded contractions as well as maximal <b>contractions</b> in which <b>muscle</b> fatigue was provoked by ischaemia were studied. Maximal finger <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> were also weakened by partial neuromuscular blockade with either decamethonium or tubocurarine. The change in R-R interval at the onset of exercise was variable and in part dependent on {{the length of the}} last R-R interval before the onset of exercise. The largest decreases were seen when the preceding R-R interval was long. During graded submaximal and maximal contractions a correlation was demonstrated between the change of the R-R interval at the onset of exercise and the contraction intensity. At the onset of the weakest contractions a 3 % prolongation of the R-R interval was seen while the strongest contractions were associated with a shortening of 8 %. At the onset of all maximal contractions, whether fatigued due to ischaemia or weakened by decamethonium or tubocurarine, a decrease in R-R interval was seen independent of the force developed. When compared at the same resting R-R interval, contractions performed with hand muscles elicited a greater shortening of R-R interval than <b>contractions</b> with finger <b>muscles.</b> The results suggest that the initial change in heart rate at the onset of <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> is related to the voluntary effort rather than to the force developed, the state of the working muscles or to the type of muscle fibres involved.

40|$|Both {{static and}} dynamic {{exercise}} {{are known to}} increase cardiac pump function as well as arterial blood pressure.

It remains unknown as to how each mechanism activates cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA) during exercise, especially at its onset. Thus we examined the response of CSNA to stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR, i. e., central command) and to <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> of the triceps surae muscles or stretch of the calcaneal tendon in decerebrate cats. We found that MLR stimulation immediately increased CSNA, which was followed by a gradual increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and ventral root activity in a stimulus intensity-dependent manner. The latency of the increase in CSNA from the onset of MLR stimulation ranged from 67 to 387 ms. Both static contraction and tendon stretch also rapidly increased CSNA. Their latency from the development of tension in response to ventral root stimulation ranged from 78 to 670 ms. These findings suggest that both central command and the muscle mechanoreflex play a role in controlling cardiac sympathetic outflow at the onset of exercise...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine if contraction-induced increase in Tm was altered in rats with heart failure (HF) induced by chronic myocardial infraction (MI) as compared with healthy control animals. A temperature probe was inserted in the triceps surae muscle to continuously measure Tm throughout experiments. <b>Static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> was induced by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve for 1 min. As baseline Tm was 34 &# 176;C, contraction increased temperature by 1. 6 &# 177; 0. 18 &# 176;C in nine health control rats and by 1. 0 &# 177; 0. 15 &# 176;C in ten MI rats (P< 0. 05 vs. control).

In addition, muscle contraction increased mean arterial pressure by 23 &# 177; 3 mmHg in control rats and by 31 &# 177; 3 mmHg in MI rats (P< 0. 05 vs. control). A regression analysis further shows that there is an inverse liner relationship between the pressor response and static contraction-induced increase in Tm. Our data suggest that Tm increase evoked by contraction is impaired in MI rats. The abnormal alteration in Tm likely modifies the reflex cardiovascular responses in MI via mechanisms of temperature sensitive receptors on muscle afferent nerves...|$|E

Previous studies showed that P 2 X receptors located at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord {{play a role in}} modulating the muscle pressor reflex. P 2 X stimulation can alter release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate (Glu). In this report, we tested the hypothesis that stimulation of P 2 X receptors enhances the concentrations of Glu ([Glu]) in the dorsal horn, and that blocking P 2 X receptors attenuates contraction-induced Glu increases and the resultant reflex pressor response. Contraction was elicited by electrical stimulation of the L 7 and S 1 ventral roots of 14 cats. Glu samples were collected from microdialysis probes inserted in the L 7 level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and dialysate [Glu] was determined using the HPLC method. First, microdialyzing α,β-methylene ATP (0. 4 mM) into the dorsal horn significantly increased [Glu]. In addition, contraction elevated [Glu] from baseline of 536 ± 53 to 1, 179 ± 192 nM (P 0. 05) and pressor response (16 ± 3 mmHg, P < 0. 05 vs. control).

40|$|McArdle disease (glycogenosis type V), {{the most}} common muscle glycogenosis, is a {{recessive}} disorder caused by mutations in PYGM, the gene encoding myophosphorylase. Patients with McArdle disease typically experience exercise intolerance manifested as acute crises of early fatigue and contractures, sometimes with rhabdomyolysis and myoblobinuria, triggered by <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> or dynamic exercises. Currently, there are no therapies to restore myophosphorylase activity in patients. Although two spontaneous animal models for McArdle disease have been identified (cattle and sheep), they have rendered {{a limited amount of}} information on the pathophysiology of the disorder; therefore, there have been few opportunities for experimental research in the field. We have developed a knock-in mouse model by replacing the wild-type allele of Pygm with a modified allele carrying the common human mutation, p. R 50 X, which is the most frequent cause of McArdle disease. Histochemical, biochemical and molecular analyses of the phenotype, as well as exercise tests, were carried out in homozygotes, carriers and wild-type mice. p. R 50 X/p. R 50 X mice showed undetectable myophosphorylase protein and activity in skeletal muscle. Histochemical and biochemical analyses revealed massive muscle glycogen accumulation in homozygotes, in contrast to heterozygotes or wild-type mice, which did not show glycogen accumulation in this tissue. Additional characterization confirmed a McArdle disease-like phenotype in p. R 50 X/p. R 50 X mice, i. e. they had hyperCKaemia and very poor exercise performance, as assessed in the wire grip and treadmill tests (6 % and 5 % of the wild-type values, respectively).

40|$|Recording {{motor unit}} (MU) action {{potentials}} during fast <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions,</b> specifically during movement, presents unique challenges that constrain {{the investigation of}} the upper limits of human MU performance. The anconeus muscle exhibits many advantageous characteristics that suggest it is an appealing model for the study of MU behaviour in challenging experiment paradigms. Thus, the purpose was to determine the MU recruitment and discharge properties associated with the generation of movement up to maximal angular velocities of elbow extension and to determine the effect of submaximal fatiguing movements on these MU properties. Due to the synergistic nature of the anconeus in the elbow extensor muscle group, a secondary purpose was to determine whether MUs of the muscles comprising the elbow extensor group behave differently during the production of high forces. Discharge rates and recruitment thresholds were tracked in 24 and 17 MUs, respectively. It was revealed that anconeus MUs increase discharge rates over two distinct linear ranges possessing different input-output gain relationships relative to elbow extension velocity. Anconeus MUs exhibited variable responses to increased resultant velocity when recruitment thresholds were considered. These variable responses, that were more common in higher threshold MUs, indicated that a compression of the MU recruitment range of the anconeus occurred as elbow extension velocity increased. Using the same recording techniques, fatigue-related changes in discharge rates and recruitment thresholds of 12 MUs were determined throughout a protocol comprised of fast, maximal, <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions,</b> and submaximal and periodic maximal movements. Results of this study demonstrated that MU properties are graded differently in response to submaximal fatiguing movements depending on the intensity of the movement, but that contraction type did not affect the relative changes in these MU properties. Lastly, MUs in three elbow extensors including the anconeus were tracked during constant joint angle force production to near maximal intensities. Differences between the elbow extensors were observed for MU discharge rates and recruitment thresholds with increasing force. These findings support an integrated model of earlier established MU control strategies for the elbow extensors and show anconeus MU recruitment occurs over a greater range than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{the development of}} chronic muscle pain in humans remain unknown. Our current understanding is principally based on experimentation in animals, which {{has resulted in the}} formulation of a multitude of theories and physiological models to postulate these mechanisms in humans. The vicious cycle theory – a popularised but unsupported theory in humans – suggests that muscle metabolites produced by <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> stimulate group III and IV muscle nociceptors leading to an excitation of gamma-motoneurones through a reflex mechanism. Increased gamma-motor drive causes intrafusal fibres to contract increasing muscle spindle afferent firing. This activity in turn will raise the likelihood of activation in the pool of alpha-motorneurones projecting to the primary muscle increasing resting muscle tonus. Muscle spindle afferents and postganglionic sympathetic outflow to skin and muscle were recorded from healthy subjects using the technique of microneurography. Cardiorespiratory function (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration) was measured non-invasively. Muscle pain was induced using a solution of hypertonic saline tonically infused via indwelling cannulae delivered by an infusion pump. The rate of infusion was controlled to ensure subjects experienced mild to moderate pain. Muscle spindle afferents fail to show any change in spontaneous discharge rate in response to tonic muscle pain contradicting the observations and conclusions from animal studies. Sympathetic outflow to skin demonstrated a transient increase followed by a sustained decrease during infusion of hypertonic saline. Sympathetic outflow to muscle demonstrated a dichotomy of responses during muscle pain: half of the subjects showing increasing sympathetic activity, blood pressure, and heart rate; whilst the others showed decreasing sympathetic activity, blood pressure, and heart rate. Consistent responses were seen in the same individuals when the study was reproduced in a second recording. This investigation advances our understanding of the physiological consequences tonic pain has on sympathetic outflow and muscle spindle afferents in the context of developing chronic muscle pain. After undertaking experimentation in awake human subjects there is no apparent evidence to suggest that tonic pain increases the discharge rate of spontaneously active muscle spindle afferents to result in increased muscle tone as proposed by the “vicious cycle” theory. There is, however, evidence of sustained changes in sympathetic outflow to muscle and skin in response to tonic pain that may {{contribute to the development of}} chronic pain...|$|R

Moreover, metabolically sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA 1) {{has been reported}} to contribute to sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and arterial blood pressure (BP) responses evoked by <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction.</b> Thus, in the present study, we examined the mechanisms by which afferent nerves’ TRPA 1 plays a role in regulating amplified sympathetic responsiveness due to a restriction of blood flow directed to the hindlimb muscles. Our data show that 24 - 72 hrs of femoral artery occlusion 1) upregulates the protein levels of TRPA 1 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues; 2) selectively increases expression of TRPA 1 in DRG neurons supplying metabolically sensitive afferent nerves of C-fiber (group IV); and 3) enhances renal SNA and BP {{responses to}} AITC (a TRPA 1 agonist) injected into the arterial blood supply of the hindlimb muscles. In addition, our data demonstrate that blocking TRPA 1 attenuates SNA and BP responses during muscle contraction to a greater degree in ligated rats than those responses in control rats. In contrast, blocking TRPA 1 fails to attenuate SNA and BP responses during passive tendon stretch in both groups. Overall, results {{of this study indicate that}} alternations in muscle afferent nerves’TRPA 1 likely contribute to enhanced sympathetically mediated autonomic responses via the metabolic component of the muscle reflex under circumstances of chronic muscle ischemia...|$|E
40|$|In hypertension, {{exercise}} elicits excessive elevations in mean {{arterial pressure}} (MAP) and heart rate (HR) increasing the risk for adverse cardiac events and stroke during physical activity. The exercise pressor reflex (a neural drive originating in skeletal muscle), central command (a neural drive originating in cortical brain centres) and the tonically active arterial baroreflex contribute importantly to cardiovascular control during exercise. Each of these inputs potentially mediates the heightened cardiovascular response to physical activity in hypertension. However, given that exercise pressor reflex overactivity is known to elicit enhanced circulatory responses to exercise in disease states closely related to hypertension (e. g. heart failure), we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} exaggerated cardiovascular response to exercise in hypertension is mediated by an overactive exercise pressor reflex. To test this hypothesis, we used a rat model of exercise recently developed in our laboratory that selectively stimulates the exercise pressor reflex independent of central command and/or the arterial baroreflex. Activation of the exercise pressor reflex during electrically induced <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> in the absence of input from central command resulted in significantly larger increases in MAP and HR in male spontaneously hypertensive rats as compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats over a wide range of exercise intensities. Similar findings were obtained in animals in which input from both central command and the arterial baroreflex were eliminated. These findings suggest that the enhanced cardiovascular response to exercise in hypertension is mediated by an overactive exercise pressor reflex. Potentially, effective treatment of exercise pressor reflex dysfunction may reduce the cardiovascular risks associated with exercise in hypertension...|$|E
40|$|AbstractParameters {{derived from}} EMG power {{spectrum}} are beneficial methods for assessing muscle fatigue. Two important indices are median frequency and mean frequency (MDF and MNF). They {{have been established}} as the global muscle fatigue indices, particularly in <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> of biceps brachii muscle. However, a major problem of these parameters is a nonlinear relationship between muscle load/force and feature value, particularly in cyclic dynamic muscle contraction of forearm muscles. In this study, EMG feature indices that can simultaneously identify both fatigue and load are proposed. Instead of using an entire EMG signal fast Fourier transformation (FFT), a concept of using consecutive FFT has been proposed as known as the “Time-Dependent MDF and MNF” (TD-MDF and TDMNF). The success of TD-MDF and TD-MNF features used to determine muscle fatigue have been presented {{in a lot of}} research works, whereas the performance of TD-MDF and TD-MNF used to determine muscle load have been proposed in a few research works. Moreover, it has not previously been evaluated with the forearm muscles. Thus it has been investigated in this study. Four forearm muscles are evaluated including flexor pollicis longus, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longus and pronator radii teres. The results showed that the proposed methods have a linear relationship with muscle load in some selected range of TD-MNF for flexor pollicis longus muscle that were not found for traditional MDF and MNF. Moreover, a statistically significant difference between TD-MNF values for different loading conditions (p < 0. 2) was observed.

Methods We used longitudinal and radial spatiotemporal mapping to examine and compare pendular and segmental contractile activity in the proximal duodenum of the rat and guinea pig when the lumen was perfused with saline or micellar decanoic acid. Key Results Isolated phasic longitudinal contractions occurred along the rat duodenum with a frequency of 36 +/- 2 cpm and strain rate amplitude of 26. 8 +/- 8. 0 % s- 1. These contractions occurred at fixed locations along the duodenum forming columns on the longitudinal strain rate map. The strain rate activity had local maxima at 46 points spaced at 7. 7 +/- 4. 0 mm intervals along the duodenum and were uncoordinated between neighboring domains. Similarly disposed, less distinct, longitudinal contractions occurred in the guinea pig duodenum at a frequency of 25. 2 +/- 6. 6 cpm with amplitude 6. 8 +/- 3. 6 % s- 1 but these were generally accompanied by numerous circular contractions that were distributed over 45 fixed locations and occurred with a frequency of 9 +/- 3 cpm. Isolated <b>static</b> circular <b>muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> also occurred but at a lower rate in the rat than the guinea pig. Both types of contractions propagated after dosage with tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, atropine, or apamin.

Sensory feedback processing may contribute to these differences. The purpose of the current {{study was to determine the}} influence of load types during <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> tasks on the gating effect, i. e., attenuation of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and the cortical silent period (cSP). Ten healthy subjects contracted their right first dorsal interosseus muscle by abducting their index finger for 90 s, to produce a constant force against a rigid restraint that was 20 % of the maximum voluntary contraction (force task), or to maintain a constant position with 10 ° abduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint against the same load (position task). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from C 3 ' by stimulating either the right ulnar or median nerve at the wrist while maintaining contraction. The cortical silent period (cSP) was also elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Reduction of the amplitude of the P 45 component of SEPs was significantly larger during the position task than during the force task and under control rest conditions when the ulnar nerve, but not the median nerve, was stimulated. The position task had a significantly shorter cSP duration than the force task. These results suggest the need for more proprioceptive information during the position task than the force task. The shorter duration of the cSP during the position task may be attributable to larger amplitude of heteronymous short latency reflexes. Sensorimotor modulations may differ with load type during constant finger force or position tasks...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{investigation}} {{was to determine if}} the near infrared spectroscopy technique was sensitive to changes in tissue oxygenation at low levels of isometric contraction in the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. Nine subjects were seated with the right arm abducted to 45 degrees, elbow flexed to 85 degrees, forearm pronated 45 degrees, and wrist and forearm supported on an armrest throughout the protocol. Altered tissue oxygenation was measured noninvasively with near infrared spectroscopy. The near infrared spectroscopy probe was placed over the extensor carpi radialis brevis of the subject's right forearm and secured with an elastic wrap. After 1 minute of baseline measurements taken with the muscle relaxed, four different loads were applied just proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint such that the subjects isometrically contracted the extensor carpi radialis brevis at 5, 10, 15, and 50 % of the maximum voluntary contraction for 1 minute each. A 3 -minute recovery period followed each level of contraction. At the end of the protocol, with the probe still in place, a value for ischemic tissue oxygenation was obtained for each subject. This value was considered the physiological zero and hence 0 % tissue oxygenation. Mean tissue oxygenation (+/-SE) decreased from resting baseline (100 % tissue oxygenation) to 89 +/- 4, 81 +/- 8, 78 +/- 8, and 47 +/- 8 % at 5, 10, 15, and 50 % of the maximum voluntary contraction, respectively. Tissue oxygenation levels at 10, 15, and 50 % of the maximum voluntary contraction were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than the baseline value. Our results indicate that tissue oxygenation significantly decreases during brief, low levels of <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> and that near infrared spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for detecting deoxygenation noninvasively at low levels of forearm muscle contraction. Our findings have important implications in occupational medicine because oxygen depletion induced by low levels of muscle contraction may be directly linked to muscle fatigue...|$|E
40|$|The {{exercise}} pressor reflex (EPR) is {{an important}} neural mechanism that controls blood pressure and heart rate during <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction.</b> It has been previously demonstrated that the EPR is exaggerated in cardiomyopathy. Both mechanically (group III) and metabolically (group IV) sensitive afferent neurons are important to this reflex in normal humans and animals. In cardiomyopathy, however, the metabolically sensitive afferents are less responsive to activation whereas the mechanically sensitive fibres are overactive. We have demonstrated that this overactivity {{is responsible for the}} exaggeration in the EPR. Of importance, we have also demonstrated that the reduced responsiveness in the group IV afferent neuron is an initiating factor {{in the development of the}} exaggerated EPR. To date, the mechanism mediating this reduced group IV responsiveness remains unclear. Given that group IV afferent neurons are activated via chemically sensitive receptors, it is logical to suggest that changes in receptor function are responsible for the blunted behaviour of group IV neurons in cardiomyopathy. In order to test this postulate, however, potential receptor candidates must first be identified. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPv 1) receptor is a non-selective cation channel that serves as a marker of the group IV afferent neurons in the periphery. We have demonstrated that the TRPv 1 is abnormal in cardiomyopathy. It has been shown that the TRPv 1 receptor is colocalized with the cannabinoid 1 (CB 1) receptor on group IV afferent neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that the function of CB 1 receptors is abnormal in cardiomyopathy. We explored this possibility by using anandamide (AEA), an endogenously produced cannabinoid that has been shown to control blood pressure via activation of the CB 1 receptor. In these studies, we evaluated the cardiovascular responses to intra-arterial injection of AEA into the hindlimb of normal, cardiomyopathic and neonatally capsaicin-treated (NNCAP) rats (rats that lack group IV afferent neurons) to determine whether administration of AEA results in abnormal responses of group IV afferent neurons in cardiomyopathic rats. We determined that AEA controls changes in blood pressure, predominately via activation of the CB 1 receptor in this preparation. We further observed that the blood pressure response to AEA is blunted in cardiomyopathic rats when compared to normal rats. We also observed a reduced blood pressure response to AEA in NNCAP animals, indicating that AEA is acting on group IV afferent neurons in this preparation. To determine whether programmed cell death could account for the decreased responsiveness that we observed during activation of the CB 1 and TRPv 1 receptors on group IV afferent neurons in heart failure, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay. We observed no evidence of cell death within the dorsal root ganglia in rats with cardiomyopathy. The data suggest that the responsiveness of CB 1 receptors on group IV afferent neurons is blunted in cardiomyopathy. Importantly, these data indicate that group IV primary afferent neurons express multiple receptor defects in cardiomyopathy that may contribute to the decreased CB 1 receptor sensitivity in this disease...|$|E

40|$|Alan Hedge, Jeffrey HancockFrequent brief rest breaks, {{known as}} micro-breaks, {{have been shown}} to benefit {{computer}} users by reducing fatigue and possibly preventing musculoskeletal disorders. Various methods of reminding users to take rest breaks have been developed. Initially, efforts focused on the use of break reminder computer software, although potentially this may be disruptive to work patterns. More recently, micro-break reminders have been incorporated into computer equipment and these have been indexed to work activity, and this approach may offer less potential for disrupting work activities. 	A computer mouse has been developed that vibrates in the user's hand after 10 seconds of inactivity. The vibration is intended to remind the user to rest his or her hand in a neutral position while not actively engaging the mouse rather than maintaining a grip on the mouse that requires <b>static</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction.</b> A laboratory experiment was conducted to test this vibrating mouse against a conventional mouse to see how it affected subjects' task performance, task behaviors, and mouse preference. It was hypothesized that the vibrating mouse would increase the number of times subjects removed their hands from the mouse, be minimally disruptive and have no adverse effect on task performance. The study also explored what subjects did with their hand when this was removed from the mouse. 	Eleven female and seven male subjects participated in the experiment. Use of the vibrating mouse (experimental condition) was compared to use of a conventional mouse (control condition) for five consecutive tasks. The first three tasks required the finding and correcting of duplicate words, the finding and correcting of duplicate sentences and the finding and correcting of misspelled words from text passages. The final two tasks were a reading comprehension task, where the subjects answered four multiple-choice questions about a text passage, and a composition task in response to a business scenario. 	Subjects were videotaped to collect data on their behavior while completing the tasks under both conditions. Task time and number of errors were collected as performance measures. User preferences and musculoskeletal discomfort were gathered using two questionnaires, one administered pre test and one post test. 	No differences were found in performance between the two conditions. The vibrating mouse induced more positive task behaviors than the conventional mouse, including significantly more resting behavior (p= 0. 02) and slightly more hand removals (p= 0. 06). The vibrating mouse, however, also induced significantly more negative task behaviors than the conventional mouse, such as increasing the frequency of unsupported hand hovering (p= 0. 00). Nine subjects found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive to their performance during the duplicate word and reading tasks; and eight found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive during the duplicate word task. The effectiveness of the mouse seemed to correspond to task type and also to subjects' mouse use technique. 	Because of technological limitations and a desire to limit extraneous distractions to the subjects during the tasks, the vibration occurrence data was collected by subjects' self reporting the number of vibration occurrences they experienced. This subjectiveness may have compromised the reliability of the vibration frequency data. 	The vibrating mouse shows promise but {{more research is needed to}} understand the conditions under which a vibration occurs and therefore when a user would gain benefits from this mouse. The effects of task type and user technique need to be examined in more detail to determine the nature of these effects before recommendations can be made as to the proper implementation of the vibrating mouse.

50|$|<b>Muscle</b> <b>contractions</b> can be {{described}} based on two variables: length and tension. A <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same. In contrast, a <b>muscle</b> <b>contraction</b> is isotonic if muscle length changes but the muscle tension remains the same. If the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric.
