5000|$|<b>Strained</b> <b>silicon</b> is a {{layer of}} silicon in which the silicon atoms are {{stretched}} beyond their normal interatomic distance. This {{can be accomplished by}} putting the layer of silicon over a substrate of silicon germanium (...) [...] As the atoms in the silicon layer align with the atoms of the underlying silicon germanium layer (which are arranged a little farther apart, with respect to those of a bulk silicon crystal), the links between the silicon atoms become stretched - thereby leading to <b>strained</b> <b>silicon.</b> Moving these silicon atoms farther apart reduces the atomic forces that interfere with the movement of electrons through the transistors and thus better mobility, resulting in better chip performance and lower energy consumption. These electrons can move 70% faster allowing <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> transistors to switch 35% faster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} {{temperature}} dependence of phonon-scattering-limited mobility µPH for advanced short-channel strained pMOS devices. By using the split CV method and Matthiessen’s rule, surface-roughness-limited mobility µSR and µPH are successfully decoupled. This paper {{indicates that the}} temperature sensitivity of µPH is proportional to T − 1. 75 for a neutral stressor and becomes higher when compressive strain is applied. It is explained by the higher optical phonon energy induced by uniaxially compressive strain. Our new findings may also explain the previously reported higher temperature sensitivity of drain current present in uniaxial strained pMOSFETs.

40|$|<b>Straining</b> of <b>silicon</b> {{improves}} {{mobility of}} carriers resulting in speed enhancement for transistors in CMOS technology. Traditionally, <b>silicon</b> <b>straining</b> is applied {{in a similar}} ad-hoc manner to the whole die including logic and memory. Speed enhancement achieved for both NMOS and PMOS devices is desirable in logic circuits for performance enhancement because both PMOS and NMOS devices lie in critical delay paths. In SRAM cells however PMOS devices {{are not in the}} delay path and hence made small to minimize cell area and improve the write stability of the cell. Hence, speed enhancement of PMOS does not result in any reduction in cell access time and in fact it degrades the cell write ability. Hence, optimal method and amount of <b>silicon</b> <b>straining</b> for logic and memory should be different. In this paper, w...|$|R

Our study in-dicates that the strain sensitivity of hole mobility becomes less with increasing temperature, and it is consistent with previous mechanical-bending result. Furthermore, the carrier-scattering mechanism for the pMOSFET under uniaxial compressive strain tends to be more phonon limited at a given vertical electric field, which explains the larger drain current sensitivity to temperature present in the compressively strained PFET.

To address these new process control requirements, in 2007, Xitronix Corporation introduced a photo-reflectance system to the semiconductor process control market. Like the Therma-Probe, the Xitronix metrology system utilized a fixed wavelength probe beam generated by a laser. However, the probe beam of the Xitronix system had a wavelength of approximately 375 nanometers, near the first major interband transition in silicon. At this wavelength the electro-modulation signal is dominant, which enabled the Xitronix system to precisely measure active doping concentration in diffusion-less annealing processes.

40|$|Strain gauges {{are widely}} applied to measure {{mechanical}} deformation of structures and specimens. While metallic foil gauges {{usually have a}} gauge factor slightly over 2, single crystalline silicon demonstrates intrinsic gauge factors as high as 200. Although silicon is an intrinsically stiff and brittle material, flexible and even stretchable strain gauges have been achieved by integrating thin silicon strips on soft and deformable polymer substrates. To achieve a fundamental understanding of the large variance in gauge factor and stretchability of reported flexible/stretchable silicon-on-polymer strain gauges, finite element and analytically models are established to reveal {{the effects of the}} length of the silicon strip, and the thickness and modulus of the polymer substrate. Analytical results for two limiting cases, i. e., infinitely thick substrate and infinitely long strip, have found good agreement with FEM results. We have discovered that <b>strains</b> in <b>silicon</b> resistor can vary by orders of magnitude with different substrate materials whereas strip length or substrate thickness only affects the strain level mildly. While the average <b>strain</b> in <b>silicon</b> reflects the gauge factor, the maximum <b>strain</b> in <b>silicon</b> governs the stretchability of the system.

40|$|The biaxial <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> has {{attracted}} {{much interest in}} manufacturing industry due to the potential enhancement in carrier-transport property. The biaxial strain lifts the degeneracy of silicon valence and conduction bands, leading {{to a reduction in}} intervalley scattering and lower effective mass of conduction and valence band states, and hence delivers better mobility and velocity performance in comparison with bulk silicon. In this research, a development of the lightly doped and heavily doped ultrathin <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> ultimate drift velocity model with the inclusion of quantum confinement effect is conducted. For nondegenerate regime, the study shows that the ultimate drift velocity is its thermal velocity which is only dependent on temperature. However, in the degenerate regime the ultimate drift velocity is its Fermi velocity which only depends on the carrier concentration. At room temperature, result shows that the ultimate drift velocity of <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> is always higher than unstrained silicon as much as 0. 5 x 10 m/s. The single channel and dual channel biaxial <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> gate capacitance are also developed. These gate capacitances take into account the quantum capacitance. Result shows that for the single channel device, the relative capacitance is lower by as much as 0. 07 compared to dual channel device when the oxide thickness is 2. 5 nm and transverse electric field is 60 MV 'm. This means that the quantum capacitance is more dominant in the single channel compared to the dual channel biaxial <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> MOSFET. This is due to the dual channel biaxial <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> having a thicker dielectric which causes the lower effect of quantum capacitance. The quantum capacitance is more dominant in thinner gate oxide and lower strain. Lastly, an analytical threshold voltage modeling has been reported. This model takes into account the effect of quantum confinement effect on the flatband voltage, built-in voltage and <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> work function. Other than that, this model also includes the quantum mechanical effect on the oxide thickness. Other important parameters such as different lateral doping profile in the depletion region, germanium mole fraction of the silicon germanium (SiGe) layer, thickness of <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> and silicon germanium, channel length, source, drain and substrate bias are also included. Comparison of this model with the thick <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> threshold voltage simulation results was also carried out. Results show that the threshold voltage for ultrathin <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> channel is always higher by as much as 0. 04 V compared to the thick <b>strained</b> <b>silicon</b> MOSFET.
