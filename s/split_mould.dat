40|$|Provisional crowns may be {{used for}} many weeks during healing of soft tissues, while other dental {{procedures}} are being performed and whilst the permanent restorations are being fabricated. The provisional occlusion they present serves a diagnostic purpose for fine tuning biological and biomechanical requirements. They need to be strong enough to withstand masticatory forces during this time, as it is costly, inconvenient and time consuming to repair breakages. There is no ideal provisional crown material, and new products appear on the market regularly. Dentists need to know which perform best in terms of strength, durability, ease of use, aesthetics and cost to facilitate selection and purchase. This study was undertaken to compare the compressive strengths of seven different provisional crown materials, consisting of three acrylic resins, three composites and one CAD/CAM fabricated sample set. A custom-made stainless steel <b>split</b> <b>mould</b> was constructed having a circular opening of 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in-depth and was used to prepare ten specimens for each material. For the composites, the various materials were syringed into the circular openings and compacted using a ball burnisher. After five minutes, specimens were removed. The heat cured acrylic resin specimens were further processed in a pressure pot for five minutes. All samples were stored in distilled water at 370 C for 24 hours before being tested. Test specimens were mounted into a jig on the Instron machine and loaded under a compressive force until they fractured or the compression limit was reached. The forces applied were recorded and used for statistical analysis. The results may help clinicians to select the most appropriate material for each clinical situation. [URL]...|$|E

This low pH could potentially inhibit setting reactions, affect adhesion, or increase the solubility of root end filling materials hence affect the compressive strength. Moreover, root end filling materials might expose or even mix with lidocaine HCL during periapical surgery. Objectives: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of acidic pH and lidocaine on the compressive strength of calcium-enriched mixture (CEM). Materials and Methods: CEM was mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions or with lidocaine (L), and condensed into 6 × 4 mm <b>split</b> <b>moulds.</b> The samples were exposed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5 or 7. 4 for 7 or 28 days.

Methods: 60 disc-shaped specimens of approximately 10 mm x 2 mm were perpared from various composites using perspex <b>split</b> <b>mould</b> and was cured for 40 seconds. The irradiated surface was polished using Sof-Lex pop-on polishing discs. The specimens were randomly divided to 6 groups. Microhardness was recorded before immersion (control group) using a load of 200 g for 15 seconds using Vickers microhardness tester, (Shimadzu Corp, Kyoto, Japan). All specimens were then immersed in 20 ml of Listerine,Oral B- Tooth and gum care alcohol-free mouth rinses, Experimental Mouth rinses X, Y and Z and distilled water for 24 hours at 37 Â? C, after which micro hardness value was measured again. Data collected was analyzed using one-way ANOVA / Games-Howell post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between groups. Specimens were also subjected to surface analysis using AFM (Ambios Technology Universal Scanning Probe Microscopyâ??). Results: Filtek Z 350 exhibited the highest Vickers microhardness number (VHN) and Ceram X Duo had the lowest VHN before immersion. All tested composite showed significant decreased in surface microhardness (VHN) compared to before immersion. Filtek Z 350 showed the highest VHN and TPH Spectrum showed the lowest VHN after immersion. Ceram X Duo showed the roughest surface before immersion. The surface roughness of Ceram X Mono was high when immersed in experimental mouthrinses. Conclusions: Filtek Z 350 exhibited significantly higher VHN compared to other composites tested.

40|$|Abstract: Statement of Problem: Compressive {{strength}} (CS) and sorption/solubility of the luting cements are two associated factors. Searching {{a correlation}} between sorption/solubility and compressive strength of various luting cements is required. Objectives: To measure the water sorption/solubility, and compressive strength of three resin-based and one conventional glass ionomer (CGI) luting cement after 1 and 24 h of immersion in distilled water and {{to determine if there}} is any correlation between those properties found. Materials and Methods: Four luting cements were investigated. For each material, 10 disc shaped specimens were prepared for measuring the sorption/solubility. The specimens were cured according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the sorption/solubility were measured in accordance with the ISO 4049 ’s. For testing the compression strength, for each material 16 cylindrical specimens were prepared by insertion of cements into a stainless steel <b>split</b> <b>mould.</b> The specimens were cured, divided into groups of 8, and then stored in distilled water at (37 ± 1) °C for 1 and 24 h. The test was performed using the universal testing machine, the maximum load was recorded and CS was calculated. The data were analysed using SPSS software version 18. One-way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey’s test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were performed. Results: G-CEM had the highest mean CS (153. 60 ± 25. 15) and CGI luting had the lowest CS (21. 36 ± 5. 37) (p 0. 05). The lowest mean sorption/solubility value was for RelyXTM U 200 and Panavia F, and the highest for CGI luting (all p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The compressive strength of all cements did not necessarily increase after 24 h and varied depending on the materials. There was a strong reverse correlation between sorption and CS values after both 1 and 24 h immersion. It may be practical for clinician to use those cements with the less sorption / solubility and more stable compression strength over time. ...|$|E

Although various mechanical properties of resin composites have been studied, no fracture toughness test data for nano-hybrid composites under acidic condition {{for a long period}} of time has been published. Objectives: To compare the fracture toughness (KIc) of two types of resin composites under tensile loading and to assess the effect of distilled water and lactic acid on the resistance of the restoratives to fracture after three months of immersion. Materials and Methods: Four resin composites were used: three nanohybrids [EsteliteSigma Quick (Kuraray), Luna (SDI), Paradigm (3 M/ESPE) ] and one hybrid, Rok (SDI). The specimens were prepared using a custom-made polytetrafluorethylene <b>split</b> <b>mould,</b> stored in distilled water (pH 6. 8) or 0. 01 mol/L lactic acid (pH 4) and conditioned at 37 °C for 24 hours, 1 or 3 months. They were loaded under tensile stress using a universal testing machine; the maximum load (N) to the specimen failure was recorded and the fracture toughness (KIc) was calculated. Data were analysed by ANOVA and Tukey’s test using SPSS, version 18. Results: The results of two-way ANOVA did not show a significant combined effect of material, time, and storage medium on fracture toughness (p= 0. 056). However, there was a strong interaction between materials and time (p= 0. 001) when the storage medium were ignored. After 24 h of immersion in distilled water, Paradigm revealed the highest KIc values followed by Rok, Luna and Estelite. Immersion in either distilled water or lactic acid significantly decreased the fracture toughness of almost all materials as time interval increased. Conclusions: Paradigm showed the highest fracture toughness followed by Rok, Luna and Estelite respectively. As time increased, KIc significantly decreased for almost all resin composites except for Luna which showed a slight decrease after one month of immersion in distilled water...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of exposure of Fuji IX Fast to the simulated acidic aspects of the oral environment in terms of any changes in the elemental composition of strontium (Sr), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and fluorine (F) which resulted at the surface of this material. Methods: Sixty-five cylindrical blocks of Fuji IX Fast were prepared using <b>split</b> <b>moulds.</b> The demineralizing solution was an acetate buffered demineralizing solution at pH 4. 3. The remineralizing solution was a buffered solution containing 1. 5 mM Ca, 0. 9 mM P and 10 ppm F at pH 7. The blocks of Fuji IX Fast were subjected either to two-day alternating cycles of remineralization and demineralization for up to 24 days (test); 6 two-day cycles of demineralizing or remineralizing solution separately, or deionized distilled water alone (controls) or were left untreated (base line control). Mineral profiles of Ca, P, Sr and F within 100 μm of the material surface were assessed following 8, 16 and 24 days of treatment (test); 4, 8 or 12 days (controls) or for baseline control samples, using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Results: There were significant changes in mineral profile in the test specimens in terms of Sr and Ca concentrations.

40|$|Soil {{reinforcement}} is {{an ancient}} technique which involves the addition of tensile elements like plastics in the soil to increase its engineering properties like shear strength, settlement, cohesion and bearing capacity. In consideration of this, a series of triaxial tests were undertaken to investigate the reinforcing effect of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) plastic material in Cape Flats sand, predominant in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Plastic strips of various lengths were randomly included to the soil at different concentrations to form a homogenous soil-plastic composite specimen prepared at varying compactive effort. Using a <b>split</b> <b>mould,</b> cylindrical specimens of 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height were prepared using the dry tamping technique. The test specimens were compacted to achieve target average dry densities of the composite sample. The plastic strip reinforcement parameters comprised of 7. 5 mm to 30 mm lengths, and concentrations of 0. 1 % to 0. 3 % by weight of dry sand. Triaxial compression tests were performed using confining pressures of 50 kPa, 100 kPa, 200 kPa, 300 kPa and 400 kPa at a shear rate of 0. 075 %/min, and to a maximum strain of 10 %. Laboratory results favourably {{suggest that there is}} an improvement in the soil shear strength properties due to these inclusions. The friction angle increased up to a peak value on varying plastic strip length and concentration, beyond which further addition of plastic material led to a reduction in the friction angle. The greatest friction angle was reported at plastic strip length and content of 15 mm and 0. 2 % respectively. Additionally, the results indicate that a higher compactive effort leads to a greater increase in friction angle of the soil. The existence of a critical confining stress was observed from triaxial test results on soil-plastic composites. This threshold limit was influenced significantly by the plastic inclusions, and the range of confining stresses. Consequently, a bilinear failure envelope was reported in reinforced samples while unreinforced specimens realised a linear relationship. The Mohr-Coulomb failure line above the critical confining pressure almost paralleled the unreinforced linear relationship. An embankment model was developed using Slide Modeler software and the factor of safety of slope was analysed with unreinforced and reinforced backfill subjected to static and dynamic loading. It was observed that the safety factor increased due to polyethylene strip inclusions. Therefore, the proposed technique will find potential practical applicability in low-cost embankment or road construction...|$|E

Consequently, significant amounts of mineral additions are usually incorporated, in replacement of part of the cement to improve the workability properties, reduce the production of hydration heat and reduce the overall cost. Mainly because it needs to incorporate significant quantities of ultrafine materials (cement and mineral additions), SCC has great potential for the use of these sub-products, such as fly ash (FA), or other commercial products, such as limestone filler (LF), as partial replacement of cement. However, the use of significant quantities of mineral additions (also necessary to ensure self-compactability), with the consequent increase in the paste volume and decrease in the coarse aggregate, will alter the SCC’s microstructure and lead to a change in shrinkage and mechanical properties. It is therefore essential to investigate and demonstrate the applicability of large quantities of these additions (in both binary and ternary mixes), mainly due to the existing regulation limitations related to their use in blended cements and as direct replacement of cement in the production of concrete mixes. To this end, an experimental programme was conducted to evaluate the effect of large quantities of FA and LF in binary and ternary mixes on the mechanical properties and shrinkage of SCC. This study focuses essentially on the evaluation of compressive strength in cubic and cylindrical <b>moulds,</b> <b>splitting</b> tensile strength, the secant and dynamic elastic modulus and, finally, shrinkage. A detailed analysis of the results and their comparison with both reference values and with results of other authors is performed. For that purpose, a total of 11 SCC mixes were produced: 1 with cement (C) only; 3 with C + FA in 30, 60 and 70 % replacement by volume (fad); 3 with C + LF in 30, 60 and 70 % fad; and finally, 4 mixes with C + FA + LF in combinations of 10 – 20, 20 – 10, 20 – 40 and 40 – 20 % fad. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
