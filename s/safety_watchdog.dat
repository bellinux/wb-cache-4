5000|$|On June 16, 2010 Radio Free Asia {{informed}} {{that there was}} a leak in one of the fuel tubes. Officials denied this information stating that [...] "Daya Bay's two reactor units are functioning safely and stably. There has been no radioactive leak". Radio Free Asia quoted an unidentified expert, saying that radioactive iodine had been released. They also claimed the incident had not been immediately reported to the government, and was kept secret for some time. The New York Times reported differently, quoting one of the shareholders of the plant, China Light & Power (CLP), a Hong Kong-based utility, that the government nuclear <b>safety</b> <b>watchdog</b> in both mainland China and Hong Kong were notified and briefed. CLP {{said in a statement that}} the leak was small and fell below international standards requiring reporting as a safety issue. No radioactive monitoring stations in Hong Kong detected any rise in radioactivity. Mainland China news outlets also quoted officials explaining the situation, which was considered under normal operation conditions and fell below international standards for reporting.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Army {{counterpart}} to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the Defense Ammunition Center on McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, near McAlester, Oklahoma [...] USATCES {{is responsible for}} providing ammunition and explosives (A&E) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&E safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS) and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&E by burial or dumping up {{until the end of}} the Vietnam War. The USATCES acts as the Army’s <b>safety</b> <b>watchdog</b> for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army’s Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordinance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS) and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&E Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&E. Their mission is to provide A&E safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army’s A&E is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it.|$|E
40|$|Food <b>safety</b> <b>watchdog</b> Safefood {{has been}} asked by the Department of Health of review {{research}} on the negative health effects of energy drinks. Research by the World Health Organisation (WHO) this month found that energy drinks will become a significant public health problem if their use among young people is not addressed through a cap on caffeine levels and restrictions on their sale and marketing [...] . “Obviously there are other issues as these products are taken with other substances – specifically alcohol or drugs – {{and that has been}} implicated in some serious incidents including suicides,” [...] . ...|$|E
50|$|Sales {{continued}} to expand, and in 1969, {{annual sales of}} cyclamate had reached $1 billion, which increased pressure from public <b>safety</b> <b>watchdogs</b> to restrict the usage of cyclamate. In October 1969, Department of Health, Education & Welfare Secretary Robert Finch, bypassing Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Herbert L. Ley, Jr., removed the GRAS designation from cyclamate and banned its use in general-purpose foods, though it remained available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling; in October 1970, the FDA, under a new Commissioner, banned cyclamate completely from all food and drug products in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Canada {{mandated}} DRLs, General Motors, {{interested in}} reducing the build variations of cars for the North American market, petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1990 to permit (but not require) US vehicles to be equipped with DRLs like those in Canada. NHTSA objected on grounds {{of the potential for}} high-intensity DRLs to create problems with glare and turn signal masking, and issued a proposed rule in 1991 that specified a maximum intensity of 2,600 cd. Industry and <b>safety</b> <b>watchdogs</b> reacted to the proposed rule, and eventually the glare objections were set aside and most of the same types of DRLs allowed in Canada were permitted but not required effective with the 1995 model year. General Motors immediately equipped most (and, in following years, all) of its vehicles with DRLs beginning with the Chevrolet Corsica. Saab, Volkswagen, Volvo, Suzuki and Subaru gradually introduced DRLs in the U.S. market beginning in 1995. In recent years, Lexus has installed high-beam or turn signal based DRLs on US models. Some Toyota models come with DRLs as standard or optional equipment, and with a driver-controllable on/off switch. Starting in the 2006 model year, Honda began equipping their U.S. models with DRLs, mostly by reduced-intensity operation of the high beam headlamps.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{recommendation that}} people voluntarily evacuate from {{places in the}} 20-30 km range from the Fukushima Daiichi plant came after the Nuclear <b>Safety</b> Commission <b>watchdog</b> released forecasts based on SPEEDI measurements. It was found that radiation levels differed significantly based on geography and wind direction, and {{it was suggested that}} because of this, the way evacuation areas were being designated should be changed and become more detailed. The Yomiuri Shinbun calculated radiation doses based on data from the Fukushima prefectural government and found they corresponded with the forecasts.|$|R
40|$|In early 2013 Europe {{was subject}} to a moral panic {{regarding}} the presence of horse flesh in beef products. Posited as a 2 ̆ 7 scandal 2 ̆ 7 and often {{referred to in the}} media as 2 ̆ 7 the horsemeat scandal 2 ̆ 7, this topic amassed a large amount of media reports and commentary as well as eliciting police investigations, raids and arrests along with a UK-wide survey of authenticity by the British food <b>safety</b> <b>watchdog,</b> the Food Standards Agency. At the time of writing (and the 2 ̆ 7 scandal 2 ̆ 7 continues) 2 ̆ 7 mislabled 2 ̆ 7 meat products have been found in the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK), France, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany. Commentators have argued that the 2 ̆ 7 scandal 2 ̆ 7 demonstrates the complexity of the food industry 2 ̆ 7 s supply chains in a globalized world while others have been quick to claim that neo-liberal, free market profiteers are to blame (Hutton, 2013) ...|$|E
40|$|Development of bug-free, high-surety, complex {{software}} is quite difficult using current tools. The brittle {{nature of the}} programming constructs in popular languages such as C/C++ is one root cause. Brittle commands force the designer to rigidly specify the minutiae of tasks, e. g. using ''for(index= 0;index>total;index++) '', rather than specifying the goals or intent of the tasks, e. g. ''ensure that all relevant data elements have been examined''. Specification of task minutiae makes code hard to comprehend, which in turn encourages design errors/limitations and makes future modifications quite difficult. This report describes an LDRD project to seed {{the development of a}} surety computer language, for stand-alone computing environments, to be implemented using the swarm intelligence of autonomous agents. The long term vision of this project was to develop a language with the following surety capabilities: (1) Reliability [...] Autonomous agents can appropriate y decide when to act and when a task is complete, provide a natural means for avoiding brittle task specifications, and can overcome many hardware glitches. (2) <b>Safety,</b> security [...] <b>Watchdog</b> <b>safety</b> and security agents can monitor other agents to prevent unauthorized or dangerous actions. (3) An immune system [...] The small chunks of agent code can have an encryption scheme to enable detection and elimination of unauthorized and corrupted agents. This report describes the progress achieved during this small 9 month project and describes lessons learned...|$|R
40|$|The National Bureau of Standards, Center for Manufacturing Engineering is {{implementing}} {{an experimental}} factory called the Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF). The AMRF will {{operate as a}} small batch machine shop and is currently configured with three machining workstations a cleaning and deburring workstation and an inspection workstation. Each of these workstations will employ robotic material handling including machine loading and unloading. At present each workstation is at a different stage of completion. The "Horizontal Workstation" which contains a horizontal-spindle N. C. machine tool and one material handling robot has been completely integrated. The material handling robot is a Cincinnati Milacron T 3 (hydraulic) which has been enhanced {{to meet the requirements}} of the AMRF. This robot has been equipped with a hierarchical robot control system, a 3 -D vision system, a <b>watchdog</b> <b>safety</b> system and an instrumented, servo controlled gripper, all of which were developed at the National Bureau of Standards. Each of these systems is described individually together with a description of the enhanced capabilities of the robot with these systems operating as an integrated package...|$|R
