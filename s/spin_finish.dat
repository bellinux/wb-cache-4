40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Textile Research Journal and the definitive published version is available at:[URL] comprehensive review of the roles played by the airflow, wetting and <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> on the air-jet texturing process is given. An experimental investigation of the air-jet texturing process using residual <b>spin</b> <b>finish,</b> yarn-to-yarn static and kinetic friction, filament strength, filament diameter, and on-line tension measurements and high-speed cine-photography is reported. Filament yarn motion in {{different regions of the}} texturing nozzle during dry and wet texturing is analysed. It is found that water acts as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the wet texturing process as the filament yarn travels through the nozzle enabling easier relative motion of the filaments resulting in enhanced entanglement. Wet texturing also reduces <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> on the yarn surface, which in turn, causes an increase in static friction between the filaments of the textured yarn resulting in better fixing of the loops and consequently superior yarns...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{effluents}} usually contain {{high concentrations}} of inorganics as well as organics, and are therefore difficult to treat. Membrane processes {{can be used for}} many of these wastewaters in the textile industry. Two typical examples are discussed: (1) the use of nanofiltration for the treatment of exhausted dye baths, in view of water recycling, and (2) the use of ultrafiltration for the removal of <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> from waste water resulting from rinsing of textile fibres. Both applications are in principle feasible, but in practice the process is negatively influenced by membrane fouling. In the first application, fouling is assumed to be caused by (ad) sorption of organic compounds, which has a large influence because of the high concentrations used in textile dyeing. Furthermore, the high salt concentrations result in a decrease of the effective driving force because of the high osmotic pressures obtained for typical dye baths. Experimental results are discussed, and the applicability of nanofiltration is related to the characteristics of the dye baths for different dyeing methods. In the second application, the concentration of organic compounds is relatively low, but because of the hydrophobic nature of the <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> compounds, a significant effect of membrane fouling is expected. An improvement is suggested by using nanofiltration membranes instead of ultrafiltration membranes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} the mechanisms governing the phenomena of fiber/matrix adhesion by controlling the fiber surface properties. This adhesion is evaluated by studying the micromech. and thermodynamical behavior of the fiber/matrix interface. The complexity of the interactions at the interface requires a global approach that takes into account the chem., morphol., and mechanics. The thermodynamical affinity between the binder and fibers is evaluated by the wetting behavior, whereas the mech. resistance of the fiber/matrix interface is characterized with the pull-out test. Three distinct approaches are used to classify the different systems according to the nature of the binder and the fiber surface. It is found that there is better adhesion when the <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> is removed from the fibers, revealing the surface roughness on which the latex can mech. anchor...|$|E
40|$|Dry-jet {{wet-spun}} polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) precursor fibers coated by <b>spin</b> <b>finishes</b> {{were characterized}} using the solid-state H- 1 {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} technique. Series of fiber samples were prepared upon thermal treatment at different temperatures (room temperature to 180 degrees C). Using the Hahn echo sequence, relatively mobile components were identified {{and the effect of}} the heat treatment on those components was studied. It was observed that the mobile components are mainly the <b>spin</b> <b>finishes.</b> Heat treatment caused loss of one of the <b>spin</b> <b>finishes</b> (Type B) to a great extent (similar to 80 %), whereas the other two <b>spin</b> <b>finishes</b> (Type A and Type C) were more stable. Additional information regarding the change in molecular mobility due to heat treatment was obtained by the spin-lattice relaxation time (T- 1) analysis. It was found that the presence of CNT affects the T- 1 relaxation time of the polymer in the composite fiber, however, that of relatively mobile components remains unaffected.

40|$|T {{emissions}} {{the first}} step is to identify the objectionable pollutant. This must be done before suitable abatement procedures can be taken. Abatement procedures may consist of changes in plant processes or chemical formulations or installation of pollution abatement equipment. The potential for pollutant emissions from finishing processes in the textile industry can be seen in the fact that more than ten billion pounds of fibers are processed per year, requiring 200 million pounds of resins and 200 million pounds of rpin finishing and coning oils. If only 5 % of these resins and oils are discharged in the stack Stack and duct analyses have been conducted on textile finishing ranges processing cottrn and synthetic fibers. Analytical methods used include gas chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and gravimetric analysis. Synthetic fiber <b>spin</b> <b>finish,</b> knitting lubricanis and cotton resin finishes were identitied in stack samples. When particulate loading was of interest, isokinetic samples of the stack gases were also taken. A brief summary of the sampling methods which were used and the conclusions drawn are presented...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the production and}} characterization of novel shaped fibers for fluid adsorption and transport. Shaped fibers such as Y, H, and octolobal, as well as conventional round fibers, were extruded using a research melt extruder. The fibers were extruded from 18 melt flow index (MFI) polypropylene (PP) and blends of 18 MFI PP and 400 MFI PP. Hydrophilic <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> Bozzetto Favorol SF 2 {{was applied to the}} surface of extruded fibers and hydrophilic polyester additive LB- 100 was included in the blend of some H fibers to increase the hydrophilicity of the fiber surface. The geometric shape retention of the extruded fibers was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. The fluid adsorption and transport properties of the fibers were investigated using a low surface tension liquid and a high surface tension liquid. The shaped fibers were shown to have improved geometric shape retention with the addition of 400 MFI PP and were shown to have twice the fluid adsorption and transport capacities of the round fibers. Micrographs of the fiber cross-sections obtained with a scanning electron microscope were used to visually determine the geometric shape retention of the fiber with respect t...|$|E
30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. <b>Spin</b> <b>finish</b> on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the <b>spin</b> <b>finish</b> blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|E

2500|$|The helmet is {{considered}} to be a Celtic version of a Roman auxiliary helmet, combining a Roman shape with La Tène style decoration. It is in the shape of a conical cap with a peaked neck guard. It is made from a single sheet of bronze, possibly <b>spun</b> <b>finished,</b> and has repoussé decoration in the La Tène style, similar to that found on the Waterloo Helmet, on the neck guard and on the fragmentary side pieces. On the neck guard are two flat domed bosses with criss-cross grooves which would originally have held red glass enamel studs. There are holes on either side for attachment to a chin-strap or cheekpiece, and a hole at the top of the helmet for the attachment of a plumed top-knot. On the outer margin of the helmet are incised two strokes which could represent the Roman number [...] "II".|$|R
50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring <b>spinning</b> frame has <b>finished</b> <b>spinning,</b> the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.|$|R
