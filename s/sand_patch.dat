30|$|A simple CA model {{simulating}} continuous bed-contact loads (rolling and sliding) is proposed; {{this model}} was developed phenomenologically {{and without the}} calculation of fluid motion. It is intended primarily for starved beds in a subaqueous system. As the amount of sand increases, the model reproduces the following bed types in order: sheet flows, <b>sand</b> <b>patches,</b> and ripples. While <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> coexist with <b>sand</b> sheets and are not sustainable, ripples are robust once formed.|$|R
30|$|It is {{interesting}} to consider a flume experiment that was conducted under conditions similar to those discussed above. Dreano et al. (2010) showed that in the stable state, the bedload flux due to bedform migration increased from barchan ripples to transverse barchanoid ripples if the sand supply was increased (however, we note that the setup of these experiments {{was different from the}} present simulation). Dreano et al. (2010) observed dynamic equilibrium states in which there was a well-controlled forced influx of sand into the system, while the present simulation assumes a closed system. In our simulation, we did not observe development of isolated ripples as the abundance of sand increased; instead, we investigated the relation between sand flux and the transition between <b>sand</b> sheets, <b>sand</b> <b>patches,</b> and isolated ripples, which had not been investigated sufficiently, compared with the properties of bedforms (ripples and dunes). In the personal experience of the author, during preliminary runs and at early stages of actual runs of flume experiments for different purposes, it is often observed that <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> occur with thin sand sheets under conditions of sparsely available sediments. The <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> migrate more slowly than do sand sheets, and this probably decreases the sand flux, although no measurements have been conducted (note that precise measurement of this is difficult). During the growth of <b>sand</b> <b>patches,</b> <b>sand</b> particles transported from upstream are incorporated into <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> and decelerated (like cars on a congested road); this local state is not in equilibrium, but in a stochastic (statistical) sense, it does not violate the equilibrium of the entire system, because <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> repeatedly appear and disappear in many places. Such behavior is compatible with the stochastic model. Although, the dynamics in the background of the stochastic process and the connection of the numerical model to actual beds remain to be further explored in future studies using new techniques for measurement and observation, considering the change in sand flux due to bed states through a grain-flow phase is a viewpoint that leads to a deeper understanding of bedforms and other sand topographies.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the seabed morphodynamics of the south Aquitaine inner shelf in the area known as “La Salie” (150 km 2, Atlantic ocean, west coast of France), through a descriptive and comparative analysis (time lapse of 29 years) of geophysical and sedimentological datasets. At a water depth of 24 – 50 m, four orders of sedimentary body types were observed at different scales. The first order are large cross-shore “morphological ridges,” corresponding with the properties of very large sorted bedforms. The second order consisted in patchy sorted bedforms, composed of alternately medium to fine <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> (0. 5 – 2 m in thickness), cut by smaller, elongated coarse sediment depressions. In particular, {{the data from the}} sub-bottom profiler revealed that <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> predominantly overlayed the coarse-grained blankets on the eastern (shoreward) extremities, while coarse-grained blanket wedges were found in front of the <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> (southwestward) or locally overlying them on the southwestern extremities. The third order of bedforms involved groups of dune-like features (fine/medium sand), lying in wide areas of coarse-grained sediment. Finally, in the fouth order, the entire inner shelf was covered with wave-generated ripples, oriented N 15 °, that were larger where sediments were coarse (wavelengths of 2. 2 m) than where sediments were fine (wavelengths of 0. 3 m). Over the past 29 years, at a large scale of observation, patchy sorted bedforms have remained remarkably persistent, as has their overall appearance. However, at a smaller scale, weak but constant movements were observed. The coarse depressions have become elongated at their extremities (by a maximum of 300 m over 15 years), and certain coarse/fine sediment boundaries have moved toward the northeast and southeast (by a maximum of 75 m over 12 years). The general movement has been shoreward as has the migration of third-order submarine dune-like features. The persistence of sorted bedforms thus appears to be the consequence of sediment sorting feedback and recurrent storm events...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: {{sediment}} gaps, Alpheus macellarius, Thalassinidea, burrows, seagrass canopies, sediment characteristics, Philippines Small-scale {{disturbance of}} seagrass meadows by burrowing shrimps {{was assessed by}} mapping and quantifying apparent disturbance marks (burrow openings, <b>sand</b> <b>patches,</b> <b>sand</b> mounds, shafts) and obtaining vertical profiles of sediment properties (grain size composition, organic matter and nutrient contents). The densities and sizes of sediment gaps and burrow openings were determined within sampling quadrats in various meadows and were correlated with ambient bed and site characteristics. Effects on sediment properties were determined in a comparison of disturbed and undisturbed areas in two beds with contrasting organic matter sources. Burrow openings and sediment gaps were common in all the meadows and were associated with either the snapping shrimp Alpheus macellarius Chace, 1988 (Alpheidae, Caridea), or species of Thalassinidea. Alpheid shrimp disturbance was more frequent than that of thalassinidean shrimps. The distribution of sand mounds and associated shafts of thalassinidean shrimps were random, whereas the distribution of <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> and burrow openings of alpheid shrimps on the beds appeared regular and clumped, respectively. The densities and sizes of sediment gaps and openings were higher and larger in wave-protected than in exposed beds (p < 0. 05). Shrimp disturbance was more prevalent in clear-water than in turbid seagrass areas of the Bolinao-Anda region. The distribution of thalassinidean shrimps, however, was wider than that of A. macellarius, which was observed to be patch areas of 14 ± 2 % of the meadows while thalassinidean shrimps produced sand mounds that covered 4 ± 1 %. Burrowing shrimps altered the vertical profiles of sediment properties – A. macellarius relocated {{a significant proportion of}} coarse grains in the upper 10 cm while the thalassinidean shrimps consolidated finer fractions from 10 to 20 cm down the core, and consequently concentrated organic matter.

30|$|A simple {{stochastic}} {{cellular automaton}} model is proposed for simulating bedload transport, especially for cases {{with a low}} transport rate and where available sediments are very sparse on substrates in a subaqueous system. Numerical simulations show that the bed type changes from sheet flow through <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> to ripples {{as the amount of}} sand increases; this is consistent with observations in flume experiments and in the field. Without changes in external conditions, the sand flux calculated for a given amount of sand decreases over time as bedforms develop from a flat bed. This appears to be inconsistent with the general understanding that sand flux remains unchanged under the constant-fluid condition, but it is consistent with the previous experimental data. For areas of low sand abundance, the sand flux versus sand amount (flux–density relation) in the simulation shows a single peak with an abrupt decrease, followed by a long tail; this is very similar to the flux–density relation seen in automobile traffic flow. This pattern (the relation between segments of the curve and the corresponding bed states) suggests that <b>sand</b> sheets, <b>sand</b> <b>patches,</b> and <b>sand</b> ripples correspond respectively to the free-flow phase, congested phase, and jam phase of traffic flows. This implies that sand topographic features on starved beds are determined by the degree of interference between sand particles. Although the present study deals with simple cases only, this can provide a simplified but effective modeling of the more complicated sediment transport processes controlled by interference due to contact between grains, such as the pulsatory migration of grain-size bimodal mixtures with repetition of clustering and scattering.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{response of}} deep shelf sediments to {{the interplay of}} tides and waves, based on {{the example of the}} Celtic Sea sand banks is described. Grab samples and 1500 km of multibeam and side scan data have been collected from the 300 km 2 densely surveyed Kaiser bank area. The bank is 140 – 170 m deep, 30 m high and 60 km long, oriented perpendicular to the shelf edge and nearly parallel to the major axis of the tidal ellipse. Surficial sediments of the bank consist of medium to gravely biolithoclastic sands. They are swept by tidal currents that reach 0. 9 m/s 1 m above the seabed, and under the occasional influence of waves. The mobile sands are commonly bedformed and rest on a highly backscattering lag. The flanks below − 140 m mainly exhibit transverse tidal dunes and sand ribbons, whereas the top of the bank mostly displays discontinuous <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> and wave ripples. The <b>sand</b> <b>patches</b> are interpreted as the remnants of tidal bedforms reworked by waves. Calculations of the threshold of motion of four modal grain sizes under various conditions at the seabed show that tidal bedforms are active during spring tides sometimes associated with waves, whereas only the largest annual waves may explain the observed wave ripples. As in active tidal banks, there is a reversal of tidal bedload transport from one bank side to the other. The sedimentation rate is very low on the Kaiser bank. In addition, there is a loss of sediment at both bank extremities and the tidal bedload cross-bank transfer is very small, probably controlled by shelf residual currents and long-term drift of sediment resuspended by waves. However, the present-day action of waves at the bank top is less intense than it was at lower sea levels during the Holocene, as evidenced by seismic studies...|$|R
