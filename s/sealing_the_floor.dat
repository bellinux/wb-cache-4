40|$|In {{this thesis}} the air {{infiltration}} through the envelope of a naturally ventilated stone church located in Bergby (Gävle, Sweden) is studied. The project {{is focused on}} Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) modeling the air change rate (ACH) inside the church hall and studying the factors (stack effect and wind effect) that influence the air infiltration. The weather parameters outside the building were recorded in a weather station and {{the properties of the}} air inside the church was analyzed with different methods. Infrared thermography techniques and thermistors were used to measure the temperature inside, the tracer gas method to measure the ACH and the blower door technique to measure the tightness of the building envelope. In order to know the pressure coefficients on the church envelope a physical model of the building was studied in a wind tunnel. Firstly, only the values obtained from the weather station were used to calculate the predictors of ACH and see which parameter influence more on its variation:  temperature difference (∆T) indicating the stack effect; and wind speed (WS), the component of wind speed perpendicular to the long-side facades of the church (WS 90) and their square values (WS 2 and WS 902) indicating the wind effect. The data obtained in the wind tunnel were later used to do the MLR study with new predictors for indicating wind effect (∆Cp∙WS, ∆Cp∙WS 2, ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS, ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS 2, ∆CpC-H∙WS, ∆CpC-H∙WS 2). Better prediction of ACH was obtained with the square of the wind speed (WS 2) instead of the magnitude itself (WS). However, the latter (WS) provided better results than the regression with the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the wind (WS 90). Although wind speed influences in ACH, it alone seems to be a very poor predictor of ACH since has a negative correlation with ΔT when the data under study include both day and night. However when high wind speed are detected it has quite strong influence. The most significant predictions of ACR were attained with the combined predictors ∆T & WS and ∆T & ∆CpOUT-IN·A∙WS 2. The main conclusion taken from the MLR analysis is that the stack effect is the most significant factor influencing the ACH inside the church hall. This leads to suggest that an effective way of reducing ACH could be <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and ceiling of the church because from those areas the air infiltration has big influence on the ACH inside the church hall, and more in this case that have been noted that the floor is very leaky. Although different assumptions have been done during the analyses that contribute to make the predictions deviate from reality, at the end {{it would be possible to}} asses that MLR can be a useful tool for analyzing the relative importance of the driving forces for ACR in churches and similar buildings, as long as the included predictors not are too mutually correlated, and that attained models that are statistically significant also are physically realistic.

40|$|Three indoor, sheeted bag-stack fumigations of {{paddy rice}} using {{aluminium}} phosphide were undertaken in Guangdong Province, southern China. We measured {{the effect of}} two types of sheeting (polyvinylchloride [PVC] or polyethylene [PE]) and two types of floor sealing (clips or fixing into a slot with a rubber pipe) on phosphine concentration and retention. The aim was to test the feasibility of retaining fumigant at a sufficient concentration for long enough to control known resistant insect pests. Each stack was pressure tested and phosphine concentrations measured daily during the fumigation. Cages of test insects in culture medium, including resistant and susceptible strains, were placed inside each stack and could be observed through the clear sheeting. Highest concentrations for the longest period were obtained in a PVC-covered stack that included a ground sheet and wall sheets <b>sealed</b> to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with rubber pipes. A similar PVC-covered stack <b>sealed</b> to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with clips instead of pipe did not retain gas as efficiently and required re-dosing. A PE-covered stack, with no ground sheet but also with wall sheets <b>sealed</b> to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with pipe, produced an acceptable fumigation. Susceptible Rhyzopertha dominica were controlled in 2 days and the most resistant strain in 15 days. Resistant Cryptolestes ferrugineus survived until day 21. The paddy was still free of insect infestation 7 months later when the bag-stack was opened to mill the rice. Pressure half-lives correlated with gas concentration and retention. Sorption {{appeared to be a}} major limiting factor, reducing potential fumigant dosage by about 50 %.

2500|$|By 1948 the White House {{had become}} {{physically}} unstable, {{and the house}} was temporarily abandoned while a major reconstruction took place. The building's interior was dismantled, the furnishings and decorative items were stored, and a new steel frame was built within the exterior walls. Truman used this opportunity to reposition the entrance to the Grand Stair. Architect Lorenzo Simmons Winslow explored several options for the reorientation of the Grand Stair before convincing President Truman of the present configuration where it opens {{to the center of the}} east wall of the Entrance Hall. Except for the new stair opening, most of McKim's design was followed but now reinterpreted in light gray Joliet marble instead of warm hued Sienna stone and painted plaster.

The Worker explains that he has disrupted Thane's Quantum Identity Pattern, 'granting' him a true death. The Worker thanks Siris for coming, but explains that he can only be freed if another takes his place in the prison.

50|$|The {{building}} at 97 Orchard Street was contracted by Prussian-born immigrant Lukas Glockner in 1863 and was modified {{several times to}} conform with the city's developing housing laws. When first constructed, it contained 22 apartments and a basement level saloon. Over time, four stoop-level and two basement apartments were converted into commercial retail space, leaving 16 apartments in the building. Modifications over the years included the installation of indoor plumbing (cold running water, two toilets per floor), an air shaft, and gas followed by electricity. In 1935, rather than continue to modify the building, the landlord evicted the residents, boarded the upper windows, and <b>sealed</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>floors,</b> leaving only <b>the</b> stoop-level and basement storefronts open for business. No further changes were made until the Lower East Side Tenement Museum became involved with the building in 1988. As such, the building stands {{as a kind of}} time capsule, reflecting 19th and early 20th century living conditions and the changing notions of what constitutes acceptable housing.|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, a {{swimming}} pond was excavated by manual labour {{as part of}} an unemployment relief scheme. It was located {{to the north of the}} Hollow Pond, close to the junction of Lea Bridge Road and Snaresbrook Road. It was locally known as [...] "the Batho", but it became notorious for being muddy and unhygienic. In 1923, the borough councils of Leyton and Walthamstow jointly agreed to fund its improvement, and in May 1932, a new lido or open-air swimming pool was opened by the Lord Mayor of London. At a cost of £6,000, it was an irregular oval shape with a 100 yd straight section for racing; a paved surround and changing rooms were built and the pool was fed by an underground spring. However, the new lido was closed in the following September, after a water sample had shown it to be [...] "unfit for bathing purposes". After another rebuilding, including <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> pool with concrete and the installation of a chlorination plant, Whipps Cross Lido reopened in 1937. It was a very large pool, 300 ft long by 130 ft wide, with a connected circular diving pool 30 ft deep. By 1981, attendances had fallen to 20,000 per annum and the decision was taken to close the lido on 4 September 1982. By December 1983, the site had been levelled and returned to forest land; only part of the access road remains.|$|R
40|$|De engelse versie heeft rapportnummer 710401021 Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{document}} {{contains a}} critical risk-evaluation of Radon to humans and the environment. Radon is an inert gas {{of which the}} main risk is induction of lung cancer. Considering {{the nature of its}} effects and its presence only the by-products of Rn- 222 are important for man in the indoor environment. In the indoor environment the average Rn- 222 concentration is about 10 times higher than in the outdoor air. The average exposure to Radon in the Netherlands results in an estimated risk of 60 cases of fatal lung cancer per million people per year, of which 80 % as a result of Rn- 222 and 20 % as a result of Rn- 200. This risk is partly present by nature (the emission is determined by the soil for about 95 %) and is therefore not always controlable. Without taking measures the risk will increase as a result of building new houses. By taking measures in all houses that will be built in future (increased ventilation of crawl space, <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor)</b> an annual decrease of the average individual risk of o. 6 % seems attainable. The spread of the exposure level is large and restriction of the individual risks can only be reached by organizing the problems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{function}} of an organ relies on its form, {{which in turn}} depends on the individual shapes of the cells that create it and the interactions between them. Despite remarkable progress {{in the field of}} developmental biology, how cells collaborate to make a tissue remains an unsolved mystery. To investigate the mechanisms that determine organ structure, we are studying the cells that form the dorsal appendages (DAs) of the Drosophila melanogaster eggshell. These cells consist of two differentially patterned subtypes: roof cells, which form the outward-facing roof of <b>the</b> lumen, and <b>floor</b> cells, which dive underneath the roof cells to <b>seal</b> off <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> tube. In this paper, we present three lines of evidence that reveal a further stratification of the DA-forming epithelium. Laser ablation of only a few cells in the anterior of the region causes a disproportionately severe shortening of the appendage. Genetic alteration through the twin peaks allele of tramtrack 69 (ttktwk), a female-sterile mutation that leads to severely shortened DAs, causes no such shortening when removed from a majority of the DA-forming cells, but rather, produces short appendages only when removed from cells in the very anterior of the tube-forming tissue. Additionally we show that heterotrimeric G-protein function is required for DA morphogenesis. Like TTK 69, Gβ 13 F is not required in all DA-forming follicle cells but only in <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and leading roof cells. The different phenotypes that result from removal of Gβ 13 F from each region demonstrate a striking division of function between different DA-forming cells. Gβ mutant floor cells are unable to control the width of the appendage while Gβ mutant leading roof cells fail to direct the elongation of the appendage and the convergent-extension of the roof-cell population...|$|R
