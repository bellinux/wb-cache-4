40|$|Tissue Transglutaminase (TG 2) and FXIIIa, {{members of}} the {{transglutaminase}} (TG) family, catalyses a transamidating reaction and form covalent bond between or within proteins. In bone development, both enzymes expressions correlate with the initial of the mineralisation process by osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Exogenous TG 2 also promotes maturation of chondrocytes and mineralisation in pre-osteoblasts. To understand the role of endogenous TG 2 in osteoblast mineralisation, the TG 2 expression was examined during the human osteoblast (HOB) mineralisation. The expression of the endogenous TG 2 increased during the mineralisation, yet, its expression was not essential for mineral deposition due to the compensation effect by other members in the TG family. The extracellular transamidating activity of HOBs was found increased during mineralisation and a shift from FXIIIa dominant- to TG 2 -dominant crosslinking activity was suggested after differentiation. However, the transamidating activity of both TG 2 and FXIIIa were not critical for cell mineralisation. On the other hand, Exogenous TG 2 was found to enhance wild <b>type</b> <b>HOB</b> and TG 2 knockdown HOB mineral deposition. The transamidating activity of TG 2 was not required but most likely a close conformation was essential for this enhancement. Results also demonstrated that exogenous TG 2 may activate the ß-catenin pathway through LRP 5 receptor thus contribute in cell mineralisation. This enhancement could be abolished by addition of ß-catenin inhibitors. Finally, using of TG 2 crosslinked collagen gel for bone and cornea repair was evaluated. Crosslinked collagen gel showed promising results in improving HOB mineralisation, human corneal fibroblast (hCF) proliferation and migration. These effects might be resulted from the trapped TG 2 within the collagen matrix and the alteration of matrix topography by TG 2...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{gear hobbing}} are driven to give higher cutting speeds, longer tool life and higher feed rates. Recently, a new <b>type</b> of <b>hob</b> with carbide inserts has been {{introduced}} with benefits in all these conditions compared to regrindable high speed steel hobs. However, {{with this kind of}} hob, new challenges occur due to positional errors of the cutting edges when mounted on the tool. These errors introduce manufacturing errors on the gear teeth which have to be controlled. In this paper, the tooth quality of a gear manufactured by hobs with different quality classes is analysed using a simulation model in combination with Monte-Carlo methods. A statistical analysis of a commercial hob provides input to the Monte-Carlo model, where the axial and the radial deviations of these inserts are considered. Simulations are performed with different hob quality classes according to DIN 3968. The results from simulation are compared with experimental results of this actual hob at a gear manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{investigate}} the influence of decompression cavity on the cold hobbing processes. Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, the rigid-plastic finite element method {{would be used to}} analyze the influence of billets with different decompression cavity on cold hobbing processes. Findings: There must be an optimal shape of decompression cavity which requires the minimum hobbing load, but achieves the optimal profile precision and strengthened results needed in formed workpiece. Research limitations/implications: There were four different designs in billet. One was a cylinder without decompression cavity, and the others were the cylinders with truncate-cone, point-cone and semispherical decompression cavity respectively, with different shapes but almost the same volumes. Practical implications: Through the simulation analysis, the influence of decompression cavity with the same volumes but different shapes on the load needed in process, the change of workpiece features, and the strengthened effects on workpieces in both open type and closed <b>type</b> cold <b>hobbing</b> processes, would be explored.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goals of this research were {{to gain a better understanding}} of the performance of ring-shank (annularly threaded) nails in lateral connections common to the post-frame industry, and to evaluate the European yield model (EYM), the basis for derivation of allowable design values, for ring-shank nails. Inputs to the EYM include nail bending yield strength, dowel bearing strength, and connection geometry. These parameters as well as single-shear connection strength were determined for nine nail groups tested in Southern Pine lumber. Nail specimens included three suppliers, two <b>shank</b> <b>types</b> (smooth and ringshank), two diameters (3. 76 and 4. 50 mm), and two coatings (galvanized and ungalvanized). Ring-shank nails averaged 85 % higher nail bending yield strength than the common nails for all but two groups. A regression model relating dowel bearing strength to specific gravity was developed based on tests with the nine nail groups loaded parallel-to-grain in Southern Pine. A statistically significant reduction in dowel bearing strength was observed for 4. 50 compared to 3. 76 mm diameter nails. While ring-shank nail connection maximum loads were roughly twice that of common nails for the same diameter, no significant differences were observed for yield loads. The current yield load definition is based on the slope of the initial portion of the load-displacement curve and does not adequately account for increases in connection strength resulting from higher steel quality. As a result, predicted yield loads based on the EYM were significantly higher than observed yield loads. A revised yield load definition is needed which includes yielding predicted by the EYM without including factors extraneous to the model. Ring-shank nails exhibited significantly higher lateral connection strengths than the common nails tested as a result of increased steel strength and gripping action of the threads. Finally, standardization in ringshank nail manufacturing must be instituted to ensure minimum steel and thread quality, before any increase in design values for ring-shank nails is implemented...|$|R

40|$|By {{comparison}} {{with those in}} industry, domestic cooking processes are rarely studied with respect to heat transfer although they can drastically modify the quality of heated products. In order to compensate for this lack of information in the literature, {{the aim of this}} work was to propose test procedures to evaluate the variability of domestic appliance heating performances in the case of oven-baking and pan-frying. The measurements included the continuous recording of pan temperature during pan-frying using different <b>types</b> of <b>hobs</b> (electric, halogen, gas, induction) and pans; the continuous recording of air temperature and measurement of the convective heat transfer coefficient and equivalent radiative temperature during oven-baking using different types of ovens. The results revealed broad variations in heating conditions {{depending on the type of}} appliance used and on consumer behaviour. For pan-frying, it was shown that pan temperature varied constantly during heating. From an initial value of 200 degrees C and a given product load, it could fall to 150 degrees C or rise to 330 degrees C at medium or high heat, respectively. For oven-baking, heating was sometimes performed at an actual air temperature that differed considerably from the air temperature set on the oven. These measurements also showed relatively low convective heat transfer coefficient values, ranging from 6 W/m(2) K under free convection to 16 W/m(2) K under forced convection...|$|R

O desempenho da semeadora-adubadora está diretamente ligado aos mecanismos de contato com o solo, mais especificamente, as hastes sulcadoras. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a mobilização do solo, o desempenho operacional e o desenvolvimento da cultura do milho, quando semeado com dois tipos de hastes sulcadoras em três profundidades de semeadura. O experimento foi conduzido no ano agrícola de 2011 / 12 em área experimental da Fazenda de Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão da UNESP/Jaboticabal em LATOSSOLO VERMELHO Eutroférrico típico. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos casualizados, esquema fatorial 2 x 3, com quatro repetições. As variáveis analisadas foram: área mobilizada, desempenho operacional e características agronômicas da cultura. A área mobilizada houve significância para os fatores haste e profundidade. O comportamento distinto das hastes é devido a seus parâmetros construtivos, sendo fator limitante para profundidade de trabalho, pois, determina o volume de solo mobilizado. No desempenho operacional do conjunto trator semeadora-adubadora houve diferença tanto para haste como profundidade. Desta forma opta-se pela haste que teve uma maior mobilização do solo e exigiu menor força e potência na barra de tração, trabalhando a menor profundidade desde que o solo esteja em condições adequadas de semeadura, um vez que não houve diferença na produtividade final de grãosThe no-tillage {{system is}} a set of techniques that combine natural resources preservation combined with minimum soil tillage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic emission transferability method in applications of valve leakage rate detection and tool wear monitoring. The method aims {{to transfer the}} information between AE inspection systems using different types of sensor and position by relationship which was called a transfer function. The spectrum density function/AErms spectra of both wide band (WD) and resonance (R 15 and R 30) AE sensors were studied. The results demonstrate a very good similarity transfer function in various conditions. Three sets of cutting condition of tool wear monitoring in machining tests were conducted. A tool <b>shank</b> of <b>type</b> SDJCL 1616 H 11 and carbide tool inserts of type CG 4035 DCMT 11 T 3 04 -UF (Sandvik Coromant) were used. Two AE sensors were mounted on the tool-holder: a WD sensor (PAC) {{at the end of}} the tool-holder and an R 30 sensor (PAC) on the side. For valve leakage rate detection, artificial leaks from incomplete closure of ball valve are used to simulate the leakage. The tests were conduced by varying inlet pressure from 1 to 5 bars in three valve sizes of 1, 2 and 3 inches respectively. The AE signals detected at the two sensors (WD and R 15) were analyzed in real-time using a Hewlett Packard HP 89410 A. Transfer functions of two AE sensors are calculated and represented by the ratio of frequency responses of the two sensors. This is particularly useful since the information obtained from one sensor may be converted into another without having to repeat the experiments. With the proposed acoustic transferability, it will be possible to make comparison between results obtained from different set-ups...|$|R
