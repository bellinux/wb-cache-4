The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E

5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, theatre {{director}} Peter Sellars {{released his}} only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film {{loosely based on}} Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> few similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released.|$|E

5|$|Lundy island {{lies on the}} {{borderline}} where the North Atlantic Ocean and the Bristol Channel meet, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> quite a mild climate. Lundy has cool, wet winters and mild, wet summers. It is often windy. Fog is a continual experience. The record high temperature is 28.8°C (83.8°F) on 2 August 1990, and the record low temperature is -4.5°C (23.9°F) recorded just six months later on 7 February 1991.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} {{from the collection of}} William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{only one}} electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move {{so quickly that}} its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E
5|$|When eating snails, this rail will hammer at {{the shells}} to extract them. For berries, it will jump high {{to break off}} {{clusters}} of this fruit. After doing this, it will pick off the berries {{one by one and}} eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E

5000|$|The Bär {{was only}} {{designed}} {{on paper and}} did not reach prototype stage. The concept {{was to make a}} formidable Assault gun/or self propelled gun. Its specifications were very much likethat of the Sturmtiger, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> may <b>have</b> been used in that role. The running gear was to be taken from the Tiger tank, but rather than using torsion bar for suspension, <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> used leaf springs.The gun was very large, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> limited or no traverse, however, it could elevate.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but {{the theatre}} {{was forced to}} pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was {{organized}} by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections {{to the content of}} Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; with Thompson concluding it was a box office success and Pratt concluding it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.|$|E
