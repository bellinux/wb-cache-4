5|$|The poetic {{versions}} of the story allude to additional matter within the tradition of Mac Da Thó's pig, including the names of Mac Da Thó's wife Maine Athrai, of his two sons, and of his grandson Léna. According to these accounts, Léna first found the pig in Slieve Bloom, and was responsible for its nourishment until it had seven inches of fat on its snout. Maine Athrai needed the pig for her husband's great feast; Léna refused, but he was killed when the pig grubbed up earth with its snout, burying him alive in his sleep. In {{this version of the}} tale, which <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> may have been omitted from the narrow version of the saga, Mac Da Thó's swineherd Follscaide dutifully delivers the pig to his master's feast.|$|E

25|$|Elsa {{arrives in}} Storybrooke, {{hoping to find}} her sister Anna. However, things get {{complicated}} {{with the appearance of}} the Snow Queen, who seems to know both Elsa and Emma. The Snow Queen is later revealed to Elsa's aunt and one of Emma's foster mothers; she plans on making them her new sisters, despite their obvious hatred of her. The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she was loved. Seeing she let herself become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same time, Mr. Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give them happy endings. Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite. Allying with the Author, Mr. Gold traps everyone in a new story called Heroes and Villains, where the roles are reversed. Henry frees everyone, becoming the new Author in the process. Things get worse as the darkness in Gold escapes, being revealed to be the true Dark One. To save Regina from becoming possessed by it, Emma forces the Darkness to take her instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man Legends 2 is {{very similar}} to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> energy is consumed when the weapon is used.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

[...] Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was surprised by the}} wedding twist, particularly by {{the fact that}} the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a [...] "TV-style complication". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip". Meslow said the episode [...] "couldn't have been better" [...] and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it.

500|$|Hall of Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 14 reviews. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly positively compared the album {{to the late}} 90's releases by Bad Boy and said that Big Sean easily outshines all the featured artists on the album. At USA Today, Edna Gunderson called this, an [...] "outstanding second album" [...] that he [...] "occasionally stumbles" [...] in an effort that is a [...] "smart set of slick club thumpers, tear-jerkers and introspective yarns." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented saying, [...] "The Detroit MC gets over on congeniality and crisp delivery, even when his lyrics are pro forma." [...] He also praised the album's production. At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff noted that [...] "Hall of Fame is still a solid, confident and diverse set that <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he's grown as both an MC and a writer since 'Finally Famous' came out in 2011." [...] Andrea Aguilar of HipHopDX summarized the album stating, [...] "As a whole, the feel-good album's set of eclectic beats doesn't disappoint, but it lacks diversity. Most of Sean's content still teems with predictable material risking leaving listeners disinterested. Random skits also slightly interrupt {{the flow of the}} album, but if you're looking for motivational music centered on the money, the cars, the clothes and hoes, this album is sure to get plenty of replays on your iPod and local radio stations alike." ...|$|E

2500|$|The mass-energy {{relation}} {{can be used}} to predict how much energy will be released or consumed by nuclear reactions; one simply measures the mass of all constituents and the mass of all the products and multiplies {{the difference between the two}} by [...] The result <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> energy will be released or consumed, usually in the form of light or heat. When applied to certain nuclear reactions, the equation shows that an extraordinarily large amount of energy will be released, much larger than in the combustion of chemical explosives, where the mass difference is hardly measurable at all. This explains why nuclear weapons produce such phenomenal amounts of energy, as they release binding energy during nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, and also convert a much larger portion of subatomic mass to energy.|$|E

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: [...] "The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice {{did not exist in}} English at all; it was only to be found in French."

2500|$|As a songwriter, Gibb contributed {{primarily}} to melody, {{with his brothers}} writing the lyrics that they would sing on the finished song (for the most part). It is difficult to identify his contributions because the songs were so shaped to the singer, but his brothers' continued writing collaboration with him on solo projects <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they relied on him. He was sometimes known as [...] "the quiet one" [...] for his less obvious contributions to the group, but privately {{he was a good}} teller of stories, who immensely enjoyed talking with fans. His reputation as a mild-mannered, stabilising influence with two very ambitious brothers continued through his life.

2500|$|The {{romance of}} his life was his {{connection}} with Léonie Léon, the full details of which were not known to the public till her death in 1906. She {{was the daughter of}} a creole French artillery officer. Gambetta {{fell in love with her}} in 1871. [...] She became his mistress, and the liaison lasted until he died. Gambetta constantly urged her to marry him during this period, but she always refused, fearing to compromise his career; she remained, however, his confidante and intimate adviser in all his political plans. It seems she had just consented to become his wife, and the date of the marriage had been fixed, when the accident which caused his death occurred in her presence. Contradictory accounts of this fatal episode exist, but it was certainly accidental, and not suicide. Her influence on Gambetta was absorbing, both as lover and as politician, and the correspondence which has been published <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he depended upon her.|$|E

2500|$|Marriage {{played a}} large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, [...] "To My Dear And Loving Husband," [...] she reveals that she is one with her husband. [...] "If ever two were one, then surely we." [...] The Puritans {{believed}} that since marriage is ordained by God, then it is a gift from God. [...] She loves her gift so much that through the use of her poetry, she is able to express her love for God's gift to her husband. In another of Bradstreet's works, [...] "Before the Birth of One of Her Children", Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage. In the lines, [...] "And if I see not half my days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you;" [...] Bradstreet is saying that if she was to die soon, what would God give her husband. She could be referring to him possibly remarrying after she dies. [...] Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, [...] "These O protect from stepdame's injury", Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future step mother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband with a new wife if she dies <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Puritan women believed in marriage and how God provided them with this gift.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day.
