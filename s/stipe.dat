5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes are readily {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow <b>stipe</b> base, and reddish scabers on the <b>stipe.</b> Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow <b>stipe</b> base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its <b>stipe</b> scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow <b>stipe</b> base.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red <b>stipe,</b> is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red <b>stipe.</b> It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the <b>stipe.</b> Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish <b>stipe.</b> Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate <b>stipe,</b> and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of nutrients, polyphenols and antioxidant activities between the pilei (caps) and <b>stipes</b> (stalks) of three commonly consumed edible mushrooms in Nigeria namely: Termitomyces robustus [pilei (TRC) and <b>stipes</b> (TRS) ], Coprinus sp [pilei (CSC) and <b>stipes</b> (CSS) ] and Volvariella esculenta [pilei (VEC) and <b>stipes</b> (VES) ] were evaluated. The pilei were {{separated from the}} <b>stipes</b> and their proximate composition was determined. Thereafter, their antioxidant properties as typified by their total phenol content, reducing power, DPPH free radical scavenging ability and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in vitro were determined. The pilei of the mushrooms had significantly higher (p 0. 05) exists between the total phenol content of the pilei [VEC (2. 1 mg/g), TRC (2. 5 mg/g), CSC (2. 3 mg/g) ] and the <b>stipes</b> [VES (2. 0 mg/g), TRS (2. 3 mg/g), CSS (1. 8 mg/g) ]. Nevertheless, polyphenol extracts from the <b>stipes</b> had a significantly (p 0. 05) exists in the inhibitory effect of the polyphenols at higher concentrations. Therefore, pilei of the mushrooms had more protein, ash and fat content; while {{there was no significant}} difference in the polyphenol distribution between the pilei and stipes; conversely the polyphenols from the <b>stipes</b> had higher antioxidant activity (except inhibition of lipid peroxidation) than that of the pilei...|$|R

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its <b>stipe</b> thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia <b>stipe</b> over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the <b>stipe</b> is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler <b>stipe</b> covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the <b>stipe</b> base.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} <b>stipe</b> but then, close to the <b>stipe,</b> the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the <b>stipe,</b> and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the <b>stipe).</b>|$|E

5|$|Linda Hopper—a {{native of}} Marietta, Georgia—was {{a member of}} the late 1970s/early 1980s music scene in Athens, Georgia, where she befriended fellow University of Georgia student Michael <b>Stipe</b> in an art design class. <b>Stipe</b> went on to form R.E.M. and Hopper joined him in the {{experimental}} music group Tanzplagen along with Stipe's sister, Lynda, and other local musicians. After the group folded, <b>Stipe</b> and Hopper formed Oh-OK, whose line-up later included Matthew Sweet and David McNair. That project ended in 1984 and Hopper briefly belonged to a Washington, D.C. band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} {{of the nature of}} the foundation for the cross used to crucify Jesus, is related to whether Jesus carried only the patibulum or the full cross (patibulum and <b>stipes)</b> to Golgotha - as to whether the upright <b>stipes</b> was a permanent fixture on Golgotha, or whether there was a permanent, or specially prepared reinforced hole for the base of the <b>stipes.</b> This also relates to the height of the cross, where estimates vary from [...] to [...] in height.|$|R
2500|$|Situated {{beneath the}} mandibles, paired maxillae {{manipulate}} food during mastication. Maxillae can have hairs and [...] "teeth" [...] along their inner margins. At the outer margin, the galea is a cupped or scoop-like structure, which sits over {{the outer edge}} of the labium. They also have palps, which are used to sense the characteristics of potential foods. The maxillae occupy a lateral position, one on each side of the head behind the mandibles. The proximal part of the maxilla consists of a basal cardo, which has a single articulation with the head, and a flat plate, the <b>stipes,</b> hinged to the cardo. Both cardo and <b>stipes</b> are loosely joined to the head by membrane so they are capable of movement. Distally on the <b>stipes</b> are two lobes, an inner lacinea and an outer galea, one or both of which may be absent. More laterally on the <b>stipes</b> is a jointed, leglike palp made up of a number of segments; in Orthoptera there are five. Anterior and posterior rotator muscles are inserted on the cardo, and ventral adductor muscles arising on the tentorium are inserted on both cardo and <b>stipes.</b> Arising in the <b>stipes</b> are flexor muscles of lacinea and galea and another lacineal flexor arises in the cranium, but neither the lacinea nor the galea has an extensor muscle. The palp has levator and depressor muscles arising in the <b>stipes,</b> and each segment of the palp has a single muscle causing flexion of the next segment.|$|R

5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer <b>stipe,</b> and distinct raised granules on the <b>stipe.</b> S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the <b>stipe.</b>|$|E
5|$|The caps {{form from}} the top of the short <b>stipe</b> by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface.

5|$|Two eastern North American species, C.inedulis and C.roseipes, {{also have}} an {{appearance}} similar to C.calopus. C.inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while C.roseipes associates solely with hemlock.

40|$|Water {{motion is}} one of the main drivers in {{morphological}} variability in species within de order Laminariales, and most of our current knowledge is based on subtidal populations. Eisenia arborea is a dominant kelp species in the North Pacific, widely distributed along the Baja California Peninsula from mid intertidal down to subtidal areas. This species presents great variability in the intertidal zone but it has not been yet evaluated such variability according to wave exposure. The present work also identifies the spatial / temporal variation, particularly respect to the presence of <b>stipes</b> without medulla (hollow <b>stipes)</b> a feature common among other brown seaweeds. We evaluated the effects of wave action in morphological variation of intertidal Eisenia arborea (Laminariales, Ochrophyta) at Punta Eugenia. The spatial and temporal variation sampling was surveyed between February, May, July, and August 2004 in the intertidal of Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur. Our results have shown that exposed sites correlate with increased length and width of <b>stipes</b> as compared to more protected sites. Hollow <b>stipes</b> frequency changed more in association with temporal variation than with spatial heterogeneity suggesting nutrient limitation for thalli development. Our results suggest that Eisenia arborea compensate by morphological modifications the stress of living in the intertidal zone by showing larger <b>stipes.</b> Hollow <b>stipes</b> might be are also a mechanical adaptation to increase survival in high energy environments...|$|R
