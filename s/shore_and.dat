5|$|Inshore {{lifeboats}} (ILBs) {{are smaller}} boats that operate {{closer to the}} <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> in shallower waters than ALBs. There are two classes, inflatables and RIBs capable of 25–40 knots. The RNLI's Inshore Lifeboat Centre at Cowes, Isle of Wight, has been building lifeboats since the 1960s and by 2015 had produced over 1,600.|$|E

The Pennsylvania Railroad leased the Erie and Pittsburgh for 999years in 1870. On March5, 1902, nearly 10,000people turned out at Union Depot to greet Prince Henry of Prussia during his {{tour of the}} United States; the prince {{remained}} in Erie for approximately 10minutes before his train continued to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York.

5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|After {{waiting for}} the wind, Endeavour resumed her voyage on the {{afternoon}} of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. Cook christened his landing place Possession Island, and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> Endeavours deck marked the occasion.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast {{on a number of}} occasions to witness storms breaking on the <b>shore,</b> <b>and</b> a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.|$|E

He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake <b>Shore</b> <b>and</b> Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land.

Drainage from the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these water systems are ephemeral.|$|E
