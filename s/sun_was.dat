5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious.

Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> rising.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent.

5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{properties}} of a rocky planet’s host star {{may be associated}} with the origin of life and the evolution of observers on that planet. By comparing the Sun to other stars in our Galaxy, {{we may be able to}} identify such properties. If our <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a typical star, stellar conditions appropriate for life, and life itself, may be common in the Universe. On the other hand, if the <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> atypical or even unique, then the life orbiting the <b>Sun</b> may also <b>be</b> atypical or unique. Here we present the comparison between the Sun and stars for three important parameters that {{may be associated with}} the origin and evolution of life. We find that: i) The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more massive than 95 ± 2 % of nearby stars. ii) The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> younger than 53 ± 2 % of stars in the Galactic disk. iii) The <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more metal rich than 65 ± 2 % of nearby stars. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{scholars}} {{say that when}} the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> eclipsed, the moon covers it. The <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> further away (lit. above) but the moon being nearer (lit. below), then the moon could not cover the sun. But since the opposite <b>is</b> true, the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> obstructed, its light is covered by that of the moon, and therefore a solar eclipse is caused. Just as, in gloomy weather, neither sun nor moon can be seen. When the edges contact, the two consume each other; when the two are concentric they face each other exactly covered and the <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> nearly extinguished. That the <b>sun</b> and moon <b>are</b> in conjunction at times of new moon is simply one of the regulatories of the heavens.|$|R
