40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of a proof-of-concept measurement instrument to satisfy the requirements of the University of Cape Town's Load Research Group. The new instrument needed to make use of current technologies to cost-effectively measure multiple residential households and provide remote communications capabilities for reliable remote data retrieval. Measurement of three-phase 4 -wire configurations was necessary as well as the ability to create second-based profiles of consumer voltage, current and active, reactive and apparent powers for load identification purposes. The main components of a measurement system were identified and prototype development was split into two stages: component integration testing and final product integration. The product was called the Power Profiler and two early prototypes were developed to test the main measurement and processing components and mechanical integration to create a compact versatile test instrument. Energy measurement ICs were used instead of discrete sampling of voltage and current to improve accuracy and allow the use of a low- cost and easy to program digital signal controller for measurement processing and storage. Several communication options were incorporated into the Power Profiler including remote GSM and local USB and Bluetooth communication. The third prototype was subjected to full calibration testing with a Chauvin Arnoux power quality analyzer used as the reference meter. The Power Profiler proved to be a high accuracy instrument with a typical inaccuracy of 0. 4 % for RMS voltage (over a 20 : 1 range), 0 % for RMS current, 1. 1 % for active power, 0. 3 % for reactive power and 0. 1 % apparent power versus the reference meter. To validate the Power Profiler measurement functionality it was connected to a residential household in conjunction with the reference meter and 4 hours of measurement data was captured for comparison. After a successful validation the Power Profiler was then left to capture another 43 hours of measurement data using a 5 -second, 10 -minute and 2 -hour measurement profile. This data was then analyzed to see if non-intrusive load discrimination could be performed. From the measurement and validation data several common household appliances were identified including the refrigerator, geyser, kettle, microwave and washing machine. The Power Profiler stores not only the average values measured between recording intervals but the maximum and minimum levels as well. This data proved very valuable for the detection of voltage dips and swells that would otherwise have gone unreported by a conventional power meter. The maximum statistic also effectively showed the <b>startup</b> <b>current</b> of motor-based appliances such as the refrigerator and washing machine which greatly assisted with load discrimination. The embedded software for the Power Profiler was split into several software tasks to simplify code maintenance and future development. A C# PC Control and Configuration application was developed to automate calibration as far as possible, and to allow an operator to configure and upload measurement data from the Power Profiler. Extensive use of object-oriented programming techniques was made to allow the reuse of the interface and control software in future applications by other developers. Remote communications capabilities were demonstrated over GSM GPRS connections to allow the retrieval of measurement data from field-deployed Power Profilers. The ability of the Power Profiler to simultaneously record second-, minute- and hour-based profiles and to allow the operator to decide which of this measured data to upload is highly effective in managing remote communication bandwidth and reducing overall operating cost of the system. The Power Profiler product proved to be a cost-effective replacement to the currently used logger and offered more channels with higher resolution measurement and profiling capabilities in a compact instrument. Remote communication capabilities reduces the overall operating cost of the system and simplified measurement retrieval. The ability to easily custom-develop software for both the Power Profiler and PC-based applications made it a flexible instrument valuable for research-orientated applications...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the bearing pedestals and motor base. As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a polar inertia in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete amortisseur. On <b>startup,</b> <b>currents</b> are induced in the rotor pole face, which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the rotor pole face will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The McTronX {{research}} group, at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North–West University, has been researching Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). A fully suspended, flywheel energy storage system (FESS) has been developed. Due to excessive unbalance on the rotor, the motor drive could not be tested up to its rated speed. In the interim, until the rotor can be balanced and other rotor dynamic effects have been investigated, the group decided that the existing drive control should be improved and tested on a high–speed permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), using normal roller element bearings. In order to test the motor control a second (identical) PMSM, mechanically coupled to the former, operates in generator mode which serves as the torque load. Two different control algorithms, namely V/f and vector control, are designed and implemented on a rapid control prototyping system, i. e. dSPACE®. The V/f control is an open–loop, position sensorless technique, whilst the vector controller makes use of a position sensor. From the design and implementation {{it became clear that}} the vector control is more robust, in the sense that it is less sensitive on parameter variations and disturbances. It can start up reliably even under full load conditions. The V/f control is an attractive alternative to the vector control, especially in AMB systems, where it may be difficult to mount the position sensor, has to operate in a hazardous environment not suited to the sensor or could degrade the reliability of the AMB system. The cost of the position sensor is not really a concern compared to the cost of an AMB system. The V/f control is more suited to fan and pump applications, which has a low dynamic requirement. The V/f control has high <b>startup</b> <b>currents</b> and is not recommended for applications requiring a high starting torque or fast acceleration during operation. The inverter, which drives the PMSM, also had to be developed. With regard to the motor control, the effects of inverter non–idealities had to be accounted, especially for the V/f control. The implemented control algorithms were tested up to 20 krpm. Discrepancies between the expected and actual results are discussed. Overall, the controllers performed as desired. Generally, the project goals have been reached satisfactorily. Master...|$|R

40|$|Operation of a {{three-phase}} {{induction machine}} on single-phase supply {{has been an}} approach used for electromechanical energy conversion in rural communities with limited or no access to three-phase grid. Such single-phase to threephase conversion {{can be achieved by}} passive and active means. In passive methods, fixed capacitors are used for starting and running the motor. Single-phase to three-phase conversion with reduced switch count is desirable, as this leads to a lower cost. However, it is a challenge to start an induction motor using such a power converter and to maintain balanced three-phase voltage under all loading conditions. In this work, unbalance in the motor terminal voltage with variable capacitor emulation method is analyzed quantitatively. This is used to show that perfect balance can not be achieved under all loading conditions.
