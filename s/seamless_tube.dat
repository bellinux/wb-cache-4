On the basis of mean value staged KELM-PLS prediction model, the minimum piercing energy consumption and maximum piercing efficiency are calculated by genetic optimization algorithm.

40|$|SummaryMost tubes have seams (intercellular or autocellular {{junctions}} that seal membranes {{together into}} a tube), but “seamless” tubes also exist [1 – 3]. In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells make seamless tubes, with single branches running through each of dozens of cellular extensions. We find that mutations in braided impair terminal cell branching and cause formation of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cysts. We show that braided encodes Syntaxin 7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab 5, Vps 45, and Rabenosyn- 5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cyst formation and restored terminal branching. We propose that early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moe, which in turn regulates <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> shape through modulation of cortical actin filaments...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of modernization, the application of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> becomes widespread. As the first process of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube,</b> piercing is vital {{for the quality of}} the tube. The solid round billet will be transformed into a hollow shell after the piercing process. The defects of hollow shell cannot be cleared in the following process, so a monitoring model for the quality of the hollow shell is important. But the piercing process is very complicated, and a mechanism model is difficult to build between the qualities of the hollow shell and measurement variables. Furthermore, an intelligent model is needed. We established two piercing process monitoring and fault diagnosis models based on the multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) model and the multistage MPCA model, respectively, and furthermore we made a comparison between these two concepts. We took three ways to divide the period based on process, K-means, and GA, respectively. Simulation experiments have shown that the multistate MPCA method has advantage over the MPCA method and the model based on the genetic algorithm (GA) can monitor the process effectively and detect the faults...|$|E
