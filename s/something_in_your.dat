500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is a [...] "tender" [...] pop power ballad with {{contemporary}} R, soul and lite rock influences, performed {{in an urban}} contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are [...] "about following your heart to find your true self", which begin [...] "They'll try to hold you back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on." [...] A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single [...] "correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, [...] "There's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe {{and you know you}} must go", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "mellow"; Mýa performs it using a [...] "sweet vocal", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] encompasses [...] "soft, contemporary beats" [...] combined with the singer's [...] "dulcet tones" [...] that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as [...] "polished", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.|$|E
2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed {{to make me feel}} this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|General Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept {{a long-running}} {{correspondence}} through the years, {{some of which}} concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee. As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. [...] "After all the Hazards you have run," [...] Henry wrote, [...] "that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> way by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she {{received}} her answer {{in the form of a}} heavenly vision. As she described it:The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, [...] "GO TO KIOWA," [...] and my hands were lifted and thrown down and the words, [...] "I'LL STAND BY YOU." [...] The words, [...] "Go to Kiowa," [...] were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but [...] "I'll stand by you," [...] was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: [...] "Take <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them." ...|$|E
2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, {{and one of the things}} he decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but in the form of a single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E
