The location of subsurface voids, {{the estimation of}} their size and {{the evaluation of the}} overburden thickness are necessary to assess the risk of collapse. In this study, electrical resistivity <b>tomography</b> (ERT) and <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>tomography</b> data are integrated in a joint interpretation process for cavity location in the city of Rome. ERT is a well established and widely employed method for cavity detection. However, additional information provided by <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>tomography</b> is capable of eliminating some potential pitfalls in resistivity data interpretation. We propose that the structure of the cavities defined by ERT {{can be used as a}} base to optimize <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>tomography</b> investigations within the framework of a joint interpretation process. Data integration and the insertion of a priori information are key issues for reducing the uncertainties associated with the inversion process and for optimizing both acquisition procedures and computation time. Herein, the two geophysical methods are tested on both synthetic and real data and the integration of the results is found to be successful in detecting isolated cavities and in assessing their geometrical characteristics. The cavity location inferred by geophysical non-invasive methods has been subsequently confirmed by direct inspection...|$|R

The low-velocity zone associated with the source of the plume is north of Hawaii, showing that the plume is tilted to a certain degree, deflected toward the south by mantle flow.

Recent high-resolution local tomography indicates a possible lower-mantle plume and a pond of plume material is evidenced by a large low-velocity zone in the upper mantle. These low seismic velocity zones often indicate hotter and more buoyant mantle material. The low-velocity zone is flanked on both sides by high-velocity anomalies of variable amplitude. In the north, high-velocities may reflect the remains of batholithic roots that formed as a result of continuous subduction along the northern continental margin 150to 50million years ago. High velocities in the south represent the subducting Juan de Fuca slab. Centered near Nazko Cone, the low-velocity zone extends to a depth of approximately [...] However, it may extend deeper southward beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate through the transition zone into the lower mantle.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Seismic</b> ray <b>tomography</b> {{methods are}} usually {{associated}} with substantial computer processing time. The {{reason for this is}} that at each step of the iterative inversion process defined by the tomographic method the two-point ray tracing problem must be solved for each source-receiver pair. In order to resolve this, an Euclidean norm (L 2 vector norm), commonly used in error functions which are to be minimized in inversion procedures, is substituted by an L 1 integral norm, which enables the estimation of model parameters by minimizing the area between observed and calculated traveltime curves that are interpolated (or adjusted) to the data points. Relatively simple mathematical developments and numerical experiments with two-dimensional compressional seismic wave velocity field models show that L 1 integral norm saves an enormous amount of processing time with no significant loss of accuracy. Occasionally, parameters of the model can be better estimated using L 1 integral norm than the L 2 vector norm that is traditionally utilized in <b>seismic</b> inversion <b>tomography...</b>|$|R

This research work was carried out to compare the responses of <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>tomography</b> and resistivity tomography in the same geologic environment and under the same conditions. Hence, the choice of the site that has a visible granitic outcrop that extends across a narrow stream channel and is flanked by unconsolidated overburden, a neutral profile that was covered by plain overburden and a site with thick lateritic cover became necessary. The results of the <b>seismic</b> and resistivity <b>tomography</b> models reveals that seismic velocity and resistivity does not always simultaneously increase with depth, but their responses in any geologic environment are determined by changes in the mechanical and chemical content of the rock types rather than depth...|$|R

Just south of Victoria, British Columbia it intersects the west-striking Devils Mountain Fault (reviewed above), and either merges with it, or crosses (and possibly truncates) it to connect with the Leech River Fault.

40|$|<b>Seismic</b> {{reflection}} <b>tomography</b> is {{a method}} for determining a subsurface velocity model from the traveltimes of seismic waves reflecting on geological interfaces. From an opti-mization viewpoint, the problem consists in minimizing a nonlinear least-squares func-tion measuring the mismatch between observed traveltimes and those calculated by ray tracing in this model. The introduction of a priori information on the model is cru-cial to reduce the under-determination. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to introduce a technique able to take into account geological a priori information in the reflection tomography problem expressed as constraints in the optimization problem. This tech-nique is based on a Gauss-Newton sequential quadratic programming approach. At each Gauss-Newton step, a solution to a convex quadratic optimization problem sub-ject to linear constraints is computed thanks to an augmented Lagrangian algorithm. Our choice for this optimization method is motivated and its original aspects are de-scribed. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on a 2 D OBC real data set and on a 3 D real data set: the introduction of constraints coming both from well logs and from geological knowledge allows us to reduce the under-determination of both inverse problems.

2500|$|<b>Seismic</b> <b>tomography</b> is a {{technique}} that uses seismic waves produced by earthquakes to gather information on {{the composition of the}} crust and mantle below a volcanic system. Different layers and structures in the Earth have different propagation speeds of seismic waves and attenuate them differently, resulting in different arrival times and strengths of waves travelling in a certain direction. From various measurements 3D models of the geological structures can be inferred. Results of such research indicate that a highly hydrated slab derived from the Nazca Plate – a major source of melts in a collisional volcanism system – underlies the Western Cordillera. Below the Altiplano, low-velocity zones indicate the presence of large amounts of partial melts that correlate with volcanic zones south of 21° S, whereas north of 21° S thicker lithospheric layers may prevent the formation of melts. Next to the Eastern Cordillera, low-velocity zones extend farther north to 18.5° S. A thermally weakened zone, evidenced by strong attenuation, in the crust is associated with the APVC. This indicates the presence of melts in the crust. A layer of low velocity (shear speed of [...] ) [...] thick is assumed to host the APVC magma body. This body has a volume of about [...] Other seismological data indicate a partial delamination of the crust under the Puna, resulting in increased volcanic activity and terrain height.|$|E
