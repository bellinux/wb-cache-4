5|$|The High Middle Ages was {{a period}} of great {{religious}} movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage <b>sites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new <b>sites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence.|$|E
