Similarly, charge control allows the electric utility to postpone charging until the peak demand is over. Charge control is not as far reaching as V2G (a technology that allows the power company to buy energy back from a plug-in car) but is very effective because it is less expensive to implement than V2G.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Large-scale cyber-physical infrastructures, {{such as the}} <b>Smart</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Grid,</b> are envisioned as some of {{the core}} {{elements}} of the future Internet of Things. These critical infrastructures move more and more beyond centralized management and control by system operators and administrators. Overloading and failures in the <b>Smart</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Grid</b> threaten the matching of demand-supply especially when new emerging technologies are integrated such as micro-generation, renewable energy resources and electrical vehicles. The integration of these technologies in the <b>Smart</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Grid</b> make the concept of Internet of Things highly applicable in the energy domain. The introduction of automated and decentralized protection mechanisms requires embedded control elements that perform organizational reconfigurations themselves in a spatially distributed environment. The dynamic input and output binding between such control elements is an example of an organization reconfig-uration that is traditionally managed offline during the design phase of a cyber-physical system. An introduced computational intelligence for the purpose of such organizational control reconfigurations requires the interoperation {{with the rest of the}} control logic during runtime. This book chapter illustrates a model that makes this interoperation possible: ALSOS-ICS, the Application-level Self-Organization Services for Internet-scale Control Systems.

The key enabling factor of an efficient smart grid is its built-in information and communication technology (ICT) that monitors the real-time system operating state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks.

40|$|Large-scale {{decentralized}} systems {{organized in}} overlay networks are complex to manage. Such systems integrate organizational complexity in the application-level {{resulting in low}} abstraction and modularity in their services. This thesis introduces a multi-level conceptual architecture for overlay services. An overlay service is a large-scale decentralized system organized in overlay networks that provides generic application capabilities. Two overlay services introduced in this thesis provide a proof-of-concept for the higher abstraction and modularity {{that can be achieved}} with this architecture. The first overlay service builds and maintains overlay networks that are self-organized in different tree topologies according to different application criteria. The second overlay service performs a function-indepencent and routing-independent decentralized aggregation of values that are distributed in a network and continuously changing. Experimental evaluation studies the performance trade-offs imposed by this generic design.

40|$|Abstract—As {{a typical}} {{emerging}} application of cyber physical system, <b>smart</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> {{is composed of}} interdependent power grid and communication/control networks. The latter one contains relay nodes for communication and operation centers to control power grid. Failure in one network might cause failures in the other. Moreover, these failures may occur recursively between the two networks, leading to cascading failures. We propose a k-to-n interdependency model for smart grid. Each relay node and operation center is supported by only one power station, while each power station is monitored and controlled by k operation centers. Each operation center controls n power stations. We show that the system controlling cost is proportional to k. By calculating the fraction of functioning parts (survival ratio) using percolation theory and generating functions, we reveal the nonlinear relation between controlling cost and system robustness, and use graphic solution prove that a threshold exists for the proportion of faulty nodes, beyond which the system collapses. The extensive simulations validate our analysis, determine the percentage of survivals and the critical values for different system parameters. The mathematical and experimental results show that smart grid with higher controlling cost has a sharper transition, and thus is more robust. This is the first paper focusing on improving <b>smart</b> <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> robustness by changing monitoring strategies, from an interdependent complex networks perspective...|$|E
