40|$|In {{industrial}} assembly lines, seam sealing is {{a painting}} process used for making watertight seals or for preventing rusting. In the process, sealant is painted on seams {{located at the}} joints of pressed metal parts. We developed a sealing robot system that adjusts the <b>sealing</b> <b>gun</b> motion adaptively to the seam position sensed by a range sensor (a scanning laser rangefinder which senses profile range data). In this paper, we propose a high-speed and highly reliable algorithm for seam position computation from the sensed profile range data around the seam. It is proved experimentally that the sealing robot system used with the developed algorithm is very effective, especially for reducing wasted sealant. ...|$|E

60|$|Only {{when nothing}} stirred in the village, when {{the dogs and}} cats had been {{spirited}} away, and when not even a rat stole from under the houses to gnaw at a fishbone, would the fishermen know of their big silent visitors. Then the wolves would gather on a snow-drift just outside the village and raise a howl, a frightful wail of famine and disappointment, that made the air shudder. From within the houses the dogs answered with mad clamor. A door would open to show first a long <b>seal</b> <b>gun,</b> then a fisherman, then a fool dog that darted between the fisherman's legs and capered away, ki-yi-ing {{a challenge to the}} universe. A silence, tense as a bowstring; a sudden yelp--Hui-hui, as the fisherman whistled to the dog that was being whisked away over the snow with a grip on his throat that prevented any answer; then the fisherman would wait and call in vain, and shiver, {{and go back to the}} fire again.|$|R

25|$|As Coast Battleship No. 4, {{she became}} the first {{radio-controlled}} target ship to be used in a fleet exercise. At the Philadelphia Navy Yard, workers removed the ship's <b>guns,</b> <b>sealed</b> compartments, and installed water pumps to slow the sinking process and enable a longer target session. They also installed radio control gear, developed by the radio engineer John Hays Hammond Jr.|$|R
60|$|That {{same night}} the wolves {{appeared}} silently {{in the little}} lodge, far up the Southeast Brook, where in a sheltered hollow of the hills the fishermen's families were sleeping away the bitter winter. Here for one long night they watched and waited in vain; for every living thing was safe in the tilts behind barred doors. In the morning little Noel's eyes kindled as he saw the wolves' tracks; and {{when they came back}} again the tilts were watching. As the lop-eared cub darted after a cat that shot like a ray of moonlight under a cabin, a window opened noiselessly, and zing! a bowstring twanged its sharp warning in the tense silence. With a yelp the wolf tore the arrow from his shoulder. The warm blood followed the barb, and he lapped it eagerly in his hunger. Then, as the danger swept over him, he gave the trail cry and darted away. Doors banged open here and there; dogs barked to crack their throats; <b>seal</b> <b>guns</b> roared out and sent their heavy echoes crashing like thunder among the hills. Silence fell again over the lodge; and there were left only a few frightened dogs whose noses had already told them everything, a few fishermen who watched and listened, and one Indian boy with a long bow in his hand and an arrow ready on the string, who trailed away with a little girl at his side trying to puzzle out the track of one wolf that left a drop of blood here and there on the snow in the scant moonlight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discipline}} of heraldry {{has its roots}} in 11th century Europe, the same time that regulations emerged on the display of military <b>guns,</b> <b>seals</b> and feudal flags by empires and military coalitions. In present-day Albania, at the time known as the Principality of Arbanon, heraldry was practiced {{as a result of its}} contacts with European pilgrim armies that landed along its shores during the 11th century.|$|R
2500|$|Christmas and New Year's Day {{were spent}} tied {{up at the}} Destroyer Base in San Diego, {{awaiting}} more orders and passengers. They both came, and the ship headed for Guam on 11 January, and arrived on 26 January, debarking troops. After a very short stay in Guam, orders arrived {{for a return to}} San Francisco. There it was learned that Neshoba would be put out of active service on 13 March. With a new paint job, <b>sealing</b> of <b>guns,</b> compartments and everything ready for the storeroom, Neshoba, commonly known as the [...] "Mighty N", left Mare Island for Stockton, California. She was to be a [...] "mother ship" [...] for five other ships tied together.|$|R
50|$|The M1895 by contrast, has a {{mechanism}} which, as the hammer is cocked, first turns the cylinder and then moves it forward, {{closing the gap}} between the cylinder and the barrel. The cartridge, also unique, plays an important part in <b>sealing</b> the <b>gun</b> to the escape of propellant gases. The bullet is deeply seated, entirely within the cartridge case, and the case is slightly reduced in diameter at its mouth. The barrel features a short conical section at its rear; this accepts the mouth of the cartridge, completing the gas seal. By sealing the gap, the velocity of the bullet is increased by 15 to 45 m/s (50 to 150 ft/s.) This feature also eliminates the possibility of injury from gases escaping through the gap, which can damage a finger if the user holds the gun with a finger positioned beside the gap.|$|R
25|$|The shell's {{explosive}} {{was contained}} in two compartments, {{separated by a}} wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuses was mounted in the wall, with {{the other in the}} base of the shell. The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap – a highly unusual feature for the time – and the side had grooves that engaged with the rifling of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper driving bands provided a gas-tight <b>seal</b> against the <b>gun</b> barrel during firing.|$|R

50|$|In a game {{which the}} winner was almost {{guaranteed}} {{a spot in}} the top 25, the Huskies came up just short. After allowing the go-ahead field goal with 3:20 left in the game the Huskies began the assault upfield. After a solid return, and two consecutive 11-yard runs by quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, the Huskies made the first of 3 costly mistakes allowing a snap from the shotgun formation to go whizzing by Lorenzen for a 21-yard loss. This proved to be the pivotal point in the game as the Huskies were unable to advance the ball, and in fact, turned the ball over on another botched snap from the <b>gun,</b> <b>sealing</b> a 17-16 victory for the Hoos.|$|R
2500|$|Early in the Spitfire's {{operational}} life {{a major problem}} became apparent; at altitudes above about 15,000ft (4,572 m), any condensation could freeze in the guns.

50|$|Banner {{reveals that}} Gertrude was {{being forced to}} help Lockyear with his murder plot. Lockyear was a Communist agent, and Gertrude's {{mother and father were}} stuck in East Germany. Lockyear claimed he could get them out, but {{threatened}} to have them killed unless she helped him. Using a tape recorder, Lockyear recorded three minutes of silence, then fired three shots with the Tokarev, then recorded more silence. The day he killed Gosling, Lockyear arranged for the delivery of an envelope containing a toy gun to Gertrude's desk. He then went to the legation with a briefcase that had an identical empty envelope in it, and a silenced Tokarev. He stalled Gosling until a time as close to 11:30 as possible, then shot him and started the tape recording. Lockyear <b>sealed</b> the <b>gun</b> into the empty envelope. As Lockyear left, he put his briefcase on Gertrude's desk, holding the envelope against it. He picked the other envelope on Gertrude's desk up and replaced it with the envelope holding the real gun. After the shots on the tape recording were heard, when everyone was examining Gosling's body, Gertrude shut off the tape recorder. She had drawn the two circles to draw attention to a reel of recording tape. Lockyear killed her, thinking she had already destroyed the tape.|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the RAIL {{feasibility}} study, Operation Dorothe (March 1961) {{was conducted}} to determine if a liquid explosive could survive the acceleration of launch from a 155 mm howitzer. This operation was successful, although some structural difficulty was experienced with the test round (C- 90). Upon completion of that exercise, it was decided to design a test round that could be used with the more viscous slurry-type explosives, and to fire several of these new rounds with inert filler prior to their use with slurry High Explosives (H. E.), precluding the difficulty previously experienced. The C- 91 projectile, is a modified M 107 H. E. round. It has been reduced in weight, equipped with an obturator, and provided with a large fill orifice. The rotating band has been altered to eliminate rotation. Internally, a plastic plug is used to control column height. A piston-type `O` ring <b>seal</b> prevents <b>gun</b> gas from reaching the interior to the projectile. Four of these projectiles were fired from a 155 mm howitzer at 15, 500 g`s, plus. They survived not only the launch, but also impact and repeated ricochet in sand, gravel, and small rock. No leakage of the inert filler (glycerin) occurred. All rounds were destroyed with explosives upon completion of the exercise. Test data and engineering drawings are provided...|$|R
5000|$|According to Nebi Dervishi, {{the society}} somehow {{dates back to}} 1878 in Istambul. Dervishi {{explained}} that its <b>seal</b> contains a <b>gun</b> and dagger, {{with the name of}} the society on top, and number 18 and 78 (left and right), showing a connection with the League of Prizren period. The society got reorganized and got its real structure in 1909 in Monastir (today's Bitola in Macedona), in the same building which hosted the The Alphabet Congress. Monastir was a cradle of irredentist movements, not only Albanian ones. The main contributor was Themistokli Gërmenji. The later, had several trips to visit the Albanian colonies, and found great support especially in the colonies of Sofia and Bucharest. Other main members of this were Thoma Avrami, Nikolla Ivanaj, and Pandeli Cale. The statute of the society (Rregullore) was printed in a local print shop owned by the Qiriazi (Kyrias) family, and had 47 articles. The society established branches throughout the vilayets, in Korçë, Yannina, Gjirokastër, Vlorë, Filat, Delvinë, Përmet, Elbasan, Tiranë, Ohër, Strugë, Dibër, Shkup, Shkodër, as well as in diaspora. The branches used a similar seal, without the letter [...] "Q" [...] that was present in the Monastir's one for distincting the [...] "headquarters" [...] (Qendra). The intended name from the beginning was [...] "The Black Hand" [...] (Dora e Zezë), in resonance with other secret societies that carried similar name in Europe, but was shifted later for avoiding misunderstandings regarding the society's programme and activity. A correspondence of Fan Noli to one of the founders, Nikolla Ivanaj, shows Noli's disagreement with these naming convention which sounded to him like the Mano Nera. Despite the efforts of Ivanaj for changing the name to [...] "National Organization of Albania" [...] (Organizacionit Kombëtar të Shqipërisë), the name did not change due to objections from the branches.|$|R
