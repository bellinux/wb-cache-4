25|$|So, {{shortly after}} HealthCare.gov's launch, the {{problems}} {{still did not}} affect the legal requirement for Americans to have health insurance by December 15, which remained on the books as stated. However, on October 23, the effective legal deadline for applying for health insurance via HealthCare.gov without getting a penalty via the individual mandate was extended to March 31, 2014, possibly because of the problems with HealthCare.gov and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> healthcare exchanges (but without a de jure explanation as such given).|$|E
25|$|Whitlam's {{radical and}} {{imperious}} style eventually alienated many voters, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> governments were openly hostile to his government. As {{it did not}} control the senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. The Queensland Country Party government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen had particularly bad relations with the Federal government. Even after it was re-elected at elections in May 1974, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. At the only joint sitting of parliament, in August 1974, six keys pieces of legislation were passed.|$|E

The Department of Justice issued an official statement reporting that Supervising Undersecretary Francisco Baraan III and the Department of Justice Panel of Prosecutors handling the Maguindanao massacre case vehemently denied having received any bribes and expressing Justice Secretary Leila De Lima's full trust and confidence in, and continuing support for, Undersecretary Baraan and the Panel of Prosecutors.|$|E

25|$|Spain is organisationally {{structured}} as {{a so-called}} Estado de las Autonomías ("State of Autonomies"); {{it is one}} of the most decentralised countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium; for example, all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets, and resources. Health and education systems among others are managed by the Spanish communities, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions. In Catalonia, the Basque Country, Navarre and the Canary Islands, a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> police functions (see Mossos d'Esquadra, Ertzaintza, Policía Foral/Foruzaingoa and Policía Canaria).|$|E
25|$|As noted previously, {{prior to}} SWANCC, {{virtually}} all US wetlands were, at least theoretically, subject to regulation under section 404. As federal jurisdiction is diminished, {{the responsibility to}} protect affected wetlands falls on states primarily and local governments, which also regulate some wetlands. State and local wetlands regulatory programs focus primarily upon navigable waters, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands. They supplement but do not substitute for federal jurisdiction. According to the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), 14 states {{have some form of}} regulatory program for freshwater wetlands, but they are quite variable. Differences exist in part because freshwater wetland types vary greatly across the nation and because of differing state preferences. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> programs are very comprehensive, but regulations in many of the 14 states are limited by wetland size, mapping requirements, and exemptions for specified activities. According to ASWM, state regulations do not generally apply to federal lands. Some of the states with the largest isolated wetland acreages provide little or no state protection, including Alaska, Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Nebraska, Kansas, and Mississippi.|$|E

500|$|During this period, Beauregard {{promoted}} innovative naval defense strategies, such {{as early}} experimentation with submarines, naval mines (called [...] "torpedoes" [...] in the Civil War), {{and with a}} small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A swift boat fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water, {{it could be used}} to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the Confederacy. He proposed that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> governors meet with Union governors of the Western states (what are called the Midwest states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis's enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a grand strategy—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at the expense of Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, destroy the Federal army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans, ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to the government.|$|E

60|$|Another {{grievance}} {{which helped}} to swell {{the tide of}} resentment against Great Britain, was the frequent impressment of American seamen, a wrong {{to which they were}} particularly exposed from national similarity. To these may be added the persistence of Great Britain in holding the posts to the south of the lakes, which, according to treaty stipulations, ought to have been given up. Washington did not feel himself in a position to press our rights under the treaty, with the vigorous hand that some would urge; questions having risen in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> courts, to obstruct the fulfilment of our part of it, which regarded the payment of British debts contracted before the war.|$|E
