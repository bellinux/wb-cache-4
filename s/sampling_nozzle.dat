30|$|Potential {{activities}} of microbial assimilations of bicarbonate, methane, carbon monoxide, formate, acetate, and leucine (autotrophic, methanotrophic, carboxydotrophic, and heterotrophic activities, respectively) were estimated by radio isotope tracer experiment using CORK fluid samples obtained during the expeditions NT 09 - 01 and NT 09 - 07. The CORK fluid was collected in multiple evacuated 150  mL stainless-steel bottles, each {{connected to a}} three-way valve and a <b>sampling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> All surfaces of the bottle, valve, and nozzle were treated with SilicoNert coating (Silcotek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA) to avoid direct contact between the fluid and stainless steel. The sampling was conducted in duplicates {{for each of the}} radio isotope tracers. Prior to the seafloor sampling by the ROV, each of the radio-isotope-tracers (NaH 14 CO 3, 14 CH 4, 14 CO, H 14 COONa, 14 CH 314 COONa, 14 C-leucine) was placed in two bottles (with and without formaldehyde at a final concentration of 4 %) as solution (NaH 14 CO 3, H 14 COONa, 14 CH 314 COONa, 14 C-leusin and formaldehyde) or gas (14 CH 4 and 14 CO) in sealed glass ampoules. The final radioactivity level was 0.25  MBq per bottle. In order to assess the methanotrophic activity, three treatments were used: (i) only 14 CH 4 added, (ii) 14 CH 4 and O 2 (a final concentration of 40  μM O 2) added, and (iii) 14 CH 4 and Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S (final concentrations of 10  mM and 0.5  mM, respectively) added. The additional O 2 or Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S were introduced either as a gas or as a solution sealed in a glass ampoule. The final concentrations of 14 C-labeled tracers in the bottles were estimated to be about 0.1  mM, 0.4  mM, 0.4  mM, 0.1  mM, 0.1  mM, and 0.1  mM for bicarbonate, methane, carbon monoxide, formate, acetate, and leucine, respectively. After placing the radio isotope tracer into the bottle with three stainless-steel balls, the bottle was evacuated with a vacuum pump. The bottle was then sealed and shaken, which resulted in the stainless-steel balls rapturing the glass ampoules containing the radio-isotope-tracers and formaldehyde. At the seafloor, the <b>sampling</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the radio-isotope-tracer sampler was placed in the discharging CORK fluid and sufficiently flushed. Fluid sample was collected by opening and closing the valve with the ROV manipulator. Immediately after recovery of the ROV, sample bottles were incubated at 4  °C for 49 – 123  days until measurement in a shore-based laboratory. The bottles containing 4 % formaldehyde were used as negative controls (i.e., with no microbial activity).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is the numerical investigation of experiments {{for the study of}} nanoparticle producing laminar flames. Popular, state of the art numerical tools for the investigation of the detailed structure of laminar flames are based on strong assumptions, leading to one-dimensional, steady state approximations of the transport and conservation equations. Unfortunately, these assumptions are often violated. The main focus of this thesis is on the quantification of uncertainties and model errors introduced by thermodynamic and gas dynamic effects, geometric constraints of the reactor and invasive measurement technique in real experiments by means of detailed multi-dimensional numerical simulations of the particle forming, reacting flow. Five different experimental setups were investigated in close collaboration with the research groups conducting these experiments. First, the impact of a molecular beam <b>sampling</b> <b>nozzle</b> on the structure of an atmospheric, premixed hydrogen/oxygen flame. Second, the probing from a low-pressure flat flame of methane and oxygen, where additionally the impact of buoyancy at large heights above the burner was quantified. Third, iron pentacarbonyl doped, particle forming, low-pressure flames of hydrogen/oxygen and methane/oxygen, with and without probing nozzle. Fourth, an atmospheric, sooting, ethylene/oxygen stagnation flow flame with a probing orifice in the stagnation plane. And finally a silica producing low-pressure flame of hydrogen/oxygen doped with hexamethyldisiloxane, used for laser induced fluorescence measurements of SiO. All these investigations required two- and three-dimensional models of the burner and housing geometry in order to capture all deviations from the one-dimensional assumptions. The results presented in this thesis demonstrated the need for such detailed investigations and also contributed to the improvement of experiments and of the kinetic models derived from the measurements. It could be shown that the one-dimensional assumptions are valid only for a very limited set of conditions and that empirical correction formulas are not of general validity. However, the deviations from the idealizing assumptions can be quantified by complementary fluid mechanical simulations of the individual experiment. Based on these finding, the multi-dimensional flow simulation became a permanent element of the experimental workflow at the Institute for Combustion and Gas Dynamics...|$|E

Shrouded anisokinetic nozzles are a means for sampling from a moving airstream with higher particle transmission than with unshrouded isokinetic nozzles. This shrouded <b>nozzle</b> <b>sampling</b> system was evaluated in an experimental ventilation duct system. Aspiration and transport efficiency measurements were made for five particle sizes in the range 1 - 13 μm at each of three duct air speeds in the range 2. 2 - 8. 8 m/s. Under these conditions, the shrouded nozzle system showed improved performance compared to buttonhook isokinetic nozzles, especially for larger particles and higher air speeds. Measured transmission efficiencies through the shrouded <b>nozzle</b> <b>sampling</b> system were generally higher and more reliably predictable than those through buttonhook isokinetic nozzles.

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to assess the suitability of {{the location of the}} air sampling probe on the 296 -S- 21 stack according to the criteria of ANSI N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conducted most tests on a 3. 67 : 1 scale model of the stack. CH 2 MHill also performed some limited confirmatory tests on the actual stack. The tests assessed the capability of the air-monitoring probe to extract a sample representative of the effluent stream. The tests were conducted for the practical combinations of operating fans and addressed: (1) Angular Flow [...] The purpose is to determine whether the velocity vector is aligned with the <b>sampling</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The average yaw angle relative to the nozzle axis should not be more than 20. The measured values ranged from 5 to 11 degrees on the scale model and 10 to 12 degrees on the actual stack. (2) Uniform Air Velocity [...] The gas momentum across the stack cross section where the sample is extracted should be well mixed or uniform. The uniformity is expressed as the variability of the measurements about the mean, the coefficient of variance (COV). The lower the COV value, the more uniform the velocity. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of the air velocity must be ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the area of the stack. At the location simulating the sampling probe, the measured values ranged form 4 to 11 %, which are within the criterion. To confirm the validity of the scale model results, air velocity uniformity measurements were made both on the actual stack and on the scale model at the test ports 1. 5 stack diameters upstream of the sampling probe. The results ranged from 6 to 8 % COV on the actual stack and 10 to 13 % COV on the scale model. The average difference for the eight runs was 4. 8 % COV, which is within the validation criterion. The fact that the scale model results were slightly higher than the actual stack suggests that the other test results on the scale model are conservative relative to the actual stack. (3) Uniform Concentration of Tracer Gases [...] A uniform contaminant concentration in the sampling plane enables the extraction of samples that represent the true concentration. This was first tested using a tracer gas to represent gaseous effluents. The fan is a good mixer, so injecting the tracer downstream of the fans provides worst-case results. The acceptance criteria are that (1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane and (2) at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by > 30 %. The results on the scale model at the point simulating the sampling probe ranged from 0. 3 to 6 %COV, and the maximum single point deviation from the mean was - 10 %. (4) Uniform Concentration of Tracer Particles [...] Uniformity in contaminant concentration at the sampling probe was further demonstrated using tracer particles large enough to exhibit inertial effects. Particles of 10 -?m aerodynamic diameter were used. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of particle concentration is ? 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane. The scale model results ranged form 2 to 9 %. Based on these tests, the location of the air sampling probe on the 296 -S- 21 stack meets the requirements of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 standard...|$|E
40|$|Vericat, D., Church, M., Batalla, R. J. (2006). Bed load bias: Comparison of {{measurements}} obtained {{using two}} (76 and 152 mm) Helley-Smith samplers in a gravel bed river. Water Resources Research, 42 We assess how {{the size of}} the Helley-Smith (HS) bed load <b>sampler</b> <b>nozzle</b> affects the accuracy of bed load sampling. Semitheoretical considerations show that the larger grains resident on the streambed can influence the sample either by blocking the sampler entrance or by causing the sampler to rest in a ??perched?? position. Probabilities for interference can be derived from the distribution of grain sizes but they do not capture the actual complexity of the influence of the bed on sampler performance. We therefore make an empirical comparison of sediment trapped by HS samplers with 76 - and 152 -mm intakes during floods in the gravel bed lower Ebro River. Most bed load rates appeared higher when sampled with the HS 152. The largest clasts collected by the HS 76 also tend to be smaller than those obtained with the HS 152 at the same flow. Analyzing paired bed load samples, we find the probability of a bed load sample collected with the HS 152 to be biased is around 43 % in the conditions of the present study, whereas 65 % of samples were biased when obtained with the HS 76. The analysis emphasizes the influence of bed material texture over sampler performance and demonstrates that the use of samplers with intake size much larger than bed grain size (i. e., 5 D) will increase the accuracy of bed load grain size distributions and the precision of annual load estimates in gravel bed rivers. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Field {{measurements}} of suspended sediment transport are important {{with respect to}} the development and verification of theoretical models and {{with respect to the}} description of boundary conditions in morphological computations. A wide range of instruments has been developed to col 1 ect samples of the sediment in suspension in order to calculate the suspended sediment transport in rivers and estuaries and along shores. These instruments vary from simple bottles to rather sophisticated acoustical devices. Two suspended sediment samplers, viz. the USP- 61 and the Delft Bottle, are studied here. Comparative field tests in 1975 and 1976 in the catchment area of the Rio Magdalena (Columbia) delivered measuring results obtained with an USP- 61 -that were about 250 percent larger in magnitude than the results obtained with a Delft Bottle. To explain this difference an investigation program was started in which this study is a first step. The main goal {{of this study was to}} obtain for both samplers an impression about the sampler characteristics and the reliability of the measuring result. An extensive measuring program concerning all possible parameters was less attractive at that moment. The properties known at present (1978 } of USP~ 61 and Delft Bottle are described and discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. The measurements described in Chapter 4 deal with the ability of both samplers to catch sediment particles correctly. This ability is expressed in the sampler efficiency. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 deal with some specific properties of both instruments. In the hydraulic phenomena observed the velocity in the <b>sampler</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the magnitude of the velocity of the surrounding water, plays a keyrole.

40|$|Suction {{sampling}} with modified garden leaf-blowers (G-vacs) is {{a widely}} used method for research on invertebrates in agricultural and grassland habitats. Approaches vary from sweeping the collecting nozzle {{across the surface of}} the vegetation within a known area, applying the nozzle firmly to the ground to delimit a sample area equal to nozzle crosssection, or applying the nozzle repeatedly within a larger open-ended cylinder placed on the ground. These approaches vary in potential for the inadvertent capture of specimens from outside of the sample area as a result of air being drawn into the nozzle from adjacent vegetation. This has never been studied adequately and is defined here for the first time as the Peripheral Suction Effect (PSE). Invertebrate species are likely to differ in susceptibility to PSE and so both sample size and composition could be impacted. This study compares two series of samples of Auchenorrhyncha taken using the same G-vac suction <b>sampler</b> (<b>nozzle</b> area, 0. 01 m 2) from areas enclosed and unenclosed by an openended cylindrical enclosure (area 0. 17 m 2) intended to prevent PSE. The unenclosed samples contained greater numbers of leafhoppers including Arthaldeus pascuellus, Javesella pellucida and immature Deltocephalinae. Numbers of immature Delphacinae did not differ between enclosed and unenclosed samples. The species composition of the two series of samples was similar, but the proportional representation of immature Delphacinae in unenclosed samples was diluted by the inflated numbers of other taxa that were drawn from the surrounding area. Peripheral suction effects are taxa-specific and therefore have the potential to bias measures of invertebrate community composition. Use of an open-ended cylinder to delimit the sample area is recommended as a simple, inexpensive and effective method of avoiding problems associated with PSE when using a G-vac. The potential for PSE with other models of suction samplers is discussed and questions for further research are identified...|$|R

40|$|Plug nozzles {{are usually}} {{designed}} to achieve altitude adaptation {{in a wide}} range of chamber/ambient pressure ratios. In actual in-flight operations of plug nozzles, this phenomenon must take place in a flowing airstream, which can affect the performance. To understand the flow behavior in such conditions and to evaluate the departure from the ideal nozzle performance, an investigation is carried out with a validated numerical tool based on the solution of turbulent Navier– Stokes equations and on shock fitting. A <b>sample</b> rocket plug <b>nozzle</b> is analyzed parametrically to evaluate the effect of varying Mach number at constant pressure and the effect of varying pressure ratio at constant Mach number. The results indicate that the interaction with a flowing airstream reduces the pressure of the external air, as seen from the nozzle exhaust jet, yielding a reduction of the performance. In particular, a dramatic decrease of nozzle performance may take place in the transonic region if the slipstream effect is neglected in the design. The results also provide useful indications on how the Mach number and the shroud shape can affect the value of ambient pressure where the transition from open to closed wake takes place...|$|R
40|$|Jet-surface {{interaction}} (JSI) can be {{a significant}} factor in the exhaust noise of installed propulsion systems. Tests to further the understanding and prediction of the acoustic impacts of JSI have been described. While there were many objectives for the test, the overall objective was to prepare for a future test validating the design of a low-noise, lowboom supersonic commercial airliner. In this paper we explore design requirements for a partial aircraft model to be used in subscale acoustic testing, especially focusing on the amount of aircraft body that must be included to produce the acoustic environment between propulsion exhaust system and observer. We document the dual-stream jets, both nozzle and flow conditions, which were tested to extend JSI acoustic modeling from simple singlestream jets to realistic dual-stream exhaust <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Sample</b> observations are provided of changes to far-field sound as surface geometry and flow conditions were varied. Initial measurements are presented for integrating the propulsion on the airframe for a supersonic airliner with simulated airframe geometries and nozzles. Acoustic impacts of installation were modest, resulting in variations of less than 3 EPNdB in most configurations...|$|R
40|$|The data {{obtained}} from two recent experiments conducted in a continuing series of experiments at the Lewis Research Center into the contamination characteristics of a 5 -pound thrust MMH/N 2 O 4 engine are presented. The primary objectives of these experiments were to establish the angular distribution of condensible exhaust products within the plume and the corresponding optical damage angular distribution of transmitting optical elements attributable to this contaminant. The plume mass flow distribution was measured by five quartz crystal microbalances (QCM's) located at the engine axis evaluation. The fifth QCM was located above the engine and 15 deg behind the nozzle exit plane. The optical damage was determined by ex-situ transmittance measurements for the wavelength range from 0. 2 to 0. 6 microns on 2. 54 cm diameter fused silica discs also located at engine centerline elevation. Both the mass deposition and optical damage angular distributions followed the expected trend of decreasing deposition and damage as the angle between sensor or <b>sample</b> and the <b>nozzle</b> axis increased. A simple plume gas flow equation predicted the deposition distribution reasonably well for angles of up to 55 degrees. The optical damage measurements also indicated significant effects at large angles...|$|R
40|$|O estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a condição de manutenção de pulverizadores com capacidade de tanque {{superior}} a 2. 000 litros, em áreas de produção de soja do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul. Foram inspecionados 38 pulverizadores de arrasto e automotrizes e 45 conjuntos de pontas de pulverização. O levantamento a campo foi realizado em parceria com a DuPont do Brasil S. A. Foram feitas inspeções em componentes e equipamentos determinantes para o controle e a qualidade da pulverização: tacômetro, manômetro, Sistema de Posicionamento Global (GPS), tanque de água limpa e reservatório para lavagem de embalagens e pontas de pulverização. A avaliação da vazão de 12 pontas por conjunto foi realizada com o uso de provetas graduadas. Os resultados indicaram que a frota da região norte do Estado possui menor idade que a frota da região sul, onde o tempo de uso médio calculado foi de 7, 1 anos. Em 51, 1 % dos casos, os pulverizadores apresentavam pontas com vazão inadequadas. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the field conditions of the boom sprayers with capacity equal or up to 2, 000 liters of water, belonging to farmers in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. It was inspected 38 boom trailed and autoproppeled sprayers and 45 parts of nozzle. The field information was collected in partnerneship with Du Pont of Brazil. It was accomplished inspections in the equipments that are important for quality and control of application: tachometer, pressure gauge, Global Positioning System, tank of clean water, tank for washing containers and spray nozzles. The evaluation of the flown of 12 nozzles per set was accomplished with the use of graduated vials. To evaluate the volume of water in 45 <b>samples</b> of <b>nozzles</b> it was also used graduated vials each one under pressure and used at the same time of the volume test. For this purpose, it was used the statistical model generating the adequate equation based on the manufacture recommendation. With these results it was possible to indicate a smaller age for the boom sprayer from the North of Mato Grosso do Sul State than the one from the South region, where the average age was about 7. 1 years. About 51. 1 % of the sprayers had nozzle with inadequate volume...|$|R
40|$|Parameters that {{influence}} nozzle wear in the abrasive water jet (AWJ) environment {{were identified and}} classified into nozzle geometric, AWJ system, and nozzle material categories. Regular and accelerated wear test procedures were developed to study nozzle wear under actual and simulated conditions, respectively. Long term tests, using garnet abrasive, were conducted to validate the accelerated test procedure. In addition to exit diameter growth, two new measures of wear, nozzle weight loss and nozzle bore profiles were shown to be invaluable in characterizing and explaining the phenomena of nozzle wear. By conducting nozzle wear tests, the effects of nozzle geometric, and AWJ system parameters on nozzle wear were systematically investigated. An empirical model was developed for nozzle weight loss rate. ^ To understand the response of nozzle materials under varying AWJ system conditions, erosion tests were conducted on <b>samples</b> of typical <b>nozzle</b> materials. The effect of factors such as jet impingement angle, abrasive type, abrasive size, abrasive flow rate, water pressure, traverse speed, and target material was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on eroded samples as well as worn nozzles to understand the wear mechanisms. The dominant wear mechanism observed was grain pullout. Erosion models were reviewed and {{along the lines of}} classical erosion theories a semi-empirical model, suitable for erosion of nozzle materials under AWJ impact, was developed. The erosion data correlated very well with the developed model. ^ Finally, the cutting efficiency of AWJ nozzles was investigated in conjunction with nozzle wear. The cutting efficiency of a nozzle deteriorates as it wears. There is a direct correlation between nozzle wear and cutting efficiency. The operating conditions that produce the most efficient jets also cause the most wear in the nozzle. ...|$|R
40|$|Commercial dry powderdispersers {{needed in}} {{conjunction}} with particle size measurement equipment are usually quite expensive (of the order of thousands of dollars). We have found that a simple vacuum generator {{can be used as}} a cost-effective disperser (US$ 50). Comparison with other commercial dispersers, small scale powder disperser (SSPD) model 3433 (TSI, Shoreview, USA) and Scirocco dry powder disperser (Malvern, Worcs, UK), showed that our disperser worked as efficiently as these expensive dispersers. Crystalline mannitol (less than 1 % moisture content) and amorphous BSA (8. 5 – 9. 2 % moisture content) smooth spherical particles were used to test the dispersion capability of the unit. Smooth spherical particles were chosen because they are more cohesive than corrugated particles due to increased contact points. Therefore, sufficient dispersions of other less cohesive particles should be able to be achieved using the optimum conditions reported here. The effects of air pressure, <b>sample</b> weight, and <b>nozzle</b> size of the disperser were investigated. Comparison of the particle size distributions between wet and dry measurements were used to determine the dispersion efficiency. Quantitative comparisons were made using the values of D(v, 0. 5) and span. The best dispersion was found using a 1. 00 mm nozzle and the maximum percentage differences in D(v, 0. 5) and span are 23 % and 19 %, respectively, with more than 200 mg mannitol powder dispersed with pressures of 50, 70, 90 psi. Using BSA powders, the maximum percentage differences of D(v, 0. 5) and span are 37 % and 25 %, respectively. As was the case for the commercial devices, the dispersion of BSA particles could not be improved even when the pressure of the compressed air was increased...|$|R
40|$|Conventional photoetching {{processes}} {{used for}} thin film patterning of tungsten involve photolithography and chemical etching processes which use toxic etchants like potassium ferricyanide and hydrofluoric acid. Through-mask electrochemical micromachining (EMM) of thin films avoids {{the use of}} toxic chemicals by using electrolytic etching, but photolithography processes are still required. Jet EMM uses an unsubmerged electrolyte jet that flows through a micro-sized nozzle cathode and impinges onto the anode workpiece. Patterning is achieved by moving the workpiece. Jet EMM eliminates the photolithography step and uses less toxic chemicals. ^ To investigate jet EMM of tungsten, the anodic dissolution of tungsten was studied using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) cell. The metal dissolution rate, current efficiency and surface brightness during anodic dissolution of tungsten {{as a function of}} the electrolyte composition, applied potential, and hydrodynamic conditions were found. For tungsten dissolution, NaOH solution was found to be the most suitable electrolyte. The surface finish is mass transfer controlled by the diffusion of OH- to the anode. ^ NaOH solution was exclusively used in the jet EMM experiments. Jet EMM uses high flow rate impinging electrolytes which produce high mass transfer rates that lead to high rates of micromachining. The effects of various factors such as flow velocity and nozzle diameter on the feature of machined holes were examined. The machined holes are tapered, the back hole is about the size of the nozzle, and the size of the front hole is a function of <b>sample</b> thickness and <b>nozzle</b> diameter. In addition to machining on various thickness of tungsten foils, jet electrochemical micromachining of back-insulated tungsten foils and tungsten coated silicon wafers were also examined. ^ Mass transport controlled finite element modeling of jet EMM was used to investigate the effect of system variables on hole shape. Various flow velocities and gap distances were investigated. Flat and cavity impingement surfaces were examined. The mass transfer at the sidewall of the cavity was found to be higher than at the bottom or a flat surface. Comparisons of hole profile between the experimental jet EMM and modeled results were made. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} and safety of future aerospace vehicles, worldwide efforts are being directed towards the development of novel aerospace materials which exhibit superior structural and multifunctional capabilities in extreme environments. Fundamental investigation into the thermo-mechanical response and dynamic failure of the materials is paramount {{before they can be}} incorporated into the design of future space access vehicles that can operate reliably in combined, extreme environments. For this purpose, a comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the performance of variety of aerospace materials such as Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs), Ti 2 AlC, and Hastelloy X under extreme thermo-mechanical loadings. ^ Starting from the first principles, analytical analyses were conducted to develop thermo-mechanical stress fields for mixed mode dynamic curving cracks in functionally graded materials (FGMs) under steady-state and transient loading conditions. Asymptotic analysis was used in conjunction with displacement potentials to develop the stress fields around propagating cracks in FGMs. Asymptotic temperature fields were developed first for the exponential variation of thermal conductivity and later these temperature fields were used to derive thermo-mechanical stress fields for a curving crack in FGMs. Using these thermo-mechanical stress fields, various components of the stresses were developed and the effect of curvature parameters, transient parameters, temperature and gradation on these stresses were discussed. Finally, using the minimum strain energy density criterion, the effect of curvature parameters, transient parameters, crack-tip speeds, non-homogeneity values and temperature gradients on crack growth directions were determined and discussed. ^ Experimental studies were then conducted to evaluate two different materials, namely, Nanolayered Titanium Aluminum Carbide (a MAX phase material) and Hastelloy X under varying rates of loading and at different temperatures. The dynamic behavior of nanolaminated ternary carbide, Ti 2 AlC, was characterized under dynamic loading using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) compression apparatus. The dynamic loading experiments were performed in the strain-rate range of 1500 - 4200 s- 1 and at temperatures ranging from room temperature (RT) to 1150 °C. At room temperature, the failure stress and strain show little dependence on strain rate, whereas the failure stress drops considerably at temperatures above 900 °C. At all strain rates and temperatures, Ti 2 AlC exhibits softening after failure initiation and a more graceful failure due to delamination and kink band (KB) formation. At temperatures higher than 900 °C, grain boundary decohesion is suggested to contribute towards the decrease in the failure stress. ^ The dynamic constitutive behavior of Hastelloy X (AMS 5754) was studied at room and elevated temperatures under varying rates of loading. A split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) apparatus was used in conjunction with an induction coil heating system for applying dynamic loads at elevated temperatures. Experiments were carried out at different temperatures ranging from room temperature (25 °C) to 1100 °C at an average strain rate of 5000 s- 1. Room temperature experiments were carried out at varying strain rates from 1000 s- 1 to 4000 s- 1. The results show that as the strain rate increases from quasi-static to 4000 s- 1, the yield strength increases by approximately 50 %. Also, under dynamic loading, the yield stress decreases with temperature up to 700 °C, after which it (yield strength) shows a peak at 900 °C before beginning to decrease again as the temperature is further increased. The Johnson-Cook model was used to predict the dynamic plastic response under varying rates of loading and at different temperatures. ^ A series of experiments were conducted to study the dynamic response of rectangular Hastelloy X plates at room and elevated temperatures when subjected to shock wave loading. The shock tube apparatus was modified and validated for testing Hastelloy X at elevated temperatures. Propane gas was used as the heating source and it was directed onto the <b>sample</b> via four <b>nozzles.</b> A cooling system was also implemented to prevent the shock tube from reaching high temperatures. High-speed photography coupled with the optical technique of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used to record the real-time deformation of the specimen under shock wave loading. The DIC technique was used in conjunction with band pass optical filters and a high intensity light source to record the full-field deformation images under shock loading at high temperatures up to 900 °C. In addition, a high speed camera was utilized to record the side-view deformation images. The high temperature DIC system has been validated by comparing with the mid-point deflections obtained from the side-view camera. The dynamic response of Hastelloy X was evaluated as a function of temperature under shock wave loading. ...|$|R
