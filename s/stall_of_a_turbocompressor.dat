40|$|Dynamic <b>stall</b> is <b>of</b> {{particular}} interest to rotor aerodynamics because of its connection to structural vibrations and control malfunctions. Due to inherent difficulties in most cases stall on rotors is approximated by simple models as those used {{within the context of}} blade element theory. However, their predictions are not always satisfactory and thus improvement is necessary. Since complete Navier-Stokes solvers are too expensive to afford, improvement is sought in between at an intermediate level. In the present work, a vortex model is proposed, based on the double wake concept corresponding to two vortex sheets originating from the trailing edge and the separation point respectively.

This thesis studies the possibility that the <b>stalling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small percentage <b>of</b> induction motors could precipitate FIDVR events. A 12. 5 kV distribution network model with A/C motor load is used to construct certain bifurcation diagrams. Continuation methods based on the predictorcorrector technique are used to arrive at system steady-state solutions tracing the curves of motor behavior while the system bus voltage is varied. The stable and unstable operating points of induction machines are obtained and analyzed. Results show that <b>a</b> small percentage <b>of</b> induction motors <b>stalling</b> could exacerbate the <b>stalling</b> <b>of</b> additional motors. There could be either no stable solutions for the system with <b>a</b> partial number <b>of</b> A/C motors <b>stalled</b> or stable solutions with <b>a</b> certain number <b>of</b> A/C motors <b>stalled,</b> depending on the percentage of integrated motor loads.
