25|$|Forward secrecy is a {{property}} of cryptographic systems which ensures that a session key {{derived from a}} set {{of public and private}} keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future. Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is compromised, not only will all future TLS-encrypted sessions using that server certificate be compromised, but also any past sessions that used it as well (provided of course that these past sessions were intercepted and stored at the time of transmission). An implementation of TLS can provide forward secrecy by requiring the use of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish <b>session</b> <b>keys,</b> and some notable TLS implementations do so exclusively: e.g., Gmail and other Google HTTPS services that use OpenSSL. However, many clients and servers supporting TLS (including browsers and web servers) are not configured to implement such restrictions. In practice, unless a web service uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange to implement forward secrecy, all of the encrypted web traffic to and from that service can be decrypted by a third party if it obtains the server's master (private) key; e.g., by means of a court order.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{original}} version, the RSA algorithm {{was used to}} encrypt <b>session</b> <b>keys.</b> RSA's security depends upon the [...] one-way function nature of mathematical integer factoring. Similarly, the symmetric key algorithm used in PGP version 2 was IDEA, which might {{at some point in}} the future be found to have previously undetected cryptanalytic flaws. Specific instances of current PGP or IDEA insecurities (if they exist) are not publicly known. As current versions of PGP have added additional encryption algorithms, their cryptographic vulnerability varies with the algorithm used. However, none of the algorithms in current use are publicly known to have cryptanalytic weaknesses.|$|E

The album sold one million copies in the United States, where it was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and two million copies worldwide. The debut of Keys' Unplugged was the highest for an MTV Unplugged album since Nirvana's 1994 MTV Unplugged in New York and the first Unplugged by a female artist to debut at number one. The album's first single, [...] "Unbreakable", peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. It remained at number one on the Billboard Hot Adult R Airplay for 11 weeks. The album's second and final single, [...] "Every Little Bit Hurts", was released in January 2006, it failed to enter the U.S. charts.|$|E

50|$|Note {{that there}} is a {{difference}} between master keys and <b>session</b> <b>keys.</b> Master keys are long-lived and usually work as a shared secret or a means to distribute <b>session</b> <b>keys,</b> which in turn do not outlive the connection for which they were created and usually serve as the functional encryption/decryption mechanism. A specific header field indicates which of the possible keys is to be used. It is also important to note that replay prevention mechanisms require the keeping of counters which are updated on valid receptions.

The data is encrypted using a pair of <b>session</b> <b>keys</b> chosen for just that message.

Furthermore, multiple applications of the key derivation function provides backwards and forward security in the sense that a compromised session key does not compromise other <b>session</b> <b>keys</b> derived from the same master key. This means that even if an attacker managed to recover a certain session key, he is not able to decrypt messages secured with previous and later <b>session</b> <b>keys</b> derived from the same master key.
