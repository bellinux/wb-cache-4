5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English <b>shield</b> <b>wall.</b> The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the <b>shield</b> <b>wall,</b> there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a <b>shield</b> <b>wall,</b> with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E

5|$|The English army {{consisted}} {{entirely of}} infantry. It {{is possible that}} some of the higher class members of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the fyrd, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the <b>shield</b> <b>wall,</b> in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the battle, Philippicus, newly {{assigned}} to the Persian front, moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion. He chose to deploy his army at Solachon, controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain, and especially access to the main local watering source, the Arzamon river. Kardarigan, confident of victory, advanced against the Byzantines, but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon. The Persians deployed as well and attacked, gaining the upper hand in the centre, but the Byzantine right wing broke through the Persian left flank. The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot the Persian camp, but Philippicus was able to restore order. Then, while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> to withstand the Persian pressure, the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians' right. Under threat of a double envelopment, the Persian army collapsed and fled, with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning. Kardarigan himself survived and, with a part of his army, held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October 1066 and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were probably about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few archers. The English soldiers formed up as a <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. Norman cavalry then attacked and killed the pursuing troops. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans made feigned withdrawals, tempting the English into pursuit, and allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head. Other sources stated that no one knew how Harold died because the press of battle was so tight around the king that the soldiers could not see who struck the fatal blow. William of Poitiers gives no details at all about Harold's death.|$|E

Fundamental properties of electromagnetic {{waves in the}} interior of a hollow conducting cylindrical tube are presented.

A consequent wideband setup having low cost and common devices as well as high dynamic range is proposed to perform reliable measurements from 50 MHz to 1. 5 GHz. Measurements of circular cylindrical waveguide effectiveness point out the simplicity of the systematic procedure and illustrate the effects of apertures on <b>shielding</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>Shielding</b> loss achieved by these apertures at frequencies below cutoff allows engineers to gain more insight into analysis and design of shields with intentional discontinuities used to exclude and to confine electromagnetic interference.

25|$|The police {{broke down}} {{the door to the}} shop, only to find large, armed group of {{defenders}} waiting for them.

Instead of retreating, the police commanders ordered their men to form a <b>shield</b> <b>wall</b> and tried to push their way into the street. The squatters responded by attempting to burn down the shop with the police inside, but the police had brought fire extinguishers with them and were able to put out the flames of the Molotov cocktail.|$|E

Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police gave up trying to storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area. The police now focused on keeping the squatters inside the barricaded area. The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|E

500|$|The battle {{opened with}} the Norman archers {{shooting}} uphill at the English <b>shield</b> <b>wall,</b> to little effect.

After the attack from the archers, William sent the spearmen forward to attack the English. They were met with a barrage of missiles, not arrows but spears, axes and stones. The infantry was unable to force openings in the <b>shield</b> <b>wall,</b> and the cavalry advanced in support. The cavalry also failed to make headway, and a general retreat began, blamed on the Breton division on William's left. A rumour started that the duke had been killed, which added to the confusion.
