5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> {{a threat to their}} republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E

Koniecpolski's influence also protected the outlaw Samuel Łaszcz, whom he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> another able commander.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} medieval {{accounts of}} the movement are by supporters of reform, who strongly condemned what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy, but historians {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and with what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
50|$|The manner {{by which}} Article 66 was handled left {{the issue of}} the port of Rijeka (Fiume) unresolved. Croatia <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> part of its territory, but Hungary <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> Corpus separatum.|$|R
50|$|The move {{created some}} {{controversy}} {{both in the}} city and church communities. Some <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> Bellevue abandoning a community that could use the church while others <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> a growing issue of white flight.|$|R
500|$|The Journal of Vision, a {{scientific}} journal about vision research, announced in March 2015 that {{a special issue}} about the dress would be published with the title A Dress Rehearsal for Vision Science. Scientific work is ongoing. The first large-scale scientific study on the dress was published in Current Biology {{three months after the}} image went viral. The study, which involved 1,400 respondents, found that 57% <b>saw</b> the dress <b>as</b> blue and black; 30% <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> white and gold; 10% <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> blue and brown; and 10% could switch between any of the colour combinations. A small number <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> blue and gold. Women and older people disproportionately <b>saw</b> the dress <b>as</b> white and gold. The researchers further found that if the dress was shown in artificial yellow-coloured lighting almost all respondents <b>saw</b> the dress <b>as</b> black and blue, while they <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> white and gold if the simulated lighting had a blue bias. [...] Another study in the Journal of Vision found that people who were early risers were more likely to think the dress was lit by natural light, perceiving it as white and gold, and that 'night owls' <b>saw</b> the dress <b>as</b> blue and black.|$|R
5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was {{the inclusion}} of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s. He understood this instrument, which he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
50|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} of {{the tooth}} gullet {{is not as}} common <b>as</b> in band <b>saws,</b> <b>as</b> {{in the majority of}} cases it is a heavier plate gauge and is not bent around band wheels multiple thousands of times per run.|$|R
50|$|The {{proceedings}} concluded at 11 p.m. on 7 August, to mixed reviews. Labor <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> an 'historic event'; {{their opponents}} <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> 'a waste of time'. On 8 August 1974, the Governor-General gave Royal Assent {{to all the}} bills.|$|R
50|$|The women's {{movement}} has been divided between those who <b>saw</b> prostitution <b>as</b> exploitation and those who <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> work. In general,the {{movement has}} not prioritized prostitution, giving it mid-level importance, and <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> a cultural issue, and did not trust the State as an intervenor. On this issue, Catholic organizations {{have been part of}} a hostile backlash to feminism, as is the fascist right. For example, the mayor of Bologna cut all funding to women's shelters.|$|R
5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy {{was stationed in}} San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against such films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E
5000|$|Her book “Frauen im Laufgitter” evoked a {{negative}} reaction from {{men and women}} alike. Men <b>saw</b> her <b>as</b> man-hating and mocked her; the women of Switzerland <b>saw</b> her <b>as</b> a radical, and blamed her for the losing vote on womens' suffrage. They believed in gradual change and <b>saw</b> her <b>as</b> far too extreme. von Rotens daughter Hortenia has been quoted explaining the rejection, saying: [...] "Women {{do not like to}} recognize and do not gladly admit what a lousy situation they are." ...|$|R

5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who {{was then}} an elected member of the State Duma {{and leader of the}} Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge. He wanted to discuss the {{strategy}} of the Russian opposition. It was imperative, Bukovsky told Nemtsov, that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin.|$|E
5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.|$|E

50|$|During World War I, Lithuania {{declared}} independence on February 16, 1918. The declaration {{stated that}} Lithuania {{would be a}} democratic republic with Vilnius as its capital. This claim was based on historical grounds, as the city was {{the capital of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the city was multi-ethnic and other groups laid similar claims. Belarusians <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> the capital of the Belarusian nation and laid claims to the heritage of the former Grand Duchy; Jews <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> the capital of Yiddish culture; Poles <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> a Polish-inhabited city.|$|R
25|$|Atrocities were {{committed}} by both sides. The government labelled its opponents terrorists and <b>saw</b> itself <b>as</b> legitimate. ZAPU and ZANU <b>saw</b> themselves <b>as</b> freedom fighters and <b>saw</b> the government <b>as</b> tyrannical. The guerrilla movement had a communist ideology and was partially {{funded by the}} Soviet Union and China. Initially, the war was very one-sided since the Rhodesian government was able to deploy an overwhelming superiority in manpower, firepower and mobility. Containing the insurgency required little more than police action.|$|R
5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could be resolved politically. He accused military leaders of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the radically anti-business views of the Aberhart government and the Social Credit Board, Alberta's mainstream opposition parties—chiefly the Liberals and the Conservatives—began to cooperate {{under the auspices of}} the newly formed People's League.|$|E
5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
