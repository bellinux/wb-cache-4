40|$|ABSTRACT: Moose (Alces alces) {{population}} density in the Kirov region of Russia is often overesti-mated {{when using the}} relationship between the distance between a residential area and the initial <b>sight-ing</b> of moose tracks. This paper presents a modified approach to provide better estimates when using this techinique. Statistically valid density estimation techniques, standardization of estimation points and routes, landscape characteristics, and time have been addressed in the new approach.

This improved method will provide more accurate {{population density}} estimates critical to prevent regional overharvest of moose. ALCES VOL. 49 : 149 – 154 (2013...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{addressed}} the role of occipital and somatosensory cortex in a tactile discrimination task. <b>Sight-ed</b> and congenitally blind subjects rated the rough-ness and distance spacing {{for a series of}} raised dot patterns. When judging roughness, intermediate dot spacings were perceived as being the most rough, while distance judgments generated a linear relation. Low-frequency rTMS applied to somatosensory cortex disrupted roughness without affecting distance judgments, while rTMS to occipital cortex disrupted distance but not roughness judgments. We also tested an early blind patient with bilateral occipital cortex damage. Her performance on the roughness determination task was normal; however, she was greatly impaired with distance judgments. The findings suggest a double-dissociation effect in which roughness and distance are primarily processed in somatosensory and occipital cortex, respectively.

Dr. Lucas thought this the effect of exhaustion, for she had not slept, and hardly taken any food since her breakfast at Kyve three days ago; and finding poor old nurse too entirely broken down to be of any use, he put his own kind wife in charge of her, and was unwilling to admit anyone else—-even Mrs. Robert Brownlow, who arrived {{in the course of the}} day.

40|$|Many aphasic {{patients}} are impaired {{in their ability}} to provide or to recognize the names of objects, but {{little is known about the}} processing deficits that underlie these difficulties. In this report, a model of object naming/name recognition is proposed, and a prediction is tested concerning one possible functional locus of impairment in name-recognition and object-naming disorders. A subgroup of aphasic patients is found to be impaired in the ability to perform perceptual similarity judgments for pairs of stimulus objects, and to be unable to classify the objects into one of two lexical categories. It is concluded that the classification disorder suffered by these patients results from an impairment at the level of the semantically guided perceptual parsing of objects. The relationship between words and the objects in the world that they signify is complex, undoubtedly involving considerably more than a series of one-to-one associations between words and objects. Between the <b>sight-ing</b> of an object and the articulation of its name, or between the perception of a word and the selection from alternatives of the object it represents, the cognitive system must perform considerable sifting and weighting of information, categorization of events, and matching of different sets of abstract conceptual elements.

She has unique tiger-eyes or cat-eyes. Her beauty {{helped her to}} support her family when her father died {{and she was the}} eldest besides her mother who was in the hospital. Reba was very attached to her family and to save her mother she decided to take up modelling. Her modelling career took her to great heights. She had several feathers in her cap. In her journey she also came in touch with many gentlemen. Out of these gentlemen was a man of a royal family- Eliot Thorson III. THis man was in his late twenties, tall, tanned, with blue eyes and golden hair. He had inherited a great fortune and a well-known chain of hotels. He had a false impression on Reba of being generous. On one fine evening, he proposed Reba to which Reba answered that she would tell her reply after her photo shoot. This photo shoot was going to continue for weeks and on her first day she met a dark, strong, muscular person with whom she fell in love at first <b>sight-</b> Hunter Jamieson. The love blossoms between both of them but the destiny shows her true colours and it is learnt that Reba's mother is critical and needed money as soon as she can for operation. Reba does {{not know what to do}} and at that moment she thinks that the only way her mother could be alive was Reba sacrificing her love and marrying Eliot. Reba decided that Hunter had to move on in life and for him she made him hate her. Hunter thought of her to be a gold-digger. With a stone of her heart, she returned to Eliot and got engaged to him. Only before a few months of marriage Eliot decided to let Reba meet his family. Reba was in no trouble until she came to know that Hunter was Eliot's cousin and had inherited the same amount of property as Eliot had. Blackmailing Reba again and again, Hunter made Reba break her engagement and after breaking the engagement she came to know that Eliot was a cheat and was double-dating. Now as the engagement was no more, Reba couldn't get the money and to save the situation Hunter offered Reba to be his mistress. He would pay her for having sex with him. Reba accepted the offer and fulfilled her part but Hunter did not pay her. To get the money, Reba went to Hunter but he carried her off to some place. Later learning that it was her mother he has got to meet, Reba thanks him and both of them live happily ever after.|$|E

To {{the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first well documented case of this association. Case presentation An otherwise healthy 17 -year-old white man who was treated with systemic isotretinoin for recalcitrant acne was referred with central retinal vein occlusion in one eye. Although a detailed investigation was negative, DNA testing revealed that the patient was a heterozygous carrier of the G 20210 A mutation of the prothrombin gene. Despite the fact that this particular mutation is thought to represent only a minor risk factor for thromboses, it is probable that isotretinoin treatment greatly increased the risk of a vaso-occlusive incident in this patient.

We detect satellites/companions, diffuse emission and velocity shear, all with high signal-to-noise ratios. These galaxies present remarkably high velocity dispersion {{along the line of}} <b>sight(-</b> 70 km s- 1), much higher than standard star-forming spirals in the low-redshift universe. We artificially redshift our data to z - 2. 2 to allow for a direct comparison with observations of high-z LBGs and find striking similarities between both samples. This suggests that either similar physical processes are responsible for their observed properties, or, alternatively, that {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish between different mechanisms operating in the low versus high redshift starburst galaxies based on the available data. The comparison between morphologies in the UV/optical continuum and our kinemetry analysis often shows that neither is by itself sufficient to confirm or completely rule out the contribution from recent merger events. We find a correlation between the kinematic properties and stellar mass, in that more massive galaxies show stronger evidence for a disk-like structure. This suggests a co-evolutionary process between the stellar mass build-up and the formation of morphological and dynamical sub-structure within the galaxy.

Pathogenic isolates of Acanthamoeba are medically relevant as the causative agent of <b>sight-</b> threatening Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), serious infections of other organs, and fatal granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Previous work employing DNA sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA genes (SSU rRNA genes) determined the genotypic diversity of Acanthamoeba and found that many named species of Acanthamoeba are associated with particular genotypes. These studies also concluded that nearly all AK infections result from a single molecular genotype: T 4. Here, we asked whether Acanthamoeba clinical isolates from non-AK infections are also associated with particular genotypes. DNA sequence determination of nuclear SSU rRNA genes was employed for genotypic identification of 29 isolates of Acanthamoeba from non-AK infections. Sequence analysis demonstrates that T 4 is the predominant genotype in non-AK infections, including those in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, nasal passages, skin, and lung. Rare genotypes (T 1, T 10, and T 12) have been isolated from brain infections. We conclude that genotype T 4 is the primary genotype in non-AK Acanthamoeba infections, as was the case in AK infections. However, the genotypes that were isolated from brains have not been observed in environmental isolates of Acanthamoeba, and their natural ecological niche is unknown...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{describe}} {{the use of}} interferon-alpha- 2 a (IFN-alpha- 2 a) {{in the treatment of}} complex hemangiomas and review the role of interferon (IFN) in this example of an angiogenic disease. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hemangiomas are the most frequent tumors of infants and children. They grow rapidly for 6 to 8 months and then resolve over a period of years. Approximately 5 % produce life-, <b>sight-,</b> or limb-threatening complications, with mortality rates between 20 % and 50 %. Aggressive therapy with steroids, arterial ligation or embolization, or surgery has been used in these situations with variable results and high morbidity. Recently, IFN-alpha was found to be effective treatment in these complex hemangiomas. METHODS: Four infants and one child were treated with IFN-alpha- 2 a at an initial subcutaneous dose of 1 million units/m 2 /day and a sustained dose of 3 million units/m 2 /day for 5 to 11 months. Appropriate laboratory values were monitored and adverse reactions and ultimate response to therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Two patients experienced minor complications that were managed easily. Three patients had total or near-total regression of the hemangioma, one had partial (50 %) regression, and one had stabilization but no regression after an average of 7. 1 months of IFN therapy. CONCLUSION: Interferon-alpha inhibits angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro. The patients in this study add to the growing number who have benefited from IFN therapy. As such, IFN-alpha should be considered as a first-line agent in treating complex hemangiomas of infants and children...|$|E

This ancient human disease remains a serious problem, occurring at high incidence globally and having {{a major impact on}} reproductive and neonatal health. N. gonorrhoeae is rapidly evolving into a superbug and no effective vaccine exists to prevent gonococcal infections. Untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhea can lead to severe sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women, epididymitis in men, and <b>sight-</b> threatening conjunctivitis in infants born to infected mothers. Therefore, there is an immediate need for accelerated research toward the identification of molecular targets for development of drugs with new mechanisms of action and preventive vaccine(s). Global proteomic approaches are ideally suited to guide these studies. Recent quantitative proteomics (SILAC, iTRAQ, and ICAT) have illuminated the pathways utilized by N. gonorrhoeae to adapt to different lifestyles and micro-ecological niches within the host, while comparative 2 D SDS-PAGE analysis has been used to elucidate spectinomycin resistance mechanisms. Further, high-throughput examinations of cell envelopes and naturally released membrane vesicles have unveiled the ubiquitous and differentially expressed proteins between temporally and geographically diverse N. gonorrhoeae isolates. This review will focus on these different approaches, emphasizing the role of proteomics in the search for vaccine candidates.

O VI λλ 1032, 1038 and C III λ 977 are detected strongly in both spectra, and S VI λλ 933, 944 is detected weakly only in the larger aperture spectrum. We also report the first detection of C II λ 1037 emission in a supernova remnant. The spectra show the presence of two kinematic components along the line of <b>sight-</b> one with both low and high excitation emission centered at a velocity of − 50 km s − 1 and another with only low excitation emission centered at a velocity of + 100 km s − 1.

We compare our results with data obtained using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at nearby locations and find that differences in the spectra imply the existence of two emitting components in the X-ray knot. Based on the X-ray morphology seen in a ROSAT HRI image, we identify two distinct regions which can be associated with these two components whose ultraviolet emission differs dramatically. These observations demonstrate the importance of high spectral resolution in understanding the proper physical relationships between the various emitting components in supernova remnants.

One possibility is that cross-modal plasticity in visual cortex is pluripotent - cross-modal responses in visual cortex may not show strong selectivity for either modality or task. Alternatively, if cross-modal plasticity is driven by functional specificity, similar activations might be expected for a given task, regardless of modality; whereas if cross-modal plasticity is driven by anatomical connectivity between visual cortex and other sensory cortical areas, similar activations might be expected for a given modality, regardless of task. Here we present work from two studies. In the first study, fMRI responses to a variety of tasks in auditory and tactile modalities were measured in early blind and sighted subjects. We found cross-modal plasticity (greater fMRI responses in blind than sighted subjects) in visual cortex for all tasks, with many areas showing cross-modal plasticity for all the tasks that we tested - across much of cortex the degree of specialization underlying cross- modal plasticity seems to be relatively weak (pluripotency). However, in dorsal-occipital and ventral regions of visual cortex, we did find evidence for selectivity based on modality (greater response to tactile than auditory tasks), and in occipital-temporal regions of cortex we found modulation of cross-modal response by task. In our second study we specifically tested the functional specificity hypothesis in visual motion area MT +. To more accurately define MT+, we used two rare <b>sight-</b> recovery subjects. In these subjects MT+ responded to auditory motion, while in visually normal subjects MT+ did not show similar auditory responses. These auditory responses in MT+ were specific to motion compared with other complex auditory stimuli, suggesting that cross- modal plasticity can be influenced by the normal functional specialization of a cortical region. Our results further demonstrate that in the case of sight recovery, cross-modal responses can coexist with regained visual responses within the visual corte...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of media and movement in contemporary choreography and film. In contrast to the prevailing critical emphasis on the physical apparatus of new media and technology in performance, it identifies a formal connection between cinema and choreography in a common constitutive element, movement. Like frames in film, the continuous passage of this movement provides a structural alternative to dramatic unity and redirects its audience towards events and possibilities from {{beyond the boundaries of}} of the theatrical and cinematic scene- and the visual field of the seen. These peripheral events manifest themselves as a "screen" that diffuses or obfuscates the site- and <b>sight-</b> of performance. Rather than a surface for the projection of images, this screen is the product of continuous motion. This continuous motion consists of two modes, autoimmunity and the ambulatory. The dissertation first considers autoimmunity in Yvonne Rainer's early choreography, which implements a structure based on incessant stopping. This structural intermittence establishes an affinity with film and produces an actual screen, which is embodied on stage by mattresses. In search of relief from this structure of relentless interruption, Rainer's subsequent dance, Trio A, develops another choreographic structure, ambulatory motion. In addition to suspending formal unity, ambulatory motion's pedestrian pace diffuses distinct qualities. Applied to a subsequent study of Chantal Akerman's feminist film je tu il elle, this diffusion becomes a formal category, opacity. By considering je tu il elle with regard to Akerman's recent documentaries on immigrants and autobiographical video installations, it is possible to link feminist performance to translation, which itself instantiates continuous motion. William Forsythe's choreography also uses translation, albeit in a way that returns to Rainer's engagement with autoimmunity as an aesthetic process. Unlike Rainer, Forsythe's translations emphasize autoimmunity's biopolitical aspects, which anticipate a life form that does not adhere to biological or technological definitions and whose collectivity relates to a notion of media that separates what it connects- namely, the screen...|$|E
40|$|This report aims to {{evaluate}} the performance gains that {{can be obtained by}} introducing cooperative localization in an indoor firefighter localization system, through the use of scenario-based simulations. Robust and accurate indoor localization for firefighters is a problem that is not yet resolved. Harsh environmental conditions and stringent size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) requirements are obstacles that have to be considered. Foot-mounted inertial navigation systems (INS) are being evaluated for first responder localization, but they have an accumulating position error that grows over time. By using ultrawideband (UWB) ranging between the firefighters and combining range measurements with position and uncertainty estimates from the foot-mounted INS via a cooperative localization approach it is possible to reduce the position error significantly. An error model for the position estimates received from single and dual foot-mounted INS is proposed based on experimental results, and it contains a scaling error which depends on the distance travelled and a heading error which grows linearly over time. The position error for these dead-reckoning systems depend upon the type of movement. Hence, the error model allows for varying position errors in order to mimic different movements that occur in typical firefighter operations. Similarly, an error model for the UWB range measurements was designed where the range measurements experience a bias and variance, which is determined by the number of walls between the transmitter and the receiver. By implementing these error models in a scenario-based simulation environment it is possible {{to evaluate}} the performance gain of different cooperative localization algorithms. The scenarios are designed to provide realistic movements of smoke divers in a search and rescue operation. A centralized extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm has been implemented, and the position accuracy and heading improvements obtained through cooperative localization are evaluated over a smoke diving operation scenario. Using the proposed cooperative localization scheme it was possible to reduce the position errors by up to 70 % in a designed scenario, where a three-person smoke diver team performs a search and rescue operation in two small apartments, where varying <b>sight-</b> and heat conditions sometimes forces the firefighters to search close to the floor by crawling...|$|E
