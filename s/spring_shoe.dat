40|$|The {{centrifugal}} clutch offers many advantages in motor and engine drive applications. Utilizing the {{centrifugal clutch}} enables {{the selection of}} normal torque motors for running loads rather than the selection of high torque motors for starting loads. The aim of this project is to be describing the torque carrying capacity at different speed which using in transmitting power. The entire work based on conventional design with ferrodo lining, driving shaft, <b>spring,</b> <b>shoe,</b> spider, cover plate, driven shaft. The detail design for various speed {{is made in the}} centrifugal clutch to select an operating range of speed under which the application are designed for torque transmission. In this project the design calculation are worked out analytically. Along with this we have introduced a compliant clutch. Compliant clutch is made from polypropylene material and there is no anyone connecting parts. it has rigid body design since revolute joints are replaced by flexible segment. The potential energy store in flexible segment can replace springs and reduction in revolute joints reduces problem with backlash and wear. The compliant clutch includes rigid body mechanism through dimensional synthesis by graphical method. A mechanism is evaluated and synthesized specific force-deflection relationship. In many applications, compliant mechanism can maintain or even improve performance relative to conventional rigid body designs. It is cost benefitted. Also conventional clutch is expensive rather than compliant clutch...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{randomly}} generated {{levels are}} connected together by hubs. Additional levels {{can be downloaded}} from Xbox Live. Level exploration is based around collecting items: the player searches for the Sacred Albums of Funk, and for keys that grant access to more levels. Enemies include rabbit ninja, a [...] "demented chicken", and [...] "psycho cheerleaders", which the player combats with Funk-Fu and Funk Notes. Funk Notes are projectiles that render enemies [...] "funkified", or harmless; more powerful than Funk-Fu, they require the player to gather ammunition. The player may also find wrapped presents, which contain power-ups such as rocket skates, <b>spring</b> <b>shoes</b> and food; these variously grant greater defensive abilities, access to certain areas, and additional health. Another power-up involves a simple rhythm game, and leaves nearby enemies [...] "funkified" [...] if the player successfully copies on-screen rhythms.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of weapons the player can use, and the player can equip both a primary and {{secondary}} weapon. Mikey can use three primary weapons: the yo-yo, a short-range weapon with limited power; the slingshot, a ranged, ammunition-based weapon; and the boomerang, a slower ranged weapon with unlimited use. The bomb and molotov cocktail are the two secondary weapons the player can use, and the player can increase Mikey's carrying capacity by finding additional cases of them. These are explosive weapons that have a small blast radius and can damage Mikey if he is in range; the bomb can also reveal hidden doors. There are also two performance boosting shoes in the game; the <b>spring</b> <b>shoes</b> increase Mikey's jumping ability and are required to reach certain areas of the map, and the hyper shoes increase Mikey's speed and make some areas more easily accessible.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{place called}} the Ol' West, {{populated}} by robots. The main protagonist is the titular character, a mechanical sheriff named Tin Star, who has a sidekick named Mo Crash. In the beginning, Tin Star and Mo ride on a stagecoach to a town called East Driftwood to stop the Bad Oil Gang and their leader, Black Bart, from committing crimes. While riding on a stagecoach, a member of the Bad Oil Gang wearing <b>spring</b> <b>shoes,</b> by name of Joe Twiddley, sees them inside of the stagecoach and tries to attack them along with his gang, but Tin Star defeats them, and the stagecoach makes it to East Driftwood more or less intact. Upon their arrival, the story begins when Tin Star tries to help the old lady carry her bags, she objects, shoves him and he accidentally steps on Tiny Johnson's award-winning geranium, setting in motion a vicious circle of vengeance and escalating confrontations with the local outlaws.|$|R
50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake <b>shoe</b> <b>springs</b> restore the <b>shoes</b> to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|R

If Plok locates one of these colorful gifts he is immediately transformed into a more powerful fighting machine for a brief length of time. These power-ups include a flamethrower, boxing gloves, a blunderbuss, dueling pistols and multiple rocket launchers. Specific presents yield vehicles that Plok can use in some later levels in the fleas' lair such as a unicycle, Jeep, jetpack, motorbike, tank, helicopter, Flying saucer and a pair of <b>spring</b> pogo <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Measuring at 1.62 m, Eddy {{was smaller}} than most of his European {{competitors}} but he made up for the height difference with endless energy and amazing acrobatic jumps that triggered a running gag about Eddy hiding <b>springs</b> in his <b>shoes.</b> Eddy {{was considered to be}} one of the first athletes to do a jump smash. His trademark shot was known as the “Airborne Kill”.|$|R
50|$|When {{the brakes}} are applied, brake fluid is forced under {{pressure}} from the master cylinder into the wheel cylinder, which in turn pushes the brake shoes into contact with the machined surface {{on the inside of the}} drum. This rubbing action reduces the rotation of the brake drum, which is coupled to the wheel. Hence the speed of the vehicle is reduced. When the pressure is released, return <b>springs</b> pull the <b>shoes</b> back to their rest position.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a <b>sprung</b> contact <b>shoe</b> beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R
40|$|Accelerometry {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} {{quantify}} the osteogenic or injury potential of impacts. This paper uses a series of four experiments to demonstrate theoretically, mechanically, and experimentally that increasing the effective mass of an impact can lead to an increase in impact force with a corresponding decrease in acceleration. The four experiments included: 1) mass <b>spring</b> models, 2) <b>shoe</b> impact testing, 3) cadaver impact simulation, and 4) an in vivo study manipulating knee angle during running. Results were consistent with the aim, illustrating a limitation for the use of accelerometers for impact assessment. In order to appropriately interpret the results from accelerometry it is necessary to quantify the effective mass of the impact. Failure to account for the influence of effective mass can lead to erroneous conclusions about impact severity...|$|R
40|$|To enhance running {{performance}} in heel-toe running, a leaf <b>spring</b> structured midsole <b>shoe</b> (LEAF) {{has recently been}} introduced. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a LEAF compared to a standard foam midsole shoe (FOAM) on joint mechanics and lower limb muscle forces in overground running. Nine male long-distance heel strike runners ran on an indoor track at 3. 0 ± 0. 2 m/s with LEAF and FOAM shoes. Running kinematics and kinetics were recorded during the stance phase. Absorbed and generated energy (negative and positive work) of the hip, knee and ankle joint as well as muscle forces of selected lower limb muscles were determined using a musculoskeletal model. A significant reduction in energy absorption at the hip joint as well as energy generation at the ankle joint was found for LEAF compared to FOAM. The mean lower limb muscle forces of the m. soleus, m. gastrocnemius lateralis and m. gastrocnemius medialis were significantly reduced for LEAF compared to FOAM. Furthermore, m. biceps femoris showed a trend of reduction in running with LEAF. The remaining lower limb muscles analyzed (m. gluteus maximus, m. rectus femoris, m. vastus medialis, m. vastus lateralis, m. tibialis anterior) did not reveal significant differences between the shoe conditions. The findings of this study indicate that LEAF positively influenced the energy balance in running by reducing lower limb muscle forces compared to FOAM. In this way, LEAF could contribute to an overall increased running {{performance in}} heel-toe running...|$|R
60|$|To {{those who}} know the skunk only from reputation, my words might seem too strong; many, however, {{who have come to}} close {{quarters}} with the little animal will think them ridiculously weak. And consider what must the feelings be of one who has had the following experience--not an uncommon experience on the pampas. There is to be a dance at a neighbouring house a few miles away; he has been looking forward to it, and, dressing himself with due care, mounts his horse and sets out full of joyous anticipations. It is a dark windy evening, but there is a convenient bridle-path through the dense thicket of giant thistles, and striking it he puts his horse into a swinging gallop. Unhappily the path is already occupied by a skunk, invisible in the darkness, that, in obedience to the promptings of its insane instinct, refuses to get out of it, until the flying hoofs hit it and sand it like a well-kicked football into the thistles. But the forefoot of the horse, up as high as his knees perhaps, have been sprinkled, and the rider, after coming out into the open, dismounts and walks away twenty yards from his animal, and literally smells himself all over, and with a feeling of profound relief pronounces himself Not the minutest drop of the diabolical spray has touched his dancing <b>shoes!</b> <b>Springing</b> into the saddle he proceeds to his journey's end, is warmly welcomed by his host, and speedily forgetting his slight misadventure, mingles with a happy crowd of friends. In a little while people begin exchanging whispers and significant glances; men are seen smiling at nothing in particular; the hostess wears a clouded face; the ladies cough and put their scented handkerchiefs to their noses, and presently they begin to feel faint and retire from the room. Our hero begins to notice that there is something wrong, and presently discovers its cause; he, unhappily, has been the last person in the room to remark that familiar but most abominable odour, rising like a deadly exhalation from the floor, conquering all other odours, and every moment becoming more powerful. A drop has touched his shoe after all; and fearing to be found out, and edging towards the door, he makes his escape, and is speedily riding home again; knowing full well that his sudden and early departure from the scene will be quickly discovered and set down to the right cause.|$|R
