5000|$|Prehistorical finds {{from various}} Neolithic eras, Roman and Alamanni ruins all testify {{to a long}} history of human {{habitation}} around Fahrwangen. The modern municipality of Fahrwangen is first mentioned in 924 as Farnowanch. [...] Under the Habsburgs both the high and low justice were brought together with the County of Tennwil.

5000|$|The {{eventually}} agreed {{compromise solution}} {{of a trial}} in the Netherlands governed by Scots law was engineered by legal academic Professor Robert Black of Edinburgh University and, {{in accordance with the}} Labour government's promotion of an [...] "ethical" [...] foreign policy, was given political impetus by the then foreign secretary, Robin Cook. The Scottish Court in the Netherlands, a <b>special</b> <b>High</b> <b>Court</b> of Justiciary, was set up under Scots law in a disused United States Air Force base called Camp Zeist in Utrecht, in the Netherlands. Facilities for a high security prison were also installed there. Under a bilateral treaty between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, these premises were, {{for the duration of the}} trial and any subsequent appeal, under the authority and control of the Scottish Court. Dutch law still theoretically applied to the area, but, barring an emergency, the Dutch authorities were banned from entering the premises and the Court had the authority to enact regulations that superseded Dutch law when necessary for the execution of the trial, and to jail people for contempt of court. The court itself, as well as people involved in the trial also enjoyed total or partial immunity from Dutch law.|$|R
50|$|Greece's current Constitution {{has been}} revised three times, {{with the first}} one taking place in 1986, when the {{responsibilities}} of the President of the Republic were significantly curtailed. In 2001 a very extensive revision took place as a total of 79 articles were amended. The new, revised Constitution introduced new individual rights, such as the protection of genetic data and identity or the protection of personal data from electronic processing, and new rules of transparency in politics (on political party financing, electoral expenditures, the relations of media owners with the State, etc.). It modernized parliamentary functions, propped up decentralization, elevated the status of fundamental Independent Authorities into Constitutional institutions and adopted its provisions on MPs' disqualifications and incompatibilities to current reality after taking into consideration the <b>Special</b> <b>Highest</b> <b>Court's</b> case-law. The most recent revision took place in 2008 and introduced several reforms and amendments: it abrogated professional incompatibility and as for growth and development measures extending on insular and mountainous areas, the central administration now assumed special responsibility thereof. It also bestowed the Parliament with the power to proceed with proposals should certain preconditions apply, to amend the budget as well as an ad hoc procedure for the Parliament to oversee the budget’s implementation.|$|R

50|$|A code of law {{seems to}} have been {{established}} under the reign of Moctezuma I. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, pochteca could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, military courts dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an appeal process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a supreme <b>court</b> and two <b>special</b> <b>higher</b> appellate <b>courts</b> at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the Huetlatoani, who had the right to appoint lesser judges.|$|R
50|$|The Audiencia Nacional (National Court) is a <b>special</b> and {{exceptional}} <b>high</b> <b>court</b> in Spain. It has {{jurisdiction over}} all of the Spanish territory, as well as over international crimes which come under the competence of Spanish courts. The Audiencia Nacional was created in 1977 {{at the same time}} as the Public Order Tribunal (Tribunal de Orden Público), a Francoist institution, ceased to exist. Despite what many people think, the two work differently, and both the Spanish Constitutional Court and the European Commission of Human Rights have observed this tribunal to be legal. Its seat is in the city of Madrid. In most cases, the rulings and decisions of these different divisions of the Audiencia Nacional can be appealed before the Supreme Court of Spain.|$|R

A lower court decision ordered {{an inquiry into}} the Shehadeh killing. The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF’s targeted killing of Shehadeh in 2002. Israeli MK Moshe Ya'alon (Chief of Staff {{at the time of}} the bombing) cancelled a trip to the United Kingdom on 5 October 2009, because he feared an arrest on war crimes charges relating to the 2002 killing.|$|R
