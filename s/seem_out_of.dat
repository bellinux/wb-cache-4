25|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth in}} different body parts happens at different times, {{but for all}} adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders.

25|$|Some synesthetes often {{report that}} they were unaware their {{experiences}} were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling {{as if they had}} been keeping a secret their entire lives. The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of sensory overload.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that {{are not meant to}} be sparkling can be a sign of refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration or as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with volatile acidity that can make a wine <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> balance.|$|E
25|$|Columbushaus was {{the result}} of a plan by the French retail company Les Galeries Lafayette, whose {{flagship}} store was the legendary Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to open a counterpart in Berlin, on the Grand Hotel Belle Vue's former site, but financial worries made them pull out. Undaunted, the architect, Erich Mendelsohn (1887–1953), erected vast advertising boards around the perimeter of the site, and the revenue generated by these enabled him to proceed with the development anyway. Columbushaus was a ten-storey ultra-modern office building, years ahead of its time, containing Germany's first artificial ventilation system, and whose elegance and clean lines won it much praise. However, despite a Woolworths store on its ground floor, a major travel company housed on the floor above, and a restaurant offering fine views over the city from the top floor, the economic situation of the time meant that it would not be followed by more buildings in that vein: no further redevelopment in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz occurred prior to World War II, and so Columbushaus would always <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in that location. Nevertheless, its exact position showed that the platz was starting to be opened out: the former hotel had mostly stood on a large flagged area laid out in front of it, indicating that the new building curved away from the existing street line; this would have enabled future street widening to take place.|$|E

[...] However he expressed uncertainty over Amy's [...] "attempted seduction of the Doctor", claiming that it [...] "did <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> keeping with the usual tone of the series", and that [...] "Given the number of young children who watch, {{it may not have been}} the most appropriate of scenes to screen".|$|E

[...] As the Old Coot walks away, his voice grows deeper with a more exaggerated Scottish accent, further supporting this idea. [...] It appears he has lived longer than the average person because he drank from the Fountain of Youth after Act I. Amelia then asks what he just said, he replies with a knowing, [...] "Don't miss your train," [...] and then he walks away.|$|E

Patrick Ferrucci of the New Haven Register commented in the album review that [...] "She does get a little wishy-washy though, going from tunes like 'Mean' and 'It's All Your Fault' to 'Please Don't Leave Me' and 'Glitter in the Air'". He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine stated {{that one of the}} biggest problems in Funhouse was its songwriting, saying, [...] "'Glitter in the Air,' with its emo-esque [...] "You called me sugar" [...] bridge, is overwrought with its clichéd imagery".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} soundtrack to lack the focus that Activision claims it has, {{and that the}} series may have {{exhausted}} a number of good guitar songs in its previous iterations.

Official Xbox Magazine UK stated that the setlist [...] "feels at times uninspired, incongruous and uninteresting". Game Informers Matt Helgeson felt that the setlist was [...] "a mixed bag", with a strong and balanced set of songs in the early tiers of Quest Mode, while the latter, more difficult songs were [...] "terrible and felt like a chore" [...] to complete. Roger Hargreaves of Metro commented that [...] "with so many of the more iconic rock songs having already been used in previous Guitar Hero and Rock Band games developers are forced to use ever more obscure songs and/or acts".

500|$|In {{retrospective}} reviews, Winter in America {{was well}} received by critics, who cite {{it as one}} of Scott-Heron's best albums. Uncut magazine's Barney Hoskyns praised the album, calling it an [...] "introspective seasonal offering from black poet-singer and collaborating pianist". He also lauded its critical content and called it [...] "a masterwork of ghetto melancholia and stark political gravitas". Ron Wynn of AllMusic wrote of Scott-Heron's performance, in that he was [...] "at his most righteous and provocative on this album", while acknowledging Jackson's contributions as well. BBC Online's Daryl Easlea called the album [...] "an affecting work" [...] and wrote that its title track [...] "should be played as standard on all modern history courses as a snapshot of the stilted hopes and aspirations in the post Watergate and Vietnam War mid 70s America". The Washington Posts Richard Harrington cited [...] "The Bottle" [...] and [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] as [...] "classic Scott-Heron works" [...] in a review of its reissue. Los Angeles Times writer Mike Boehm viewed that its title track [...] "sounded a sad death-knell for '60s hopes of transforming change", while calling it a [...] "wonderful mood piece, capturing what it's like to feel oppressed in your soul by outer-world events that <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control". Danny Eccleston of Mojo called it an [...] "alloy of Rhodes-laden souljazz with 's razor-sharp beat-poetry" [...] and quipped, [...] "Anger, radicalism, humour and funk from the proto-rapper, thankfully restored to health and liberty." ...|$|E

Mike Diver of BBC Music was equally critical, writing that [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] is a [...] "wholly pointless minute-something {{in the company of}} star producer The-Dream, wasted on the boring profanities of Birthday Cake." [...] A reviewer for Flavour had a mixed reaction to the lyrical content, writing, [...] "I can't exactly say it is a bad song. In fact, I will probably be singing it over the next few weeks. But at this point its like, 'we get it – you like sex.' Chill out about it and sing about education or something – your younger fans need more SUBSTANCE." [...] Nathan S. of DJ Booth noted that the song resembles a real life [...] "quickie", continuing to write that the overtly sexual lyrics in the song earned Talk That Talk the Parental Advisory sticker.

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, however, {{had a more}} {{positive}} response to the film and awarded it {{three out of four}} stars, writing, [...] "That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve. There is a kind of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don't <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time and place like the cast of Troy.

2500|$|In February 2014, Atlus {{announced}} that the game would see an English release {{in the second half}} of 2014. The localization was handled internally by Atlus, and followed the precepts of their policy for the Persona series: they kept the text as close as possible to the Japanese original, except where some aspects such as humor would be difficult for a Western audience to understand. They also sought to avoid the localization adjustments that would <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context with the visuals, citing the changes to the Ace Attorney games as a type of localization they wished to avoid. As Persona Q was a spin-off from two popular games, the team were extra careful that they remained faithful to both the original and fan expectations for the characters. A compromise that was made was that players did not have enough space in the naming screen to use the [...] "Yu Narukami" [...] title for the Persona 4 protagonist.

During any given performance, Tim Smith rants between and during numbers, acting out bizarre childlike ideas and emotions. During the 1980s the band perfected a detailed stage act involving shabby lift attendant costumes, badly-applied clown make-up, Tim Smith's bullying of other band members (predominantly Jim Smith), and a final formal presentation of champagne and flowers by The Consultant and Miss Swift complete with confetti, taking place to [...] "a euphoric sweep of saxophone and keyboards that wouldn’t <b>seem</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in a '70s cigar advert."
