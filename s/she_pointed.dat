5|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> {{out that}} when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> out that historical buildings {{are often used}} in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, the Bells {{had moved}} to Brisbane, where John was Queensland manager for Airlines of Australia Ltd, having left the RAAF in 1929. Mary became leader of forty or so members of the Women's National Emergency Legion Air Wing who had volunteered to assist with {{aircraft}} maintenance during times of war. Determining that their objectives would not be met in their existing organisation, on 17July they formed a new paramilitary group, the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander. She soon expanded the WATC into a national organisation, with Commandants leading each state's chapter, and herself as Australian Commandant. Bell wrote to Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, with whom she was acquainted via her husband and through aviation circles, advocating {{the establishment of a}} women's branch of the RAAF similar to the RAF's Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Among other things, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> out that female volunteers such as hers were already supporting the Air Force in driving, nursing and clerical duties. The WATC was one of several women's voluntary organisations whose members were keen to support the military, arguing that their personnel provided a ready-made pool of skilled staff for auxiliary services, saving the government time and money training unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E
25|$|Germain {{published}} her prize-winning essay at her {{own expense}} in 1821, mostly {{because she wanted to}} present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> out some of the errors in her method.|$|E

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> {{out that}} {{polygamy}} was illegal in Malaysia for non-Muslims {{but not for}} Muslims, and that child custody arrangements for Muslims were biased towards fathers {{as opposed to the}} shared-custody arrangements of non-Muslim parents. Women's groups in Malaysia began campaigning in the 1990s to have female sharia judges appointed to the sharia legal system in the country, and in 2010 two female judges were appointed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Bishop {{fatally shot}} her 18-year-old brother, Seth Bishop, on December 6, 1986, at their home in Braintree, Massachusetts. Bishop fired two shots from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun (one into her bedroom wall, then one into her brother's chest {{while they were in}} the kitchen with their mother). Later <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> the weapon at a moving vehicle on the {{adjacent}} road and tried to get into the vehicle. The death of her brother was classified as an accident by Braintree police.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.|$|E

The Yorktown came out of yard {{in the spring of}} 1964. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.|$|E
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal {{movement}} was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' {{on the grounds}} that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the {{movement was}} not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policy making in India. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir. Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation. Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.|$|E

5000|$|The book {{encompasses}} {{a critique of}} multiculturalism, alleged weak policing, cultural relativism and what Phillips calls a [...] "victim culture". She argues that these forces combined to create an ideal breeding ground for Islamic terrorists. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> to the centrality of London-based individuals and groups to many terror plots around the world, which she argues were enabled by a semi-formal [...] "covenant of security" [...] between Islamists and the British authorities. Zacharias Moussaoui and the shoe-bomber Richard Reid are two of many such examples <b>she</b> <b>points</b> to in the book.|$|R

25|$|Robin is Eva Kane's son, Evelyn, {{which in}} England {{can be a}} man's name {{as well as a}} woman's. Mrs Upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son, but he {{realised}} that any scandal would be to his detriment. Mrs McGinty saw the photo of Eva Kane while working at the Upward house and assumed the photo was of Mrs Upward as a young woman. Robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the Â£30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking. Mrs Upward thought Kane's photograph to be similar to a photo Robin had shown her of his mother, whose back story he made up. She wanted to confront Robin by herself, so <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> to the wrong photo (that of Lily Gamboll) to put Poirot off the scent.|$|E
25|$|Shurley {{found no}} signs of brain damage but {{observed}} a few persistent abnormalities in Genie's sleep, including a significantly reduced amount (and much larger than average variance in duration) of REM sleep and an unusually high number of sleep spindles. He eventually concluded Genie had been mentally disabled from birth, specifically citing her significantly elevated number of sleep spindles. The other scientists following the case remained divided on this issue. Much later, for example, Susan Curtiss emphatically argued that, though Genie clearly had serious emotional difficulties, {{she could not have}} been disabled. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Genie made a year's developmental progress for every calendar year after her rescue, which would not be expected if her condition was congenital, and that some aspects of language Genie acquired were uncharacteristic of mentally disabled people. She instead believed that Genie was born with at least average intelligence, and that the abuse and isolation of her childhood had left her functionally disabled.|$|E
25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> to them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{experienced}} discrimination {{throughout her}} climbing career {{and in an}} interview with John Stieger in Climbing, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that [...] "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the [...] "tomboy" [...] she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.|$|E
500|$|An {{academic}} {{study of}} western Kaali enthusiasts noted that, [...] "as {{shown in the}} histories of all cross-cultural religious transplants, Kaali devotionalism in the West must take on its own indigenous forms {{if it is to}} adapt to its new environment."
