40|$|This thesis {{involved}} {{a longitudinal study}} of 30 healthy infants from 6 weeks to 15 months to investigate the relationship between feeding behaviour and weight gain in infancy. Poor infant weight gain is associated with adverse outcomes in childhood (e. g. Skuse, Pickles, Wolke, et al 1994) and adulthood (e. g. Fall, Vijayakumar, Barker, et al 1995). Previous research has investigated the relationship between feeding behaviour and concurrent weight, but {{with a few exceptions}} there has been little previous work on the relationship between feeding behaviour and weight gain in infants. Feeding behaviour was measured at four breastfeeds in 32 infants at six weeks and later in 30 of the same infants at 12 months during <b>solids</b> <b>feeding.</b> Birthweight was obtained from parents' child health records and weight was measured at 6 weeks, 3 months and thereafter every 3 months until 15 months. Sucking patterns during milk feeding were found to be independently associated with infant weight gain, but there was no independent association between <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour and weight gain. Other independent predictors of weight gain were; infant sex, milk intake during breastfeeding and age of introduction of solids. An analysis of associations between milk and <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour found some evidence of parallels within infants across the two different types of feeding and the implications of this are discussed. A new method for the analysis of breastfed infants' sucking patterns which resolves the serious problems of the already published methods was developed during die course of the study and an outline of this is provided. Previously unavailable data on (1) the behaviour of one year olds during <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> and (2) the components of variation in milk and <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Air current {{segregation}} (ACS) is one segregation {{phenomenon that}} has been identified to contribute significantly to the separation of fines(particlesb 42 μm) from coarse material during the filling of industrial silos. This paper describes investigations of ACS for alumina powder based on experiments conducted in an industrial silo, in the laboratory and by computation, using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code Fluent. For the industrial silo, the extent of ACS has been measured using the accumulation of fine material at the wall as an indicator. Based on these results, modifications to the feeding system were undertaken which showed that ACS is promoted if the material is fed in a dilute form.

The effects of <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> rate and air extraction rate on ACS have been investigated in the laboratory silo and the results clearly show that low <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> rates promote ACS.

In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, effects of partially replacing milk replacer by <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 and partially replacing dry matter (DM) intake from maize silage and barley straw by concentrate during period 2 were tested. <b>Solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 consisted of maize silage, barley straw, and concentrate (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis). <b>Solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 2 consisted of maize silage and barley straw (50 : 50 ratio on DM basis) for the nonconcentrate groups, and maize silage, barley straw and concentrates (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis) for the concentrate groups. At the end of period 1 (n = 16) {{and at the end of}} period 2 (n = 90), parameters of animal performance, rumen development, rumen fermentation, ruminal drinking, and abomasal damage were examined. Partially replacing milk replacer by <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 resulted in early rumen development (ERD) at the end of period 1, characterized by increased rumen weight, and an increased epithelial and absorptive surface area. Both ERD and partially replacing roughage by concentrates in period 2 increased the rumen development score at the end of period 2. Although ERD calves consumed more <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and less milk replacer during period 1 and 2 than non-ERD calves, carcass weight gains at 25 wk were identical, and utilization of the <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> provided appeared similar to that of milk replacer.

Plaque formation at the rumen mucosa was unaffected by ERD or partially replacing roughage by concentrates and generally low in all calves.

40|$|Veal calves in Europe are {{typically}} fed {{large quantities of}} milk replacer and small amounts of <b>solid</b> <b>feed,</b> a diet known {{to lead to the}} development of abnormal oral behaviours in these animals. These abnormal oral behaviours are thought to be an indication of frustration, chronic stress, and hence poor welfare. The present study investigated how different feeding strategies, differing in <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and milk replacer provision, affected the behaviour and welfare of veal calves across time. Four treatment groups (A–D) comprising of 12 Holstein–Friesian bull calves each (7. 6 ± 0. 1 weeks old and 54. 7 ± 0. 3 kg at arrival), penned in groups of three, were fed one of four amounts of a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> mixture, i. e. 50 % concentrates, 25 % fresh maize silage, and 25 % wheat straw (on dry matter [DM] basis) : A = 0, B = 9, C = 18, and D = 27 g DM/kg 0. 75 /d. Provision of milk replacer was adjusted to achieve similar average daily gain across treatments. Behaviour was recorded around feeding (10 min continuous focal observations of individual calves) and throughout the day (7 sessions of 30 min scan sampling at 5 min interval every 2 h from 06 : 30 h) every week for four months. In an attempt to find an easy practical method to measure behavioural response to feeding strategy, two 3 -min behavioural tests were carried out: (1) in months 1 and 3, calves were presented with a ball and latency to make oral contact with it was recorded; and (2) in month 1, calves were presented with an overall and time spent orally manipulating (i. e. chewing or licking) it was recorded using scan sampling every 10 s. Calves in treatment D displayed less abnormal oral behaviours around feeding, less tongue playing throughout the day, and more chewing in the first two months, compared to treatment A. Treatment B only led to lower tongue playing levels compared to A and treatment C had no benefit in terms of reducing abnormal oral behaviours. Although a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> dose–response was expected on the display of abnormal behaviours in veal calves, treatment C did not fit within this expectation. These findings point to a more complex relationship between <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and abnormal oral behaviour frequency in veal calves. The two behavioural tests distinguished the different treatments as expected, and thus showed a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> dose–response. Because of an increase in chewing and ruminating efficiency over time, amounts of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> should be increased with age to maintain high levels of chewing and ruminating.

In addition, {{the effect of}} a single daily feed of milk on worm burdens was assessed. Methods: Eight lambs were assigned to each of the 3 diets: milk (M), milk plus <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> (cereal-based pellets and lucerne chaff) (MS), or <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> only (S). Those to be fed <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> were converted from complete milk feeding to the designated diet during their third week of life. From 3 weeks of age, all lambs were infected with 1000 O. circumcincta larvae twice weekly for 6 weeks; 4 lambs from each diet group were given normal sheathed L 3 and another 4 were infected with exsheathed larvae. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations were monitored from Day 17 after first infection, and worm burdens and abomasal pH and morphology were determined at necropsy. Results: Total worm burdens and FEC were significantly lower in the M than MS and S groups, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} between those receiving sheathed and exsheathed larvae. The milk-fed lambs had a smaller reticulo-rumen and omasum and a more acidic abomasal pH. Serum gastrin and pepsinogen were increased in all groups, irrespective of diet or type of larvae used for infection. Conclusions: The cause of the lower worm establishment in lambs fed only milk was probably not failure to exsheath in the immature gastro-intestinal tract, as there were similar worm burdens in lambs whether sheathed or exsheathed larvae were administered. The lower pH of the abomasal contents of the preruminant lambs may have been a factor, as the parasites have previously been shown to die more rapidly in vitro at low pH. Alternatively, the milk itself had adverse effects on the parasites, but was ineffective when combined with <b>solid</b> <b>feed.</b> There was no benefit from feeding a milk plus solid diet over a solid diet...|$|E

There were 3420 neonates who were followed up by interviewing their mothers until 28 days after delivery. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of SIO. Results Compared to infants who were not given solid food, the relative risk (RR) of SIO for infants given food other than banana as early <b>solid</b> food <b>feeding</b> was 1. 87 (95 %CI 0. 48; 8. 24), while for infants given banana only as early <b>solid</b> food <b>feeding,</b> the RR was 9. 15 (95 %CI 1. 96; 42. 58). After the adjustments of birth weight, co- lostrum, and breast feeding, the odds ratio of SIO for infants given banana was 2. 99 (95 %CI 2. 65; 5. 14). Conclusion Banana as early solid food for neonates feeding is an important risk factor for the occurrence of SI...|$|R
