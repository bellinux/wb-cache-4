25|$|In London, Thomson renewed his {{acquaintance}} with Adolphe Smith, a radical journalist {{whom he had}} met at the Royal Geographical Society in 1866. Together they collaborated in producing the monthly magazine, Street Life in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text {{the lives of the}} <b>street</b> <b>people</b> of London, establishing social documentary photography as an early type of photojournalism. The series of photographs was later published in book form in 1878.|$|E
25|$|Thomson was an {{accomplished}} photographer in many areas, including landscapes, portraiture, street photography, and architectural photography, and his legacy {{is one of}} outstanding quality and breadth of coverage. His photography from the Far East enlightened the Victorian audience of Britain about the land, people, and cultures of China and South-East Asia. His pioneering work documenting the social conditions of the <b>street</b> <b>people</b> of London established {{him as one of}} the pioneers of photojournalism, and his publishing activities mark him out as an innovator in combining photography with the printed word.|$|E
25|$|Approaching {{the station}} {{from the town}} along Queen <b>Street,</b> <b>people</b> first saw the large goods shed.

The passenger station was situated to the south of these buildings. It originally consisted to two – later three – small train sheds covering separate platforms for trains running in each direction to Exeter, Plymouth, and Torquay. It was rebuilt in 1861 as a single station with a larger train shed covering all three platforms.|$|E

25|$|John Thomson (14 June 1837 – 29 September 1921) was a {{pioneering}} Scottish photographer, geographer, and traveller. He {{was one of}} the first photographers to travel to the Far East, documenting the people, landscapes and artefacts of eastern cultures. Upon returning home, his work among the <b>street</b> <b>people</b> of London cemented his reputation, and is regarded as a classic instance of social documentary which laid the foundations for photojournalism. He went on to become a portrait photographer of High Society in Mayfair, gaining the Royal Warrant in 1881.|$|E
25|$|The first actual {{demonstration}} of the day took place in New Zealand where 10,000 people demonstrated in Auckland and Wellington. The Auckland march was bigger than expected, forcing police to shut off Queen <b>Street.</b> <b>People</b> were reported to be still starting the march as those {{at the front of}} the march reached a rally in Myers Park several kilometres away. In Wellington the march had to carry on after the then planned end point as there were too many people to fit into the park. There were also protests in at least 18 other centres, including Dunedin, Thames, Opotiki, Whakatane, Whangarei, Timaru and Rotorua, and Picnic for Peace in Christchurch.|$|E
25|$|Thomson's {{travels in}} China were often perilous, as he visited remote, almost {{unpopulated}} regions far inland. Most {{of the people}} he encountered had never seen a Westerner or camera before. His expeditions were also especially challenging because he had to transport his bulky wooden camera, many large, fragile glass plates, and potentially explosive chemicals. He photographed {{in a wide variety of}} conditions and often had to improvise because chemicals were difficult to acquire. His subject matter varied enormously: from humble beggars and <b>street</b> <b>people</b> to Mandarins, Princes and senior government officials; from remote monasteries to Imperial Palaces; from simple rural villages to magnificent landscapes.|$|E

25|$|The {{second of}} the Dublin car bombs went off at about 17:30 on Talbot Street, near the {{intersection}} with Lower Gardiner Street. Talbot Street was the main route from the city centre to Connolly station, Dublin's primary railway station. It was parked at 18 Talbot Street, on the north side, opposite Guineys department store. The bomb car was a metallic blue mink Ford Escort, registration number 1385 WZ. It had been stolen that morning in the Docks area of Belfast. The blast damaged buildings and vehicles {{on both sides of}} the <b>street.</b> <b>People</b> suffered severe burns and were struck by shrapnel, flying glass and debris; some were hurled through the windows of shops.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study in}} Western societies, {{homeless}} people have a higher prevalence of mental illness {{when compared to the}} general population. They also {{are more likely to be}} alcoholics and suffer from drug dependency. It is estimated that 20–25% of homeless people, compared with 6% of the non-homeless, have severe mental illness. Others estimate that up to one-third of the homeless suffer from mental illness. Studies have found that there is a correlation between homelessness and incarceration. Those with mental illness or substance abuse problems were found to be incarcerated at a higher frequency than the general population. Fischer and Breakey have identified the chronically mentally ill as one of the four main subtypes of homeless persons; the others being the <b>street</b> <b>people,</b> chronic alcoholics, and the situationally distressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos {{were used to}} enhance the text rather than {{to act as a}} medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, John Thomson, in the late 1870s. In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, Street Life in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the <b>street</b> <b>people</b> of London and established social documentary photography as a form of photojournalism. Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant medium for the imparting of information, successfully combining photography with the printed word.|$|E

25|$|In Philadelphia, the Independence Transportation Center {{was built}} in part due on a 2007 survey by the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, which {{concluded}} that many tourists arrived by bus and that some Chinatown buses disruptively parked on the <b>street.</b> <b>People</b> living closer to Chinatown bus stops in Philadelphia's Chinatown {{were more likely to}} complain about the buses. Similarly, in Washington, D.C., interim bus loading regulations were enacted in 2008 due to complaints about disruptive bus layovers. In Boston in 2004, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority required Chinatown buses to make stops inside South Station and to have permits. Although Fung Wah Bus Transportation was often ticketed for curbside parking offenses in Boston, they eventually became one of two Chinatown buses headquartered in South Station (besides Lucky Star Bus) because the fines for curbside parking were becoming higher than the South Station terminal fees.|$|E

However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs. Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. [...] "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately." [...] Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. [...] "His business mind was fascinating.

500|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the election, the Heart of Uptown Coalition and a Shiller {{supporter}} who was director of the Center for <b>Street</b> <b>People,</b> 4455 N. Broadway, organized a voter registration drive that registered 80 homeless people using the Center's address, and on election day fed them a meal at a local church hall and helped them vote. Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People's spokesman explained [...] "We think Jerry Orbach is a lovely man, but he doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the development...If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. We decided that Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement." [...] Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People's construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987 Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.|$|E
