When the fluid layer thickness is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer depth, the azimuthal velocity axial gradient is nearly constant and this rotating disk flow is a torsional Couette flow. As in the plane Couette flow or the cylindrical Couette flow, transition to turbulence occurs via the appearance of turbulent domains inside a laminar background. Nevertheless, we show that in the rotating disk case, the nucleation of turbulent spirals is connected to the birth of structural defects in a periodic underlying <b>spiral</b> <b>roll</b> pattern...|$|E
40|$|Linear and weakly {{nonlinear}} {{thermal convection}} in a moderately thin spherical shell {{in the presence}} of a spherically symmetric gravity subject to a spherically symmetric boundary condition is systematically investigated through fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. The convection problem is self-adjoint and the linear convective stability is characterized by l, the degree of a spherical harmonics Y-l(m) (theta, phi). While the radial structure of the linear convection is determined by the stability analysis, there exists a (2 l+ 1) -fold degeneracy in the horizonal structure of the spherical convection. When l=O(10), i. e., in a moderately thin spherical shell, the removal or partial removal of the degeneracy represents a mathematically difficult, physically not well-understood problem. By starting with carefully chosen initial conditions, we are able to obtain a variety of nonlinear convective flows at exactly the same parameters near the onset of convection, including steady axisymmetric convection, steady azimuthally periodic convection, steady azimuthally nonperiodic convection, equatorially asymmetric convection, and steady convection in the form of a. single giant <b>spiral</b> <b>roll</b> covering the whole spherical shell which is stable and robust for a wide range of the Prandtl number...|$|E

Previous work dealt with numerical modeling of a new engine topology used in the above engine and various work on improved heat exchangers. Recently, morn modeling suggests that cooling powers {{in the range of}} 35 kW (10 ton) may be possible with an engine having a longest dimension of 4 ft. and that efficiency improves significantly with size. Also, we have solved some fabrication problems with our high temperature nickel heat exchangers. The major work this year has been on the high temperature thermoacoustic stack structure. A common Stirling engine regenerator structure consisting of stacked disks cut from stainless steel wire mesh was tested in an apparatus previously used for high amplitude heat exchanger measurements. Stacks are very easy to construct in this fashion and longitudinal thermal conduction is greatly reduced. Results show that amplitude performance is very good and within 10 % of the usual <b>spiral</b> <b>roll</b> structures. More impressively, the efficiency of the mesh stack is as much as 30 % higher than for spiral rolls stacks.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{concerns}} Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille {{flows in}} a narrow-gap cavity for six {{different combinations of}} rotational and axial Reynolds numbers. The in-house numerical code has been first validated in a middle-gap cavity. Two sets of refined LES results, using the Wall-Adapting Local EddyViscosity(WALE) and theDynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale models availablewithin an in-house code based on high-order compact schemes, have been then compared with no noticeable difference on the mean flow field and theturbulent statistics. The WALE model enabling a saving of about 12 % of computational effort has been finally used to investigate the influence on the hydrodynamics of the swirl parameter N within the range [1. 49 − 6. 71]. The swirl parameter N, which compares the effects of rotation of the inner cylinder and the axial flowrate, does not influence significantly the mean velocity profiles. Turbulence intensities are enhanced with increasing values of N with remarkably high peak values within the boundary layers. The inner rotating cylinder has a destabilizing effect inducing asymmetric profiles of the Reynolds stress tensor components. The rotor and stator boundary layers exhibit the main characteristics of two-dimensional boundary layers. Turbulence is also mainly at two-component there. Thin coherent structures appearing as negative (resp. positive) <b>spiral</b> <b>rolls</b> are observed along the rotor (resp. stator) side. Their inclination angle depends strongly {{on the value of}} the swirl parameter, which fixes the intensity of the crossflow. On the other hand, the intensity {{and the size of the}} coherent structures observed within the boundary layers are governed by the effective Reynolds number. For its highest value, they penetrate the whole gap. Finally, the results have been extended to the non-isothermal case in the forced convection regime. A correlation for the Nusselt number along the rotor has been provided showing a much larger dependence on the axial Reynolds number thanexpected from previous published works, while it depends classically on the Taylor number to the power 0. 145 and on the Prandtl number to the power 0. 3...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} on {{sustainability of}} energy resources since the Brundtland Report (Brundtland report) has spurred much research into alternative energy technologies across the globe. The Malaysian government, without exception, through government research bodies and public universities has continued its encouragement towards {{the exploration of}} sustainable production, processing, and utilization of its resources. Thermo acoustics technology, currently viewed as a potential replacement for the conventional refrigeration systems {{is one of the}} research area being pursued. With almost no moving parts, no hazardous refrigerants, and considered as “low technology” with no critical dimensions, a thermo acoustic cooling system may indeed be the answer to the ecological threat posed by the production of harmful refrigerants that is related to global warming and the thinning of the ozone layer. Thermo acoustics theory is a field associated with either a temperature gradient induced by oscillations, or oscillations induced by a temperature gradient. The former is an everyday event with negligible temperature gradients of the order ~ 10 - 4 °C produced by sound waves. The latter was probably first observed by European glass blowers over 200 years ago when sound was sometimes heard when a hot glass bulb was attached to a cooler glass tube. The practical usefulness of the phenomenon, however, has only been realized in the late eighties with the first cryocooler probably made by Hofler in 1985 (Hofler, 1986). The last twenty years have seen fast developments in research into the thermo acoustics effects and systems. Theoretical and experimental works are many in developed countries with numerical studies slowly catching up due much to the nonlinearities and multidimensional effects that have to be addressed. NASA and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) USA had successfully developed a high efficiency power source based on thermo acoustic technology, while Ben and Jerry in collaboration with Penn State University in USA developed an ice cream refrigerator with 120 Watt power (Garret et al. 1993 and www. benjerry. com). The stack of the thermo acoustic system is considered as the heart of a thermo acoustic system. Development and continuous improvement of it can thus lead to a better overall performance of a thermo acoustic system. The heat transfer process crucial to thermo acoustic effects occurs in and near the stack region and current technology of the stack material and geometry has room for improvement based on the background completed. Figure 7. 1 shows the stack’s position within a simple cylindrical resonator and the associated temperature difference, ?T, across the stack that developed as a result of compression and expansion of the fluid particles generated by a speaker/driver. Various researchers have recommended various stack gaps using latest discovery of the best performance stack material (i. e. Mylar). Theoretical analysis has shown that a pin-array stack performed better than a parallel plate stack but the <b>spiral</b> <b>roll</b> stack, however, is probably the easiest to be fabricated. Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) through research grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOSTI) has been involved in thermo acoustic research since 2002.

Variation of parameters such as the stack thickness and separation gap and their effects on the temperature difference across the stack are investigated...|$|E

40|$|Derivation of literal approximations to the {{aircraft}} dynamic modes {{remains one of}} the central problems in the theory of aircraft flight dynamics, and one that has never been satisfactorily resolved. Although approximations to the fast modes (short period, roll) are generally good, the slow modes (phugoid, dutch <b>roll,</b> <b>spiral)</b> seem to have several competing approximations, none of which are uniformly satisfactory. This paper examines the fundamental assumptions behind the traditional approach to the derivation of literal approximations. A major flaw in all previous derivations resulting in incorrect slow-mode approximations is uncovered. In following a formal procedure, improved literal approximations are derived for the slow modes. In this process, a new condition for onset of directional departure is obtained, which is related to the dutch-roll frequency.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} investigation of the steady convective flow in a horizontal channel of rectangular cross-section subjected to a uniform longitudinal temperature gradient imposed at the walls. It is shown that at zero Prandtl number {{the solution of the}} problem corresponds to a plane-parallel flow along the channel axis. In this case, the fluid moves {{in the direction of the}} imposed temperature gradient in the upper part of the channel and in the opposite direction in the lower part. At non-zero values of the Prandtl number, such solution does not exist. At any small values of Pr all three components of the flow velocity differ from zero and in the channel cross-section four vortices develop. The direction of these vortices is such that the fluid moves from the centre to the periphery in the vertical direction and returns to the centre in the horizontal direction. The stability of these convective flows (uniform along the channel axis) with regard to small three-dimensional perturbations periodical in the direction of the channel axis is studied. It is shown that at low values of the Prandtl number the basic state loses its stability due to the steady hydrodynamic mode related to the development of vortices at the boundary of the counter flows. The growth of the Prandtl number results in the strong stabilization of this instability mode and, beyond a certain value of the Prandtl number depending on the cross-section aspect ratio, a new steady hydrodynamic instability mode becomes the most dangerous. This mode is characterized by the localization of the perturbations near the sidewalls of the channel. At still higher values of the Prandtl number, the <b>spiral</b> perturbations (<b>rolls</b> with axis parallel to the temperature gradient) become the most dangerous modes, at first the oscillatory spiral perturbations and then the Rayleigh-type steady spiral perturbations. The influence of the channel width on these different instabilities is also emphasized...|$|R
