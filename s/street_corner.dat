5|$|The memorial's {{location}} {{on a busy}} <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> has caused it to deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent clean-up and restoration projects.

5|$|Irene Cara, {{a former}} student of the Performing Arts, was cast as Coco Hernandez. Parker was not {{impressed}} with Cara's musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film's music composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student but had been expelled from the school for disruptive behavior. Simkin had discovered Ray breakdancing on a <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> in Harlem before asking him to audition for a role in the film.|$|E
5000|$|Interestingly, the {{struggle}} over free speech on downtown <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> was regarded as absurd by many people, since there were myriad other areas {{in the public sphere}} that allowed outdoor speaking to take place—downtown <b>street</b> <b>corners,</b> though, were outlawed. The fight over the <b>street</b> <b>corners,</b> therefore, became a symbol of the divisive ideology of the IWW—their opponents scornfully argued that the <b>street</b> <b>corners</b> were important to the Wobblies only because they could not reach an audience elsewhere since nobody would willingly attend any of their speeches.|$|R

5|$|The third highest-grossing film of its decade, Mom and Dad was {{claimed by}} Babb {{to have made}} $63,000 for every $1,000 the {{original}} investors contributed, and the Los Angeles Times estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million. Its success spawned a number of imitations, such as <b>Street</b> <b>Corner</b> and The Story of Bob and Sally, that eventually flooded the market, {{but it was still}} being shown around the world decades later and ultimately was added to the National Film Registry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E

5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted palm tree. Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that homosexuality is a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5|$|The largest mass {{shooting}} {{perpetrated by}} the Einsatzgruppen {{took place on}} 29 and 30 September 1941 at Babi Yar, a ravine northwest of Kiev, a city in Ukraine that had fallen to the Germans on 19 September. The perpetrators included a company of Waffen-SS attached to Einsatzgruppe C under Rasch, members of Sonderkommando 4a under SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and some Ukrainian auxiliary police. The Jews of Kiev were told to report to a certain <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> on 29 September; anyone who disobeyed would be shot. Since word of massacres in other areas had not yet reached Kiev and the assembly point was near the train station, they assumed they were being deported. People {{showed up at the}} rendezvous point in large numbers, laden with possessions and food for the journey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Andrić's death, the Belgrade apartment where {{he spent much of}} World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andrić. As Yugoslavia's only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andrić was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works were long shunned for nationalist reasons, and even briefly blacklisted following Yugoslavia's dissolution, but were rehabilitated by the literary community {{at the start of the}} 21st century. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature.|$|E

5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to get rich because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made {{his way back to the}} North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{involvement}} with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, {{general manager of the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster tube station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1998, Deuteronomium {{recorded}} {{their first}} studio album titled <b>Street</b> <b>Corner</b> Queen under their label. With this release {{they wanted to}} be pioneering and experimented with black metal and different styles such as reggae, funk metal, rap and others seldom heard in extreme metal. They also tried writing as artistic lyrics as possible without hiding the message, using everything from bonsai trees to ravens as metaphors about social issues. The album was distributed through label's catalogue and almost worldwide in Christian bookstores. <b>Street</b> <b>Corner</b> Queen was released on May 20, 1998. The release gig was held in the rock club Lutakko with Hallowed as the support act.|$|E
