2500|$|In France, {{the period}} {{following}} the Wars of Religion saw {{the appearance of}} a new form of narrative fiction (which some critics have termed the [...] "sentimental novel"), which quickly became a literary sensation thanks to the enthusiasm of a reading public searching for entertainment after so many years of conflict. These short (and realistic) novels of love (or amours, as they are frequently called in the titles) included extensive examples of gallant letters and polite discourse, amorous dialogues, letters and poems inserted in the story, gallant conceits and other rhetorical figures. [...] These texts {{played an important role in}} the elaboration of new modes of civility and discourse of the upper classes (leading to the notion of the noble honnête homme). [...] None of these novels have been republished since the early 17th century, and they remain largely unknown today. [...] Authors associated with les Amours were Antoine de Nervèze, Nicolas des Escuteaux and François du <b>Souhait.</b> Meanwhile, the tradition of the dark tale—coming from the tragic short story (histoire tragique) associated with Bandello, and frequently ending in suicide or murder—continued in the works of Jean-Pierre Camus and François de Rosset.|$|E

He became [...] "secrétaire ordinaire" [...] to Charles III, Duke of Lorraine (between 1600 et 1605), and later Henry I, Duke of Lorraine (from 1608), {{and several of his}} works are {{dedicated}} to high-ranking members of the Lorraine court, including Princess Catherine of Lorraine and the brothers François de Bassompierre and Je(h)an de Bassompierre. Du <b>Souhait</b> lived for many years in France, but he was apparently banished in 1614 for having contributed to a scabrous satirical poetry collection.

5000|$|Du <b>Souhait</b> was {{the author}} of seven novels, a {{collection}} of short stories (for which he is today most well-known), a collection of poems, a pastoral, a tragedy in 5 acts, a translation of the Iliad, and several works of moral and didactic philosophy. Of his seven novels, only his first two seem to have had a certain commercial success (four editions each, both in Paris and Lyon). As a novelist, Du Souhait's early works participated in the same tradition of the [...] "sentimental novel" [...] as authors Antoine de Nervèze and Nicolas des Escuteaux, although Du <b>Souhait</b> differs from these authors both in his content (he paints a far less idealized portrait of love and includes occasional satirical/realistic elements) and in his sometimes awkward style (especially in his [...] "tit-for-tat" [...] gallant dialogues). Like these other authors, in his later works Du <b>Souhait</b> moved away from the sentimental toward the longer adventurous novel with pastoral elements. Du Souhait's ear for oral discourse and his satirical side are most apparent in his short story collection Histoires comiques ou entretiens facetieux (Paris, 1612). Du <b>Souhait</b> also contributed laudatory poems to the prefatory material of works by Timothée de Chillac and Pierre de Deimier.|$|E

Another large-scale vocal composition was the oratorio Agar (1875) by Georges Pfeiffer for soli, chorus and orchestra, which was published in full score. Other orchestral scores include a number of works by Anaïs de Perrin de Lange in 1877 and 1880, an 1880 reprint of the Fantaisie fantastique op. 12 (1856) by Ninette Nicolò, the third piano concerto op. 86 (1883) by Georges Pfeiffer and Stances for violin and orchestra (1887) by Jules Wiernsberger.|$|R

50|$|Father <b>Souhait</b> was {{a student}} of {{architecture}} before taking up Holy Orders. He played a large part {{in the design of}} the church building, modelling it on the pilgrimage church in Lourdes, France. The design of the church follows the style of a Gothic architecture. Gothic architecture grew out of the period in European history when the church had become established as the religious and political power in Europe. In this sense, Gothic architecture is an expression of a movement as much as it is a specific style of construction. This church exhibits the Gothic style is many of its features, including the nave, transepts, sanctuary, and ribbed dome.|$|E
5000|$|Nervèze is {{representative}} of a younger generation following on the literary developments of French novelists Nicolas de Montreux and Béroalde de Verville, and he is often associated [...] - [...] along with authors Nicolas des Escuteaux and François du <b>Souhait</b> [...] - [...] with the sentimental novels (or [...] "amours") published {{during the reign of}} Henry IV. Nervèze wrote ten novels, of which one is a reworking of a story taken from Ariosto's Orlando furioso and one is a reworking of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered. Nervèze dedicated his novels to high-ranking members of the nobility around the king: Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully; Queen Marie de Médicis; the marquis de Rosny; the vicomte d'Aubeterre.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{his contemporaries}} Antoine de Nervèze and François du <b>Souhait,</b> Des Escuteaux {{is one of}} the authors most often {{associated}} with the so-called [...] "sentimental novel" [...] (or [...] "amours") published during the reign of Henry IV of France. Unlike these other authors, Des Escuteaux was not a prince's secretary and he apparently only worked on novels and not on plays or works of moral philosophy. The first five novels by Des Escuteaux were dedicated to noble ladies, but it is unsure to what degree he profited from their patronage. These ladies were: Renée de Cossé, who was the daughter of Artus de Cossé, the wife of Charles of Montmorency and the cousin of Charles II de Cossé, duc de Brissac; Isabel de Rochechoüart (dame de Lesé); Lucrèce de Boüillé (mademoiselle de Créance); Jeanne de la Brunetière (dame de Vaudoré); and Catherine de Mars (comtesse douairière de Caravas).|$|E
500|$|Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour {{was assumed}} to have been {{responsible}} for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed [...] "P. Darmancour". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les <b>Souhaits</b> Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen {{years old at the time}} the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for [...] "La Belle au bois dormant", which the paper had published in 1696.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere {{is growing}} concern that {{flooding}} {{is becoming more}} frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network. Suite au sentiment d'une aggravation du risque d'inondation en Europe, il devient important de mieux comprendre les mécanismes en jeu. L'article présente une revue bibliographique des connaissances sur cette question, d'abord sur la détection de changements dans le régime des crue, puis dans la simulation du régime futur sous hypothèse de scénarios climatiques. Il est souligné l'importance de travailler sur des longues séries de façon à bien prendre en compte les oscillations climatiques, de rechercher des causes physiques aux changements détectés, et d'introduire dans les simulations une étape de validation sur les données anciennes et de prise en compte de rétro-effets. L'article se termine par le <b>souhait</b> de mise en place d'un réseau de recherche européen sur l'étude des changements dans le régime des crues...|$|E
