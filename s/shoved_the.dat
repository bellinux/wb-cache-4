5|$|On April 25, 2014 at the Berkeley Springs High School {{theater in}} West Virginia, James headlined the Covey Promotion 3rd Annual Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony, {{as she was}} {{inducted}} into the Covey Pro Hall Of Hame Class of 2014. The next day, during the All or Nothing 8! event which was aired on May 17 as the 154th episode of Covey Pro TV, James was interrupted during an interview by Amber Rodriguez, who mocked James on her legitimate pregnancy and gave her a pie as a tease, and in return, James <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> pie in Amber's face. Jessie Belle Smothers came to the rescue and battled Rodriguez as James was escorted out by security. Two months after giving birth to her child, James returned to in-ring competition at Queens Of Combat 3 on November 30, where she defeated Tessa Blanchard. On May 16, James debuted for First State Championship Wrestling (1CW) unsuccessfully challenging Kacee Carlisle for the 1CW Women's Championship after getting herself disqualified.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, strange vignettes began airing {{advertising}} Hardy's {{return to}} TNA under his OMEGA character, Willow. He made his TNA return at Lockdown, in the Lethal Lockdown match {{as part of}} Team MVP. He then appeared on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, facing Rockstar Spud. In the following weeks, {{he would continue to}} feud with Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud, leading to a tag-team match between them (with Kurt Angle as Willow's partner) at Sacrifice on April 27, Willow and Angle would go on to win that match. On the May 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated James Storm by disqualification when Storm <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> referee and as Storm made his way up the ramp, Mr. Anderson appeared and hit Storm with the Mic check. On the May 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow's match against Magnus ended in a DQ when Bram interfered and handcuffed Willow to the bottom rope and started to hit him with a metal turnbuckle. On the May 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated both Magnus and Bram in a two on one handicap match. On the May 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, Willow defeated Magnus in a Falls Count Anywhere match.

25|$|On October 25, 1957, several masked gunmen murdered Anastasia {{while he}} was sitting in the barber shop at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. As Anastasia sat in the barber's chair, the three assailants rushed in, <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> barber out of the way, and started shooting. The wounded Anastasia {{allegedly}} lunged at his killers, but only hit their reflections in the wall mirror. Anastasia died at the scene. Many historians believe that Gambino ordered caporegime Joseph Biondo to kill Anastasia and Biondo gave the contract to a squad of Gambino drug dealers led by Stephen Armone and Steven Grammauta.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in a 3–1 Supercopa de España first-leg victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou. Having {{received}} a yellow card for taking his top off during his goal celebrations, he was sent off for a second yellow card offence minutes later before he <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> referee lightly to depict his dissatisfaction. He was handed a five-match ban following the game. In his 400th game for Real Madrid, Ronaldo scored two goals against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions league, taking his tally to 411 goals. On 23 October, Ronaldo claimed his fifth FIFA Player of the Year award by receiving The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.|$|E
25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Tazz (ECW) and Tajiri (WWF). The match started with Tajiri {{performing}} a spinning heel kick, and a standing moonsault. Tazz fought {{back with a}} head and arm suplex. Tajiri then escaped a suplex attempt, and performed kicks and punches. Tazz fought back with a clothesline. After Tazz applied a cross armbar, and performed a flapjack spinebuster, Tajiri fought back with a handspring back elbow. Tazz then pulled Tajiri off the apron, and sent him into the ringsteps. Back in the ring, Tajiri applied the Tarantula, and dropkicked Tazz, who was kneeling. Tazz then blocked a kick, and performed a capture suplex. He then <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> referee out of the way, allowing Tajiri to spit green mist into Tazz's face, and pin him after a Buzzsaw Kick.|$|E

25|$|Diaz {{made his}} debut for EliteXC in Hawaii on September 15, 2007 on Showtime. He won a hard fought split {{decision}} over his opponent Mike Aina. MMA Weekly reported that Nick Diaz signed a two-year deal with EliteXC {{and in his}} next fight, fought striking specialist KJ Noons for the vacant 160 pound title. Once the fight began, the two exchanged rather evenly on the feet until Noons dropped Diaz with a well timed right counterpunch. Diaz attempted several takedowns, {{all of which were}} stuffed by Noons, on one occasion with a swift right knee which opened up a notable gash on Diaz's face, eventually resulting in a loss via doctor stoppage due to multiple cuts on his forehead. A disappointed Diaz left the arena immediately and on his way out he flipped off the doctor from the arena entrance and <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> camera out of his face.|$|E
25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then girlfriend, two men <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> two {{back into the room}} and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} match, Lex Luger defended the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat in a No Disqualification match. However, Luger protested and wanted the match to occur with count-outs and {{disqualifications}} in effect. Steamboat agreed. Steamboat started the match {{with a bunch}} of roll-ups. Steamboat delivered several moves to dominate {{the early part of the}} match. Luger kicked Steamboat out of the ring and attacked him outside the ring but Steamboat delivered a Chop to Luger. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Mongolian Chop but Luger countered with many of high-impact moves. He made a pinfall attempt but got a near-fall. He got another near-fall and complained that he was not getting a fast count. He started clotheslining Steamboat and argued with referee Tommy Young. Steamboat took advantage and delivered a Crossbody for a near-fall. Luger started regaining momentum by hitting power moves on Steamboat. Steamboat countered Luger and delivered a Diving Mongolian Chop but got a near-fall. Luger stayed with the ropes. Steamboat tried to attack Luger but Luger delivered a Back Body Drop to Steamboat, sending him into the other ring. Luger <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> referee and brought a chair. Steamboat delivered a Catapult to Luger and started attacking Luger with a chair to get disqualified. As a result, Luger won the match and retained the United States Heavyweight Championship. Steamboat continued to attack Luger with the chair after the match.|$|E

500|$|Late on February 29, 2008, {{according}} to a report given by the Catholic News Service, Archbishop Rahho was [...] from his car in the Al-Nur district of the city; his bodyguards and driver were killed. [...] According to church officials, [...] "gunmen sprayed the Archbishop's car with bullets, killed two bodyguards and <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> bishop into the trunk of a car. In the darkness, he managed to pull out his cellphone and call the church, telling officials not to pay a ransom for his release" [...] they said. [...] "He believed that this money would not be paid for good works and would be used for killing and more evil actions," [...] the officials said. Other reports stated that also investigators believed the archbishop may have been shot {{at the time of the}} kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{played an}} intense {{overtime}} period filled with end-to-end rushes and brilliant saves by the goaltenders. [...] At one point, Canada's Guy Lafleur put a shot on net that snuck through the Czechoslovak goaltender, but Ivan Hlinka deliberately <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> net {{out of place}} before the puck crossed the line. [...] He received a delay of game penalty, but prevented a Canadian win. [...] A few moments later, Guy Lapointe rifled a low shot that again beat Dzurilla, however this goal was also disallowed as the buzzer had sounded to end the first ten-minutes of the overtime period one-tenth of a second before it crossed the line. International rules of the time dictated that play was to be stopped at the ten-minute mark of each overtime period and the teams would switch {{the side of the}} ice they defended. [...] During the break, Canadian assistant coach Don Cherry noted to his team that Dzurilla often came far out of his net to defend and could be beaten on a shot from a sharp angle.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Alejandro" [...] on her 2009–11 The Monster Ball Tour. It was {{the fourth}} song of the set list on the North American leg of the tour. However, on the European and British legs of the tour the song was performed {{towards the end of}} the show. The live performance saw her wearing a silver bodysuit and then being carried by her crotch by one of her male dancers and lowered onto another male dancer, engaging in a threesome with them. During the performance at San Diego, California, Gaga incorporated the city's name in the song, later commenting [...] "I am so lucky that San Diego rhymes with 'Fernando' and 'Alejandro'." [...] Ted Shaw of Windsor Star commented that [...] "Songs like 'Alejandro', 'Teeth' and 'Monster' <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> sex act in your face." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy from The Gazette said that [...] "the song followed in fast order, with not quite enough to set [...] apart. It was one choreographed dance number after the next." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone commented that the performance was [...] " [...] of several moments [...] that gave parents in the audience consternation." [...] Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News compared Gaga's performance of the song with that of an erotic dancer.|$|E

500|$|Ars Technica panned the new Tablet mode {{interface}} {{for removing}} the charms and app switching, making the Start button harder to use by requiring users {{to reach for}} the button on the bottom-left rather than {{at the center of the}} screen when swiping with a thumb, and for making application switching less instantaneous through the use of Task View. Microsoft Edge was praised for being [...] "tremendously promising", and [...] "a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows8 as being a [...] "reliable" [...] platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows10 was considered [...] "the best Windows yet" [...] and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be [...] "comfortable and effective" [...] across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch. ExtremeTech felt that Windows10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that [...] "it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> throttle to maximum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Realizing {{something}} urgent {{needed to}} be done or he would potentially have dead prisoners on his hands, the warden moved Burns to another jail and told the remaining women that the strike was over. [...] He also ordered Burns to be force fed. Historian Eleanor Clift recounts that the force feeding of Lucy Burns required [...] "five people to hold her down, and when she refused to open her mouth, they <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> feeding tube up her nostril." [...] This treatment was extremely painful and dangerous, causing Burns to have severe nosebleeds. [...] Of the well-known suffragists of the era, Burns spent the most time in jail.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} In Your House pay-per-view, Razor Ramon and the 1–2–3 Kid had been {{scheduled}} against the WWF Intercontinental Champion [...] Jeff Jarrett and his Roadie but as the Kid was unable to wrestle due to the Kid's (legit) neck injury, the match was changed to a Handicap match, which Ramon won. After the match, an unknown man, later revealed as Savio Vega, attacked both Jarrett and The Roadie before being escorted backstage. During a match between Vega and Jarrett on Raw, Roadie pushed Vega into guest commentator Shawn Michaels, who in turn <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> Roadie away and later on attacked both Roadie and Jarrett. At the same time, Jarrett also focused on his music career. On the July 1, 1995 episode of Superstars of Wrestling, Jarrett's music video, [...] "With My Baby Tonight", premiered for the first time. The music video played over again at forthcoming WWF shows during July 1995.|$|E

It was the last album released under Nothing Records, as the label was dissolved following {{a lawsuit filed by}} Reznor against his former manager and business partner, John Malm. The compilation was supported by the [...] "Against All Gods Tour", as well as a single–a cover of Depeche Mode's [...] "Personal Jesus". It was the first and only tour to feature Mark Chaussee of Rob Halford's Fight on lead guitar, replacing John 5, whose relationship with Manson had soured over the previous year. During the band's performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> guitarist. John 5 responded in anger, throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song.

2500|$|His Newman/Haas car {{was much}} less {{reliable}} the following year, 1994, and results suffered. It was during this season that Mansell [...] "wore out his welcome" [...] in the United States with glimpses of rude behaviour, particularly after he was knocked out of the Indianapolis 500. After the crash, he {{stormed out of the}} track hospital, and refused medical care. When reporter Dr. Jerry Punch asked Mansell if he had spoken with Dennis Vitolo, the driver who had crashed into him, Mansell replied, [...] "You speak to him" [...] and <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> camera away. Subsequently, Mansell was due to sign autographs at a K-mart store (the primary sponsor of his car), but {{because of a lack of}} demand the event was cancelled. Mansell was also the catalyst for the breakdown in the relationship between himself and Mario Andretti. Mario has since remarked [...] "I guess if Ronnie Peterson was the best team-mate I ever had, Nigel Mansell was the worst" [...] and [...] "I had a lot of respect for him as a driver, but not as a man".|$|E
2500|$|To bolster his {{increasing}} popularity, MGM frequently paired {{him with}} well-established female stars. Joan Crawford asked {{for him as}} her co-star in Dance, Fools, Dance (1931). He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as A Free Soul (1931), in which he played a gangster who <b>shoved</b> <b>the</b> character played by Norma Shearer; Gable never played a supporting role again. The Hollywood Reporter wrote [...] "A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star... Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen". He followed that with Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931) with Greta Garbo, and Possessed (1931), in which Crawford (then married to Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and he steamed up the screen. Adela Rogers St. Johns later dubbed Gable and Crawford's real-life relationship as [...] "the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down". Louis B. Mayer threatened to terminate both their contracts, {{and for a while}} they kept apart. Gable shifted his attentions to Marion Davies. However, Gable and Garbo disliked each other. She thought he was a wooden actor, while he considered her a snob.|$|E
