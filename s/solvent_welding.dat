40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} has become essential {{in many areas}} in the United States. Currently there is over 37. 5 million miles of natural gas distribution lines. A large majority of these lines are polyethylene pipes. With such {{a large percentage of}} polyethylene lines in use gas companies are continually looking for ways to improve repair procedures. 	The focus of this work was two fold. One of the objectives was to mechanically characterize the squeeze-off of polyethylene pipe, assess damage (if any) to the pipe and use this information in the design of a squeeze-off tool {{that could be used in}} a keyhole (18 inch diameter hole) by a single operator. Equations were developed to predict required squeeze-off forces under different conditions, such as temperature, tool radius, squeeze-rates, and swivel versus fixed jaws.

The second objective was the development a patch consisting of a solvent swollen polyethylene film that can be applied to a live natural gas line, in a keyhole if necessary.

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} spirometric obstructive pulmonary function impairment among {{workers who}} were occupationally exposed to organic solvents, iron oxide dust, or welding fumes. Data were collected from records of periodic health examinations of workers. In total, 448 Korean male work-ers were enrolled and classified into three exposure groups: exposure to organic solvents, iron oxide dust, or welding fumes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association be-tween occupational exposure and pulmonary function. Compared to exposure to organic solvents, exposure to iron oxide dust {{was significantly associated with}} obstructive pulmonary function im-pairment (odds ratio [OR], 9. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 20 – 41. 97). The group exposed to welding fumes did not show a significantly higher OR compare to those exposed to organic solvents (OR, 2. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 74 – 10. 8).

Purpose The aim of this case–control study {{was to assess the}} relationship between the risk of musculoskeletal con-genital malformations in offspring and paternal workplace exposure to potential health hazards during the precon-ception period. Method The study comprised 105 patients (cases) with a musculoskeletal congenital malformation(s) and 135 con-trols matched for age and demographic characteristics. Both parents of each case and control were interviewed in the hospital by a trained physician. They also completed a questionnaire focusing on the preconception period and on the 3 -month period immediately before and after the pregnancy conception date, respectively, of the child under study. Results The odds of having a child with a congenital malformation was higher (P 0. 05) if the father was occupationally exposed to pesticides, <b>solvents,</b> or <b>welding</b> fumes during the preconception period.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{discover}} a method to investigate the properties of interfaces as described by a numerical physical model. The model used was adopted from literature and applied to a commercially available multiphysics software package. By doing this the internal properties of simple structures could be elucidated and then readily applied to more complex structures such as valves and pumps in laminate microfluidic structures. A numerical finite element multi-scale model of a cohesive interface comprised of heterogeneous material properties was used to elucidate irreversible damage from applied strain energy. An unknown internal state variable was applied to characterize the damage process. Using a constrained blister test, this unknown internal state variable could be determined for an adherend/adhesive/adherend body. This is particularly interesting for laminate systems with microfluidic and microstructures contained within the body. A laminate structure was designed and fabricated that could accommodate a variety of binary systems joined using nearly any technique such as adhesive, <b>welding</b> (<b>solvent,</b> laser, ultrasonic, RF, etc.), or thermal. The adhesive method was the most successful and easy to implement but {{also one of the}} more difficult to understand, especially over long periods of time. Welding methods are meant to achieve a bond that is similar to bulk properties and so are easier to predict. However, methods of welding often produce defects in the bonds [...] Examples of the test structures used to elucidate the internal properties of the model were shown and demonstrated. The real life examples used this research to improve upon current designs and aided in creating complex structures for sensor and other applications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} subsequent characterization {{of a series of}} oriented, highly ordered laminated composite materials. These laminated composite materials all possess order over varying length-scales from angstrom level molecular chain orientation to macro-scale order in woven fabrics. In each case, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO 2) is used as a unique reaction medium and processing aid allowing for the development of structures not previously attainable with standard techniques. The goal of this research is two-fold, the first goal involves the proof of concept, exhibiting the ability to attain novel composite structures using unique SC CO 2 chemistries and processes. The second goal of this research is aimed at developing a thorough understanding of how these unique structures and morphologies translate into an overall mechanical response for the material. ^ This work will be divided into three distinct but interrelated projects. The first project involves the development of a unique SC CO 2 assisted <b>solvent</b> <b>welding</b> technique. This technique is then applied towards the fabrication of a quasi-isotropic laminate comprised of a series of solvent-welded uniaxially-oriented linear low density polyethylene films (LLDPE). The geometry of this laminate is designed to exploit the improved strength and rigidity of uniaxially oriented LLDPE films while suppressing undesireable transverse properties. ^ The second project to be addressed in this project involves the development of fiber-reinforced composites with unique nano-scale morphologies. The long-range order in these composites has profound effects on both the individual fiber properties as well as the overall composite properties. ^ The final project of interest in this work involves the development of intercalated silicate nano-composites with high clay content. In order to achieve the desired morphologies it is necessary to create polymer/clay nano-composites with very high clay content, approaching 50 % clay. This level of clay content is not currently possible with conventional techniques due to viscosity limitations. The focus of this project is to employ SC CO 2 as a reaction medium and a processing aid in the in-situ intercalation of silicate nano-composites with high clay content. Subsequent efforts in this area involve the orientation of these structures through the fabrication process itself or through post-reaction processing. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{concept of}} {{reducing}} laboratory operations in scale {{such that they}} fit on a microfluidic chip has been met with great enthusiasm. Lab-on-a-chip devices promise to be cost effective to operate due to reduced reagent consumption, {{have the potential to}} offer shorter analysis times due to their short path lengths, and may be useful in biological applications in that they are inherently compact and inexpensive to build, thus they may be disposable. In this work, a series of fabrication techniques for the production of polymer-based microfluidic devices are explored. In the first component of this research effort an aluminum mold was fabricated using CNC machining to create the desired microchannel design, followed by a two-stage embossing process, involving two polymer substrates with different glass transition temperatures (Tg), polyetherimide (PEI; Tg 216 oC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; Tg 105 oC). Successful feature transfer from aluminum mold to PMMA substrates was achieved reproducibly employing this method. With this approach, the expensive process of producing the aluminum master need be performed only once. Electrophoretic separations of fluorescent dyes, rhodamine B and fluorescein were performed on the PMMA microchips, with peak efficiencies of 55500 and 66300 theoretical plates/meter, respectively. The next stage of work explored a new bonding method by <b>solvent</b> <b>welding</b> using ice as sacrificial layer to prevent channel deformation. Water {{is one of the most}} compatible sacrificial media; it is readily available, non toxic, has a low evaporation rate, a high freezing point relative to the bonding solvent, and a low melting point which makes it easier to flush out after sealing, as compared to using other sacrificial media (paraffin wax or low-melting temperature alloys). The bonded PMMA microchips could withstand an internal pressure of > 2000 psi, more than 17 times stronger than the thermally bonded chips. In the final stage of work a new bonding technique was developed that readily produces complete microfluidic chips, without the need of a sacrificial layer to form complete multilayer microfluidic devices. Also developed was the use of an SU- 8 master in the two-stage embossing process to create microchannels. This approach is faster, simpler and less costly than CNC machining. The fabrication technique was utilized to build a microfluidic liquid chromatography (LC) system that was shown to generate high separation efficiencies of 10, 000 - 45, 000 plates/m. In addition, a passive micromixer containing high-density microfeatures was fabricated to perform a glycine assay using O-phthaldialdehyde.
