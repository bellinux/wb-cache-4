40|$|In {{distributed}} environments, {{collaboration is}} often achieved {{with the help}} of services. To enable automatic service trading, semantically expressive, automatically comparable, flexible, and editable <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> are needed. Our analysis shows that only ontology-based <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> like DAML-S offer the necessary expressiveness and flexibility. Unfortunately, up to now, DAML-S offers just a generic framework and lacks support for creating and editing appropriate <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> for specific classes of services. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach to improving the usability of DAML-S. The two main building blocks of our approach are a process and a tool. The process guides through the steps necessary to create adequate <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> by introducing a layered ontology of services. The graphical tool, DINST, implements these ideas, thus offering a comfortable way to edit <b>service</b> <b>descriptions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Service {{discovery}} {{is a critical}} task in service-oriented architectures. GRIMOIRES is a UDDI-compliant service registry with rich metadata annotation capabilities. In this paper, we present a WSRF-compliant extension of the GRIMOIRES architecture that exposes <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> and their metadata annotations as WS-Resources. By doing so, the service registry provides improved interoperability by allowing service descrip-tions to be accessed and managed via standard Web services oper-ations. In particular, we can access <b>service</b> <b>descriptions,</b> manage the lifetime of <b>service</b> <b>descriptions,</b> and subscribe for notifications of change in <b>service</b> <b>descriptions.</b> The paper discusses the benefits and design choices associated with such an approach and the technical challenges in providing an implementation.

40|$|Abstract—Web Services is a {{technology}} for building distributed software applications that are built upon {{a set of}} information and communication standards. Among those standards is the Web <b>Services</b> <b>Description</b> Language (WSDL) which is an XML-based language for describing <b>service</b> <b>descriptions.</b> <b>Service</b> providers will publish WSDL documents of their Web services so that service consumers can learn about service capability and how to interface with the services. Since WSDL documents are {{the primary source of}} service information, readability of WSDL documents is of concern to service providers, i. e., <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> should be understood with ease by service consumers. Providing highly readable <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> can then be used as a strategy to attract service consumers. However, given highly readable information in the WSDL documents, competitors are able to learn know-how and can copy the design to offer competing services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} service {{clustering}} and uses <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> to construct probabilistic models for service clustering. We discuss how <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> can be enriched with machine-interpretable semantics {{and then we}} investigate how these <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> can be grouped in clusters {{in order to make}} discovery, ranking, and recommendation faster and more effective. We propose using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (i. e. two machine learning techniques used in Information Retrieval) to learn latent factors from the corpus of <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> and group <b>services</b> according to their latent factors. By creating an intermediate layer of latent factors between the <b>services</b> and their <b>descriptions,</b> the dimensionality of the model is reduced and services can be searched and linked together based on probabilistic methods in latent space. The model can cluster any newly added service with a direct calculation without requiring to re-calculate the latent variables or re-train the model. ...|$|R

Detailed <b>descriptions</b> of context-altering <b>services</b> are necessary, and manually adapting them to the local environment is a tedious and error-prone process. We present a method for automatically providing <b>service</b> <b>descriptions</b> by observing and learning from {{the behavior of a}} service with respect to its environment. By applying machine learning techniques on the observed behavior, our algorithms produce high quality localized <b>service</b> <b>descriptions.</b> In a series of experiments we show that our approach, which can be easily plugged into existing architectures, facilitates context-awareness without the need for manually added <b>service</b> <b>descriptions.</b> ...|$|R
