40|$|The {{pollution}} haven debate fractures along three fault lines: scope, methodology, and values. The {{scope of}} the pollution havens question must go beyond the original definition (intentional use of lax environmental regulations to attract foreign investment) to include a broader assessment of the transfer of environmental risk. Whether attributed to governmental policy or to the behavior of firms, or both, environmental risk can be transferred as hazardous products, processes, wastes, or displaced resource extraction. Researchers mistrust each other's methodologies, especially as the conventional economic analyses consider value discussions about global environmental justice issues outside their jurisdiction. This author questions whether the transfer of environmental risk {{is the result of}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> consciously exchanging cost for adequate compensation; or alternatively, an unethical export of environmental hazard to vulnerable societies.

Similarly, countries were not commonly {{supposed to go}} bankrupt and, therefore, government bonds are usually considered a good proxy of risk-free rates, notwithstanding the more or less recent cases of default and debt restructuring {{that have occurred in}} several emerging countries. Consequently, <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> models were mainly addressed to deepen interest rate or liquidity risk, rather than default risk.

40|$|Both {{academia and}} {{practitioners}} long shared {{the belief that}} default {{on the part of}} a sovereign entity was an extremely rare event. A similarly strong opinion was also that countries could not go bankrupt and, therefore, government bonds could be considered a good proxy of risk-free rates, notwithstanding the more or less recent cases of default and debt restructuring that have occurred in emerging countries. Consequently, <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> models were mainly oriented towards the analysis of interest rate or liquidity risk, rather than default risk. Within the approaches used to measure the possible default of a sovereign issuer, a fundamental role is played by rating agencies, which issue “Sovereign Credit Ratings” consisting of an assessment of a State’s future capability and willingness to fulfil its obligations towards its creditors. Both academics and practitioners agree that country risk is multidimensional, and the traditional measures and sovereign ratings from specialised agencies are unable to capture the specific risks of the different countries. This is especially true after the international financial crisis, which has triggered a negative spiral between sovereign risk and the credit risk of banking intermediaries, exhibiting the different transmission channels through which sovereign risk affects bank funding. Rises in sovereign risk adversely affect banks’ funding costs through several channels, due to the pervasive role of government debt in the financial system. Three major international agencies – Moody’s Investor Service, Fitch Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s – consider and assess these event risks differently in order to determine their sovereign credit rating. Starting from summer 2011, tensions in sovereign credit rating were quickly transmitted to the banking systems. In fact, sovereign downgrades have direct negative repercussions on the cost of banks’ debt and equity funding, because this is a channel through which sovereign risk adversely affects banks’ funding costs. In particular, sovereign ratings generally represent a ceiling for the ratings of domestic banks. This complex of factors has brought into the limelight, within the financial system, the so-called country risk, and has shown that the determinants of this risk have become more complex (sovereign debt structure and composition, the EMU countries sharing the euro currency and monetary policy, the ratings from the ECAIs – the External Credit Agency Institutions, etc.), intensified, and strongly interrelated as a consequence of the international financial crisis.

This empirical study complements earlier research by explicitly examining cross-security and cross-country contagious rating effects of credit rating agencies’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments.</b> In particular, the specific impact of sovereign rating changes during the financial turmoil in emerging markets {{in the latter half of}} the 1990 s has been examined.

It investigates in a first attempt {{the consequences of the}} planned revisions on the two central aspects of international bank credit flows: the impact on capital costs and the volatility of credit supply across the risk spectrum of borrowers. The empirical findings cast doubt on the usefulness of credit ratings in determining commercial banks' capital adequacy ratios since the standardized approach to credit risk would lead to more divergence rather than convergence between investment-grade and speculative-grade borrowers. This conclusion is based on the lateness and cyclical determination of credit rating agencies' <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and the continuing incentives for short-term rather than long-term interbank lending ingrained in the proposed Basel II framework...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} to which extent rating events influence sovereign bond yield spreads and overall financial market volatility. While rating agencies are {{part and parcel}} of today?s financial markets, the study succeeds in tracing some independent effect that ratings exert on financial market prices. First, our Granger causality test cautions against overestimating the independent longrun impact that sovereign credit ratings exert on the financial-market <b>assessment</b> of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk,</b> however. The financial market and the two leading rating agencies appear broadly to share the same model in that assessment. As indicated by the explanatory power of the equations that underlie the causality test, dollar bond spreads and a set of default determinants seem to explain somewhat better the level of credit ratings than vice versa. The mutual interaction between sovereign yield spreads and ratings may be characterised by the nature of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> (requiring <b>assessments</b> on present and future willingness rather than only ability to pay), the information content of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> ratings (?contaminating? rating changes with other publicly-available news) and the industrial organisation of the rating industry (introducing an upward bias in sovereign ratings). Second, contrary to our expectations, our event studies find a highly significant announcement effect 2 ̆ 013 obviously muted by strong market anticipation 2 ̆ 013 when emerging-market sovereign bonds are put on review with negative outlook. The result may surprise, beyond the above considerations, because the rating of these bonds is fairly new to the industry; this lack of experience is reflected by a high degree of split ratings. Negative rating announcements seem also to be effective in the aftermath of rating deteriorations (possibly not fully captured by the length of our observation window), as investors are incited to reorient their portfolios. Positive rating events, by contrast, do not seem to have a significant announcement effect on dollar bond spreads. However, significant effects were found on changes in volatility levels of yield spreads and stock market returns. Third, these findings imply that the sovereign rating industry has the potential to help dampen excessive private capital inflows into the emerging markets with negative rating announcements. Positive announcements, by contrast, do not seem to exert a significant impact on <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> and thus are unlikely to add to the Harberger externality, even though they tend to reduce volatility in both bond and stock markets. For two reasons, even this conclusion must be cautioned however. The econometric analysis of rating decisions seems sensitive to the sample period chosen and the proxy variable for <b>sovereign</b> country <b>risk.</b> And even if rating agencies have the potential to dampen excessive inflows, our analysis does not provide information whether the agencies would provide negative rating announcements in time...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{casualties}} {{in the aftermath of}} the attacks on September 11 has been global confidence in the Middle East. Sovereign risk- the credit <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> to the obligations of central governments is believed to have increased. In response, credit rating agencies like Moodys and Standard and Poor (S&P) have revised their ratings or placed specific countries on their watch list, a move which normally precedes a credit downgrade.

40|$|The authors analyze {{some aspects}} of the market for Brady bonds (restructured debt in {{developing}} countries). They focus on how the debt crisis in Mexico in 1994 affected <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> (as measured by the stripped spread) in other Brady countries, especially Poland. Their main finding: The risk premium (in a single country) has a behavior (one unit root), consistent with the hypothesis that it reflects new market information. Among stripped yields, co-movements of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> premia were stronger during the period of highest volatility in the Mexican crisis. In the case study of Mexico and Poland, they do not reject cointegration for the period July 1994 -July 1995; they do reject it for July 1995 -July 1996. The crisis had a strong permanent effect on <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> in Mexico (about 55 basis points). Different Brady bonds responded differently to the Mexican crisis. Countries with similar pre-crisis means and volatility reacted similarly (in terms of absolute deviation and the degree of co-movement with the Mexican bonds). Other factors (region, oil producers, date of Brady deal) did not explain observed patterns. There was convergence of volatility during the highly volatile period of the Mexican crisis. These results suggest that traders'behavior in assessing the <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> of Brady countries is not constant over time, and responds especially to the level of market uncertainty. Herd behavior increases with risk, leading (in a volatile environment) to even more volatility. Learning is likely to spill over because traders have limited experience with, and limited information about, developing countries. The decrease in co-movements of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> premia in the second period of the sample could indicate that markets were learning -that is, gathering information about, and experience in, the developing countries, so that the issue of learning spillover was less relevant. But it could also signal that no relevant shock existed to generate such spillover effects, although the market was still vulnerable to country-specific shocks. On that issue, further research is needed.

Using a sample of 45, 864 Eurozone firms (2005 - 2012), we find that trade credit received increases when <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> becomes higher, but only before the crisis. However, during the crisis, trade credit supply decreases as <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> increases.

We show that this conventional wisdom rests on one implicit assumption: that assets cannot be retraded in secondary markets.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} ensuing recession have caused a sharp deterioration in public finances across advanced economies, raising investor concerns about <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk.</b> The concerns have so far mainly affected the euro area, where some countries have seen their credit ratings downgraded during 2009 − 11 and their funding costs rise sharply. Other countries have also been affected, but to a much lesser extent. Greater <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> is already having adverse effects on banks and financial markets. Looking forward, <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> concerns may affect {{a broad range of}} countries. In advanced economies, government debt levels are expected to rise over coming years, due to high fiscal deficits and rising pension and health care costs. In emerging economies, vulnerability to external shocks and political instability may have periodic adverse effects on <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk.</b> Overall, risk premia on government debt will likely be higher and more volatile than in the past. In some countries, sovereign debt has already lost its risk-free status; in others, it may do so in the future. The challenge for authorities is to minimise the negative consequences for bank funding and the flow-on effects on the real economy. This report outlines the impact of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> concerns on the cost and availability of bank funding over recent years. It then describes the channels through which <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> affects bank funding.

We find that by taking it into account, the credit rating estimation improves. Our estimation assigns a higher <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> to the new European Union member states, whereas the old European Union member states see their <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> decreased...|$|R

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{financial crisis}} of 2008 has shaken the very foundations of modern financial theory, which {{rested on the}} hypothesis that financial markets were efficient. Since markets have been inconsistently pricing <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk,</b> recent studies suggests {{that there may be}} “multiple equilibria” between <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> prices and underlying fundamentals. As a consequence, scientific papers focus on analyzing government risk and its determinants. For this purpose, most studies employed parametric models in order to examine the impact of variables on <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk.</b> However recent scientific studies suggest that these parametric models are not an appropriate approach to model the non-linear dynamics of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> markets. In this study there are two different modeling techniques applied in order to verify whether non-parametric models estimate <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> measures more accurately than parametric models. Moreover, it is aimed to expose indications of multiple equilibria on the European <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> markets based on an ex-post analysis. In order to evaluate estimation accuracy and explanatory power of parametric and non-parametric models, there are 16 different European sovereigns assessed by regarding an estimation error indicator. Indications of multiple equilibria are exposed by focusing on dynamics of determinants and with respect to the individuality of European sovereigns. For this purpose, we employed a three-stage panel data analysis. The empirical results revealed complex and dynamic European <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> markets. We found that non-parametric models generally connect more accurately underlying fundamentals to actual spreads than generic parametric models, even though qualitatively are both models similar. The dynamics of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> markets is manifested in alternating sensitivity of certain fundamentals as well as in time-varying risk determinants, which indicates an inconsistent perception of the market equilibria. Finally, we found that market participants distinguish consciously the geographical affiliation of a sovereign by charging discernible risk premium. The empirical results suggest that since global financial crisis debt-related macro variables have been gaining in importance. In particular, we found in combination with high unemployment rate countries reflect high likelihood of default. This finding may provide valuable early warning signals to countries that move towards dangerous risk paths...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> is {{the risk}} of a {{government}} being unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations, or reneging on loans it guarantees. Many countries have faced <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> in the late-2000s global recession. The existence of such risk means that creditors should take a two-stage decision process when deciding to lend to a firm based in a foreign country. Firstly one should consider the <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> quality of the country and then consider the firm's credit quality.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{main purpose}} of this article is to analyze how <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> {{influences}} the loan supply reaction of banks to monetary policy through the bank lending channel. Additionally, we aim to test whether this reaction differs in easy and tight monetary regimes. Using a sample of 3, 125 banks from the euro zone between 1999 and 2012, we find that <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> plays an important role in determining loan supply from banks during tight monetary regimes. Banks in higher <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> countries reduce lending more during tight regimes. However, we find little evidence to support any relationship between <b>sovereign</b> <b>risk</b> and loan supply reaction to monetary policy expansions. These results are very interesting for the way monetary policy is conducted in Europe. Banking union, banking system strength, and the budget control of governments would be necessary measures to reduce the heterogeneous transmission of the monetary policy in the euro zone...|$|R
