5|$|Worcestershire had {{an unusually}} large number of exclaves (see Fig 1), which were {{cut off from the}} main county and {{completely}} surrounded by the nearby counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire (Detached) and Oxfordshire. This relationship with neighbouring counties mirrored the confusing and fragmented layout of parishes within Worcestershire's own hundreds (<b>See</b> <b>images</b> and table below). The most notable islands were Dudley, Evenlode, Blockley and the area around Shipston-on-Stour. Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Shropshire had their own exclaves within the main part of Worcestershire at Rochford, Broome, Clent, Tardebigge (Tutnall and Cobley) and Halesowen respectively. Tardebigge's history outside the county is even more colourful, changing hands from Worcestershire to Staffordshire and Warwickshire, before returning to Worcestershire at differing times over the centuries. The southern boundary of the county was also complex, with parish boundaries penetrating deep into Gloucestershire and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The SS service medals were {{manufactured}} by two firms Deschler of Munich and Petz & Lorenz of Unterreichenbach. The medals were die struck {{and had a}} metal composition of different alloys such as bronze, tin, copper and zinc. All levels of the long service awards were held on blue ribbons (<b>See</b> <b>images).</b> The 12 years and 25 years service class awards normally had the SS runes service branch embroidered into the ribbons (<b>See</b> <b>images).</b> These awards were presented in a black case, which bore white or silver wash SS runes posted on the top center of the box cover. Both medals, the twelve and twenty-five-year medals, have the tear-drop suspension loop.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of forcings imposed on it, the climate system will still show {{internal}} variability (<b>see</b> <b>images</b> opposite).

25|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) relies on the paramagnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to <b>see</b> <b>images</b> of changing blood flow in the brain associated with neural activity. This allows images to be generated that reflect which brain structures are activated (and how) during performance of different tasks or at resting state. According to the oxygenation hypothesis, changes in oxygen usage in regional cerebral blood flow during cognitive or behavioral activity {{can be associated with}} the regional neurons as being directly related to the cognitive or behavioral tasks being attended.|$|E
25|$|The use of spheres {{is often}} for convenience, being limited both by {{graphics}} libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to <b>see</b> <b>images</b> of surfaces {{that have been}} colored to show quantities such as electrostatic potential. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces, solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces, and isosurfaces. The isosurface in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms {{to be seen and}} identified and {{it is not easy to}} deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.|$|E

25|$|Until 1980, the {{structure}} of the rings of Saturn was explained as being caused exclusively by the action of gravitational forces. Then images from the Voyager spacecraft showed radial features in the B ring, known as spokes, which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings was not consistent with gravitational orbital mechanics. The spokes appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light (<b>see</b> <b>images</b> in Gallery); the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60°. The leading theory regarding the spokes' composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by electrostatic repulsion, as they rotate almost synchronously with the magnetosphere of Saturn. The precise mechanism generating the spokes is still unknown, although {{it has been suggested that}} the electrical disturbances might be caused by either lightning bolts in Saturn's atmosphere or micrometeoroid impacts on the rings.|$|E

Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also <b>see</b> <b>images,</b> but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the [...] "tape" [...] does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during [...] to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, like a kind of telepathy.|$|E

[...] To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a packing material. [...] To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. [...] Depending on their purpose, distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4.|$|E
