5|$|In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. On 25 February 1933, {{based on}} the report by the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan's {{invasion}} had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the organization's judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day. Immediately following, Japan also withdrew from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, thus removing all restrictions on the number and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> capital ships. Haruna was reactivated and assigned to the First Battleship Division on 20 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was half the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fellow speakers {{and she wore}} huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise {{to those of us}} who'd heard her speak.|$|E

50|$|Fenn {{published}} several {{volumes of}} what we would now call picturebooks that employed woodcuts. <b>Her</b> sense <b>of</b> the visual layout <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books was keen and she carefully dictated to her publishers the margins and font <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books.|$|R
25|$|In her {{autobiography}} Crespin analyses {{the difficulties}} she {{found in the}} recording process, and notes that the Decca engineers called her, affectionately, 'the French cannon' due to the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice.|$|E
25|$|Captain Edward Dyer {{received}} a letter of marque on 14 March 1805. She was supposedly engaged in the fisheries between 1805 and 1807, but the scale of her armament and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew was more consistent with privateering.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 1794 Tarleton and Gilbody {{received}} a new letter of marque. Now she carried slightly fewer guns, {{and she had}} a crew of 36 men, half the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earlier crew, suggesting that she had stopped privateering.|$|E

50|$|Queens {{regulate}} the sex ratios of the broods {{depending on the}} time in the cycle; earlier in the cycle there is a female bias and later in the cycle there is a male bias in the sex ratio. In addition, the queen must manage the body <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> daughters as well. It is possible that this is done by allocating different amounts of pollen to the different broods. Generally, female worker bees are smaller than the foundress bees that come along in the reproductive broods later on. Queens also stop foraging once the first brood emerges.|$|R
5|$|On 25 February 1933, {{following}} {{a report by}} the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan's invasion of China had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the judgement of this organization, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations on the same day. Japan also immediately withdrew from the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, thus removing all restrictions on the numbers and <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> capital warships. In November 1934, Kongō was placed in Second Reserve in preparation for further modifications. On 10 January 1935, Kongō was toured by the Nazi German naval attaché to Japan, Captain Paul Wenneker, as part of a gunnery demonstration.|$|R
25|$|Brooks {{expanded}} {{the size of}} James Madisons crew to some 70 officers and men. He also had them armed, using borrowed funds. The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew was anomalously large for a Revenue Marine vessel, suggesting that Brooks had intended to engage in privateering.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, Price {{underwent}} {{surgery in the}} United States to reduce the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breast implants and also had rhinoplasty. However, she was {{not happy with the}} results of her breast implants, so returned to Beverly Hills, California in July 2008 for corrective surgery. She returned to the United Kingdom with much smaller size 32C breasts.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{a statue}} of her {{was placed on the}} area of the former Perth Esplanade, now Elizabeth Quay. The statue {{references}} her opposition to the filling in of Mounts Bay for the freeway interchange, but neither addresses that site or her more famous defence of Kings Park. The statue has been criticised both for the youthful appearance given her and the small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> umbrella.|$|E

5000|$|Kettlewell - A bad cook {{who often}} has a sudden desire to 'deck' people - hence [...] "I'll deck yer!". She has muscles the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> potatoes, and <b>her</b> special dish is the garlic pasty, {{much to the}} chagrin of the other Rottentrolls.|$|R
25|$|Captain Matthew Smith took {{command in}} 1808, and Comus {{continued}} off the Portuguese coast {{and in the}} Mediterranean. On 5 February she captured sundry Danish vessels at St. Ubes (Setubal, Portugal). The vessels Comus captured were the Ovenum, Martha Beata, Aufgehende Sonne, Finegheden, Johannes, Soe Blomstedt, Speculation, Haabet, Fortuna, Bragernes and Magdalena. The initial distribution of prize money amounted to ₤12,000. Given the small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew, {{this resulted in a}} notable amount even for an ordinary seaman.|$|E
25|$|As Britain {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wartime fleet {{after the end of}} the Second World War, several Colossus-class ships were placed into reserve, while work on the Majestic class was initially halted at the end of the war, then restored to a low-priority status. Demands for fiscal cutbacks, combined with the rapid obsolescence of the carriers by the development of jet aircraft, saw four of the eight Colossuses and all five completed Majestics sold off to other nations.|$|E
25|$|Wright, {{who was one}} of Thomas' {{subordinates}} at the EEOC {{until he}} fired her, told Senate Judiciary Committee staff that Thomas had repeatedly made comments to her much like those he allegedly made to Hill, including pressuring her for dates, asking her the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts, and frequently commenting on the anatomy of other women. Wright said that after she turned down Thomas for a date, Thomas began to express discontent with her work and eventually fired her. Thomas said that he fired Wright for poor performance and for using a homophobic epithet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to study optimal trading strategies in a limit order book, as typically arise when a trader has {{a block of}} shares to liquidate and she submits limit orders. The execution of limit orders is uncertain, {{which leads to a}} stochastic control problem. In contrast to previous literature, we allow the trader to choose both the quotes and the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> submitted orders. Great attention is paid to how the trading strategy is affected by an order book’s characteristics, market volatility and the trader’s risk attitude. We prescribe an optimal splitting <b>of</b> the order <b>size,</b> which is new in the literature on optimal trade execution where this problem is solved only in the case of market orders, {{and at the same time}} we offer guidelines to optimally place orders further behind the best price or to (re) position them more aggressively. Thus this paper is the first attempt towards a more realistic modeling of optimal liquidation throughout limit orders...|$|R

50|$|In early 2009 the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and Rivercruise Ireland {{could not}} reach agreement. DDDA then offered the Department of Defence use of the ship as a {{training}} vessel for free (as a replacement for the sunken Asgard II), but the offer was turned down. The Department of Defence declared the Jeanie Johnston unsuitable because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lack <b>of</b> speed, <b>her</b> required crew <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 11 and <b>her</b> inability to participate in tall ships races.|$|R
25|$|Kudrow {{attended}} Portola Middle School in Tarzana, California. In 1979, {{at the age}} of 16, she underwent rhinoplasty {{to reduce}} the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose. She graduated from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles where then N.W.A. member Eazy-E also attended. Kudrow received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Vassar College, intending to follow in her father's footsteps and research headaches. Kudrow worked on her father's staff for eight years while breaking into acting, earning a research credit on his study on the comparative likelihood of left-handed individuals developing cluster headaches.|$|E
25|$|Lord Belmore bought James Madison on 16 June 1813 {{and had her}} {{converted}} from schooner to brig rig. He also renamed her Osprey, with home port of Killybegs in Donegal. Later, Belmore had her armed; her warrant as a letter of marque against the United States named Richard Chambers as master and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew as 30 men. However, it bore the date 27 August 1814, which ex post was quite late in the war. There is no sign in either the London Gazette or Lloyd's List of Osprey taking any prizes.|$|E

5000|$|Post-production at SoHo was {{originally}} {{planned to take}} approximately three days, but it was extended to two weeks. Gabor Jurina, the photographer responsible for the digital retouching of the actual photographs taken of Betts during the shoot, supplied the post-production team with 118 digital stills of the intermediate stages of the transformation from the [...] "real" [...] photograph of the made-up Betts to the final image shown on the billboard. These were re-cut and assembled to create the functions shown in the [...] "Photoshopping" [...] sequence, such as stretching Betts's neck and adjusting the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>of</b> <b>her</b> facial features. Other post-production work included stabilising Betts's head {{in the center of}} the shot during the make-up sequence, covering certain continuity errors, creating and compositing the billboard advertisement, and constructing a false image-editing interface.|$|R

60|$|Then one of {{his companions}} got up and showed us his black cattle. The male slaves were chiefly lads, and the women young, well formed, and abominably hideous. The dealer pulled her blanket off one of them, and bade her stand up, which she did {{with a great deal}} of shuddering modesty. She was coal black, her lips were the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> sausages, <b>her</b> eyes large and good-humoured; the hair or wool on this young person's head was curled and greased into a {{thousand}} filthy little ringlets. She was evidently the beauty of the flock.|$|R
500|$|Furtado's manager Chris Smith {{stated that}} [...] "Big Hoops" [...] {{was an attempt}} to {{translate}} Furtado's versatility as [...] "a free-range artist", being [...] "free form; not contained versus a structured typical song." [...] As an in-joke to Smith's reaction to when he first heard the track, the song starts with the manager saying [...] "Time release the fresh", Furtado laughing at the phrase, and Interscope Records A representative Thom Panunzio replying “You’re 100 percent right Chris.” The title and intro, during which Furtado chants [...] "the bigger the better" [...] against a bass line, references the character finding strength in the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> earrings.|$|E
500|$|For the {{localization}} of the game, {{the team}} {{decided to give}} the character of Drippy a Welsh accent, citing comedian Rhod Gilbert as a reference point. Steffan Rhodri was ultimately cast as Drippy; the team immediately felt that he fit the role, during his first audition. The Fairy Godmother character was initially conceived as an [...] "older lady with a perm", which evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "mountain-like woman". The method that she uses to give birth, in which the offspring burst forth, was inspired by the process that sea anemones lay eggs. The character of Cassiopeia was conceived in a quick meeting, after which the background information and story documents were handed to Momose, who drew the character based on the information. Cassiopeia underwent various changes throughout development. In particular, Momose suggested possible alterations to her physical appearance, such as the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, and changing colors to reflect her emotions. The character Pea was named as a reference to the fairy tale The Princess and the Pea, while her Japanese name of Kokoru is a reference to the word [...]|$|E
500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do you understand it when people talk about [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E

25|$|Breast {{hypertrophy}} (macromastia and gigantomastia) {{does not}} respond to medical therapy; yet a weight-reduction regimen for the over-weight woman can alleviate some <b>of</b> the excessive <b>size</b> and volume <b>of</b> <b>her</b> abnormally enlarged breasts.
