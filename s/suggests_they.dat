5|$|Stauromedusae, small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have {{traditionally}} been classified {{as members of the}} Scyphozoa, but recent research <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E

5|$|Five years later, Harry and Sally find {{themselves}} on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged, which surprises Sally. Harry <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding {{that they will not}} be friends.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> see a play, which happens to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E

5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular field guide to North American mushrooms <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} guest appearances by James Earl Jones and Carrie Fisher. In {{contrast to}} previous guest stars, Jones takes a liking to Sheldon (Jim Parsons) {{and the main}} plot {{is focused on the}} two having a night out together. Fisher appears when Jones <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> knock on her door and run away. The episode received high ratings and mainly positive reviews, with many complimenting the cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|The opening title {{sequence}} {{is different from}} many other episodes in that Peter trips during the theme song and injures a stage dancer (consequently puncturing her lung). Also, Stewie comes towards the camera screen and <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> cut from the opening sequence.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> came from the planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between {{the appearance of the}} creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Brunette Coleman was a {{pseudonym}} {{used by the}} poet and writer Philip Larkin. In 1943, {{towards the end of}} his time as an undergraduate at St John's College, Oxford, he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name. The style he adopted parodies that of popular writers of contemporary girls' school fiction, but the extent of the stories' homoerotic content <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> were written primarily for adult male titillation.|$|E

5|$|Dredd {{suspects}} Ma-Ma {{is desperate}} to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is {{the centre of}} Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.|$|E
5|$|Hanada holes up in Misako's {{apartment}} and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening {{phone calls and}} forbidding {{him to leave the}} apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E

5|$|The Ashbridge {{family were}} English Quakers {{who lived in}} Chester County, Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century. Jonathan Ashbridge had been disowned by the Chester Meeting some time after the American Revolutionary War and died in Pennsylvania in 1782. Jonathan's wife, Sarah, arrived in Upper Canada in 1793 with her two sons, John and Jonathan, three of her daughters, and their families. Folklore <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> spent their first winter {{in the ruins of}} the old French fort, Fort Rouillé, near present-day Fort York.|$|E
5|$|The Chesepian {{were the}} {{historic}} indigenous {{people of the}} area now known as Tidewater in Virginia {{at the time of}} European encounter. Little is known about them but archeological evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> may have been related to the Carolina Algonquian, or Pamlico people. They would have spoken one of the Algonquian languages. These were common among the numerous tribes of the coastal area, who made up the loose Powhatan Confederacy, numbering {{in the tens of thousands}} in population. The Chesepian occupied an area which is now defined as the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>they,</b> like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
