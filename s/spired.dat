The throne is shaped like a boat with a <b>spired</b> {{pavilion}} in the middle. This elevated pavilion represents Mount Meru, the centre of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The throne is decorated with coloured enamels and stones as well as deva and garuda figures. The throne was once used for giving royal audiences.|$|E
500|$|Ansgars Church was {{the first}} church {{to be built in}} Odense since the Middle Ages. Completed in 1902, it was {{designed}} by Niels Jacobsen in the late Romanesque style in red brick on granite foundations. The cross-shaped interior is complemented by a <b>spired</b> bell-tower, [...] high. The Peace Church (Fredenskirke) consecrated in 1920 was so named in gratitude {{for the end of the}} First World War. The church was the work of Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint who went on to design Copenhagen's Grundtvig's Church.|$|E
500|$|At the {{entrance}} to the pagoda there are huge statues of guardians of the temple, known as chinthes which are leoglyphs (lion shaped glyphs). Out of the four entrances to the pagoda only the southern and western ones are in use. There are 550 glazed terra-cotta tiles inscribed with the Jataka tales fixed on three of the five terraces of the pagoda; the earlier count was 584 tiles of which some are not found now. The four flights of steps which provide access to the terraces leading to an octagonal platform over which the gilded stupa has been built. At the four corners of the top most terrace, smaller replicas of the main pagoda are affixed at their back side, fitted with four gilded kalashas or vases; similar replicas are also fixed at the corners in the lower terraces. At the base of the pagoda there are containers fitted closely and set in series, which have gilded bronze castings of plants and flowers, with alms bowls carved in stone in between. Around the exterior periphery of the pagoda there are several temples and wooden pavilions decorated with the pyatthat [...] (multi-tiered and <b>spired</b> roofs).|$|E
5000|$|Masonry spires: These {{are found}} on medieval and revival churches and cathedrals, {{generally}} with towers that are square in plan. While masonry <b>spires</b> on {{a tower of}} small plan may be pyramidal, <b>spires</b> on towers of large plan are generally octagonal. The <b>spire</b> is supported on stone squinches which span {{the corners of the}} tower, making an octagonal plan. The <b>spire</b> of Salisbury Cathedral is of this type and is the tallest masonry <b>spire</b> in the world, remaining substantially intact since the 13th century. Other <b>spires</b> of this sort include the south <b>spire</b> of Chartres Cathedral, and the <b>spires</b> of Norwich Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral and Oxford Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral {{originally}} had two <b>spires.</b> The <b>spires</b> (one north and one south) overlooked the entrance (west side) of the cathedral. In 1544 the two <b>spires</b> {{were destroyed by}} fire. The south <b>spire</b> was rebuilt, but the north <b>spire</b> {{was replaced by a}} simple gable roof. In 1640 a clock was built underneath the rebuilt <b>spire,</b> and from 1650 the famous Wallenrodt Library, donated by Martin von Wallenrodt, was situated underneath the gable roof.|$|R
500|$|Tall Gothic central <b>spires</b> {{remain at}} Salisbury and Norwich, that at Chichester having been rebuilt in the 19th century after its collapse. The <b>spire</b> of Salisbury at [...] is the tallest in Britain. It {{is also the}} tallest 14th-century <b>spire,</b> the tallest ashlar masonry <b>spire</b> (as against the {{openwork}} <b>spires</b> of Germany and France), and tallest <b>spire</b> {{in the world that}} remains from the Medieval period that has not been entirely rebuilt. However, it was greatly surpassed in height by the <b>spires</b> of Lincoln and Old St. Paul’s. At Lincoln, between the early 14th century and 1548, the central tower was surmounted by the tallest <b>spire</b> in the world at about 170 metres (557ft) but this fell in a storm. Lichfield Cathedral, uniquely in England, has three medieval masonry <b>spires.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{building}} is constructed of Oamaru stone, set on foundations of basalt breccia from Port Chalmers, with details carved by Louis Godfrey, who also did {{much of the}} woodcarving in the interior. The use of [...] "cathedral glass", coloured but unfigured glass pending the donation of a pictorial window for the rose window is characteristic of Otago's 19th-century churches, where donors were relatively few reflecting the generally [...] "low church" [...] sentiments of the place. Similar examples {{can be found in}} Lawson's churches throughout Otago. Notable among these are the former Wesleyan Church in Stuart Street, Dunedin (now used as a home for the Fortune Theatre), the <b>spired</b> Knox Church in the north of the city, and the Tokomairiro Presbyterian Church in Milton, said {{at the time of its}} construction to have been the southernmost building of its height.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point of}} debate {{at that time}} was that of the merits of urbanism. Again, of {{importance}} here were opposing views from abroad, namely the picturesque theories of town planning proposed by Viennese city planner Camillo Sitte, as put forward in his influential book City Planning According to Artistic Principles (1889) and the opposing classical-rational urbanism point of view also proposed in Vienna by Otto Wagner, heavily influenced by the Parisian model - under the directorship of Baron Haussmann from 1858 to 1870 - of driving wide boulevards through the old labyrinthine city with the intent of modernising traffic and waste management, as well as enabling the greater social control of the population. This debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever town planning design competition in 1898-1900 for the Töölö district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nyström (together with engineer Herman Norrmén), second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertil Jung and Valter Thomé. Nyström's scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two in the Sittesque style, with the street network adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck's competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments - and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael's Church in Helsinki, with numerous [...] "fantastic" [...] <b>spired</b> buildings. In the Töölö competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nyström, and completed in around 1923.|$|E

The wild park lay clear and bright in the moonlight, with strange, silvery {{radiance}} on the grass. The patches of timber, like <b>spired</b> black islands in a moon-blanched lake, seemed to harbor shadows, and places for bears to hide, ready to spring out. As Helen neared each little grove her pulses shook {{and her heart}} beat. Half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold. And all seemed glorious--the sailing moon, white in a dark-blue sky, the white, passionless stars, so solemn, so far away, the beckoning fringe of forest-land at once mysterious and friendly, and the fleet horses, running with soft, rhythmic thuds over the grass, leaping the ditches and the hollows, making the bitter wind sting and cut. Coming up that park the ride had been long; going back was as short as it was thrilling. In Helen, experiences gathered realization slowly, {{and it was this}} swift ride, the horses neck and neck, and all the wildness and beauty, that completed the slow, insidious work of years. The tears of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full. All that pertained to this night got into her blood.

Mary had once, on a like occasion, only said, 'it was very cold;' and looked to see whether the captain expected the monster to bear down on the ship. But the present iceberg put her in mind of the sublime aspirations which gothic cathedrals seem as if they would fain embody. And then, she thought of the marvellous interminable waste of beauty of those untrodden regions, whence yonder enormous iceberg was but a small fragment--a petty messenger--regions unseen by human eye--beauty untouched by human hand-the glory, the sameness, yet the infinite variety of perfect purity.
