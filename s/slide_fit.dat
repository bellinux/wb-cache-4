40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the sliding and the {{vibrating}} fretting tests mechanism of h-BN micro-particles when used as a lubricating grease- 2 additive. Design/methodology/approach: The fretting tests were conducted on steel/steel contacts using both vibrating fretting apparatus and the shaftsleeve <b>slide</b> <b>fitted</b> tester. The wear scars were characterized with profilometry. The tribological properties of grease- 2 compounded with h-BN additive were also compared to those obtained for the commercial product Militec- 4. Findings: The experiment showed significant differences between the results obtained from the vibrating fretting and the shaft-sleeve <b>sliding</b> <b>fitted</b> tests. Adding h-BN to the lubricant leads to a better performance in the shaft-sleeve slide regime than in the steel/steel vibrating test condition. Originality/value: The results of the experimental studies demonstrate the potential of h-BN as an additive for preventing fretting sliding, and can very useful for further application of compound grease- 2 with h-BN additive in industrial equipment...|$|R
50|$|Fittings {{that are}} not allowed to slip are made to diameters that prevent {{slipping}} and consequently the mating surfaces cannot be brought into position without force. For small bearings this is best done with a press because tapping with a hammer damages both bearing and shaft, while for large bearings the necessary forces are so great that there is no alternative to heating one part before fitting, so that thermal expansion allows a temporary <b>sliding</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|R

40|$|Direct-drive air-bearing slides {{have the}} {{inherent}} advantages of high positioning accuracy and smoothness of motion, {{but due to}} low damping in the air bearings, they generally lack dynamic stiffness. The rigidity of the drive, both statically and dynamically, can also be low compared to mechanical equivalents. In this paper, the dynamic response of an air-bearing <b>slide</b> <b>fitted</b> with a novel design of oil-lubricated squeeze film damper and driven by a fast-response, high-resolution control system is reported. The {{results show that the}} damper produces a substantial improvement in dynamic stiffness and that sufficient drive stiffness can be obtained to enable the slide to be used in some precision-machining applications...|$|R

5000|$|An {{example of}} such a design {{modification}} suffix is adding [...] "V" [...] or [...] "Z" [...] {{to the end of the}} part number to designate the variant of the part that is purchased [...] "less paint", [...] "less plating", [...] "with the holes not yet drilled", [...] "intentionally oversize by [...]01mm", or any of countless other modifications. The intent is usually that the feature in question (such as holes not yet drilled, or paint not yet sprayed) will be added at a higher assembly level; or that maintenance workers in the field will choose from a kit of undersize and oversize parts (such as bushings) in order to achieve a certain <b>fit</b> (<b>sliding</b> <b>fit,</b> light press fit, etc.).|$|R
50|$|In 1958, {{designs were}} {{finalised}} {{for a new}} fleet of boxvans with pressed steel sides, resembling an extended version of the 1957 four-wheel B van type. The new wagons had four <b>sliding</b> doors <b>fitted,</b> one on each corner, and were constructed from 1958 to 1959.|$|R
50|$|Slide cube {{projectors}} {{were popular}} {{at one time}} because the cubes were cheaper than trays and they allow for higher storage density - f.e. a book or drawer of 16 forty-slide cubes (640 <b>slides)</b> <b>fits</b> {{in the space of}} a single round tray that holds at most 140 slides.The stack storage and preview feature also makes for easier editing of slide shows; slides can be added or removed from the show without having to shift all of the remaining slides up or down in their slots one at a time.Some tray-based projectors (f.e. some Kodak round-tray and Hähnel straight-tray slide projectors) can use stack loaders to view a stack of slides, but they don't lend themselves to this type of operation and there is no associated storage system.|$|R
25|$|The system's {{vehicles}} {{consist of}} four {{different types of}} LRVs. All LRVs are 20.2 metres long and have 3 <b>sliding</b> doors <b>fitted</b> {{on the left side}} (when facing the running direction from inside). This means that island platforms (except the triangular platform at Siu Hong Stop) cannot be used at all in the LRT system.|$|R
40|$|Three {{engineering}} polymers (HDPE, UHMWPE, and Nylatron GS) {{have been}} studied at very high tensile strain rates (above 104 /s) using an expanding ring technique, which involves placing a thin ring of polymer as a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> around a hollow thick-walled cylinder. A blast wave generated by an exploding wire results in a pressure pulse acting on the internal wall of the cylinder. This pulse propagates through the cylinder wall and is partially transferred into the ring. The ring moves virtually instantaneously at a high velocity away from the cylinder and then decelerates under almost uniaxial tension {{as a result of}} the hoop stress. Measurements were made by photographing the ring using a high speed camera at 105 to 106 frames/s, from which the true stress-strain properties were determined. Comparisons have been made between results obtained from quasi static, split Hopkinson pressure bar, and expanding ring experiments...|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a shaft with {{a nominal}} {{diameter}} of 10 mm {{is to have}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the [...] "maximum material condition") and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} glow {{discharge}} for solution of certain mapping problems was described in 2002. According to a Nature news article describing the work, researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that gives tourists luminous route indicators. To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass <b>slide.</b> <b>Fitting</b> a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny glowing strip light. The approach itself provides a novel visible analog computing approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a {{glow discharge}} in a microfluidic chip.|$|R
5000|$|Nipples {{are also}} {{available}} separately from the cable, for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to the cable by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to the cable axis is required, the cable end may be finished with a brass ferrule or [...] "trumpet" [...] soldered to the cable. The barrel nipple will be a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> over the brass ferrule, and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples {{at each end of}} the cable, and avoidance of twisting of the inner cable. Applying heat to the inner cable for soldering may weaken the steel, and although soft soldering is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of the inner cable being damaged as a result. Silver soldering may require additional heat treatment of the wire to preserve the temper of it in order to prevent it from becoming too soft or too brittle ...|$|R
50|$|The Ghia {{models were}} {{similarly}} equipped to UK models, {{but only the}} 2.3-litre V6 models featured imported Ford alloy wheels. Ford 'Rostyle' steel rims were fitted to all 2.0 GL, Ghia and S models, optionally on the other models. New Zealand Ghia models, however, did not feature a steel <b>sliding</b> sunroof (<b>fitted</b> as standard on UK Ghia models), although some models did feature an aftermarket sunroof.|$|R

50|$|The cab {{arrangement}} was made especially convenient for the crew. The double roof {{was lined with}} teak while side louvre ventilators with roller <b>slides</b> were <b>fitted.</b> The cab front and sides had ventilating doors. Sliding louvres in the cab sides provided adequate weather protection while the lookout had hinged adjustable glass windscreens.

5000|$|The {{other main}} area of {{application}} for selective assembly is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the [...] "fit and finish" [...] of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application {{similar to the one}} above with the 12 mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the precision important (to produce the desired fit), but the accuracy is also important (because the 12 mm pin must interact with something else {{that will have to be}} accurately sized at 12 mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there is still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits—all sliding, but with varying resistance).|$|R

50|$|Plans {{had existed}} in 1901 to rebuild further F class locomotives, {{but these were}} {{scrapped}} and in 1902-03 a further six FB class locomotives were built, numbers 315 and 372-376. These locomotives differed from the other rebuilds in having a redesigned frame and piston valves {{in place of the}} original <b>slide</b> valves <b>fitted</b> to the earlier rebuilds. FA 9 also differed from the standard rebuilds in that its trailing truck had outside journal boxes instead of the internal type used on the other engines.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the next}} ferry {{built for the}} PJ & MS Co was of very similar {{dimensions}} and machinery, yet displaced two-hundred tons more. This discrepancy is because the Dee Why and Curl Curl had <b>sliding</b> doors <b>fitted</b> to their promenade decks, instead of swinging doors like those on the South Steyne. Spaces enclosed by sliding doors {{at the time were}} classed under British rules as having no tonnage-earning purpose, and so the two-hundred tons this space would have earned was deducted from the displacement of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Eventually all thirty Class 16C {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2B boilers and reclassified to Class 16CR. Several alterations to {{the engine}} frames were necessary to accommodate the no. 2B boiler.

40|$|We study {{sliding window}} multi-join {{processing}} in continuous queries over data streams. Several algorithms are reported for performing continuous, incremental joins, {{under the assumption}} that all the <b>sliding</b> windows <b>fit</b> in main memory. The algorithms include multiway incremental nested loop joins (NLJs) and multi-way incremental hash joins. We also propose join ordering heuristics to minimize the processing cost per unit time. We test a possible implementation of these algorithms and show that, as expected, hash joins are faster than NLJs for performing equi-joins, and that the overall processing cost is influenced by the strategies used to remove expired tuples from the sliding windows. ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1904 Courier was a runabout model. It could seat 2 {{passengers}} and sold for US$650, {{making it one}} of the lowest-priced cars on the market at the time.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are used}} for torque {{transmission}} via pulleys and gears. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare the load carrying capacity of three (P 3 G) and four (P 4 C) lobed polygonal shafts and hub connections manufactured from the same outer diameter. The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for interference, line to line and clearance fit. The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically. With the advancement of numerical analysis as Finite Element Analysis, these issues can be addressed, making polygonal shafts a viable competitor to keyed and splined shafts. The loading strength of the polygonal shaft and hub connection has been analyzed using Finite element Analysis software, ANSYS®, by subjecting the connection to torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} hub experienced greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The stresses were higher in P 4 C shaft than P 3 G shaft. The clearance fit was found to be the most detrimental fit and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress and hub displacement, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> is a requirement. For general purpose, P 3 G interference fit is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} rotor {{internal}} friction on the system's stability was studied when operated above the first critical speed. This internal friction is commonly caused by <b>sliding</b> press <b>fits</b> or <b>sliding</b> splines. Under conditions of high speed and low bearing damping, these systems will occassionally whirl at a frequency {{less than the}} shaft's rotational speed. This subsynchronous precession is a self excited phenomenon and stress reversals are created. This phenomenon was observed during engine testing. The reduction of spline friction and/or the inclusion of squeeze film damping have controlled the instability. Case history and the detail design of the squeeze film dampers is discussed...|$|R
