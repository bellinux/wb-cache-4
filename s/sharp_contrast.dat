5|$|In the afternoon, Sheaffe {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements and took command of the British forces. In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to his predecessors' direct attacks, Sheaffe took a more cautious approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.|$|E
5|$|It is in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the {{majority}} of patriotic wartime films, especially among the plethora of those that take place primarily on a ship, which usually feature themes such a brotherhood, respect for higher-ranking officers, and able, hard working seamen.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} and marital practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women {{were not required to}} be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E
50|$|The {{human rights}} {{situation}} during combat was {{heavily dependent on}} the specific commander and his troops. The situation for different leaders and their troops of the United Front thus shows <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts.</b> Also, {{the quality of life}} of the Afghan population was heavily dependent on the specific leader that was directly controlling the area in which they lived. <b>Sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> could also be witnessed regarding life and structures in those areas.|$|R
50|$|Padegs {{preferred}} {{themes were}} modern urban life, antiwar subjects, an idealised dream world and sarcastic self-portraits. His work was redolent with expressive distortion, refined features and <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{climate is}} Mediterranean {{continental}} with <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> between {{summer and winter}} temperatures. The average temperature is 24°C in summer and 5°C in winter. Rainfall is sparse, around 350 mm/year.|$|R
5|$|In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to {{the mostly}} mild {{weather in the}} first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the {{continent}} was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{economy was}} among the most {{advanced}} in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until {{the first half of the}} 6th century and in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and resilient.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{won by the}} Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6hours, 23minutes, 49seconds, after a six-man {{breakaway}} group contested a sprint finish. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with {{the same time as}} Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.|$|E
5000|$|After {{these two}} {{relatively}} slow solos, Exeo (Latin for [...] "I go out") is caracterized by the <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> {{created by the}} dramatic clash of {{the high and low}} registers of the orchestra.|$|R
25|$|In {{most cases}} the {{interior}} side of a door matches its exterior side but, in some other cases, there are <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> between the two sides, {{such as in the}} case of a vehicle door.|$|R
50|$|The {{color pattern}} {{is similar to}} that of A. c. mokasen, except that the dark bands are in <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast</b> to the lighter ground color, and that there are no smaller dark spots between them.|$|R
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> {{with the}} white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a {{distinct}} rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which capitalize on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E
5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> of the painting’s chiaroscuro, the German art {{historian}} Ralf van Bühren explains {{the bright light}} {{as a metaphor for}} mercy, which [...] "helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".|$|R
25|$|Infrared and {{ultraviolet}} watermarks – When seen in {{the near}} infrared, the banknotes will show darker areas in different zones depending on the denomination. Ultraviolet light will make the EURion constellation show in <b>sharper</b> <b>contrast,</b> and also some fluorescent threads stand out.|$|R
50|$|He {{managed to}} reduce {{the power of the}} Patriarchate of Aquileia, however, the Republic of Venice became the {{beneficiary}} of the Patriarchate, which led to <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> between the parties involved. Meinhard retreated from Gorizia Castle (Schloss Bruck) to Burg Bruck in Lienz.|$|R
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E
50|$|The Turkish carpet is {{distinct}} from carpets of other provenience in that it makes more pronounced use of primary colours. Western Anatolian carpets prefer red and blue colours, whereas Central Anatolian use more red and yellow, with <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> set in white.|$|R
50|$|Bourboulon's {{pictures}} were {{shot with a}} Pentax camera and focus on bright light and <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts.</b> His most typical pictures portray girls and women on the Spanish island of Ibiza, playing on the juxtaposition of blue sky, white walls, and sun-tanned skin.|$|R
5000|$|Infrared and {{ultraviolet}} watermarks - When seen in {{the near}} infrared, the banknotes will show darker areas in different zones depending on the denomination.

5|$|The {{opportunity}} for Durkheim to a receive major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by {{his approach to}} society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, {{as part of his}} doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his The Division of Labour in Society, and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood in stark {{contrast}} {{from those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, like those of the Han Chinese upper classes, had arranged marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and dancing in the streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of their beauty, familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> from the beliefs of the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their husbands and were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows {{two-tone}} colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
50|$|The two {{candidates}} {{met in a}} debate held in Arlington on September 24, 2013. The debate was marked by <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> between the candidates on both issues and style. Northam was the aggressor in the debate, attacking Jackson over his controversial statements and personal history.|$|R

5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, {{an explanation of}} almost 200 glyphs. His work {{was believed to be}} authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was in <b>sharp</b> <b>contrast</b> to the party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
5000|$|... "Donna", {{a parody}} of doo wop songs (see also [...] "Donna" [...] by Ritchie Valens), was {{originally}} written as a potential B-side to the song [...] "Waterfall". The song features <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts</b> between falsetto in the chorus (Creme) and deep monotone vocals (Godley) in the verse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} was often {{reflected in the}} art of the period. Music, paintings, architecture, and artifacts were frequently inspired by the Turkish and Ottoman styles and methods. Paintings in particular portrayed the Ottomans with bright colours and <b>sharp</b> <b>contrasts,</b> suggesting their interesting peculiarity and exotic nature.|$|R
