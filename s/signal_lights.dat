5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
40|$|Polarization-dependent gain (PDG) {{and state}} of {{polarization}} (SOP) of the output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> in Yb 3 +-doped fiber amplifiers are studied by numerically stimulation, {{which showed that}} PDG of output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is not only changed with the input pump power and signal power, input polarization of pump and <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> but also changed with the doping concentration, the cross-section anisotropy, the fiber length,the phase difference of the fiber, and so on. Moreover, SOP of the output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is studied. It is found that the polarization of output <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is relative {{not only to the}} phase difference of the fiber,polarization of pump and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> as the non-doped fiber, but also to PDG of output <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> the cross-section anisotropy, the doping concentration, and so on, which is different to the non-doped fiber...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} on wavelength conversion in semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) {{when the power}} of the input pump light is as much as that of the input <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> in which the four-wave mixing (FWM) effect and the cross-gain modulation (XGM) effect occur obviously {{at the same time and}} the modulation format of the converted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> is inverted to that of the input <b>signal</b> <b>light.</b> Experimental results are in agreement with theoretical analysis...|$|R
5|$|The square, massive Norman tower has three-arched belfry {{windows on}} each face, surmounted by corner turrets, and a conically-shaped tower of {{octagonal}} proportions, topped again {{by a short}} steeple. The tower was a main viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) which linked the Paris Observatory with the Royal Greenwich Observatory using trigonometry. Cross-channel sightings were made of <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> at Dover Castle and Fairlight, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} a $5.5million project {{to improve the}} intersection between Clover Street (NY65) and Jefferson Road (NY252) {{in the town of}} Pittsford. The project, which had been in development for a decade, involved the widening of Jefferson Road from two to four lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection, the addition of green arrow <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> for all left-hand turns, and the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the worst}} problems in many countries. Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand. Traffic engineers at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka are testing the developed tool for actual applications...|$|R
5|$|With Real Carlos disabled, Keats {{pushed on}} into combat with Saint Antoine, the {{combined}} French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached. At 23:50, Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship, beginning {{a close and}} heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides {{with one another in}} pitch darkness and with an increasing wind. For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off Cape Spartel in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed Superb to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night. Formidable was also {{to the rear of the}} combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> until it had safely passed the battle between Superb and Saint Antoine. Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: Caesar, Venerable, Spencer and Thames arrived after midnight, all firing on Saint Antoine as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. Superb was later joined by Carlotta and the small ships HMS Calpe and Louisa, which remained on hand during the night.|$|E
25|$|The fort's heavy {{guns were}} German, {{typically}} Krupp, while the turret mechanisms {{were from a}} variety of sources. The fort was provided with <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> to permit communication with neighboring forts. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E
25|$|The large {{weapons were}} all German products, made by Krupp in Essen, but the armor was by Cockerill (Belgium), Ateliers de Creusot (France) or Grüson (Germany).

The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} photon {{statistics and}} quadrature squeezing {{of the signal}} mode produced by one-mode subharmonic generator. It is found that the mean photon energy of the signal mode is twice of a twin <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> beam. And the energy fluctuations of the two <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> beams are four times that {{of one of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> beams. We have also shown that the photon energy quadrature squeezing of the output signal mode is exactly equal to that of the cavity <b>signal</b> mode. In <b>light</b> of this, the global quadrature squeezing of the signal mode is independent of the mean photon ener-gy. On the basis of the above results, the quantum analysis of a one-mode sub-harmonic generating system should somehow be modified...|$|R
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{version of}} the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the Trabant's two-stroke engine in 1989, {{the result of a}} trade agreement between East and West Germany. The model, the Trabant 1.1, also had minor improvements to its brake and <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> a renovated grille, and MacPherson struts instead of a leaf-spring-suspended chassis. When the 1.1 began production in May 1990, the two German states had already agreed to reunification.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{railways}} mostly use colour <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b> Earlier {{the older}} semaphores and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) were used, {{but these were}} replaced by colour signals. Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use automatic block systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably interlocked with the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters. With the planned introduction of Cab signalling/Anti collision devices the element of risk on account of drivers overshooting signals will also be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene film {{capacitors}} {{meet the}} criteria for stability Class 1 capacitors, and have low electrical losses and nearly linear behavior over a very wide temperature and frequency range. They are used for oscillators and resonant circuits; for electronic filter applications with high quality factor (Q) such as high-pass filters, low-pass filters and band-pass filters {{as well as for}} tuning circuits; for audio crossovers in loudspeakers; in sample and hold A/D converters and in peak voltage detectors. Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> or pulse width generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E

25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one stop lamp, mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a stop lamp function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high-mounted stop and turn <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual high-mounted supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time. Auto and lamp manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high-mount supplemental stop lamps in the early 1980s, but this effort, too, failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack on}} 22 October was {{conducted}} in a rainstorm which grounded many RFC aircraft until the afternoon but the advance of the British infantry was observed by contact-patrol aircraft crews {{and especially in the}} afternoon and evening, fighter pilots attacked German troops in trenches and shell-holes, roads and villages. Machine-gun nests and artillery batteries were also attacked and two battalions of infantry moving along the Houthulst–Staden road were caught by a pair Camel pilots and scattered. A bomber squadron attacked Hooglede village where many resting soldiers were billeted. German aircraft flying at low altitude attacked the positions of the 35th Division and one aircraft followed a British contact-patrol aircraft. When troops responded to a call for flares, the German pilot dropped <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> on them, marking their position for the German artillery. The British sent forward an 18-pounder anti-aircraft gun was sent forward to Koekuit to engage German aircraft but with little effect.|$|E
