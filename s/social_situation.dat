5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and <b>social</b> <b>situation,</b> and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting <b>social</b> <b>situation</b> is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to the political and <b>social</b> <b>situation</b> in 11th-century Europe, {{the rise of a}} reform movement within the papacy, and the political and religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E

25|$|Although the Czechs and Slovaks speak {{languages}} {{that are}} very similar, the political and <b>social</b> <b>situation</b> of the Czech and Slovak peoples was very different {{at the end of}} the 19th century. The reason was the differing attitude and position of their overlords – the Austrians in Bohemia and Moravia, and the Hungarians in Slovakia – within Austria-Hungary. Bohemia was the most industrialized part of Austria and Slovakia was the most industrialized part of Hungary – however at very different levels of development. Furthermore, the Hungarians were far more determined to assimilate the Slovaks than the Austrians were to assimilate the Czechs.|$|E

In 1866, Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey reported that disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses, and attacked and killed black people, leaving their bodies on the roads.|$|E
25|$|Few local Dacians were {{interested}} in the use of epigraphs, which were a central part of Roman cultural expression.

Apart from members of the Dacian elite and those who wished to attain improved social and economic positions, who largely adopted Roman names and manners, the majority of native Dacians retained their names and their cultural distinctiveness even with the increasing embrace of Roman cultural norms which followed their incorporation into the Roman empire.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present research were twofold. The main objective was to {{study the effects of}} different types of <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> (very intimate vs. very task-specific), language choices made by Anglophone interlocutors (French vs. English) and subjects' ethnolinguistic vitality (French vs. English) on the language spoken by Francophones and on their perception of the interaction. A secondary goal was to develop a taxonomy of <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> representative of the everyday lives of students to serve in a study of ethnolinguistic contact. In order to achieve these objectives three studies were conducted. In the first study a total of 4753 relationships, topics of conversation and activities constituting various interpersonal situations were provided by 484 subjects. The <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> were rank-ordered by 121 student/experimenters according to their level of intimacy and task specificity. The <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> collected could be grouped into six clusters representing six levels of intimacy and task specificity. On the basis of these clusters a taxonomy of <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> was elaborated. A second study was conducted to further validate the findings obtained in the first study and to select 8 <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> to serve as stimuli in the third study. Two hundred and forty-three students from introductory psychology classes rated 20 <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> on their degree of intimacy and task specificity. The twenty <b>social</b> <b>situations</b> used as stimuli were taken from the taxonomy presented in the first study. In a third and final study, Francophone subjects' language behavior was studied by having them read four short vignettes representing an interaction between a Francophone and an Anglophone. The subjects were instructed to identify with the Francophone interlocutor represented in the vignettes and to respond in writing to the Anglophone interlocutor in the language of their choice. Depending on the experimental condition the subjects were exposed to one of four possibilities: (1) four vignettes representing very intimate situations where the Anglophone interlocutor always responded in French, (2) four vignettes representing very intimate situations where the Anglophone interlocutor always responded in English, (3) four vignettes representing very task-specific situations where the Anglophone interlocutor always responded in French, and lastly (4) four vignettes representing very task-specific situations where the Anglophone interlocutor always responded in English.
