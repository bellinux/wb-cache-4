40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the leadership approach that facilitates adoption of <b>school</b> <b>councils.</b> The project was accomplished in two different contexts by utilizing a combination of quantitative and qualitative research approaches. This study was conducted through the participation of fifteen schools. There were thirteen schools selected from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada for the quantitative approach to the study. From this participant group, seven schools were involved in the implementation of <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> and six were not involved. In addition, two European schools were selected for the qualitative approach to the study based on a long history of site-based management and a recent more advanced form of site-based management having been introduced there.

[...] The findings show that in the European environment the degree of principal dominance that <b>school</b> <b>council</b> members feel should exist is different than the principals' viewpoint. It appears, from the European case studies, that feelings toward dominance can be affected by leadership approach. The study conducted in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador reveals that <b>school</b> <b>council</b> members and teachers perceive those principals who are involved in <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> as having a leadership approach that is more highly developed than principals who are not involved.

40|$|In Queensland, {{all state}} schools have the {{opportunity}} to decide the model of school-based management they would like to adopt for their school communities. For schools wishing to pursue the greatest level of school-based management, <b>School</b> <b>Councils</b> are mandatory. Because <b>School</b> <b>Councils</b> will play an important role as schools become increasingly involved in school-based management, the operations of newly formed Councils were the basis of this research. The main purpose of the study is to determine, through both literature and research, what makes an effective <b>School</b> <b>Council.</b> Although Education Queensland has identified roles and functions, as well as the rationale behind <b>School</b> <b>Councils,</b> clear guidelines to assist Councils with their implementation and to gauge the effectiveness of Councils do not exist. Because <b>School</b> <b>Councils</b> have only been implemented in Queensland for {{a very short period of}} time, there has been very little research undertaken on their operations. There are three main stages to this research. First, an extensive literature review explored the theoretical, research and policy developments in relation to school-based management and <b>School</b> <b>Councils.</b> Second, a pilot study was undertaken of an existing <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> that had been in operation for just twelve months. The final and most significant stage of the research involved multi-site case study of three newly formed <b>School</b> <b>Councils,</b> the research being conducted over a twelve-month period to obtain a longitudinal picture of their operations. Two general theoretical frameworks, based on the concepts of change theory and leadership theory, guided the research. Data from the study were analysed within these frameworks and within six focus areas that were identified from the literature and pilot study. These focus areas formed the basis for the development of criteria for the implementation of an effective <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> that were investigated in the three case studies. The focus areas were: 1. promoting the profile of the <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> within the <b>school</b> community; 2. developing well defined roles, responsibilities and functions of the School Council; 3. developing roles and relationships of <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> members; 4. promoting accountability, monitoring and reporting responsibilities; 5. providing training and professional development for all <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> members; and 6. improving the functioning and operations of the <b>School</b> <b>Council.</b> The research was conducted within the qualitative tradition.

Since 1867 Austrian monarchy recognized the equal status of all the nationalities and languages used in the large multicultural state. The 19th paragraph of new Austro-Hungarian Constitution (from the 21st of Dec., 1867) was meant to guarantee equal national rights to all the ethnic group in the empire. In Brody where more than ¾ of the population were the Jews (out of ca. 20.000 of inhabitants) there was only one public school with instruction in German and two schools with Polish as instruction medium. Galician Regional School Council (Landesschulrat) in Lviv allowed opening of two more schools refusing however the wish of Brody town commune to have German for instruction language in these new <b>schools.</b> <b>Council</b> was only willing to allow them to be in Polish. In the end, in 1880 Brody town commune appealed with the complaint to the Tribunal of the State (Reichsgericht) in Vienna, after unsuccessful attempts to defend their claim at the Galician Landeschulrat and the Ministry of Religion and Science. In the State Tribunal Brody commune was represented by Dr [...] (1831–1894), who published the memorial on the situation of Jews in Austria in 1859. The tribunal referee in Brody case was [...] (1807–1894) who concluded that the rights of Brody town commune guaranteed by the 19th paragraph of the constitution were violated what all other board members agreed to as well. The Ministry of Education viewed Brody Israelites as not belonging to German nationality (against the views of Brody commune itself) while Brody and Galician Israelites did not want to acknowledge themselves neither to Polish nor to Ukrainian nationalities. According to Hye, Brody Jews could not use [...] "the guaranteed constitutional rights as for nationality and language" [...] and either to present themselves as a separate Hebrew ethnic group different from all other Austrian minorities what Hye declined pointing at several previous bans of usage of Hebrew language in the administrative life and non-recognition of [...] "Hebrew tribe" [...] by Austrian legislature.

The children then set up a children's rights-based <b>school</b> <b>council</b> in their schoo 1. The children took part in all aspects of the research. The methods used included questionnaires for all Years 4 to 7 pupils and for School Councillors, interviews conducted by the young researchers with 18 pupils and a reflective journal, by the teacher/researcher. Children displayed a high level of competence and engaged with enthusiasm. They valued their <b>School</b> <b>Council</b> as an appropriate forum for expressing their views, acknowledged the development of a listening culture in the school and identified areas in which they had influenced decision-making. Some of the difficulties met included time constraints, which at times threatened to undermine the rights-based approach, and the boundaries that existed for both adults and children working within an educational institution. The study identified the need for having clearly articulated aims for <b>school</b> <b>council</b> work and the appropriateness of a rights-based rationale for <b>school</b> <b>council</b> work which, in this study, nurtured children's enthusiasm, developed their knowledge and understanding of rights, and had a positive and lasting effect on school culture and ethos.

The purpose of this qualitative case study was to describe the function and influence of local <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> on <b>school</b> improvement and to provide {{a better understanding of the}} role of parent/family and community involvement in those efforts. Data was gathered over a nine month period in three elementary schools in different communities through observation of <b>school</b> <b>council</b> meetings; interviews with various members of the school community, and review of relevant materials. Results of data analysis showed that the function and influence of local <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> on <b>school</b> improvement, and the impact of parent and community involvement on <b>school</b> <b>council</b> function were related to the overall culture of the school. Parent involvement in the school and parent influence on the work of the <b>school</b> <b>council</b> was strengthened by the relationship with the parent organization and other parent involvement activities in the school. The attitude and commitment to parent involvement present in the school culture, as well as, the efforts to recruit parent and community members with the resulting parity in membership also influenced the work of the <b>school</b> <b>council.</b> The results mirrored previous research that showed inconsistencies in the implementation of <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> across the country, that the evidence of their influence on school improvement has been limited, and that schools with existing parent involvement activities before the initiation of <b>school</b> <b>councils</b> had more positive influence on school improvement.
