500|$|On February 3, 2015, Dylan {{released}} Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963, {{which have}} been described as part of the Great American Songbook. All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of [...] "Sinatra covers". Dylan explained, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day." [...] In an interview, Dylan said he had been thinking about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.|$|E

5000|$|In {{this path}} {{expressed}} in my verses I have felt sad and happy, I have felt overwhelmed by loneliness and yet more by company. I have <b>seen</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> {{a child in}} Areguá. I have <b>seen</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a young student in Buenos Aires. I have felt as if I were in Academia Universitaria again feeling that beautiful rush {{that a group of}} friends generates. And I have also <b>seen</b> <b>myself,</b> with white hair, white bearb, just as I am today”. And he adds: “The eyes of those who read me won't see what I see [...] But they might build the image of a road in which edges life is found. If this is so, my verses would have had accomplished their mission of leaving my voice within these pages. If not, these poems will always be my sons that in most cases were born in painful desperation, sons of mine that are were left defenceless, alone and defenceless of the one that gave them life through a poem. They remain with the reader, lost and lonely, those poems. Let them say if they have it… their truth.|$|R
5000|$|In September 19, 2015 {{the filmmaker}} made the {{following}} {{speech at the}} National Film Award of Spain ceremony, held in Madrid: [...] "I don't know why they give me this prize.

500|$|Eastwood has {{disapproved of}} America's wars in Korea (1950–1953), Vietnam (1964–1975), Afghanistan (2001–present), and Iraq (2003–2011), {{believing that the}} United States should not be overly militaristic or {{play the role of}} global policeman. He has {{referred}} to himself as [...] "...too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing," [...] describing himself in 1974 as [...] "a political nothing" [...] and [...] "a moderate" [...] and in 1997 as a [...] "libertarian." [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> conservative," [...] Eastwood has stated, while noting in the same breath that he is not an [...] "ultra-leftist," [...] either. At times, he has supported Democrats in California, including Senator Dianne Feinstein in 1994, liberal United States House of Representatives member Sam Farr in 2002, and Governor Gray Davis, whom he voted for in 1998 and 2002 and hosted pricey fundraisers for in 2002 and 2003.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|Signer Judith Vaughan, a {{resident}} of Los Angeles and a nun with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, said, [...] "We didn't commit a crime. All we did was say, 'Hey, there's a diversity of opinion among people [...] {{and we need to}} talk about freedom of conscience.' I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> defiant." [...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times to say that the Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E
5000|$|For {{his first}} {{dive into the}} video game {{industry}} and BioWares franchise, Adam auditioned for Dragon Age: Origins at the voice studio Side UK, reading and obtaining there a couple of roles. [...] Directed by Catherine Livingstone, Dragon Ages voice director, he recorded various voices such as the Ostagar prisoner, which Adam has said he was [...] "quite fond of" [...] and [...] "the first time Id ever <b>seen</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a computer sprite." [...] Alongside that performance, he worked as two Ostagar army minions (soldier and officer) and, for the Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening add-on, as the Constable Aidan.|$|R

5000|$|Amiel {{then went}} {{to look for a}} new {{producer}} for the album, she ended up in London and was introduced to ex Altered Images band member Stephen Lironi. Lironi had previously worked other bands such as Space, Black Grape and Hanson, but Amiel states that none of that really mattered to her when she met him. She states [...] "All that mattered was that I felt comfortable with him straight away- I felt like he got what I was trying to do creatively." [...] Working with Lironi saw Amiel exploring a more organic sound, while still sticking to her electronic roots. She explains [...] "I’ve never <b>seen</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> tied to a particular genre and been happy that my taste tends to lead me right across the musical spectrum." ...|$|R
500|$|She {{also was}} seen by [...] others as a sex symbol. Aaliyah {{did not have a}} problem with being {{considered}} one. [...] "I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me," [...] she stated. [...] "It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel [...] "sexy for sure" [...] and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E

2500|$|Hilfenhaus is {{primarily}} a swing bowler, relying on moving the ball away from right handed batsmen. During an interview in 2010, {{he explained that he}} is able to bowl when conditions do not suit him: [...] "When the ball's not swinging for me the role does change a little bit... I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> more <b>as</b> a dot bowler than a wicket-taker like Mitch [...] when the ball stops swinging for me. I've just got to build pressure and do the team thing." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sturridge said he {{preferred}} to play as a centre-forward {{rather than as a}} wide player: [...] "I do still <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a striker but I am doing a job for the team and I'm enjoying doing it." [...] As Sturridge transitioned from a wider role into a striker when he joined Liverpool, Sturridge also said that he likens himself on striker Thierry Henry, who [...] "played wide for Juventus and then went to Arsenal and played as a centre-forward." ...|$|E
5000|$|One event may {{illustrate}} the aspiration of the Turbeville family to distinction: {{in elementary school}} one asked a young Deborah Turbeville and her classmates to make a drawing in chalk about Christmas or America. Turbeville recounts that her teacher {{did not like the}} content of her drawings ("apparently they were very weird") and she was dismissed from school for a few weeks. When she remembers this event, Turbeville has said, [...] "Sometimes, I still <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> today <b>as</b> that child who made those drawings, and who continues to make things quietly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Knowing {{everybody}} and being welcome everywhere, playing a good hand at whist, and having an inexhaustible fancy in {{the invention of}} a dinner, Major Mulvany naturally belonged to all the best clubs of his time. Percy Linwood and he constantly met in the billiard-room or at the dinner-table. The Major approved of the easy, handsome, pleasant-tempered young man.

2500|$|Three {{decades after}} her Grammy, Reddy {{discussed}} the song's iconic status: [...] "I think it came along {{at the right}} time. I'd gotten involved in the Women's Movement, {{and there were a}} lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those sort of things. All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> being dainty," [...] she said.|$|E

I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell.

2500|$|In 1994, Dohrn {{said of her}} {{political}} beliefs: [...] "I still <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a radical." [...] On November 4, 2010, Dohrn was interviewed by Newsclick India.

2500|$|Because of {{the public}} controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory {{suspended}} Watson's administrative responsibilities. On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never {{thought of myself as}} a racist. I don't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a racist. I am mortified by it. It was the worst thing in my life." [...] An editorial in Nature at the time acknowledged that his remarks were [...] "beyond the pale," [...] but wished that the tour had not been cancelled so that Watson would be forced to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, global pollsters {{and psychologists}} have studied {{individual}} differences {{in the sense of}} global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the World Values Survey, administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a world citizen.” [...] For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) [...] [...] [...] all humans everywhere?”), Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”), Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”), and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”). These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for new work, Stern found an advertised {{position}} in Radio & Records for a morning host at WWWW, a struggling rock station in Detroit, Michigan. His aircheck was well received by management who made an offer, but Douglas advised Stern against the move and suggested to wait for an offer from a better station. Stern went ahead regardless and accepted a deal, starting on April 21, 1980. He thought of new ways to improve his show and to be more open on the air, [...] "to cut down the barriers ... strip down all the ego ... and be totally honest". His efforts paid off with his first industry recognition, winning a Billboard Award for Album-Oriented Rock Personality of the Year For a Major Market and the debut Top Five Talent Search contest in the album-oriented rock category from radio syndication firm Drake-Chenault, which then distributed the winning radio segments to stations across the country. Despite the success, WWWW continued to decline in the ratings and failed to overtake the three more popular rock stations in the area. The quarterly Arbitron ratings released in January 1981 {{showed no signs of}} a strong audience, causing the station to change formats overnight from rock to country music, to Stern's surprise and annoyance. He lasted a further two weeks before [...] "it was time to hit the road again. Somehow, I couldn't <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> Hopalong Howie". He declined offers to work at WXRT in Chicago and CHUM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|$|E
