5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under <b>shrubs</b> or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low <b>shrubs.</b> During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low <b>shrubs.</b> However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E

5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal trees and <b>shrubs</b> in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic {{in their respective}} families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as Lactarius and Russula species that only grow with Cistus <b>shrubs</b> in the Mediterranean basin.|$|E

30|$|When {{considered}} by tree species alone, Cornus nuttallii (P < 0.001) {{was the only}} species with significantly lower mortality inside <b>shrub</b> patches of any guild relative to areas outside <b>shrub</b> patches (Table 4). Interactions between <b>shrub</b> guild and tree species were evident: mortality rates for Abies concolor (P < 0.001) and Cornus nuttallii (P = 0.001) were lower in riparian <b>shrub</b> patches compared to outside <b>shrub</b> patches (Table 5). In generalist <b>shrub</b> patches, mortality was lower for Abies concolor (P = 0.001), but only marginally lower (when considered against the adjusted α = 0.005) for Cornus nuttallii (P = 0.007) and Calocedrus decurrens (P = 0.006) relative to outside <b>shrub</b> patches. Individual tree species mortality rates within montane chaparral {{did not differ from}} tree species mortality rates outside <b>shrub</b> patches, and mortality rates of Pinus lambertiana and Quercus kelloggii exhibited no significant differences in any <b>shrub</b> vegetation type. Abies concolor was the only species that showed significant differences among mortality rates associated with different <b>shrub</b> guilds; paralleling the results for all trees combined, A. concolor mortality was highest in montane chaparral, lower in generalist, and lowest in riparian patches (all P < 0.001; Table 5).|$|R

30|$|We used ARC {{software}} (ESRI 2011) {{to compare}} the change in area of <b>shrub</b> patches between the pre-fire and post-fire periods.

To examine the change in spatial pattern of <b>shrub</b> patches, we calculated the pre-fire and post-fire mean patch size, patch density, and nearest neighbor statistics.

30|$|<b>Shrub</b> biomass was {{generally}} not affected by mechanical treatment. It was expected that <b>shrub</b> biomass would increase as sagebrush would {{have benefited from the}} increase in soil nitrogen and water availability. Previous studies showed that chaining treatments (a type of mechanical treatment that has been used for brush control) caused a vigorous <b>shrub</b> response within the first two years post treatment (Tausch and Tueller 1977, Skousen et al. 1989). However, Bates et al. (2005) found minimal <b>shrub</b> response 13  years after a mechanical treatment. He cited a lower initial <b>shrub</b> density within his plots as a possible cause of this slower response. This would not be accurate in our study as Phase 2 still had a relatively intact <b>shrub</b> component. Continued long-term study is needed to determine if the <b>shrub</b> layer will respond to the cut-and-leave mechanical treatment.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the effect of <b>shrub</b> encroachment in temperate semi-natural grasslands on plant species diversity. We tested the hypothesis that an initial <b>shrub</b> encroachment leads to enhanced habitat heterogeneity and thereby to a higher diversity. In a calcareous grassland near Göttingen (Germany) we analysed the effect of <b>shrub</b> encroachment on the species richness in 30, 100 m 2 plots each with 10 subplots of 1 m 2 size. The 30 main plots belonged to six different <b>shrub</b> encroachment classes. A descriptive correlative gradient analysis of <b>shrub</b> invaded grasslands and their species number of flowering plants was performed. Within the 30 plots of different <b>shrub</b> encroachment a total of 203 plant species were recorded. The mean α 1 -diversity (level of subplots), mean α 2 -diversity (level of plots) {{as well as the}} α 3 -diversity (level of <b>shrub</b> encroachment classes) have their highest values at medium <b>shrub</b> invaded sites. This finding is in line with our hypothesis of a hump-back relation between <b>shrub</b> encroachment and species richness, and {{can be explained by the}} increased habitat heterogeneity. However, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) emphasized the importance of the present vegetation composition for species richness. The dominance of highly competitive, clonal-growing grass species is accompanied by low diversity swards with a lower facilitation of <b>shrub</b> establishment. Species accumulation curves highlight the benefit of <b>shrub</b> encroachment for γ-(landscape-) diversity. This result emphasises the importance of habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and, therefore, nature conservation...|$|R

5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more stunted fashion; instead, <b>shrubs</b> and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and <b>shrubs.</b> Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common <b>shrubs</b> include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E

30|$|It was {{interesting}} that <b>shrub</b> cover {{was not an}} important explanatory factor for reburn severity. Previous work has demonstrated that greater <b>shrub</b> cover following initial fires can lead to higher reburn severity (Coop et al. 2016, Coppoletta et al. 2016). One explanation for this lack of <b>shrub</b> importance in our findings is that <b>shrub</b> cover in our plots was {{not as high as}} in areas initially burned at high severity. Mean tall- and short-stature <b>shrub</b> cover from our field plots was 28 % and 22 %, respectively. It is possible that, at these levels, there was enough discontinuity in <b>shrub</b> cover that they did not exacerbate surface-fire intensity in the reburn. Observations from this study area support this assertion (R. Everett, University of California, Berkeley, USA, unpublished data). It is unlikely that this discontinuity was simply a product of insufficient time given the strong post-fire establishment response that the dominant <b>shrub</b> species have (USDA Forest Service 2018) and the relatively long period between initial and reburn fires (17  yr). Rather, the presence (and spatial pattern) of live overstory trees following initial fire likely influenced the total proportion and pattern of <b>shrub</b> cover. Further investigation into the influence of live overstory on post-fire <b>shrub</b> establishment and growth would be needed to fully test this linkage.|$|R
