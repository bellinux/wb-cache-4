5|$|In 1967, {{the book}} was adapted into the fifth film in the Eon Productions series, {{starring}} <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> as Bond. Only a few elements of the novel and {{a limited number of}} Fleming's characters survive into the film version.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after five}} films, <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> {{resigned}} from the role of James Bond and—during the filming of You Only Live Twice—was not on speaking terms with Albert Broccoli. The confirmed front runners were Englishman John Richardson, Dutchman Hans De Vries, Australian Robert Campbell, Englishman Anthony Rogers and Australian George Lazenby.|$|E
5|$|Laurence Luckinbill plays Sybok. <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> was {{originally}} contacted {{to star in}} the role, but was busy with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Shatner discovered Luckinbill by chance; channel surfing late one night, he saw him perform as Lyndon Baines Johnson. When Shatner called to offer him the role, Luckinbill accepted immediately.|$|E

5|$|Sorkin did uncredited script doctor work {{on several}} {{films in the}} 1990s. He wrote some quips for <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> and Nicolas Cage in The Rock.

5|$|The {{story was}} serialised in the Daily Express {{newspaper}} and Playboy magazine, and also adapted for comic strip format in the Daily Express. In 1967, {{it was released}} as the fifth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, starring <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> as Bond. The novel has also been adapted as a radio play and broadcast on the BBC.|$|E
5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character and a picture of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E
5000|$|The Basilica {{was used}} for a brief scene in the 1987 film The Untouchables in which <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> {{character}} explains [...] "The Chicago Way" [...] to Kevin Costner's character.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> {{performance}} as the likeable criminal Duke Anderson was instrumental in his breakout from being typecast as James Bond. It also restored him to the ranks of top male actors in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Dunhill {{has also}} {{occasionally}} provided various accessories for the cinematic James Bond throughout the series. The association began in 1962 when the production team requested a gunmetal cigarette lighter for <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> introduction in Dr. No.|$|R
5|$|As with Fleming's {{previous}} novels, Diamonds Are Forever received broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1971 it was adapted into the seventh Bond film in the series and was the last Eon Productions film to star <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> as Bond.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds Are Forever is a 1971 British spy {{film and}} the {{seventh in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions. It is the sixth and final Eon film to star <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery,</b> who returned to the role as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, {{for the first time}} since You Only Live Twice (1967), having declined to reprise the role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).|$|E
5|$|Dr. No is a 1962 British spy film, {{starring}} <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery,</b> with Ursula Andress and Joseph Wiseman, {{filmed in}} Jamaica and England. It {{is the first}} James Bond film. Based on the 1958 novel {{of the same name}} by Ian Fleming, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather and was directed by Terence Young. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that would continue until 1975.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{can be seen}} cameoing in {{the film}} The Wind and the Lion (1975), playing a British nobleman living in Tangier who is killed in a shootout with <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> Berber tribesmen. He also {{appeared}} with singer Cher in Suspect (1987).|$|R
50|$|Critics noted {{this was}} <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> {{first attempt to}} go {{mainstream}} in film and {{to distance himself from}} the James Bond role. Connery continued to experiment with other roles, although he starred in two more Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again.|$|R
50|$|Film {{rights were}} bought by {{producer}} Mace Neufeld, who had filmed The Hunt for Red October. John McTiernan, who made October was originally going to direct but dropped out. The Russian sequences in October were rewritten at <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> request by John Milius, and Milius was signed to direct Intruder.|$|R
5|$|During {{the filming}} in Japan, it was {{announced}} that <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead, he brought writer Len Deighton together with <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery</b> {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred.|$|E
5|$|James Bond is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. Bond is a British secret agent working for MI6 who also answers by his codename, 007. He has been portrayed on film by actors <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery,</b> David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, in twenty-six productions. Only two films {{were not made}} by Eon Productions. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
500|$|The first Bond film, Dr. No, {{included}} {{the introduction of}} the character of James Bond. Bond was introduced in an exchange near the beginning of the film in a [...] "now-famous nightclub sequence featuring Sylvia Trench", to whom he makes his [...] "immortal introduction". It was <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> second line in the film.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton {{returned}} to the Bond film franchise with the chase- and heavily gadget-dependent Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). Hamilton claimed in a much later interview that he had instructed Roger Moore not to mimic <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> rendition of James Bond.|$|R
50|$|Celebrities {{also provide}} voice-overs for advertising. Some celebrities have {{distinct}} voices which are recognizable even when faces are not visible on a screen. This {{is a more}} subtle way to add celebrity branding to a product or service. An example of such an advertising campaign is <b>Sean</b> <b>Connery's</b> voice-over for Level 3 Communications.|$|R
