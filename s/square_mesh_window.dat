40|$|In the {{flatfish}} {{beam trawl}} fisheries the by-catch by weight of invertebrates is several {{times the amount}} of marketable fish. In order to reduce the impact of beam trawling on the benthic communities, a number of benthos escape modifications to the trawl were tested. A drop-out opening (escape zone without netting) and large diamond and square mesh escape zones just behind the groundrope were not effective in releasing the benthos by-catch and induced an unacceptable decrease in commercial catch. Square mesh windows inserted in the belly {{just in front of the}} cod-end were more promising. With these devices a significant reduction in weight and number of most benthic species could be realised.

40|$|The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) {{proposes a}} change in the old {{fisheries}} regulation of the EU. The aim of this thesis is to give a description of the new regulation with a focus on the discard ban and the landing obligations. Because the use of selectivity devices is crucial on this new regulation, the efficiency of the <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>window</b> (SMW) as selectivity device was evaluated. The efficiency of the device as a bycatch reducing system was studied in the Norwegian prawn (Pandalus borealis) fishery. His efficiency was compared with the mandatory by-catch reducing device Nordmøre-grid. For that, selectivity studies were performed in Balsfjord, Norway. The obtained data was used to observe if the SMW would accomplish the bycatch levels aimed in the new CFP. In addition, the data of the SMW performance was compared with data from similar experiments conducted with the SMW in the Bay of Biscay by the research centre of AZTI-Tecnalia. This was made to compare the performance of the SMW in species rich fisheries with species poor fisheries. Data was descriptively analysed and selectivity analyses were made using SELNET to obtain a clear understanding of the selection patterns. Results show that the SMW does not work efficiently as a selectivity device in target species fisheries, in a clear contrast with the effective selective capacity shown by the Nordmøre-grid. Results also prove the inefficiency of the SMW for mixed species fisheries. Both studies prove the inefficiency of the device to accomplish the bycatch regulation adopted through the new CFP. These results, taking into account the actual development state of the different selective devices in the European fisheries, allow us to conclude that more selectivity studies are still needed to achieve the European target of less than 5 % bycatch to avoid discards in mixed fisheries. For that, developments of the SMW or the use of combinations of different devices is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Tese de dout., Ciências e Tecnologias das Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências do Mar e do Ambiente, Univ. do Algarve, 2003 Scientific {{evidence}} {{points to}} the overfishing {{of some of the}} most important commercial stocks exploited in Portuguese waters (ICES sub-area IXa) by the bottom trawling fleets targeting fish and crustaceans. While temporary fishing interdiction has been implemented in specific areas off the south-west coast, in an attempt to reduce the fishing effort upon juvenile fish, there has been considerable resistance to the introduction of gear modifications, including the increase in cod end mesh sizes. The small cod end mesh sizes currently in use, particularly in crustacean trawling, largely contribute to catch discarding or misreporting, causing increasing conflicts between trawl fishermen and fishermen from other métiers competing for common resources. Recent studies have shown that discard rates can attain very high levels, up to 70 % on board of both crustacean and fish trawlers off the Portuguese south coast, with a high number of low-valued species, especially small pelagics, being discarded in large amounts. A number of gear modifications were tested in crustacean and fish trawls, aiming at reducing the amount of undersized fish from the target species and allowing for the escapement of a significant fraction of non-commercial by-catch. Their usefulness is discussed in a review, six papers and an overview of the thesis. The improvement of size-selectivity, by increasing cod end mesh size and changing mesh configuration was addressed for the deep groundfish assemblage off the south coast exploited by crustacean trawlers (Papers I and II), and for the shallow and deep groundfish assemblages off the south west coast, where a number of fish trawlers usually operate (Papers III and IV). Cod end selectivity parameters for three different mesh sizes and two mesh configurations, diamond and <b>square</b> <b>mesh,</b> were estimated for a large number of target and by-catch species. In a number of cases, the data structure allowed for the analysis of between-haul variation, and selectivity models were proposed which relate the estimated parameters to the variables under test and also to external variables such as cod end catch and trawling depth, giving a first insight into the mechanisms involved in cod end size selectivity. By-catch reducing devices (BRD’s) placed in the rear part of the trawls or in the cod end, comprising different combinations of oblique separator panels in association with <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>windows,</b> and <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>windows</b> alone, were tested in crustacean fishing grounds off the south coast (Papers V and VI), with the purpose of excluding the non-commercial by-catch. The effectiveness of the different BRD’s was separately evaluated for the most captured species. Between-species differences in behaviour towards the sorting devices are discussed. Sizedependence in escapement through the <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>windows</b> was recorded for a number of species, and the window selectivity could then be separately estimated. The cod end selectivity experiments carried out for crustacean trawling suggested that an increase in cod end mesh size from the current 55 mm to 70 mm diamond mesh, without changing cod end design or material, would be advisable in order to reduce the amount of undersized catch. Such an increase would simultaneously allow for the exclusion of a large fraction of non-commercial by-catch. The results obtained for fish trawling provide, on the other hand, evidence of the difficulty in managing a number of target species of different shapes and sizes based only on mesh size or mesh configuration regulations. The use of BRD’s greatly contributed to the exclusion of non-commercial by-catch. While evidence of active escape behaviour through the <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>windows</b> was found for some by-catch species, for others the exclusion from the trawl relied on previous guidance to upper trawl areas by the separator panels used. Overall, the results suggest a significant potential for the use of by-catch reducing devices in this fishery. Comissão Europeia.

40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Common Fishery Policy of the European Union is the reduction of discards and unwanted by-catches in the fishery. In principle this could be achieved if the catching methods were optimised for this. Still high numbers of undersized flatfish {{are caught in the}} bottom trawls. Although EU regulations make the use of the BACOMA codend mandatory in the Baltic Sea cod areable to escape through <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> escape <b>window</b> of the BACOMA net the whereas flatfish still remain in the cod-end. Gear experiments have been carried out with the aim to better separate cod from the flatfish fraction already when entering the rear belly, making use of the natural behaviour of the fish, i. e. the preferred swimming distance {{from the bottom of the}} net in the funnel. As cod have a natural tendency to keep a relativly great distance from the bottom, flatfish tend to stay close to it. It was attempted to separate both fractions by splitting the funnel into an upper and lower part with a horizontal panel. This wastested for two different nets, a cod trawl to separate cod from flatfish, and an eel-trawl to separate cod and flatfish from eel. Cod and flatfish separation is best at a panel distance of 50 cm from the bottom. Thus, 74 % of the cod were found in the upper panel, whereas 75 % of the flounder were in the lower section. A separation of eel from cod was however not possible, since eel tend to rise to the upper part of the net, together with cod...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the size {{selectivity}} of cod in static fishing gears such as pots and traps. In this field study, floating fishing pots were equipped with 40, 45 and 50 mm <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> escape <b>windows</b> in order to estimate the size selectivity of cod at different mesh sizes. Relationships between selectivity parameters and mesh size, as well as an optimal mesh size for the escape window with respect to current minimum landing size of cod in the Baltic Sea were sought. The results show that the floating pot is not only species selective when used in the Baltic Sea cod fishery, the implementation of an escape window reduced the proportion of undersized bycatch in the pots by more than 90 %. The estimated length at 50 % retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the escape window, while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50 % retention and current minimal landing size of 38 cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45 mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0. 01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40 mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an escape window. This result could be explained as a "saturation effect", i. e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea.

In these surveys, the traditionally used 40 mm diamond mesh codend and an experimental <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> codend were used under commercial conditions.

For example, in a mesh of 391876 nodes the average distance is reduced from 417. 33 to 17. 32 by adding hierarchical lines. This is gained by increasing the number of lines by 4. 20 % compared to the non-hierarchical structure. A similar hierarchical extension of the torus structure also results in logarithmic dependen-cies, the relative difference between performance of mesh and torus structures being less significant than for non-hierarchical structures, especially for large structures. The skew and extended meshes are introduced as variants of the perfect <b>square</b> <b>mesh</b> and their performances studied, and it is shown that while they allow for more flexibility in design and construction of structures supporting topological rout-ing, their performances are comparable to the performance of the perfect <b>square</b> <b>mesh.</b> Finally suggestions for further research within the field is given...|$|R
