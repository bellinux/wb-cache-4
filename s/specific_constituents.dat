40|$|A {{range of}} {{engineering}} alloys {{was selected to}} create two distinct sets of structures. One was functionally graded materials (FGM) - using pairs of these alloys - and the second type {{was a series of}} wafer-layered structures using pairs of these alloys in different combinations. The aim of this investigation was to identify unique sets of structures of alloys which provide very different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) compared to those of individual elements. The process used to create these structures was laser direct metal deposition (DMD) additive manufacturing technology. The linear thermal expansion coefficients of these samples were measured and the results show that specific sets of FGM and wafer type structures of <b>specific</b> <b>constituent</b> metal alloys can be fabricated by DMD, in which the overall coefficient of thermal expansion of these new structures is significantly different from that of each alloy when measured individually.

50|$|The Young Czech Party {{ushered in}} the democratization of {{political}} parties and thus, greater representation in politics. By 1901, the Young Czech Party had lost its predominance in Czech politics. Its decline was accompanied by the growth of other Czech mass parties. The Christian Socialism Party and the Social Democracy Party are examples of two steadily growing and established mass parties. Czech political parties after the year 1900 were organized both as national parties and as parties with <b>specific</b> <b>constituents</b> or interests. This serves to display the greater democratization and diversification of Czech political parties. The Young Czechs, despite decreasing popularity, committed the Party to positive politics and found opposition to be unproductive. The Party thrived with forming coalitions and negotiations with parties such as the Social Democrats and the Progressives. Thus, the Young Czech Party continued {{to have a very}} important role in Czech politics. The Czech National Council, which the Party helped establish in 1900, served as the coordinating body for all Czech parties. The Young Czechs remained the strongest influence in the Council up to 1914.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an event-based {{approach}} for Chinese sentence compression without using any training corpus. We enhance the linguistically-motivated heuristics by exploiting event word significance and event information density.

The heuristics are only required to determine possibly removable constituents instead of selecting <b>specific</b> <b>constituents</b> for removal, and thus are easier to develop and port to other languages and domains. The experimental results show that around 72 % of our automatic compressions are grammatically and semantically correct, preserving around 69 % {{of the most important}} information on average. ...|$|E

The roles of <b>specific</b> <b>constituents</b> of integrin-mediated adhesions, which are collectively known as the 'integrin adhesome', in diverse pathological states are becoming clear.

The proposed algorithm facilitates belief propagation by utilizing the <b>specific</b> <b>constituent</b> codes {{that exist in}} the factor graph, which results in an express journey (XJ) for belief information to propagate in each decoding iteration. In addition, this XJ-BP decoder employs a novel round-trip message passing scheduling method for the increased efficiency. The proposed method simplifies min-sum (MS) BP decoder by 40. 6 %. Along with the round-trip scheduling, the XJ-BP algorithm reduces the computational complexity of MS BP decoding by 90. 4 %; this enables an energy-efficient hardware implementation of BP decoding in practice.

To test the rigor of this correlation a second study was undertaken with a further 37 tomato varieties selected for low, medium and high rutin levels. We show that the flavonol rutin contributes to the greatest extent to the antioxidant capacity of tomatoes and suggest that this flavonoid may be a useful target for up-regulation in tomatoes in order to improve their antioxidant status...|$|R

When OS from Manduca sexta larvae is deposited on N. attenuata wounded leaves, the major FAC N-linolenoyl-glutamic acid (18 : 3 -Glu) is modified within seconds by a heat labile process. Some of the major modified forms are oxygenated products derived from 13 -lipoxygenase activity and one of these derivatives, 13 -oxo- 13 : 2 -Glu, is an active elicitor of enhanced JA biosynthesis and differential monoterpene emission in N. attenuata leaves...|$|E

Those of highest molecular weight (70, 000 - 120, 000) also occurred in the washed membrane fraction of the cell and may therefore be derived from the thylakoids, to which the phycobilisomes are attached in vivo. Colorless polypeptides of lesser molecular weight (30, 000 - 70, 000) appeared to be <b>specific</b> <b>constituents</b> of the phycobilisome.

30|$|One {{may follow}} a second approach, {{referred}} to as the sequential approach, and focus on one <b>specific</b> <b>constituent</b> such as the lithospheric magnetic field (e.g., Maus et al., 2008).

This is a complex and subjective procedure where the investigator’s decisions are needed all along the way to isolate the corresponding contributions. This approach successfully led to a suite of lithospheric field models with unprecedented spatial resolution (SH degree 133 for the MF 7 model). Even though specific problems related to spectral leakage can arise (Sabaka and Olsen, 2006; Thébault et al., 2012), implying that all SH coefficients are not necessarily well resolved, these models clearly revealed striking regional correlations between magnetic anomalies and continental geological bodies at small spatial scales.|$|R
