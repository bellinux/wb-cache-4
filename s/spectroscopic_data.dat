5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>data</b> on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

While <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>data</b> {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3bar based on the <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>data</b> in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>data</b> in the wavelength range 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|E

This method {{is intended to}} help astronomers to handle complex <b>spectroscopic</b> line <b>data</b> cubes where the inspection of the channel and moment maps is difficult. Due to the Hughes phenomenon, the number of input images for the segmentation process is limited. Therefore, the spectrum of each pixel is fitted {{with a mixture of}} 6 Gaussians with fixed mean values and variances. The maps of the Gaussian weights are the input for a Markovian segmentation algorithm. The final segmentation map contains classes of pixels with similar spectral line profiles. The application of our method to the Hi data cube of the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4254 shows that kinematically interesting regions can be detected and masked by our method. ...|$|R

25|$|It {{was once}} widely {{hypothesized}} that ethane produced {{in this fashion}} on Titan rained back onto the moon's surface, and over time had accumulated into hydrocarbon seas or oceans covering much of the moon's surface. Infrared telescopic observations cast significant doubt on this hypothesis, and the Huygens probe, which landed on Titan in 2005, failed to observe any surface liquids, although it did photograph features that could be presently dry drainage channels. In December 2007 the Cassini probe found at least one lake at Titan’s south pole, now called Ontario Lacus because of the lake's similar area to Lake Ontario on Earth (approximately 20,000nbsp&km2).

500|$|The cyclol fabric {{was shown}} to be implausible for several reasons.

Maurice Huggins calculated that several non-bonded atoms of the cyclol fabric would approach more closely than allowed by their van der Waals radii; for example, the [...] inner Hα and Cα atoms of the lacunae would be separated by only 1.68 Å (Figure 5). [...] Haurowitz showed chemically that the outside of proteins could not have {{a large number of}} hydroxyl groups, a key prediction of the cyclol model, whereas Meyer and Hohenemser showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state. [...] More general chemical arguments against the cyclol model were given by Bergmann and Niemann and by Neuberger. [...] Infrared <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>data</b> showed that the number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis, and that intact, folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups; both observations contradict the cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins. [...] Finally, proteins were known to contain proline in significant quantities (typically 5%); since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds, proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric. [...] An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann. [...] Moreover, a supporting piece of evidence—the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 amino-acid residues—was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|... 2D {{correlation}} analysis originated from 2D NMR spectroscopy. Isao Noda developed perturbation based 2D spectroscopy in the 1980s. This technique required sinusoidal perturbations to the chemical system under investigation. This {{specific type of}} the applied perturbation severely limited its possible applications. Following research done by several groups of scientists, perturbation based 2D spectroscopy could be developed to a more extended and generalized broader base. Since the development of generalized 2D {{correlation analysis}} in 1993 based on Fourier transformation of the data, 2D correlation analysis gained widespread use.
