A total of 39 species were caught, 32 by <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> and 33 at the intake, with 26 species being caught by both methods. The abundance and biomass were several times higher at the intake than in the <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> samples. Although the average length was higher in the <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> samples {{in the case of}} most species, almost all length classes of each population were also present in the samples from the cooling water intake.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to study the causes of by-catch in shrimp fishing gears in The Gambia waters and to propose measures to reduce the catch of juvenile and undersized fish. Catch and discard of undersized fish by shrimp trawlers {{is a matter of}} concern. Four methods of by-catch reduction are studied in this report including the Nordmøre grate, grid, enlarged mesh and square mesh {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate method for by-catch reduction in The Gambia waters. Square mesh was found to be the most likely method to reduce by-catch and should be applied in shrimp trawl, shrimp drift gill net and <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> fisheries in The Gambia waters. The method is simple and does no t require extra netting material. The diamond mesh netting of any of the gear can be turned to 90 º and the meshes mounted through the bars to attain square shape meshes.

40|$|Sampling for glass eels of the shortfinned eel, Anguilla australis, was {{conducted}} {{in a number of}} estuaries in south-eastern Australia using glass eel and <b>stow</b> <b>nets</b> during the winter and spring months of 1994 and 1995. Preliminary modelling of the invasion of A. australis glass eels was undertaken by determining correlations between Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) of glass eels and water temperature, electrical conductivity, lunar phase and height of high tide. Low ( 0 m AHD) tide height showed significant correlation with high CPUE, but lunar phase (as moon age in days) did not. There appears to be some scope for predicting the invasion of A. australis glass eels into south-eastern Australian estuaries using temperature and electrical conductivity as key criteria for determining when glass eel fishing should commence.

40|$|AbstractFrom March 1989 until May 1995 overall 675 hauls were {{performed}} using a commercial <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> vessel {{to get information}} concerning spatial and seasonal distribution, length frequency distribution, stock situation and migration patterns of lampreys in the Elbe estuary in northern Germany. 2217 river lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis) and 10 sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) were caught during the whole study period. The river lamprey occurred in 40. 3 % of the performed <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> hauls. The catch success was highest in the western main channel, whereas the frequency of occurrence of river lampreys was only about 10. 9 % at the most upstream site in the southern marginal area. In 1989 and 1990 significantly more than 50 % of the hauls contained river lampreys. In contrast, from 1991 to 1995 their frequency of occurrence was lower than 40 %, in 1991 even lower than 20 %. Sea lampreys occurred only at 6 from 9 sampled sites and were only observed in 1990 and 1992 – 1994. Total lengths of river lampreys varied between 7 and 46 cm. Based on the length frequency distribution, the following three size classes of river lampreys were separated: LF I (7 to 16 cm), LF II (17 – 26 cm) and LF III (27 – 46 cm). The majority of the caught individuals could be grouped in size class LF III. Total lengths of sea lampreys ranged between 69 and 85 cm and were restricted to only one size class (PM III). 70 % of all sea lampreys were caught in April and May. Most of the sea lampreys were observed in the eastern main channel. The maximum average abundance of river lampreys was observed with 6. 75 Ind · m− 3 · 10 − 6 {{in the same area}} in 1992. However, in 1993 and 1994 the highest average abundances of river lampreys occurred in the western main channel. Based on redundance analysis, a significant correlation between the abundances of lampreys and the environmental variables autumn, spring, summer, salinity, water temperature, grain size, new moon and first moon quarter was found. The downstream migrating river lampreys of size class LF I und the sea lampreys during their anadromous spawning migration showed highest abundances mainly in spring, whereas high abundances of river lampreys of size class LF II in the feeding phase occurred in summer. The presence of both size classes LF I and LF II confirms the successful reproduction of river lampreys in the catchment area of the Elbe. The observation of river lampreys of size class LF III during their anadromous spawning migration was closely correlated with the variable autumn. A spring spawning migration of river lampreys was not observed...|$|E

Comparing the status on coastal fisheries of the East Sea, Yellow Sea and South Sea in Korea, scientific evidence was made for fisheries management on coastal fisheries based on characteristics of each sea area. From 1990 to 2011, the catch of coastal fisheries in Korean waters ranged from 150, 000 mt to 230, 000 mt, {{with an average of}} 190, 000 mt, and it accounted for 15 % in average of total catch fished in adjacent waters of Korea. In order of catch by coastal fisheries, gillnet (36. 7 %) was the primary fishery, followed by coastal complex (24. 7 %), <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> (18. 3 %), trap (12. 9 %), lift net (3. 9 %), purse seine (3. 0 %) and beam trawl (0. 4 %) fisheries. In order of catch by species, anchovy (15. 0 %) had the largest proportion of total catch, followed by common squid (10. 3 %), akiami paste shrimp (5. 2 %), blue crab (3. 9 %) and octopus (3. 7 %). Of the average catch by sea area from 1990 to 2011, Yellow Sea, South Sea and East Sea were 37. 4 %, 34. 6 % and 28. 0 %, respectively. Since 2000 s, however, the average catch of South Sea has accounted for the largest proportion. The number of permitted fishing vessels involved in 8 coastal fisheries was 55, 336 vessels in average from 1997 to 2011.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{continued}} from the "Development of stownet on anchor fishery: its establishment in Ariake Sound and fishing to the colonized Korea Sea" {{in the last}} number of this bulletin and covers its development after the World War II. Despite losing the Korea Sea as a fishing area after the war, stownet on anchor fishery {{as a kind of}} set-net to catch fish moving on tidal currents had been devised reaching a developmental peak in the 1950 s. The reasons besides early motorization used to increase freshness were recovery of fish stock, social factors involving demand for food, high-inflation, and a lack of employment opportunities. With the post war fisheries reform. offshore Ariake Sound was divided into the surrounding four prefectures which caused serious conflict between those claiming territorial fishing rights. Meanwhile fishing had continued to operate in the form of mutual entrance or unofficial agreements. During the period of high economic growth beginning in 1960, stownet on anchor fishery had rapidly declined as a result of over-fishing, and evolved into the more profitable laver culture which has been newly established, requiring less labor. At present, <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> on anchor fishery exists only sporadically and is not of industrial importance. However this form of fishery has taken root as a side job of laver culture because of its compatibility with available boats and labor. This fishery has been revaluated as being labor-saving and as being an energy-saving fishing method, but its management is not foreseeable due to local marketability of indigenous species and low level of fish stock. It has transformed little during the past 60 years following the war in terms of gear structure, fishing scale. fishing method., fishing ground. and target species, with the exception of changes in the materials of the gear and increased horsepower...|$|E

40|$|Seasonal, diurnal and size-dependent {{trends of}} food composition, prey {{selection}} and daily ration of juvenile twaite shad were investigated in the Elbe estuary. Juvenile twaite shad were caught for diet analysis with framed gape <b>stow</b> <b>nets</b> in the mesohaline {{region of the}} Elbe estuary in April, July and August 1993. Copepods, mysids and fish were identified as main food items of juvenile twaite shad. In August, the importance of mysids and fish as main prey organisms increased with increasing total length of twaite shad, whereas the proportion of copepods decreased. During night fishes were consumed {{to a lesser extent}} than during day. Insects were mainly eaten during night. In the early morning copepods were main food items. Juvenile twaite shad preferred the mysidacean Mesopodopsis slabberi and the sprat Sprattus sprattus. Cladocerans were ingested corresponding to their availability, whereas all other food items were avoided. Daily ration according to WINBERG (1956) showed peak values in spring and summer and decreased during the following season.

40|$|European eel Anguilla {{anguilla}} (L.) {{populations have}} declined dramatically {{during the last}} decades and are now among the most critically endangered fish populations in Europe. The limitation of upstream migration of glass eels {{is considered to be}} one of the key factors reducing eel populations. The migration of eels in their juvenile stage (glass eels) was studied, and options to improve eel passage at a tidal barrier complex at the mouth of the Yser River, Flanders, Belgium, were assessed. Glass eels were sampled during tidal rise with <b>stow</b> <b>nets</b> and lift nets to analyse their distribution over the study area, while a fyke net was used to evaluate the impact of limited barrier opening on glass eel migration. Support-vector machine-based analysis of the lift net data indicated that migrating glass eels are attracted by the fresh water flow leaking from the barriers, whereas other variables such as the sampling location only had a weak influence on the glass eel density. Limited barrier opening during tidal rise appeared to be a cost-efficient and effective mitigation option to improve upstream glass eel migration without significant intrusion of seawater. Adjusted barrier management could often be implemented and applied on numerous tidal barriers. Therefore the results of this paper are of interest to a wide range of river managers and stakeholders and may contribute to the conservation of many eel populations...|$|R
40|$|Early (post) larval fish {{constitute}} {{a significant part}} of the temporary hyperbenthos, i. e. of the fauna living in the lower reaches of the water column close to the substratum. Information on the densities and spatial and temporal variations of these stages, as well as on their lengths at the moment of occurrence, can be an important contribution to the knowledge of their dispersion, migrations and to the identification of possible bottlenecks in their recruitment. Therefore the hyperbenthos of the Voordelta, a shallow coastal zone in front of the Dutch Delta, as well as that of the subtidal channels and the intertidal brackish marsh creeks of the Westerschelde Estuary, was sampled monthly during one year by means of a sledge and a <b>stow</b> <b>net.</b> A total of 37 taxa were recorded from 410 samples. Densities often exceeded 400 ind 1000 m - 2 in the Voordelta and 300 ind 1000 m - 2 in the Westerschelde, including the tidal marshes of Waarde and Saeftinghe. The dominant taxa were clupeid larvae (predominantly herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus, Pomatoschistus spp. (a mixture of sand goby P. minutus and Lozano's goby P. lozanoi), common goby Pomatoschistus microps, Syngnathus spp. (probably almost exclusively Nilsson's pipefish S. rostellatus), plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea and flounder Pleuronectes flesus. Most species were found at a larger size in the Westerschelde (and in the tidal marshes) suggesting migration from the shallow coastal area into the estuary. Several species utilize the tidal marshes in the brackish reaches of the Westerschelde. The nursery value of these areas however, is restricted to specific early life history stages of a few species, especially flounder, bass Dicentrarchus labrax and the common goby. The estuary itself seems to function as a nursery for other species like sole and plaice. The hyperbenthic sledge was found to sample specific life history stages of postlarval flatfish (early settlement stages at the onset of asymmetry), which are not easy to sample with other types of sampling gear...|$|E
40|$|A <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> (90 m 2 opening) was used, {{at regular}} {{intervals}} between July 1989 and June 1993, to collect fish over ca. 4 h on both the flood and ebb tides at five sites distributed at regularly spaced distances throughout the Elbe Estuary. Overall, 53. 4 % of the species were marine, {{and some of these}} were abundant, e. g. Clupea harengus, Pleuronectes flesus, Pomatoschistus minutus, Merlangius merlangus and Sprattus sprattus. However, in terms of number of individuals, such species contributed only 9. 1 %, compared with 90. 0 % by anadromous species, which was predominantly due to exceptionally high catches of Osmerus eperlanus. The ichthyofaunal compositions on the flood and ebb tides were similar, even downstream where salinities change markedly during each tidal cycle. Although this is probably due in part to groups offish being swept first upstream on the flood tide and then back downstream on the ebb tide, several species clearly tended to occupy particular regions of the estuary. Each year the species composition changed sequentially from the most downstream site (max. salinity = ca. 31. 4 %‰) to the most upstream site (max. salinity = ca. 1. 5 %‰), mainly {{as a result of a}} sequential decline in the number and abundance of marine species and a progressive increase in the contributions of both anadromous and freshwater species. However, the marine species diagnostic of differences in the compositions among regions varied between years. Thus, for example, the diagnostic species for the downstream sites were C. harengus and M. merlangus in 1990 / 1991 and S. sprattus in 1992 / 1993, reflecting differences in the recruitment strengths of these marine species in the two years. The ichthyofaunal composition exhibited pronounced annual cyclical changes in each region and thus occurred irrespective of whether or not the salinity in a region underwent pronounced changes during the year. This cyclicity was attributable to intra-annual variations in the times of recruitment of certain marine species, particularly in the downstream region, and to seasonal migrations of diadromous species into each region, as well as to the movements of freshwater species into the upstream region in winter and early spring...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of an estuarine brackish marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands) by {{fish and crustaceans}} visiting the intertidal creeks at rising tides was investigated over an 18 mo period. Samples were collected every month over a tidal cycle. A <b>stow</b> <b>net</b> passively fished the nekton migrating {{in and out of}} the marsh habitat. Simultaneous measurements of current speed and waterheight allowed for quantification of the catches. Multivariate clustering and ordination techniques were applied to assess temporal changes in the nekton assemblage. A total of 68 fish and crustacean species were caught but only 38 were regular visitors of the marsh creek. The marsh nekton community proved to have a very stable character. Only 40 % of the observed variance could be explained. The seasonal appearance of juvenile stages of fish and crustaceans was found to differentiate between spring and summer-autumn communities. The environmental variables measured (i. e. temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration and detritus standing stock) did not correlate well with the observed changes in community structure. The mysid shrimp Neomysis integer dominated the community, both in density and biomass, during most of the year. Early postlarval flounder Pleuronectes flesus characterized the spring nekton assemblage. Early postlarval brown shrimp Crangon crangon was abundant from spring through autumn. In late summer juveniles of seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, common goby Pomatoschistus microps and shore crab Carcinus maenas were typical members of the marsh creek nekton. The hyperbenthic fauna of the marsh was comparable to the hyperbenthos found in the adjacent subtidal parts of the Westerschelde estuary while the epifauna of both areas differed substantially. It is argued that the marsh under study is a nursery ground for only a small number of estuarine inhabitants: C. crangon, P. flesus, C. maenas, P. microps, D. labrax and possibly 2 mullet species. Adult flounder, adult and juvenile common goby, juvenile seabass and the early postlarval brown shrimp all use the creeks as feeding ground, mainly preying upon the creek infauna and mysids. Given the high abundance of hyperbenthic mysid shrimp in the marsh and their presumed role in detritus-based food chains, we believe marsh studies should not refrain from considering this component of the nekton. This is the first study reporting on the nekton use of a European marsh. The need for similar research in other European marshes is stressed...|$|E
