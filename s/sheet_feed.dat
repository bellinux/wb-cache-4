After the flow leaves the trailing edge, this {{difference in}} velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet. As the vortex sheet is convected downstream from the trailing edge, it rolls up at its outer edges, eventually forming distinct wingtip vortices.

40|$|AbstractA turbine blisk, which {{combines}} blades and a disk together, {{is one of}} the most important components of an aero engine. In the process of blisk electrochemical machining (ECM), the sheet cathode, which is usually used as a tool electrode, has a complicated structure. In addition to that, the channel between the adjacent blades is narrow and twisted, so interference is apt to happen when the <b>sheet</b> cathode <b>feeds</b> into the channel. Therefore, it is important to choose suitable trajectory control strategy. In this paper, a new trajectory control strategy of the sheet cathode is presented and corresponding simulation analysis is conducted on the basis of an actual blisk model. The simulation results demonstrate that the <b>sheet</b> cathode can <b>feed</b> into the channel by a spatial line trajectory without interference. Moreover, the verification experiments are carried out according to the simulation. The experimental results show that the cathode can move into the channel without interference. It is verified that the new trajectory control strategy is correct and can be used in the blisk ECM process successfully...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Wilkes Land {{continental}} slope contains an intricate network of submarine canyons {{that on the}} continental rise develop {{into a series of}} chan-nel and overbank deposits of turbidite systems. We can define upper-fan, mid-dle-fan, and lower-fan provinces. The Wilkes Land upper fans are character-ized by large channels with relief up to 900 m, distances between levee crests up to 18 km, and channel-floor widths up to 6 km. Middle-fan channels also have high relief (; 300 m), and locally, interchannel areas exhibit mounded contourite-style deposits with high relief (up to 490 m). Within middle-fan sed-iment mounds there are acoustic facies of channel–overbank deposits from tur-bidity currents, and of sediment waves from contour-current sedimentation. The lower rise is characterized by small, shallow channels (50 – 75 m relief) and by interchannel areas of low relief, both characteristic of a lower-fan environ-ment. The Wilkes Land turbidite systems show the following significant mor-phological differences compared to most river-sourced fans: (1) multiple large tributary channels across the upper and middle fan, (2) channel relief several times greater (900 m) than typical relief (100 – 200 m) for channels on fans less than 300 km in diameter, and (3) steep middle-fan and lower-fan gradients. We interpret the differences in channel network patterns, channel size, and middle-fan and lower-fan gradients between the Wilkes Land fans and other fans to result from the continental ice <b>sheet</b> <b>feeding</b> glacial ice streams that reached the outer continental shelf at times of glacial maxima. The Wilkes Land can-yon–channel network patterns are comparable with the high-latitude Lauren-tian Fan and Labrador Sea channels. The Laurentian Fan also has large upper-fan channels with larger relief (800 m) than typical relief (200 – 300 m) expected for fans that are 600 km in diameter. Both the Labrador Sea and Laurentian Fan are fed by continental ice sheets at the shelf edge...|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple but accurate potential flow model {{was developed for}} studying the symmetric vortex flow on cones. The model is {{a modified version of}} the model first developed by Bryson, in which discrete vortices and straight-line <b>feeding</b> <b>sheets</b> were used to represent the flow field. It differs, however, in the zero-force condition used to position the vortices and determine their circulation strengths. The Bryson model imposed the condition that the net force on the <b>feeding</b> <b>sheets</b> and discrete vortices must be zero. The proposed model satisfies this zero-force condition by having the vortices move as free vortices, at a velocity equal to at the local crossflow velocity at their centers. When the free-vortex assumption is made, a solution is obtained in the form of two nonlinear algebraic equations that relate the vortex center coordinates and vortex strengths to the cone angle and angle of attack. The vortex center locations calculated using the model are in good agreement with experimental values. The cone normal forces as well as center locations are in good agreement with the vortex cloud method of calculating symmetric flow fields...|$|R
