5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's <b>shadow</b> <b>crossing</b> the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E

40|$|Care of {{the phase}} wind-up {{correction}} should be reasonably taken in precise point positioning. In practice, correct computation of phase wind-up relies mainly upon {{the information about}} the satellite attitude, which should be modeled differently when satellites undergo eclipsing. Different GPS satellite types would be subject to different eclipsing periods. For instance, GPS ⅡR satellites can experience noon and midnight turn maneuvers, GPS ⅡF satellites suffer from noon maneuver and <b>shadow</b> <b>crossing,</b> and GPS Ⅱ/ⅡA satellites may further experience post-shadow recovery periods when compared to ⅡF ones. As for the BDS non-GEO satellites, one should take into account the attitude control switching between the nominal and the orbit-normal mode. This paper presents a model enabling the attitude to be correctly computed for both eclipsing as well as non-eclipsing satellites. Numerical tests using real data are then performed in order to verify our model presented. As far as the filtered residuals are concerned, it is found that, their maximum residual could exceed 20 cm during the eclipsing periods. This problem is fortunately solvable when use of our model has been made, since the residuals reduce to below 5 cm. It should be noted that, our numerical results may be slightly different when we use precise satellite orbit and clock products delivered by different Analysis Centers. Furthermore, the <b>shadow</b> <b>crossing</b> period takes typically up to 1 hour for GPS Ⅱ/ⅡA satellites, during which the yaw attitude is controlled entirely by the positive yaw bias (Ⅱ/ⅡA of 0. 5 &# 176;). The Ⅱ/ⅡA post-shadow recovery periods, covering about 30 minutes, still cannot be fully modeled; the data collected within this period should thereby be excluded...|$|E
40|$|When {{satellites}} {{enter into}} the noon maneuver or the <b>shadow</b> <b>crossing</b> regimes, the actual attitudes will depart from their nominal values. If improper attitude models are used, the induced-errors due to the wind-up effect and satellite antenna PCO (Phase Center Offset) will deteriorate the positioning accuracy. Because different generations of satellites adopt different attitude control models, the influences on the positioning performances deserve further study. Consequently, the impact of three eclipsing strategies on the single-system and multi-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) are analyzed. According {{to the results of}} the eclipsing monitor, 65 globally distributed MGEX (Multi-GNSS EXperiment) stations for 31 -day period in July 2017 are selected to perform G/R/E/C/GR/GREC PPP in both static and kinematic modes. The results show that the influences of non-nominal attitudes are related to the magnitude of the PCO values, maximum yaw angle differences, the duration of maneuver, the value of the sun angle and the satellite geometric strength. For single-system, using modeled attitudes rather than the nominal ones will greatly improve the positioning accuracy of GLONASS-only and BDS-only PPP while slightly contributions to the GPS-only and GALILEO-only PPP. Deleting the eclipsing satellites may sometimes induce a longer convergence time and a worse solution due to the poor satellite geometry, especially for GLONASS kinematic PPP when stations are located in the low latitude and BDS kinematic PPP. When multi-GNSS data are available, especially four navigation systems, the accuracy improvements of using the modeled attitudes or deleting eclipsing satellites are non-significant...|$|E
40|$|GPS draconitic signal (351. 6 ± 0. 2 days) and its higher {{harmonics}} {{are observed}} at almost all IGS {{products such as}} position time series of IGS permanent stations. Orbital error and multipath are known as two possible sources of these signals. The effect of Earth <b>shadow</b> <b>crossing</b> of GPS satellites is another suspect for this signal. Up to {{now there is no}} serious attempt to investigate this dependence. AMATLAB toolbox is developed and used to determine the satellites located at the earth shadow. RINEX observation files and precise ephemeris are imported to the toolbox and a cylindrical model is used to detect the shadow regions. Data of these satellites were removed from the RINEX observation files of three IGS permanent stations (GRAZ,ONSAandWSRT) and new RINEX observation fileswere created. The time span of these data is about 11 years. The new and original fileswere then processed using precise point positioning (PPP) method to determine position time series, for further analysis. Both the original and new time series were analyzed using the least squares harmonic estimation (LS-HE) in the following steps. The 1 st step is the validation of the draconitic harmonics signature in the original position time series of the three stations. The 2 nd step does the same for the new time series. It confirms that the power spectrum at the draconitic signals decreases to some extent for the new time series. The difference between the original and new time series (difference between all three position quantity (X, Y and Z)) is then analyzed in the 3 rd step. Signature of the draconitic harmonics is also observed to the differences. The results represent that all eight harmonics of GPS draconitic period do exist at the residuals and mainly they decrease. All of the three stations were then processed together using the multivariate LS-HE method. At the 4 th step, the difference of the spectral values between the original time series and new times serieswere analyzed. Decreasing of the spectral values at most harmonics (e. g. 1 st, 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th, 7 th and 8 th) represents the effect of removing satellite observations at shadow of the earth on draconitic harmonics. At least, five harmonics among seven shows the amelioration of results (draconitic error reduction) after removing the earth shadowed data from RINEX raw data. The results show that the draconitic year’s component of data is in part due to eclipsing satellites...|$|E
