The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of formation span a wide range from - 0. 64 to + 0. 55 kB/atom, and the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of alloying ranged from - 0. 39 to + 1. 0 kB/atom. This range exceeds the range of configurational entropy of a binary alloy, which reaches a maximum value of + 0. 69 kB/atom and a minimum value of 0 k B /atom. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the NiTi martensitic transition was measured using low-temperature calorimetry and inelastic neutron-scattering. The high-temperature B 2 phase of NiTi has a <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> 0. 5 k B /atom larger than the low-temperature martensitic phase. The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> accounts for the total entropy of the austenitic-martensitic phase transition. Inelastic neutron scattering was used to show that the phonon DOS of V is unchanged between 20 and 1000 °C, inconsistent with the phonon softening expected from thermal expansion. It is found that the effects of volume expansion and rising temperature exert equal and opposite shifts on the phonon DOS. The pure temperature dependence of the phonon DOS is due to strong phonon-phonon scattering, which in turn leads to a large anharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> contribution at high temperature. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of eight chemically disordered Cu-Au alloys was measured using inelastic neutron scattering.

Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on powdered [ [...] . ]. The alloy was prepared in two states of chemical order: 1) with equilibrium [ [...] . ] order, and 2) an fcc solid solution prepared by high- energy ball milling. The main difference in the phonon DOS of the ordered and disordered alloys occurs near 39 meV, the energy of a peak arising from optical modes in the ordered alloy.

Samples of [ [...] . ] were prepared with two microstructures: 1) with equilibrium [ [...] . ] order, and 2) with partial disorder (having a large [ [...] . ] chemical order parameter, but without the tetragonality of the unit cell). We measured the difference in their heat capacities from 60 K to 325 K and inelastic neutron scattering spectra at four values of Q at 11 K and at 300 K.

Neutron energy loss spectra were measured for two states of nanophase Fe: 1) as-milled, with a characteristic nanocrystallite size of 12 nm, and 2) annealed, with a characteristic crystallite size of 28 nm.

The anharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of FeAl is measured in the temperature range of 10 K to 1323 K.

Principles of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab-initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic x-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information. It is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing.

40|$|A close {{inspection}} of neutron spectra of glass formers {{in the frequency}} region above the boson peak does not show the constant eigenvalue density expected for a random dynamical matrix, but a slow decrease towards higher eigenvalues. In 1, 4 -polybutadiene and selenium, the slope becomes steeper with increasing temperature in the undercooled liquid, suggesting an influence of the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy.</b> One can describe the behaviour quantitatively {{in terms of a}} balance between level repulsion (from the randomness of the dynamical matrix) and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy.</b> On the basis of this evidence, the boson peak must be a crossover from such a balance at higher frequencies to a mixture of sound waves and additional excitations at low frequency.

40|$|AbstractThe heat {{capacities}} of two samples of a fcc Cu–Zn alloy with the composition CuZn 15 and CuZn 34 were measured from T= 5 K to 573 K using relaxation and differential scanning calorimetry. Below ∼ 90 K, they are characterised by negative excess heat capacities deviating from ideal mixing {{by up to}} − 0. 20 and − 0. 44 J·mol− 1 ·K− 1 for CuZn 15 and CuZn 34, respectively. The excess heat capacities produce excess <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies,</b> which are less negative compared to the excess entropy available from the literature. Since the literature entropy data contain both, the configurational and the vibrational part of the entropy, the difference is attributed to the excess configurational entropy. The thermodynamics of different short-range ordered samples was also investigated. The extent of the short-range order had no influence on the heat capacity below T= 300 K. Above T= 300 K, where the ordering changed during the measurement, the heat capacity depended strongly on the thermal history of the samples. From these data, the heat and entropy of ordering was calculated. The results on the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> {{of this study were}} also used to test a relationship for estimating the excess <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{applies the}} theory of lattice {{dynamics}} towards two applications: <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> in alloys and dielectric absorption in oxides. <b>Vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> between ordered-L 12 and disordered phases in the Au 3 Cu, Cu 3 Au, Cu 3 Pd, Pd 3 Cu, Cu 3 Pt, Au 3 Pd, and Pd 3 Au systems are calculated. This study was done using first-principles energy calculations and the supercell method. Calculated values of ASÊ»rder-disorder ranged between - 0. 05 - 0. 07 kB. Length-dependent transferable force constants are used to predict <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> in the Au-Cu, Au-Pd, and Cu-Pd systems. The stiffness of these force constants is obtained from a function that depends on bond length; this function is determined by fitting polynomials to a small set of calculated force constants. Once a function that describes force constant stiffness vs. bond length is determined for a particular pair type, the function can be transferred between different configurations and chemical systems to construct force constants for an arbitrary structure. These transferable force constants are shown to accurately predict <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of L 12 -ordered and disordered phases in Cu 3 Au, Au 3 Pd, Pd 3 Au, Cu 3 Pd, and Pd 3 Au. The dielectric absorption at microwave frequencies in binary oxides is calculated within an empirical Buckingham energy model. For MgO, the calculated dielectric losses at room temperature agrees relatively well with experiments, and the temperature dependence is in qualitative agreement. We also model systems to gain insight into the effects of different cation sizes and masses. We explain our results in terms of anharmonic forces, atomic masses, and phonon dispersion curves. by Eric John Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Phonon {{density of}} states (DOS) curves were {{measured}} on alloys of face-centered-cubic (fcc) Au-Fe using nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS). The NRIXS and INS results were combined to obtain the total phonon DOS and the partial phonon DOS curves of Au and Fe atoms from which <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> were calculated. The main effect on the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of alloying comes from a stiffening of the Au partial phonon DOS with Fe concentration. Force constants were calculated from first principles for several compositions and show a local stiffening of Au-Au bonds close to Fe atoms. The calculated phonon DOS curves reproduce the experimental trend. The stiffening is attributed to two main effects comparable in magnitude: (i) an increase in electron density in the free-electron-like states and (ii) stronger sd hybridization...|$|R
40|$|The phonon {{densities of}} states for pure {{vanadium}} and the solid solutions V- 6. 25 % Ni, Pd, Pt were determined from inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The solute atoms caused a large stiffening of the phonons, resulting in large, negative <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of mixing. For V- 6. 25 %Pt, the negative <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing exceeds the conventional positive chemical entropy of mixing. This negative total entropy of mixing should extend to lower concentrations of Pt, {{and the effect}} on the bcc solvus line is discussed. The experimental data were inverted to obtain interatomic force constants by using a Born–von Kármán model with an iterative optimization algorithm. The stiffening of bonds responsible for the decrease of entropy was found to occur mainly in first-nearest-neighbor solute-host bonds, and correlates in part with the solute metallic radius...|$|R

Phonon densities of states {{were obtained for}} bcc solid solutions of V with 3 d, 4 d, and 5 d transition metal solutes, from which <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of alloying were obtained. A good correlation is found between the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of alloying and the electronegativity of transition metal solutes across the 3 d row and down columns of the periodic table. First-principles calculations on supercells matching the experimental compositions predicted a systematic charge redistribution in the nearest-neighbor shell around the solute atoms, also following the Pauling and Watson electronegativity scales.
