40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to devise an improved method for evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of telerobotic on-orbit satellite servicing scenarios. Past, present, and future telerobotic on-orbit servicing systems and their key capabilities are examined. Previous technical and economic analyses of satellite servicing are reviewed and evaluated. The standard method employed by previous feasibility studies is extended, developing a new servicing decision approach incorporating operational uncertainties (launch, docking, et cetera). Comprehensive databases of satellite characteristics and on-orbit failures are developed to provide input to the expected value evaluation of the servicing versus no-servicing decision. Past <b>satellite</b> <b>failures</b> are reviewed and analyzed, including the economic impact of those <b>satellite</b> <b>failures.</b> Opportunities for spacecraft life extension are also determined. Servicing markets of various types are identified and detailed using the results of the database analysis and the new, expected-value-based servicing feasibility method. This expected value market assessment provides a standard basis for satellite servicing decision-making for any proposed servicing architecture. Finally, the method is demonstrated by evaluating a proposed small, lightweight servicer providing retirement services for geosynchronous spacecraft. An additional benefit of the method is that it enables parametric analysis of the sensitivity of economic viability to the probability of docking success, thus establishing a threshold for that critical value. While based on a more economically conservative approach, the new method demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed server in the face of operational uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGPS/IRS {{hybridization}} is a {{good candidate}} to fulfill demanding civil aviation requirements. When {{the integrity of the}} GPS measurements is ensured they may be used to calibrate inertial position and improve accuracy. This can be done in a tightly coupled manner by means of a Kalman filter. Calibrated IRS can ensure coasting while maintaining good short term accuracy and helps detect large GPS failures. The hybridized system must also be able to detect slowly growing errors on GPS measurements that may affect inertial calibration. These errors may affect one or several GPS measurements. Fault detection and exclusion capacity of Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring is limited for GPS, as it is designed for one <b>satellite</b> <b>failure</b> only. Therefore other solutions have been proposed. Among these are the extrapolation method and the solution separation method that are also designed to detect one <b>satellite</b> <b>failure</b> at a time. The study reported in this paper presents first results obtained with an extension of Mats Brenner's separation algorithm for fault detection. That extension concerns detection and isolation of more than one failure during operations ranging from en-route to NPA, with the objective of satisfying the availability requirement. The paper starts with a brief review of the classical Solution Separation method for a single <b>satellite</b> <b>failure</b> detection and isolation. In this section the model of the tightly coupled GPS/IRS system involved in simulations is also presented. The third section is dedicated to theoretical description of the one failure Solution separation fault detection and exclusion algorithm. The next section considers the behavior of the algorithm when two simultaneous range failures occur. In particular the impact of two faulty measurements on the test metrics in the former fault detection and exclusion algorithm is examined. These simulation results are used to discuss the contribution of a two range failure detection algorithm. Afterwards, a two simultaneous range failure detection and exclusion algorithm based on an extension of the nominal Solution Separation method is introduced. Definitions of performance parameters (Horizontal Protection Level, Horizontal Exclusion Level, and Missed Detection Probability), when several pseudo range failures (ramp, bias, etc.) occur simultaneously, are discussed. Finally initial simulation results are presented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{solution to the}} problem of autonomous task allocation for a self-organising constellation of small satellites in Earth orbit. The method allows the constellation members to plan manoeuvres to cluster themselves above particular target longitudes on the Earth’s surface.

Worst case failure configurations are identified for polar orbit constellations and the coverage performance deterioration 'is evaluated by computer simulations.

It is shown that the probability of occurence of a worst case failure configuration is very low, and that the most probable configuration is a uniform distribution of the defective satellites. As a consequence, the maximum tolerable number of satellite failures occuring simultaneously in a constellation can be determined, for a specified minimum coverage performance. Therefore, assuming a given launch delay for the replacement of satellites, one can estimate the necessary overall satellite reliability.
