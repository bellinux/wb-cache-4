2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or spinning reel. [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight. [...] The bait casting reel design will operate well with a wide variety of fishing lines, ranging from braided multifilament and heat-fused [...] "superlines" [...] to copolymer, fluorocarbon, and nylon monofilaments (see Fishing line). [...] Most bait casting reels can also easily be palmed or thumbed to increase the drag, <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> or to accurately halt the lure at a given point in the cast.|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{fly fishing}} on small, clear-water streams can be {{especially}} productive if the angler stays as {{low to the ground}} and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth. Trout tend to face upstream and most of their food is carried to them on the current. For this reason, the fish's attention is normally focused into the current; most anglers move and fish [...] "into the current", fishing from a position downstream of the fish's suspected lie. Trout tend to strike their food at current [...] "edges", where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a [...] "low energy" [...] environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the [...] "edge" [...] of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream. The challenge in stream fishing is placing the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, not long range casting. Done properly, the fly seems to be just floating along in the current with a [...] "perfect drift" [...] as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the [...] "take" [...] in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|With a good rod {{and decent}} mono or flurocarbon line, the 'thump' of a bass should be easily felt on limp line. After the first 'thump', {{wait a second}} {{to see if there}} is a second one as he sucks the worm in further. At this point, or if there is no second 'thump' after a second or so, draw up most of the slack and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> HARD AND FAST. This is {{important}} to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Then hold steady tension on the fish until landed.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{anchoring}} {{consists of}} determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out <b>the</b> scope, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> and assessing where the vessel ends up. The ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected; has suitable holding ground, enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing.|$|R
5000|$|A jigging motion {{can be used}} {{to attract}} fish which are {{normally}} caught while trying to strike the lure but they can also be snagged by <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> as they investigate the jigged lure. The lure can also be fished motionless and the angler feels for the bait to be picked up by a fish and then <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> after waiting for the fish to fully take the bait. After a strike occurs <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> is <b>set</b> and then <b>the</b> fish is hauled in and the caught fish is removed.|$|R
25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly pressed against the rod handle with the index finger of the casting arm. The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with the index finger against the rod handle and lift <b>the</b> rod tip, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to not strike (or <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook)</b> when the fish bites, but rather just reel in. The act of striking while using a circle hook often results in the hook being {{pulled out of the}} fish altogether.|$|E
50|$|A {{fast action}} tip {{will be used}} when fishing jig type lures. The angler can feel and {{therefore}} control what the lure is doing quite easily. Since only the very tip of the rod bends, when a fish strikes the angler has ample rod shaft and backbone to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> correctly.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of some soft molded trailers—particularly split eel trailers—is {{that when a}} fish sucks the lure into its mouth, the trailer tails can catch on the gill rakes. This prolongs {{the time it takes}} the fish to spit out the lure and gives the angler another second to react and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some rods {{are joined}} through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps in <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> and help {{activating}} the rod from tip to butt when casting, {{resulting in a}} better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending {{on the kind of}} rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial fishing rods.|$|R

5000|$|Black drum are {{reported}} to mouth a natural bait, so anglers need {{to wait a few}} seconds before <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> [...] Once a big adult drum grabs the bait, it takes off with gusto, and can put up quite a fight. An unsecured rod can easily be pulled into the water. Landing these big fish on light tackle can be challenging, and since drum are primarily scent-based feeders, there is little disadvantage in using heavier line and tackle. A 40-lb braided line with a comparable weight fluorocarbon leader is a good compromise between castability and strength. However, big drum are frequently caught with everything from 8-lb monofiliment to 100-lb braided lines with heavy steel leaders.|$|R
50|$|Although bass will {{suck the}} bait {{off the bottom}} {{producing}} the familiar 'thump' feel at the rod, they may also pick it up with no indication other than the line starting to move away. Always watch the line on the fall and as it sits there. If it begins moving, figure out which way and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some good baits for perch include worms, {{live and}} dead minnows, small {{freshwater}} clams, crickets, and any small lure resembling any of these. Larger perch are often caught on large live minnow on a jighead, especially when fished over weed beds. Bobbers, if used, should be spindle type {{for the least}} resistance when the bait is struck, but small round Bobbers work well too, yet indicate any slight pull of the bait. Raising the rod top is usually more than enough force to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|In chalk {{streams and}} spring creeks trout often take up {{station at the}} most {{advantageous}} feeding position. Cast upstream and allow the current to present your Pheasant Tail in a natural manner. Alternatively, cast across the stream, allow the fly to sink, and as the fly approaches the feeding trout stop the line and allow the fly to rise in the water. Watch the trout if you can, or alternatively watch {{the tip of the}} fly line for any movement and, if seen, lift the rod tip and gently <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E

50|$|To catch a fish on Reel Fishing {{you must}} do two things, hook the fish and reel it in. When hooking a fish wait until its mouth has {{completely}} covered the hook then hit the reel button to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Once the hook is set then you must reel it in. Do not reel if the fish is resisting {{because you have a}} greater chance of the line snapping or you losing the fish. When the fish is speeding away and then slows that {{is the best time to}} reel it in because the fish will have a lesser chance of resisting.|$|E
5000|$|Power Pro {{a type of}} braided {{fishing line}} made out of a {{material}} called Spectra fibers. It has an equivalent diameter of nearly 1/5 of monofilament. Thus the diameter {{of a piece of}} Power Pro testing at 50 pounds is equivalent to monofilaments' diameter testing at around 12 pounds. It lacks stretch that monofilament has, giving the fisherman a better [...] "feel" [...] and also helps <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> faster. Environmentalists have criticized the use of spectra fiber, as {{it takes a long time}} to degrade thus harming the environment. Spectra is a form of gel-spun polyethylene.|$|E
50|$|Popular among fishermen, tautog have a {{reputation}} for being a particularly tricky fish to catch. Part of this is because of their tendency to live among rocks and other structures that can cause a fisherman’s line to get snagged. The favorite baits for tautog include green crabs, Asian shore crabs, fiddler crabs, clams, shrimp, mussels, sandworms, and lobsters. Tautog fishing may also be difficult due to the tendency of fishermen try to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> as soon as they feel a hit, rather than wait for the tautog to swallow the bait. Rigs with minimal beads, swivels and hooks should be used to prevent entanglement with the rocks, reefs or wrecks that tautog frequent.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> is an unproduced {{screenplay}} by American playwright, Arthur Miller. It {{was written in}} 1947 and {{was intended to be}} produced by Columbia Pictures Studio, Hollywood, and to be directed by Elia Kazan. The screenplay was inspired by the true story of Pete Panto, a young dockworker who stood up against the corrupt Mafia-connected union leadership. Panto was discovered dead in a pit outside New York eighteen months after his disappearance. <b>Set</b> in <b>the</b> Red <b>Hook</b> district of Brooklyn, <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> is <b>the</b> story of Marty Ferrara, a longshoreman who is ‘ready to lay down his life, if need be, to secure one thing - his sense of personal dignity.’ ...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the drop}} lines are <b>set</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> of one line can not touch <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> of another line, {{to prevent the}} fish from getting tangled up in {{multiple}} lines, or getting tangled in lines with other fish already on the line. This might mean using lines just over 1 foot long and having the lines spaced in 3 foot intervals. It is also typical to avoid setting lines directly over stumps, branches or other obstacles that might cause the fish to get tangled. This is done so that any released fish {{has a better chance}} of being in good health.|$|R

5000|$|In {{recreational}} fishing terminology, the hookset (setting the hook or striking) is a motion {{made with a}} fishing rod in order to [...] "set" [...] a fish hook {{into the mouth of}} a fish once it has bitten a fishing lure or bait. That is, in order to secure the fish on the hook, a sharp motion is performed to push the barb of the hook into the fish's mouth, preferably in the corner. If this motion were not performed, while it is possible for a fish to set itself, the likelihood of successfully landing the fish is minimal since, without the barb of the hook secured, the fish could shake the hook out of its mouth. The motion is usually a sharp, sweeping motion of the rod, either upwards or to the side, depending on the orientation of the rod at the moment the fish bites. Some fishermen will perform several hooksets in quick succession to ensure that the fish is securely hooked, especially on fish with tough mouths such as some saltwater species. In contrast, anglers using circle hooks needn't <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> since the hook's design allows it to set itself when the angler reels in.|$|E

50|$|Modern fishing lines {{intended}} for spinning, spin cast, or bait casting reels are almost entirely made from artificial substances, including nylon, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, also called fluorocarbon), polyethylene, Dacron and Dyneema (UHMWPE). The {{most common type}} is monofilament, made of a single strand. Fishermen often use monofilament because of its buoyant characteristics {{and its ability to}} stretch under load. The line stretch has advantages, such as dampening <b>the</b> force when <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> and when fighting strong fish. On very far distances the dampening may become a disadvantage. Recently, other alternatives to standard nylon monofilament lines have been introduced made of copolymers or fluorocarbon, or {{a combination of the two}} materials. Fluorocarbon fishing line is made of the fluoropolymer PVDF and it is valued for its refractive index, which is similar to that of water, making it less visible to fish. Fluorocarbon is also a denser material, and therefore, is not nearly as buoyant as monofilament. Anglers often utilize fluorocarbon when they need their baits to stay closer to the bottom without the use of heavy sinkers. There are also braided fishing lines, cofilament and thermally fused lines, also known as 'superlines' for their small diameter, lack of stretch, and great strength relative to standard nylon monofilament lines. Braided, thermally fused, and chemically fused varieties of 'superlines' are now readily available.|$|R

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandSea turtle bycatch {{issues are}} of special concern in tuna {{longline}} fisheries.
