40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{non-invasive}} {{nature of}} arterial spin labelling (ASL) {{has opened a}} unique window into human brain function and perfusion physiology. High spatial and temporal resolution makes the technique very appealing {{not only for the}} diagnosis of vascular diseases, but also in basic neuroscience where the aim is to develop a more comprehensive picture of the physiological events accompanying neuronal activation. However, low signal-to-noise ratio and the complexity of flow quantification make ASL one of the more demanding disciplines within MRI. In this review, the theoretical background and main implementations of ASL are revisited. In particular, the perfusion quantification methods, including the problems and pitfalls involved, are thoroughly discussed in this article.

40|$|Volterra filters {{have been}} applied to many {{nonlinear}} system identification problems. However, obtaining good filter estimates from short and/or noisy data records is a difficult task.

It aims at giving an overview of the topic as complete as possible, although it does not expect to be exhaustive, given the complexity of the subject. Thus, an attempt was made to collect any useful information about hybrid power amplifiers from the designer's point of view. A <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> of hybrid power amplifiers is then provided, giving a comprehensive idea of the diffusion of such systems and of their employment according to different power level and frequency bands at which they are required to operate. From a strictly theoretical point of view, this article reports the main characteristic parameters of power amplifiers and their classification as derived from the traditional theory. A distinction between bias classes and operating classes is provided, recalling with some mathematical details different operating modes, in particular current mode and switched mode operations. Apart from mathematical-based statements, this article addresses practical aspects that are essential in the design of a hybrid power amplifier, considering its elementary components and providing a description and an essential bibliography for each of them. Starting from the printed circuit board, which physically constitutes the amplifier, the active components (transistors) and passive components (discrete and distributed) are described, and some considerations about the final assembly are given.
