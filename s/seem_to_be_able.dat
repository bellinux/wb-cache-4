25|$|As for pitch {{contours}} {{in early}} infant utterances, infants between 3 and 9 {{months of age}} produce primarily flat, falling and rising-falling contours. Rising pitch contours would require the infants to raise subglottal pressure during the vocalization or to increase vocal fold length or tension {{at the end of}} the vocalization, or both. At 3 to 9 months infants don’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to control these movements yet.|$|E

They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do some magic as well, as they owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E

However, during Umbridge's tenure at Hogwarts, she quickly obtains the power to have the final say in disciplinary actions, due to an Educational Decree (one of many) passed by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge.|$|E

25|$|The body {{is able to}} {{substantially}} {{reduce the}} amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of iron overload. Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the liver, the heart and other metabolically active organs.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to close human proximity and food-conditioned. Out of 1,028incidents of black bears acting aggressively toward people, recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 107 resulted in injury, and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots where people regularly fed the bears handouts. In almost every case where open dumps or handouts {{that had previously}} attracted black bears were ceased, the number of aggressive encounters with bears has decreased precipitously over time. However, in the aforementioned case of the spree attack in Liard River Hot Springs, the attacking bear was {{believed to have been}} previously almost fully dependent on a local garbage dump that had closed and was starving {{as a result of the}} loss of that food source. Attempts to relocate bears are typically unsuccessful, as black bears <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to return to their home range even without familiar landscape cues.|$|E
25|$|When Jeopardy! {{made the}} move on December 31, 1984, WABC {{was looking to}} improve its ratings in the hour leading up to Eyewitness News at 5:00p.m.. Jeopardy! helped, but the station did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find a {{complementary}} program for it at 4:30p.m.. The station first tried Name That Tune as the accompanying program, but the show had already been struggling in the ratings in its earlier morning timeslot and did not fare better. Thus, WABC moved it to a late-night timeslot and added Divorce Court in its place in early 1985. While Divorce Court was popular, the fictional court program switched stations for the fall of 1985. WABC responded by signing on as an affiliate for the syndicated edition of Sale of the Century, which had been airing on WOR since its January 1985 premiere and was entering its second season that fall. But once again, the station was left needing another solution, as Sale became the third straight problematic Jeopardy! lead-out program and was cancelled by its syndicator in 1986.|$|E

In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit.

Towards {{the end of the}} show, during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he passed out over his drumkit. After a 20-minute wait, Moon reappeared onstage, but after a few bars of [...] "Magic Bus", collapsed again, and was immediately taken to hospital. Scot Halpin, an audience member, convinced promoter Bill Graham to let him play drums, and the group closed the show with him. Moon had a day to recover, and by the next show at the Los Angeles Forum, was playing to his usual strength.

Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility". The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even". Amnesty International’s China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: [...] "Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?" [...] The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.|$|E

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi."

500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
