5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a <b>secondary</b> <b>accent.</b> The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT One of the {{difficulties}} in English teaching lies in the correct use of primary and <b>secondary</b> lexical <b>accents.</b> French learners of English encounter particular difficulties in perceiving the stressed syllables and more particularly in encoding information on stress which is rarely necessary in French. They consequently have difficulties in producing primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>accents</b> when they speak. As {{the source of the}} problem seems related to attention, the dual coding of information on the word using sound and visual annotations is a potential solution. SWANS is an authoring system which enables the semi-automatic generation of multimedia documents in which accents are marked visually and sound is synchronized. This article presents SWANS, the hypotheses that underlie its development and the empirical evaluation of a model...|$|R
30|$|On the {{syllable}} level: The accent command amplitude Aa {{corresponds to}} the interval of local F 0 excursions associated with accented syllables and boundary tones. So far, we assume that Aa decreases with increasing tempo, and due to accent command merging or suppression of <b>secondary</b> <b>accents,</b> there will be fewer accent commands. The accent command onset times T 1 and accent command offset times T 2 {{with respect to the}} underlying syllable or nuclear vowel onset or offset times reflect the precise alignment of F 0 excursions with the segmental tier. We hypothesize that increased speech rate also requires the F 0 gesture to occur earlier in the syllable. We also wish to examine whether accent commands and hence the F 0 gestures are more strongly anchored to the nuclear vowel onset than to the onset of the syllable.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, each hemistich {{also holds}} one <b>secondary</b> <b>accent</b> which may occur {{on any of}} the first five syllables, most {{frequently}} on the third; this frequently balanced four-part structure resulted in one of several monikers for the line: [...] (in contradistinction to the [...] or [...] described below).|$|E
5000|$|Secondary stress (or obsolete: <b>secondary</b> <b>accent)</b> is {{the weaker}} of two degrees {{of stress in}} the {{pronunciation}} of a word; the stronger degree of stress being called primary. The International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for secondary stress is a short vertical line preceding and {{at the foot of}} the secondarily stressed syllable: as before the nun in [...] (the higher vertical line denotes primary stress). Another tradition in English is to assign acute and grave accents for primary and secondary stress: pronùnciátion.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{proposal}} for an annotation system for information structure that combines contemporary corpus-oriented accounts of information status with insights from the recent theoretical debate (e. g. Selkirk, 2007; Beaver & Velleman, subm.) on the basic pragmatic sources which lead to primary and secondary accentuation; in particular, {{the combination of the}} given-new distinction with the classical triggers for F-marking by Rooth (1992). We comment on the yet undecided question whether one or several kinds of focus should be considered in the annotation task. A key property of our scheme is its distinction between a lexical and a referential level. This allows us to describe fine-grained properties of texts, e. g. the information structurally and prosodically relevant observation that a given discourse referent may be taken up by means of lexically new material. The annotation system is demonstrated for examples from transcripts of spoken corpora as well as sentences taken from the theoretically oriented literature. We report on the inter-annotator agreement reached, and show how the system can be used in the investigation of subtle prosodic phenomena like <b>secondary</b> <b>accents,</b> which have been claimed to mark second occurrence focus. 1 Contrastive focus vs. information focu...|$|R
5000|$|Folk dancers often {{speak in}} terms of [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "slow" [...] instead of a steady meter [...] "1, 2, 3," [...] etc. These dance rhythms {{may not agree with}} the rhythms and meters {{performed}} by the musicians. For example, the [...] rhythm of the dance kopanitsa is often described as quick-quick-slow-quick-quick, (2+2+3+2+2) whereas the tune may be played in what may be written as (2+2)+(2+1)+(2+2), i.e., an 11 time with primary <b>accent</b> at 1, <b>secondary</b> <b>accents</b> at 5 and 8, and ternary accents at 3, 7, and 10; the dancers thus dance to a meter composition 4+3+2+2, which may also be played by the musicians, e.g., in Traichovo horo (Трайчово хоро). In addition, some tunes may have considerable time bends, such as the Macedonian Žensko Beranče and Bajrače, though viewed as and written in 3+2+2+3+2. Therefore, in dance instruction, quick and slow beat descriptions, in combination with intuition and careful listening, may be a good approach, though not suitable for performing and notating the music. In addition, a dance instructor not familiar with the exact musical rhythms should not demonstrate these dance rhythms without music. It would be best to use a slowed-down playback, lest the dancers become confused at full speed.|$|R

40|$|Several {{production}} and perception experiments {{have been carried}} out in order to investigate, whether stress clash environments in A(BC) -compounds really trigger a stress shift or a destressing of the secondary stress or not. The results indicate that stress shifting is rather rare than common in German. If it occurs, it manifests itself both on a {{production and}} perception level. This situation remains stable, no matter if listeners are presented the full acoustic signal or only delexicalised stimuli. The only environment where stress shift tends to take place more often are words consisting of four syllables. These allow for placement of an additional foot. Stress clashes in trisyllabic compounds are often handled by a destressing of the <b>secondary</b> <b>accent</b> as an alternative to stress shift. However, in the majority of stress clash environments, listeners did perceive the primary and secondary stress in the immediate neighbourhood. Obviously, a stress clash creates less of a problem in German than it does in other Germanic languages...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis Event-Related Potentials (ERP) study {{investigates the}} use of {{prosodic}} information {{in the process of}} lexical access in French. In French, accentuation is said to be post-lexical, with a primary final <b>accent</b> (FA) and <b>secondary</b> initial <b>accent</b> (IA) marking the edges of the phrase. Results from previous studies, however, suggest IA may hold a demarcative function close {{to the level of the}} word. Still, the contribution of IA in word processing has not yet been empirically tested. In this study, participants listened to trisyllabic French nouns and pseudowords, with (+IA) or without (−IA) initial accent while completing a lexical decision task. We were mainly interested in modulations of the N 325, a component assumed to reflect difficulties in the extraction of lexical stress patterns. ERP results show a larger N 325 when stimuli were presented −IA, revealing both the automaticity of stress extraction and a preference for stress templates with initial accent...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the acoustic, articulatory and perceptual relevance of the Accentual Phrase (AP) in French. The AP is the lowest level of the hierarchical model of French intonation proposed by Jun and Fougeron [7]. A corpus of 22 sentences, each likely to yield 3 APs, was recorded for 4 native French speakers. Our first aim was to describe the acoustic properties of the AP. We measured both primary (LH*) and <b>secondary</b> (LHi) <b>accents</b> in terms of F 0 peak values, F 0 slopes, duration of the F 0 rises, duration of the peak-bearing syllables and number of syllables needed for the rise. We found that the AP was often realized as [LHiLH*], with the H* peak featuring a higher F 0 value, a longer duration, a stronger syllable-anchoring than Hi, and the LH* rise being more dynamic than LHi. We compared these acoustic results with those of a previous articulatory analysis and confirmed the preponderance of H* over Hi. Then using perceptual tests, we tried to evaluate the ability of French listeners to slice utterances into Accentual Phrases. The slicing scores show that the listeners could well split the sentences into separate APs. Once this ability quantified, we tried to match these results with the acoustic measurements to address the following question: what makes an AP be perceived as a unit? We suggest that the Accentual Phrase is perceived as a unit mainly because of its tonal (low-high-lowhigher), durational (AP-final syllable longest) and dynamic (long small rise [...] brief large rise) characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinguishing}} between closely related intransitive derivations, such as passive, reflexive, anticausative (decausative), {{is one of}} the most intricate semantic and syntactic issues in languages with polysemous intransitive markers. Both anticausative and passive derivations entail the promotion of the initial direct object (= Patient) and the demotion of the initial subject (= Agent). This common syntactic feature accounts for their similar morphological marking in many languages (see e. g. COMRIE 1985 : 328 ff.; HASPELMATH 1987 : 29 ff.). In the cases where the markers of the passive and anticausative (at least partly) overlap, passives without an overtly expressed agent can be distinguished from anticausatives only by semantic criteria. This semantic opposition is characterized, for instance, by COMRIE (1985 : 326) as follows: "Passive and anticausative differ in that, even where the former has no agentive phrase, the existence of some person or thing bringing about the situation is implied, whereas the anticausative is consistent with the situation coming about spontaneously. " This general definition is also relevant for a description of the system of intransitive derivations in a number of Ancient Indo-European languages, such as Ancient Greek or (Vedic) Sanskrit. 2. The Vedic-_ya-presents: jäyate 'is born' In what follows I will focus on the Vedic verbs built with the suffix-ya-, which {{is one of the}} markers used to build present tense stems. Generally, the-va-presents with the accent on the suffix are passives (kriydte 'is made', ucydte 'is called', stüyäte 'is praised', hanyäte 'is killed'), whereas the-ya-presents with root accentuation behave as non-passive intransitives (cf. pädyate 'falls', büdhyate 'wakes', rlyate 'flows'). However, a few-ya-formations are generally said to be exceptions to this regularity. One of the parade examples is jäyate 'is born', derived from the root jan. According to the opinion widely spread in earlier Indo-European and Indo-Iranian studies, jäyate (as well as its Old-Iranian cognate, Avestan zaiieitï) is the 13 original passive, with the <b>secondary</b> <b>accent</b> shift in Vedic.

40|$|This study investigates {{effects of}} three {{prosodic}} factors—prosodic boundary (Utterance-initial vs. Utterance-medial), lexical stress (primary vs. <b>secondary)</b> and phrasal <b>accent</b> (accented vs. unaccented) —on articulatory and acoustic realizations of word-initial CVs (/nε/, /tε/) in trisyllabic English words. Articulatory measurements include linguopalatal contact (by electropalatography) for both C and V, and seal duration; acoustic measurements include nasal duration and energy for /n/, VOT, burst energy and spectral {{center of gravity}} for /t/, and F 1, vowel duration and vowel amplitude for /ε/. Several specific points emerge. First, domain-initial articulation is differentiated from stress- or accent-induced articulations in many aspects; for the most part, prominence affects vowel measures while initial position affects consonant measures. Nonetheless, the vowel is also effectively louder domain-initially, suggesting that the boundary effect is not strictly local to the initial consonant. Second, the boundary (domain-initial) effect is not seen across-the-board, but is often constrained by stress and accent factors, revealing that domain-initial strengthening is more effective when a relevant phonetic dimension does not undergo a compelling strengthening coming from stress or accent. Third, some accentual effects {{can be seen on}} secondary-stressed syllables, suggesting that accentual influences spread beyond the primary-stressed syllable. But this spread is mainly seen with consonantal measures, showing an asymmetric accentual influence between consonantal and vocalic articulations. 1...|$|R
