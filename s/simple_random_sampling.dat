25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} clustered sampling) generally increases {{the variability of}} sample estimates above that of <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling,</b> {{depending on how the}} clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation.

An extremely brief review of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> basics is given that discusses the UNIFORM random number function {{and the use of}} the special SAS functions INT, CEIL, and FLOOR to select <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> in the data step. Data step code for selecting unrestricted <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> is given and explained. Data step code for selecting Bernoulli samples and two different approaches to selecting a <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> without replacement are presented and discussed. Simpler ways to select <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> without replacement using PROC SORT and PROC RANK are illustrated and examples given. An alternative to selecting a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> in the data step is to use PROC SURVEYSELECT in SAS/STAT. The syntax for the SURVEYSELECT procedure is given and statements needed for selecting unrestricted and <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> are explained. The meaning and use of different options available using PROC SURVEYSELECT are examined. PROC SURVEYSELECT code is given to select unrestricted and <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> without replacement. References to published papers on how to use SAS to select <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> are given...|$|R
25|$|There are, however, some {{potential}} drawbacks to using stratified sampling. First, identifying strata and implementing {{such an approach}} can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection, as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates. Second, when examining multiple criteria, stratifying variables {{may be related to}} some, but not to others, further complicating the design, and potentially reducing the utility of the strata. Finally, in some cases (such as designs with a large number of strata, or those with a specified minimum sample size per group), stratified sampling can potentially require a larger sample than would other methods (although in most cases, the required sample size would be no larger than would be required for <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling).</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is a {{basic type}} of sampling, since {{it can be a}} {{component}} of other more complex sampling methods. The principle of <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is that every object has the same probability of being chosen. For example, suppose N college students want to get a ticket for a basketball game, but there are only X < N tickets for them, so they decide to have a fair way to see who gets to go. Then, everybody is given a number in the range from 0 to N-1, and random numbers are generated, either electronically or from a table of random numbers. Numbers outside the range from 0 to N-1 are ignored, as are any numbers previously selected. The first X numbers would identify the lucky ticket winners.|$|E

30|$|Cluster {{sampling}} is {{one method}} {{that has been}} used in these circumstances. It involves dividing the population into recognisable ‘clusters’ (say, streets within a city suburb) and then sampling from the clusters (say, the houses in a street) (Cochran 1999, Chaps. 9 – 10; Schreuder et al. 1993, Chap. 3; Gregoire and Valentine 2008, Chap. 12). However, this is inappropriate if it is desired to take a <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of individuals from the population; cluster sampling generally involves varying chances of selection for the population members, rather than equal chances as required for a <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample.</b> Pinkham (1987) described a simple method to take a <b>simple</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of individuals from a population without a list sampling frame. However, it involves visiting each and every individual in the population, generally an impossibility for very large populations and a process through which a list sampling frame could be compiled in any case.|$|R
