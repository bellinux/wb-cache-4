5000|$|Rehaai is {{the story}} of Shamim, a woman married off when she was barely more than a child. Her brutish son Waseem is married to Shehnaz, a wife he uses as a {{convenient}} punching bag anytime he feels the need to vent his frustration, about anything and everything. The opening chapter revolved around Waseem’s increasingly vocal demand for an heir. Though Shehnaz has an unlikely ally in her mother-in-law, there is nonetheless a steady trickle of neighbors who drop in frequently to remind Shamim and Shehnaz of her inability to bear Waseem’s child. Out of all these [...] "well-wishers," [...] none is more insidious than chacha Inayat, who regularly fans the flames of Waseem’s desire to father a child. It is evident that Inayat is merely using Waseem’s childlessness as a means to further his own end, but the solution he offers is beyond macabre. Inayat offers up his own preteen child, Kulsoom as the bride, asserting that a younger woman can produce heirs much faster than an older woman such as Shehnaz. Waseem agrees to Inayat’s proposal and threatens his mother and wife of dire consequences if they {{stand in the way of}} his gaining the object of his desire. The story follows the consequences caused by this child marriage. Although Kulsum is Waseem's second wife, Shehnaz adores Kulsum as her daughter instead of hating her. Shameem's sister has a son Akmal. Akmal is helpful to Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum. He has a liking towards Kulsum. Kulsum grows and gives birth to 3 daughters which makes Waseem angry. He doubts that something in going between Akmal and Kulsum and so Waseem beats Akmal. Waseem does not earn even a single penny and so their condition becomes from bad to worse because of which Shameem is forced to become a maid. All the neighbours make fun of Shameem. Shameem's sister starts hating her because Waseem had beaten Akmal and tells Akmal not to help them. But Akmal could not see their condition and helps them secretly. He later convinces his mother. Meanwhile, Waseem has run out of the house and has married Noor Jahan. Noor Jahan had already married 2 times. But they do not get along as Waseem is a gharjamai and Noor Jahan's mother hates him. She throws him out of the house. Then he meets his long lost friend who was doing an illegal business of gambling. Police attacks them and Waseem gets shot by a gun because of which he is handicapped. On the other hand, Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum had started a clothing business which makes Waseem jealous. One day when Shameem told Kulsum to go to Akmal's shop for calculation, Waseem shouts at her mother and tells her that she is <b>solding</b> Kulsum towards Akmal and so she is shameless. She tells [...] "I'm shameless because I gave birth to such a child who spoilt a girl's life and her daughter-in-law's i.e Shehnaz life. He is in a shock. From that day Waseem feels guilty of what he had done and asks for forgiveness from Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum. They forgive and Waseem decides that Kulsum should marry Akmal. Chacha Inayat fights with Waseem but Waseem does not change his mind. But Kulsum thinks that she has no respect in society and she could not remarry. She tries to commit suicide. The very next day Shehnaz's sister comes and asks Kulsum's daughter's hand for her son. Shehnaz gets furious as she is very young and she does not want that what happened to her mother (Kulsum)to happen with Kulsums daughter. Her daughter tells Waseem that she does not want to marry and wants to become a doctor. Shameem is listening to them and is scared if Waseem allows the marriage. But he encourages his daughter to study making Shameem happy. In this way Shameem gets freedom or Rehaai from the society's evil traditions making the show end on a happy note.|$|E

40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic rotary percussive drilling hammers (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW). In most geological conditions, predomi-nantly button bits are used which consist of a number of cemented carbide buttons inserted and/or solded into holes of a steel body (Figure 1). The properties of the button bit can be adjusted effectively to the local cir-cumstances by variation of the amount of inserted buttons, button composition, button geometry, <b>solding</b> and steel quality or the bit's flushing system.

40|$|Despite {{the need}} for {{increased}} industrial energy efficiency, studies indicate that cost-efficient energy conservation measures are not always implemented, explained by the existence of barriers to energy efficiency. This paper investigates the existence of different barriers to and driving forces {{for the implementation of}} energy efficiency measures in the energy intensive Swedish foundry industry. The overall results from a questionnaire show that limited access to capital constitutes by far the largest barrier to energy efficiency according to the respondents. A comparison between group-owned and privately owned foundries shows that, except for limited access to capital, they face different high-ranked barriers. While barriers within group owned companies are more related to organizational problems, barriers within private foundries are more related to information problems. This study also found that energy consultants or other actors working with energy issues in foundries are of major importance in overcoming the largest barriers, as the foundries consider them trustworthy. They may thus help the foundries overcome organizational problems such as lack of sub-metering and lack of budget funds by quantifying potential energy efficiency investments. The two, by far, most important drivers were found to be people with real ambition and long-term energy strategies.

40|$|The time {{evolution}} {{of the price of}} resources <b>sold</b> to the market and of the price difference, between <b>sold</b> and extracted resources, is investigated in case of no accumulation of the resources; i. e. when the resources are extracted and <b>sold</b> to the market at the same mass flow rate. The price {{evolution of}} <b>sold</b> resources varies with time according to the relation between the price increase factor, PIF, of <b>sold</b> and extracted resources. The price evolutions of <b>sold</b> resources and price difference are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate of extracted and <b>sold</b> resources. The price of <b>sold</b> resources and the price difference increase with time if the PIF of <b>sold</b> resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources and the initial price is greater than the critical price of <b>sold</b> resources, which depends on the initial price of extracted resources and the interest rate of non-extracted and extracted resources. The price of <b>sold</b> resources and the price difference decrease with time if the PIF of <b>sold</b> resources is greater than the PIF of extracted resources and the initial price is smaller than the critical price of <b>sold</b> resources.
