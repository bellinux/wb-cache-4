30|$|Precisely tuning {{the amount}} of Cas 9 and sgRNA in cells {{is also used to}} improve the specificity; some studies have {{demonstrated}} that a decrease in {{the amount of}} CRISPR reagents in cells could reduce off-target effects (Fu et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013). Timely controlled Cas 9 expression is also demonstrated through a tet-on system (Gonzalez et al., 2014). Furthermore, gene editing with the Cas 9 mRNA and protein causes fewer off-target effects compared to plasmids and viruses, likely because the mRNA or RNPs were rapidly degraded after immediate on-target cleavage (Kim et al., 2014). Modifying the sgRNA sequence also improved the specificity. For example, sgRNA with a truncated base-pairing sequence (17 nt instead of 20 nt) enhanced the targeting specificity because truncated <b>sgRNAs</b> <b>have</b> reduced binding affinity with the target DNA and thus are more sensitive to mismatches (Fu et al., 2014).|$|E
40|$|CRISPR/Cas 9 {{has emerged}} as a {{versatile}} genome-engineering tool that relies on a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and the Cas 9 enzyme for genome editing. Simple, fast and economical methods to generate <b>sgRNAs</b> <b>have</b> made targeted mutagenesis routine in cultured cells, mice, zebrafish and other model systems. Pre-screening of sgRNAs for target effi-cacy is desirable both for successful mutagenesis and minimizing wasted animal husbandry on targets with poor activity. Here, we describe an easy, quick and cost-effective fluorescent polymerase chain re-action (PCR) -based method, CRISPR Somatic Tissue Activity Test (CRISPR-STAT), to determine target-specific efficiency of sgRNA. As a proof of princi-ple, we validated our method using 28 sgRNAs with known and varied levels of germline transmission ef-ficiency in zebrafish by analysis of their somatic ac-tivity in injected embryos. Our data revealed a strong positive correlation between the fluorescent PCR profiles of the injected embryos and the germline transmission efficiency. Furthermore, the assay was sensitive enough to evaluate multiplex gene target-ing. This method is easy to implement by laborato-ries with access to a capillary sequencer. Although we validated the method using CRISPR/Cas 9 and ze-brafish, it can be applied to other model systems and other genome targeting nucleases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCitrus leaf blotch virus (CLBV) has a single-stranded, positive-sense, genomic RNA (gRNA) {{organized}} in three ORFs, which encode a polyprotein involved in replication (RP), a potential movement protein (MP), and coat protein (CP). Northern blot hybridization of total, virion, or double-stranded RNA with probes of different gRNA regions revealed that CLBV produces two 3 ′-coterminal and two 5 ′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). The 3 ′-coterminal sgRNAs contain the MP (3 ′MP sgRNA) and CP (3 ′CP sgRNA) genes and untranslated regions (UTRs) of 123 and 284 nt, respectively, at their 5 ′ end. These sgRNAs {{start with a}} hexanucleotide which is also present at the 5 ′ terminus of the gRNA. The 5 ′-coterminal <b>sgRNAs</b> <b>have</b> 6795 and 5798 nt, colinear with the gRNA, and contain ORF 1 and most MP gene (5 ′RPMP sgRNA) and most ORF 1 (5 ′RP sgRNA), respectively. Their 3 ′ termini map 35 and 40 nt upstream of the transcription initiation of the 3 ′CP and 3 ′MP sgRNAs, respectively, next to a potential promoter element. Our results suggest that, as in alphaviruses, CLBV internal genes are expressed via 3 ′-coterminal sgRNAs transcribed from the minus gRNA strand. The 5 ′-coterminal sgRNAs may result from early termination of the gRNA during the plus-strand synthesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPanicum mosaic virus (PMV) is a {{single-stranded}} positive-sense RNA {{virus in}} the family Tombusviridae. PMV genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) are not capped or polyadenylated. We have determined that PMV uses a cap-independent mechanism of translation. A 116 -nucleotide translational enhancer (TE) region on the 3 ′-untranslated region of both the gRNA and <b>sgRNA</b> <b>has</b> been identified. The TE is required for efficient translation of viral proteins in vitro. For mutants with a compromised TE, addition of cap analog, or transposition of the cis-active TE to another location, both restored translational competence of the 5 ′-proximal sgRNA genes in vitro...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{sequence}} of an infectious cDNA clone of panicum mosaic virus (PMV) {{showed that the}} single-stranded RNA genome is 4326 nucleotides (nt) and a single highly abundant subgenomic (sg) RNA of 1475 nt was synthesized during PMV infection of pearl millet plants and protoplasts. Computer comparisons revealed strong similarities between the predicted amino acid sequences of the p 48 and p 112 open reading frames (ORFs) and replicase proteins {{of members of the}} Tombusviridae. The <b>sgRNA</b> <b>has</b> the potential to encode five proteins. Three small ORFs, p 8, p 8 -FS, and/or p 6. 6 have similarity to ORFs of carmo-, necro-, and machlomoviruses thought to be involved in virus spread in plants. The <b>sgRNA</b> also <b>has</b> the potential to encode a 26 -kDa capsid protein and a 15 -kDa nested gene (p 15) of unknown function. PMV transcripts also supported replication and movement of SPMV, the satellite virus. Genome organization, physicochemical properties, and biological features indicate that PMV {{is a member of the}} Tombusviridae family. However, PMV differs sufficiently from previously described members to warrant its placement in a new genus provisionally designatedPanicovirus...|$|R
40|$|Genetic modification, {{including}} plant breeding, {{has been}} widely used to improve crop yield and quality, {{as well as to}} increase disease resistance. Targeted genome engineering is expected to contribute significantly to future varietal improvement, and genome editing technologies using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) /Cas 9 /single guide RNA (<b>sgRNA)</b> <b>have</b> already been successfully used to genetically modify plants. However, to date, there has been no reported use of any of the current genome editing approaches in sweet orange, an important fruit crop. In this study, we first developed a novel tool, Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration, for enhancing transient protein expression in sweet orange leaves. We then successfully employed Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration to deliver Cas 9, along with a synthetic sgRNA targeting the CsPDS gene, into sweet orange. DNA sequencing confirmed that the CsPDS gene was mutated at the target site in treated sweet orange leaves. The mutation rate using the Cas 9 /sgRNA system was approximately 3. 2 to 3. 9 %. Off-target mutagenesis was not detected for CsPDS-related DNA sequences in our study. This is the first report of targeted genome modification in citrus using the Cas 9 / sgRNA system—a system that holds significant promise for the study of citrus gene function and for targeted genetic modification...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInfection {{of plants}} or protoplasts with turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a monopartite RNA virus, {{results in the}} {{synthesis}} of the genomic RNA and two subgenomic (sg) RNAs. The transcription start site for the 1. 45 -kb sgRNA was previously mapped to position 2606 (J. C. Carrington, T. J. Morris, P. G. Stockley, and S. C. Harrison, (1987). J. Mol. Biol. 194, 265 – 276) corresponding to position 2607 in the TCVms isolate and the start site for the 1. 7 -kb <b>sgRNA</b> <b>has</b> now been mapped to position 2333 in TCVms. A 96 -base sequence (90 bases upstream and 6 bases downstream) encompassing the transcription start site for the 1. 45 -kb sgRNA was sufficient for full promoter activity. Similarly, a 94 -base sequence (90 bases upstream and 4 bases downstream) encompassing the start site was required for full activity of the 1. 7 -kb sgRNA promoter. The 1. 45 -kb sgRNA promoter, but not the 1. 7 -kb sgRNA promoter, was able to direct synthesis of a nontemplate RNAin vitrousing partially purified TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Computer generated secondary structures for the two sgRNA promoters revealed an extensive hairpin just upstream from the transcription start site. Comparisons of corresponding sequences from related viruses indicates higher sequence conservation for the 1. 45 -kb sgRNA promoter compared with the 1. 7 -kb sgRNA promoter, despite the latter's location within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase open reading frame...|$|R

Compared to other conventional multiplex CRISPR/Cas systems, a single <b>sgRNA</b> seed <b>has</b> the advantage of reducing off-target gene-editing.

There are many online tools available for predicting sgRNA sequences with high target specificity and/or cleavage activity. Here, we refer the user to genome-wide sgRNA sequence predictions that we have developed for both the human and mouse and that {{are available from the}} Broad Institute website. Once a set of target genes and corresponding <b>sgRNA</b> sequences <b>has</b> been identified, customized oligonucleotide pools can be rapidly synthesized by a number of commercial vendors. Thereafter, as described here, the oligonucleotides can be efficiently cloned into an appropriate lentiviral expression vector backbone. The resulting plasmid pool can then be packaged into lentiviral particles and used to generate knockouts in any cell line of choice...|$|R
40|$|Numerous RNA viruses {{generate}} subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) for {{expression of}} their 3 *-proximal genes. A major step {{in control of}} viral gene expression is the regulation of sgRNA synthesis by specific promoter elements. We used {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV) as a model system to study transcriptional control in a virus with multiple sgRNAs. BYDV generates three sgRNAs during infection. The <b>sgRNA</b> 1 promoter <b>has</b> been mapped previously to a 98 -nucleotide (nt) region which forms two stem-loop structures. It was determined that sgRNA 1 is not required for BYDV RNA replication in oat protoplasts. In this study, we show that neither sgRNA 2 nor sgRNA 3 is required for BYDV RNA replication. The promoters for sgRNA 2 and sgRNA 3 synthesis were mapped by using deletion mutagenesis. The minimal sgRNA 2 promoter is approximately 143 nt long (nt 4810 to 4952) and is located immediately downstream of the putative sgRNA 2 start site (nt 4809). The minimal sgRNA 3 core promoter is 44 nt long (nt 5345 to 5388), with most of the sequence located downstream of sgRNA 3 start site (nt 5348). For both promoters, additional sequences upstream of the start site enhanced sgRNA promoter activity. These promoters contrast to the sgRNA 1 promoter, in which almost all of the promoter is located upstream of the transcription initiation site. Comparison of RNA sequences and computer-predicted secondary structures revealed little or no homology between the three sgRNA promoter elements. Thus, a small RNA virus with multiple <b>sgRNAs</b> can <b>have</b> very different subgenomic promoters, which implie...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCRISPR/Cas 9 {{technology}} is a highly promising genome editing tool in the mouse, potentially overcoming the costs and time required for more traditional gene targeting methods in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Recently, compared to the wildtype nuclease, paired Cas 9 nickase (Cas 9 n) combined with single guide RNA (<b>sgRNA)</b> molecules <b>has</b> been found to enhance the specificity of genome editing while reducing off-target effects. Paired Cas 9 n {{has been shown to}} be as efficient as Cas 9 for generating insertion and deletion (indel) mutations by non-homologous end joining and targeted deletion in the genome. However, an efficient and reliable approach to the insertion of loxP sites flanking critical exon(s) to create a conditional allele of a target gene remains an elusive goal. In this study, we microinjected Cas 9 n RNA with sgRNAs together with a single DNA template encoding two loxP sites flanking (floxing) exon 2 of the isoprenoid synthase containing domain (Ispd) into the pronucleus and cytoplasm of C 57 BL/ 6 NCr one-cell stage zygotes. After surgical transfer, one F 0 mouse expressing a conditional allele was produced (at a frequency of ∼ 8 % of live pups born). The floxed allele was transmitted through the germline to F 1 progeny, and could be successfully recombined using Cre recombinase. This study indicates that conditional targeting can be accomplished effectively using paired Cas 9 n and a single DNA template...|$|R
40|$|The type II CRISPR/Cas {{system from}} Streptococcus pyogenes and its {{simplified}} derivative, the Cas 9 / single guide RNA (<b>sgRNA)</b> system, <b>have</b> emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here, we describe adaptations {{of these systems}} leading to successful expression of the Cas 9 / sgRNA system in two dicot plant species, Arabidopsis and tobacco, and two monocot crop species, rice and sorghum. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used for delivery of genes encoding Cas 9, sgRNA and a non-fuctional, mutant green fluorescence protein (GFP) to Arabidopsis and tobacco. The mutant GFP gene contained target sites in its 50 coding regions that were successfully cleaved by a CAS 9 /sgRNA complex that, along with error-prone DNA repair, resulted in creation of functional GFP genes. DNA sequencing confirmed Cas 9 /sgRNA-mediated mutagenesis at the target site. Rice protoplast cells transformed with Cas 9 /sgRNA constructs targeting the promoter region of the bacterial blight susceptibility genes, OsSWEET 14 and OsSWEET 11, were confirmed by DNA sequencing to contain mutated DNA sequences at the target sites. Successful demonstration of the Cas 9 /sgRNA system in model plant and crop species bodes well for its nearterm use as a facile and powerful means of plant genetic engineering for scientific and agricultural applications.

40|$|The {{development}} of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /CRISPR-associated (Cas) technologies promises {{a quantum leap}} in genome engineering of model organisms. However, CRISPR-mediated gene targeting reports in Drosophila melanogaster are still restricted to a few genes, use variable experimental conditions, and vary in efficiency, questioning the universal applicability of the method. Here, we developed an efficient two-step strategy to flexibly engineer the fly genome by combining CRISPR with recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In the first step, two <b>sgRNAs,</b> whose activity <b>had</b> been tested in cell culture, were co-injected together with a donor plasmid into transgenic Act 5 C-Cas 9, Ligase 4 mutant embryos and the homologous integration events were identified by eye fluorescence. In the second step, the eye marker was replaced with DNA sequences of choice using RMCE enabling flexible gene modification. We applied this strategy to engineer four different locations in the genome, including a gene on the fourth chromosome, at comparably high efficiencies. Our data suggest that any fly laboratory can engineer their favorite gene for {{a broad range of}} applications within approximately 3 months...|$|R
40|$|Genome editing is an {{important}} tool for gene functional studies as well as crop improvement. The recent development of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system using single guide RNA molecules (sgRNAs) to direct precise double strand breaks in the genome {{has the potential to}} revolutionize agriculture. Unfortunately, not all sgRNAs are equally efficient {{and it is difficult to}} predict their efficiency by bioinformatics. In crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), with labor-intensive and lengthy transformation procedures, it is essential to minimize the risk of using an ineffective sgRNA that could result in the production of transgenic plants without the desired CRISPR-induced mutations. In this study, we have developed a fast and efficient method to validate the functionality of sgRNAs in cotton using a transient expression system. We have used this method to validate target sites for three different genes GhPDS, GhCLA 1, and GhEF 1 and analyzed the nature of the CRISPR/Cas 9 -induced mutations. In our experiments, the most frequent type of mutations observed in cotton cotyledons were deletions (∼ 64 %). We prove that the CRISPR/Cas 9 system can effectively produce mutations in homeologous cotton genes, {{an important}} requisite in this allotetraploid crop. We also show that multiple gene targeting can be achieved in cotton with the simultaneous expression of several <b>sgRNAs</b> and <b>have</b> generated mutations in GhPDS and GhEF 1 at two target sites. Additionally, we have used the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to produce targeted gene fragment deletions in the GhPDS locus. Finally, we obtained transgenic cotton plants containing CRISPR/Cas 9 -induced gene editing mutations in the GhCLA 1 gene. The mutation efficiency was very high, with 80. 6 % of the transgenic lines containing mutations in the GhCLA 1 target site resulting in an intense albino phenotype due to interference with chloroplast biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Replication by many positive-strand RNA viruses {{includes}} genomic RNA amplification and subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) transcription. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), both processes {{occur in}} virus-induced, membrane-associated compartments, require BMV replication factors 1 a and 2 a, and use negative-strand RNA 3 as {{a template for}} genomic RNA 3 and sgRNA syntheses. To begin elucidating their relations, we examined the interaction of RNA 3 replication and sgRNA transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 1 a and 2 a, which support the full RNA 3 replication cycle. Blocking sgRNA transcription stimulated RNA 3 replication by up to 350 %, implying that sgRNA transcription inhibits RNA 3 replication. Such inhibition was independent of the sgRNA-encoded coat protein and operated in cis. We further found that sgRNA transcription inhibited RNA 3 replication at a step or steps after negative-strand RNA 3 synthesis, implying competition with positive-strand RNA 3 synthesis for negative-strand RNA 3 templates, viral replication factors, or common host components. Consistent with this, sgRNA transcription was stimulated by up to 400 % when mutations inhibiting positive-strand RNA 3 synthesis were introduced into the RNA 3 5 ′-untranslated region. Thus, BMV subgenomic and genomic RNA syntheses mutually interfered with each other, apparently by competition for one or more common factors. In plant protoplasts replicating all three BMV genomic RNAs, mutations blocking <b>sgRNA</b> transcription often <b>had</b> lesser effects on RNA 3 accumulation, possibly because RNA 3 also competed with RNA 1 and RNA 2 replication templates and because any increase in RNA 3 replication {{at the expense of}} RNA 1 and RNA 2 would be self-limited by decreased 1 a and 2 a expression from RNA 1 and RNA 2...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{cancer is}} a global problem being the second leading cause of deaths in the EEUU. Particularly, the {{pancreatic}} cancer (PDAC) causes the 7 % of the deaths from cancer. The main problems of the PDAC are its delayed diagnostic and the low rate of survival in the advanced stages. It has been noticed that tumoral cells express abnormal glycosylation patterns in their surface. These changes include an overexpression of some glucidic antigens like Sialyl-Lewis. These antigens are composed by a Sialic acid molecule linked to the terminal chains of the Lewis sugars (antigens of the Lewis blood group). In fact, {{there are two types}} of Sialyl-Lewis antigens that have been observed to be overexpressed in tumoral cells: SLex and SLea. These antigens are synthesized by two α- 2, 3 -sialyltransferases enzymes: ST 3 Gal III and ST 3 Gal IV. In this project, we want to analyse the role of the glycosyltransferases (ST 3 Gal III and ST 3 Gal IV) in the tumoral phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells. To achieve this objective, we want to perform a genomic knock-out of these enzymes using the CRISPR-Cas 9 system and compare the phenotype of the control cells with the engineered cells. To verify the knock-out, we want to check the expression of ST 3 Gal III and ST 3 Gal IV at the protein level using a Western Blot analysis. To perform genomic editions, it is necessary to transfect BxPC- 3 and Capan- 1 cells with different vectors that contain the Cas 9 nuclease and the sgRNA. For this reason, different liposomal reagents have been tested using different size vectors conjugated with GFP. The transfection protocol has been optimized to transfect our cells using a 5. 4 kb vector equivalent to the vector with the sgRNA cloned in it. In contrast, using the 12. 1 kb vector, equivalent to the vector with the Cas 9 and the <b>sgRNA</b> cloned, we <b>have</b> achieved low transfection efficiencies. For these reasons, to perform the edition it has been established to transfect vectors with the sgRNA using the optimized protocol whereas Cas 9 has to be introduced into our cells using another strategy.
