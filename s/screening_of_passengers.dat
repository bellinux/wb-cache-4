The supplement reconfirms earlier conclusions that selective screening is a viable security option, but that effective screening {{must be based on}} clear policies and carefully managed to avoid perceptions of racial or ethnic profiling, and that screening must have public support.

40|$|Due {{to severe}} {{terrorist}} attacks in recent years, aviation security issues have moved into the focus of politicians {{as well as the}} general public. Effective <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> bags using state-of-the-art X-ray screening systems is essential to prevent terrorist attacks. The performance <b>of</b> the <b>screening</b> process depends critically on the security personnel, because they decide whether bags are OK or whether they might contain a prohibited item. <b>Screening</b> X-ray images <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> bags for dangerous and prohibited items effectively and efficiently is a demanding object recognition task. Effectiveness of computer-based training (CBT) on X-ray detection performance was assessed using computer-based tests and on the job performance measures using threat image projection (TIP). It was found that adaptive CBT is a powerful tool to increase detection performance and efficiency of screeners in X-ray image interpretation. Moreover, the results of training could be generalized to the real life situation as shown in the increased detection performance in TIP not only for trained items, but also for new (untrained) items. These results illustrate that CBT is a very useful tool to increase airport security from a human factors perspective...|$|R
50|$|Security {{theater is}} a {{critical}} term for deployment of measures primarily aimed at raising subjective security without a genuine or commensurate concern {{for the effects of}} that action on real safety.

50|$|SPOT (which {{stands for}} <b>Screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Passengers</b> by Observation Techniques) {{is a program}} {{launched}} in the United States by the Transportation Security Administration to identify potential terrorists among people at an airport {{by a set of}} 94 objective criteria, all of which are signs for either stress, fear, or deception.

The TSA's Registered Traveler Program and Trusted Traveler Program have been criticized on similar grounds. The CAPPS has been demonstrated to reduce the effectiveness of searching below that of random searches since terrorists can test the system and use those who are searched least often for their operations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a study where a new X-ray machine for security screening featuring motion imaging (i. e. 5 {{views of a}} bag are shown as an image sequence) was evaluated and compared to single view imaging available on conventional X-ray screening systems. More specifically, it was investigated whether with this new technology X-ray <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> bags could be enhanced {{to such an extent}} that laptops could be left inside passenger bags, without causing a significant impairment in threat detection performance. An X-ray image interpretation test was created in four different versions, manipulating the factors packing condition (laptop and bag separate vs. laptop in bag) and display condition (single vs. motion imaging). There was a highly significant and large main effect of packing condition. When laptops and bags were screened separately, threat item detection was substantially higher. For display condition, a medium effect was observed. Detection could be slightly enhanced through the application of motion imaging. There was no interaction between display and packing condition, implying that the high negative effect of leaving laptops in passenger bags could not be fully compensated by motion imaging. Additional analyses were carried out to examine effects depending on different threat categories (guns, improvised explosive devices, knives, others), the placement of the threat items (in bag vs. in laptop) and viewpoint (easy vs. difficult view). In summary, although motion imaging provides an enhancement, it is not strong enough to allow leaving laptops in bags for security screening...|$|R

40|$|X-Ray <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> bags is an {{essential}} component of airport security. Large investments into technology have been made in recent years. However, the most expensive equipment is of limited value, if th humans who operate it are not selected and trained appropriately. Scientific studies have shown that human performance in x-ray image interpretation depends critically on individual abilities and visual knowledge acquired through experience on the job and training. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of adaptive computer-based training for increasing the detection of guns, knives, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and other prohibited items. 97 airport security screeners of a European airport participated in this study. At the beginning of the project, all airport security screeners conducted the X-Ray Competency Assessment Test (X-Ray CAT). Thereupon they received adaptive computer-based training (CBT) for about 4 months. Then they conducted the X-Ray CAT the second time in the middle of the project. This was followed by about 4 months of CBT and a third test with X-Ray CAT at the end of the project. The goal was that each screener conducts at least one 20 minute training session per week. Substantial increases of detection performance were found as a result of training, which depended on the threat category (guns, IEDs, knives and other prohibited items). The largest training effects were found for IEDs. Additional analyses showed that training not only leads to an increase of detection performance but also results in faster response times when an x-ray image contains a threat object. Thus, recurrent CBT can be a powerful tool to increase efficiency in x-ray image interpretation by airport security screeners...|$|R
