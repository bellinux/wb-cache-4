25|$|For the Prius, Toyota used a new {{range of}} plant-derived {{ecological}} bioplastics {{made from the}} cellulose in wood or grass instead of petroleum. The two principal crops are kenaf (a member of the hibiscus family and related to cotton and okra) and ramie, commonly known as China grass {{and one of the}} strongest natural fibres, similar to flax in absorbency and density. Toyota <b>says</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the United Nations' International Year of Natural Fibres, which covers kenaf and ramie.|$|E

500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn <b>says</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking {{my head against the}} woodwork a couple of times".

500|$|While Catholics are {{sometimes}} accused of worshiping images, {{in violation of}} the first commandment, the Church <b>says</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> misunderstanding. In the Church's opinion, [...] "the honor paid to sacred images is a 'respectful veneration', not the adoration due to God alone". In the 8th century, heated arguments arose over whether religious icons (in this context paintings) were prohibited by the first commandment. The dispute was almost entirely restricted to the Eastern church; the iconoclasts wished to prohibit icons, while the iconodules supported their veneration, a position consistently backed by the Western Church. [...] At the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, the ecumenical council determined that the veneration of icons and statues was not {{in violation of the}} commandment and stated [...] "whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it." [...] At {{around the time of the}} controversy over Iconoclasm, the Western church began to use monumental sculpture, which by the Romanesque period became a major feature of Western Christian art, that has remained part of the Catholic tradition, in contrast to Eastern Christianity, which avoids large religious sculpture. The Catechism, using very traditional arguments, posits that God gave permission for images that symbolize Christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the bronze serpent, and the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant. It states that [...] "by becoming incarnate, the Son of God introduced a new economy of images".|$|E
2500|$|Socrates {{argues that}} Achilles {{is such a}} good liar in the Iliad that he fools even Odysseus, who never notices his duplicity (371a). Citing the scene where Achilles tells Odysseus that he will not rejoin the war but will sail away with the early dawn, and Ajax a {{different}} story, Socrates <b>says</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cunning man (Iliad, IX, 357-363.) If Achilles is so shifty that even Odysseus, whose middle name is cunning, cannot spot it, Achilles must be the better liar. Achilles, of course, never carried out his threat to leave, but remained at his camp. Hippias, quite foolishly, insists that Achilles told two different stories [...] "in innocence." ...|$|E

According to Edith Cantor, while Paula Smith's original [...] "Trekkie's Tale" [...] was only ten paragraphs long, [...] "in terms of their impact on those whom they affect, those words [...] have got to rank right up there with the Selective Service Act". At Clippercon 1987 (a Star Trek fan convention held yearly in Baltimore, Maryland), Smith interviewed a panel of female authors who say they do not include female characters in their stories at all. She quoted one as saying [...] "Every time I've tried to put a woman in any story I've ever written, everyone immediately <b>says,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Mary Sue." [...] Smith also pointed out that [...] "Participants in a panel discussion in January 1990 noted with growing dismay that any female character created within the community is damned with the term Mary Sue." ...|$|E

6000|$|When I made {{my speech}} at Springfield, {{of which the}} Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not {{thinking}} of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I had no thought {{in the world that}} I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave States. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races. It {{never occurred to me that}} I was doing anything or favouring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States. But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basis--the basis upon which our fathers placed it--can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? The Judge <b>says</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new principle started in regard to this question. Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of the government? I think he says in some of his speeches--indeed, I have one here now--that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and, therefore, he set about studying the subject upon original principles, and upon original principles he got up the Nebraska bill!
