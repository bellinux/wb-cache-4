40|$|Abstract. A {{vertical}} {{livestock feed}} mixer with spring-controlled packaging unit was designed, constructed and tested. This design had in focus a weighing and gauging mechanism which made possible a <b>semi-automatic</b> <b>packaging</b> {{in conjunction with}} feed mixing and discharge operations. The main components of the machine included a double-wall cylindrical mixing chamber consisting of recycling gate, discharge gate, evacuating gate, window and a screw conveyor inside an inner cylinder. The packaging mechanism {{is attached to the}} discharge gate and the base of the frame with the frame serving as the structural support for the machine and its contents. The main design parameters included screw conveyor features such as helix angle, fill ratio, normal pressure due to bulk load on screw shaft, axial force per pitch, total screw torque, capacity and power requirements of the screw conveyor. The design concept of the packaging mechanism involved determination of free length of spring, total active length, pitch of spring, spring index, stiffness of spring, maximum shear stress and total spring rate. In a hitch-free operation, the machine was designed to package 25 kg of mixed feed ingredients at a time. In operation, the feed ingredients are scooped and moved upward by the rotary movement of the screw conveyor and then sprayed back into the smaller cylinder without passing through the internal tube. A preliminary testing was carried out on the machine to determine the actual discharge rate and hence the performance of the packaging mechanism. Results revealed that an average discharge rate of 0. 356 kg/s was obtained. Powered by a 2 hp single phase electric motor, the machine has a mixing capacity of 4. 124 m 3 /h with a production cost of $ 470. Nomenclatur...|$|E
40|$|The gamma Doradus {{stars are}} a recent class of {{variable}} main sequence F-type stars {{located on the}} red edge of the Cepheid instability strip. They pulsate in gravity modes, and this makes them particularly interesting for detailed asteroseismic analysis, which can provide fundamental knowledge of properties near the convective cores of intermediate-mass main sequence stars. To improve current understanding of gamma Dor stars through theoretical modelling, additional constraints are needed. Our aim is to estimate the fundamental atmospheric parameters and determine the chemical composition of these stars. Detailed analyses of single stars have previously suggested links to Am and lambda Bootis stars, so we wish to explore this interesting connection between chemical peculiarity and pulsation. We have analysed a sample of gamma Dor stars for the first time, including nine bona fide and three candidate members of the class. We determined the fundamental atmospheric parameters and compared the abundance pattern with other A-type stars. We used the <b>semi-automatic</b> software <b>package</b> VWA for the analysis. This code relies on the calculation of synthetic spectra and thus takes line-blending into account. This is important because of the fast rotation {{in some of the}} sample stars, and we made a thorough analysis of how VWA performs when increasing vsini. We obtained good results in agreement with previously derived fundamental parameters and abundances in a few selected reference stars with properties similar to the gamma Dor stars. We find that the abundance pattern in the gamma Dor stars is not distinct from the constant A- and F-type stars we analysed. Comment: 13 pages, accepted by A&...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fluorescent and bioluminescent {{time-lapse}} microscopy {{approaches have}} been successfully used to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian oscillator at the single cell level. However, most of the available software and common methods based on intensity-threshold segmentation and frame-to-frame tracking are not applicable in these experiments. This is due to cell movement and {{dramatic changes in the}} fluorescent/bioluminescent reporter protein during the circadian cycle, with the lowest expression level very close to the background intensity. At present, the standard approach to analyze data sets obtained from time lapse microscopy is either manual tracking or application of generic image-processing software/dedicated tracking software. To our knowledge, these existing software solutions for manual and automatic tracking have strong limitations in tracking individual cells if their plane shifts. Results In an attempt to improve existing methodology of time-lapse tracking {{of a large number of}} moving cells, we have developed a <b>semi-automatic</b> software <b>package.</b> It extracts the trajectory of the cells by tracking theirs displacements, makes the delineation of cell nucleus or whole cell, and finally yields measurements of various features, like reporter protein expression level or cell displacement. As an example, we present here single cell circadian pattern and motility analysis of NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts expressing a fluorescent circadian reporter protein. Using Circadian Gene Express plugin, we performed fast and nonbiased analysis of large fluorescent time lapse microscopy datasets. Conclusions Our software solution, Circadian Gene Express (CGE), is easy to use and allows precise and semi-automatic tracking of moving cells over longer period of time. In spite of significant circadian variations in protein expression with extremely low expression levels at the valley phase, CGE allows accurate and efficient recording of large number of cell parameters, including level of reporter protein expression, velocity, direction of movement, and others. CGE proves to be useful for the analysis of widefield fluorescent microscopy datasets, as well as for bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, it might be easily adaptable for confocal image analysis by manually choosing one of the focal planes of each z-stack of the various time points of a time series. Availability CGE is a Java plugin for ImageJ; it is freely available at: [URL]. </p...|$|R
