5|$|Some {{germanium}} compounds {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic <b>steatosis,</b> and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows <b>steatosis</b> (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced <b>steatosis.</b> Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of <b>steatosis</b> and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine {{may also}} cause <b>steatosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} taking tetracyclines require {{medical supervision}} {{because they can}} cause <b>steatosis</b> and liver toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound, CT, and MRI can all {{identify}} <b>steatosis</b> (fatty changes) of {{the liver}} tissue and nodularity {{of the liver}} surface suggestive of cirrhosis. CT and especially MRI are able to provide {{a higher level of}} detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver. Unlike <b>steatosis</b> and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation (i.e. hepatitis) or fibrosis. Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and fibrosis of the liver.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis {{is often}} preceded by {{hepatitis}} and fatty liver (<b>steatosis),</b> {{independent of the}} cause. If the cause is removed at this stage, the changes are fully reversible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, {{patients}} with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It {{is usually not}} until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels {{are found to be}} elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic <b>steatosis.</b> Microvesicular and macrovesicular <b>steatosis</b> with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. <b>Steatosis</b> usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{so named}} {{due to their}} effect on the {{carbohydrate}} mechanism. They promote glycogen storage in the liver. An enlarged liver is a rare side-effect of long-term steroid use in children. The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and paediatric population is <b>steatosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{the major}} cause of liver disease in Western countries. Although <b>steatosis</b> (fatty liver) will develop in any {{individual}} who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages {{over a long period}} of time, this process is transient and reversible. Of all chronic heavy drinkers, only 15–20% develop hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can occur concomitantly or in succession.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic <b>steatosis,</b> or fatty {{infiltration}} of the liver, can also occur, {{and is an}} indicator of malnutrition in children. Neurological disorders that may occur as complications include seizures and tremors. Wernicke encephalopathy, which results from vitamin B1 deficiency, {{has been reported in}} patients who are extremely malnourished; symptoms include confusion, problems with the muscles responsible for eye movements and abnormalities in walking gait.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women {{is associated with}} beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition there is {{an increased risk of}} thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Tamoxifen is also a cause of fatty liver, otherwise known as steatorrhoeic hepatosis or <b>steatosis</b> hepatis.|$|E
25|$|Macroscopically, {{the liver}} is {{initially}} enlarged, {{but with the}} progression of the disease, it becomes smaller. Its surface is irregular, the consistency is firm, and the color is often yellow (if associated with <b>steatosis).</b> Depending {{on the size of}} the nodules, there are three macroscopic types: micronodular, macronodular, and mixed cirrhosis. In the micronodular form (Laennec's cirrhosis or portal cirrhosis), regenerating nodules are under 3mm. In macronodular cirrhosis (post-necrotic cirrhosis), the nodules are larger than 3mm. Mixed cirrhosis consists of nodules of different sizes.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic <b>steatosis</b> (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.|$|E

2500|$|On physiology, {{the report}} finds {{that based on}} studies available, [...] "no {{definite}} conclusions can be drawn concerning the physiological activity of birds in response to force feeding" [...] because although [...] "force feeding induced hepatic <b>steatosis</b> in the duck or goose", [...] "hepatic <b>steatosis</b> in the waterfowl is a normal metabolic response" [...] {{and there was a}} low incidence of disease indicating lesions. If gavage is stopped the [...] "return to normal took approximately four weeks". As an economic indicator the report states [...] "it is strongly {{in the interest of the}} farmer" [...] to avoid disease as the [...] "resulting fat liver is of no commercial value". It summarizes that [...] "some pathologists consider this level of <b>steatosis</b> to be pathological but others do not" [...] and recommends that research [...] "should be carried out into methods of producing fat liver which do not require the use of force feeding".|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Haller {{used the}} term [...] "metabolic syndrome" [...] for {{associations}} of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperuricemia, and hepatic <b>steatosis</b> when describing the additive effects of risk factors on atherosclerosis.|$|E
2500|$|Ducks reared for {{foie gras}} are {{typically}} slaughtered at 100 days {{of age and}} geese at 112 days. [...] At this time, the bird's liver is 6 to 10 times its ordinary size. Storage of fat in the liver produces <b>steatosis</b> of the liver cells.|$|E
2500|$|Hepatotoxicity may {{manifest}} as triglyceride accumulation, {{which leads}} to either small-droplet (microvesicular) or large-droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of <b>steatosis</b> by which phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease) ...|$|E
2500|$|Fatty change, or <b>steatosis</b> is the {{accumulation}} of fatty acids in liver cells. These {{can be seen as}} fatty globules under the microscope. Alcoholism causes development of large fatty globules (macro vesicular <b>steatosis)</b> throughout the liver and can begin to occur after a few days of heavy drinking. [...] Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into acetaldehyde, then further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into acetic acid, which is finally oxidized into carbon dioxide (...) and water (...) [...] This process generates NADH, and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio. A higher NADH concentration induces fatty acid synthesis while a decreased NAD level results in decreased fatty acid oxidation. Subsequently, the higher levels of fatty acids signal the liver cells to compound it to glycerol to form triglycerides. These triglycerides accumulate, resulting in fatty liver.|$|E
2500|$|Kwashiorkor {{is mainly}} caused by {{inadequate}} protein intake. The main symptoms are edema, wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, <b>steatosis,</b> and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair. Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status. The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means [...] "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," [...] as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.|$|E
2500|$|Steatohepatitis {{is seen in}} both {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic liver disease and {{is the culmination of}} a cascade of events that began with injury. [...] In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. [...] Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products [...] in the liver cells in a process called <b>steatosis.</b> This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect [...] as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. [...] Overtime, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. [...] These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include <b>steatosis</b> with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Biotinidase {{deficiency}} {{is not due}} to inadequate biotin, {{but rather}} to a deficiency in the enzymes that process it. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. General symptoms include decreased appetite and growth. Dermatologic symptoms include dermatitis, alopecia, and achromotrichia (absence or loss of pigment in the hair). Perosis (a shortening and thickening of bones) {{is seen in the}} skeleton. [...] Fatty liver and kidney syndrome and hepatic <b>steatosis</b> also can occur.|$|E
2500|$|In the hamster {{model of}} yellow fever, early {{administration}} of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease. Ribavirin treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates, reduced tissue damage in the liver and spleen, prevented hepatocellular <b>steatosis,</b> and normalised levels of alanine aminotransferase, a liver damage marker. The mechanism of action of ribavirin in reducing liver pathology in yellow fever virus infection may be similar to its activity in treatment of hepatitis C, a related virus. Because ribavirin had failed to improve survival in a virulent rhesus model of yellow fever infection, it had been previously discounted as a possible therapy.|$|E
