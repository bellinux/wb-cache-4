40|$|Refraction {{techniques}} make {{it possible}} to determine the most appropriate <b>sphero-cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> prescription to achieve the best possible visual quality. Among these techniques, subjective refraction (i. e., patient's response-guided refraction) is the most commonly used approach. In this context, this paper's main goal is to present a simulation software that implements in a virtual manner various subjective-refraction techniques [...] including Jackson's Cross-Cylinder test (JCC) [...] relying all on the observation of computer-generated retinal images. This software has also been used to evaluate visual quality when the JCC test is performed in multifocal-contact-lens wearers. The results reveal this software's usefulness to simulate the retinal image quality that a particular visual compensation provides. Moreover, it can help to gain a deeper insight and to improve existing refraction techniques and it can be used for simulated training...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progress}} and improvements on optical technology have {{enabled us to}} measure {{the characteristics of the}} eye in great detail. It has also been shown that, even when myopia and astigmatism are completely corrected with spectacle, the retinal image is still blurred due to uneven refraction power of the cornea and the crystalline lens [1][2], an effect known as “irregular astigmatism”. However, almost all researches in visual science assume sharp images as input. Currently, a large-scale whole visual system models is being developed on a supercomputer to elucidate its complex function [3]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the blurred retinal images are gradually compensatedatboth,theretinaandthecortex[4]. Therefore, we have developed an eye optics model which can calculate the blurred retinal image based on known physiological evidences to provide a more realistic input to retinal and visual cortex model. The proposed model is described by the linear image filter based on Artal’s model [5]. It can process multispectral image for reproducing the spectral characteristics of photoreceptors. OTF (Optical transfer function) calculated from the wavefront aberration with spectral transmittance of the lens is used for image processing filter. The wavefront aberration is defined by Zernike Coefficients values (measured by wavefront aberrometer such as OPD-Scan or Shack-Hartman Sensor systems) or SCA values (power of <b>sphero-cylindrical</b> <b>lens</b> with its axis for spectacle lens or contact lens prescriptions). To consider the effects of diffraction, OTF is designed to vary depending on pupil diameter and wavelength. To account for aging effects, the spectral transmittance of thelens[6]wasalsoimplemented.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar se a aberrometria ocular total (análise da frente de onda ou wavefront) possibilita a melhora na acuidade visual corrigida (AVc) com lentes esfero-cilíndricas, obtida com a refratometria manifesta em casos de ceratocone com algum grau de intolerância ao uso de lentes de contato. MÉTODOS: Os prontuários de 46 pacientes (89 olhos) referidos com diagnóstico de ceratocone e intolerantes ao uso de lentes de contato, submetidos ao exame de aberrometria ocular total seguido de refração manifesta, foram estudados de forma retrospectiva. A AVc (logMAR) com a correção existente antes do exame foi comparada com a obtida com a nova refração manifesta, realizada, considerando-se os dados objetivos da aberrometria. O teste não-paramétrico de Wilcoxon para amostras pareadas foi utilizado para verificação de diferenças estatisticamente significantes na AVc. RESULTADOS: Houve uma melhora estatisticamente significante na AVc com a nova refração manifesta (p OBJECTIVE: To verify if {{the total}} ocular aberrometry (wavefront analysis) {{facilitates}} manifest refraction and improvement in best spectacle distance corrected visual acuity (BSCDVA) with <b>sphero-cylindrical</b> <b>lenses,</b> in keratoconus cases {{with some degree}} of contact lenses intolerance. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 46 patients (89 eyes) referred with keratoconus and contact lenses intolerance was performed. Ocular aberrometry with ray tracing was followed by manifest refraction. BSCDVA (logMAR) with the previous correction was compared with the one obtained based on the wavefront auto-refraction. The nonparametric test of Wilcoxon for paired samples was used to test statistically significant differences in BSCDVA. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in BSCDVA with the new manifest refraction (p < 0, 0001). The average BSCDVA changed from 0, 37 or 20 / 47 (varying between 1, 3 and 0; standard deviation [SD] = 0, 25) with previous refraction to 0, 23 or 20 / 34 (varying between 1 and 0, 1; SD = 0, 21). 52 eyes (58, 4 %) of 28 patients showed improvement in BSCDVA with the new refraction. The average improvement was 0, 13 logMAR (1, 3 lines on Snellen chart), varying between zero and 0, 6 (6 lines), with standard deviation of 0, 16. Eight patients had significant anisometropia that limited the prescription of glasses. CONCLUSION: Aberrometry facilitated the refraction, determining significant improvement in visual acuity with <b>sphero-cylindrical</b> <b>lenses</b> in keratoconus patients intolerant to contact lenses. The anisometropia was a limiting factor in the prescription of glasses...|$|R
40|$|A common optometric {{problem is}} to specify the eye’s ocular aberrations in terms of Zernike {{coefficients}} and to reduce that specification to a prescription for the optimum <b>sphero-cylindrical</b> correcting <b>lens.</b> The typical approach is first to reconstruct wavefront phase errors from measurements of wavefront slopes obtained by a wavefront aberrometer. This paper applies a new method to this clinical problem that does not require wavefront reconstruction. Instead, we base our analysis of axial wavefront vergence as inferred directly from wavefront slopes. The result is a wavefront vergence map {{that is similar to}} the axial power maps in corneal topography and hence has a potential to be favoured by clinicians. We use our new set of orthogonal Zernike slope polynomials to systematically analyse details of the vergence map analogous to Zernike analysis of wavefront maps. The result is a vector of slope coefficients that describe fundamental aberration components. Three different methods for reducing slope coefficients to a spherocylindrical prescription in power vector forms are compared and contrasted. When the original wavefront contains only second order aberrations, the vergence map is a function of meridian only and the power vectors from all three methods are identical. The differences in the methods begin to appear as we include higher order aberrations, in which case the wavefront vergence map is more complicated. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of vergence map representation of ocular aberrations...|$|R
