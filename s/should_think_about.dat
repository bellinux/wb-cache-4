During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a dilemma in who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> whether or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he asked her for advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Cecil {{believes}} that game design involves a different creative process {{as compared to}} traditional writing. As a writer of a linear story, [...] "all they do is to write the script," [...] he said. [...] "In game design, the writer <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium {{is no excuse for}} a poorly constructed story, the big thing {{is that we have a}} different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories. And that’s why so many games have bad stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|Li {{believes}} that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense {{and instead of}} trying to play the hero people <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: [...] "A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case." [...] He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real life fight and he does not wish to, either.|$|E
2500|$|Dmitry Rogozin {{was quoted}} by Interfax news agency as saying, [...] "Instead of speculating {{about the nature}} of the cargo carried on the Arctic Sea and inventing {{different}} types of tales ... important lessons should be drawn from this event. ...

[...] Sergey Lavrov stated that the Arctic Sea was not secretly carrying advanced Russian missiles, [...] "As for the alleged presence of S-300 systems onboard the dry cargo carrier Arctic Sea, this is an absolute lie"; the Russian Prosecutor General's office also denied the presence of anything but timber aboard the ship. Critical of the idea of Iran-bound missiles aboard the Arctic Sea, Russian journalist Maxim Kononenko pointed out that Russia has direct access to Iran through the Caspian Sea.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Haggard and {{his church}} {{supported}} Colorado Amendment 43 to the Colorado Constitution. It provided, [...] "Only {{a union of}} one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state." [...] Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being {{between a man and}} a woman, Haggard and other gay marriage opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the Colorado Supreme Court would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional. [...] In the movie Jesus Camp, Haggard says, [...] "we don't have to debate about what we <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> homosexual activity. It's written in the Bible." [...] Haggard initially opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions for homosexual couples. [...] He later came to support same-sex marriage as a civil institution, saying that while he still believes it is forbidden under Biblical law, he feels that [...] "we need to be careful not to inculcate [...] into civil law." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Observer, a Ugandan {{bi-weekly}} newspaper, {{printed a}} response to the international attention the bill received. The newspaper said that homosexuality is not a right, is not included in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the US, where much of the media attention originated, still remains controversial. It furthermore criticised the disparate reaction to other human rights violations and genocide in Uganda's history that did not attract the same amount of attention. It went on to state [...] "... this is my major discomfort with homosexuality it is not emerging naturally but rather as a result of intense campaigns in schools, luring people with money and all sorts of falsehoods.... Gays target other people's children because they don't have their own to enlist. Advocates of homosexuality <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the broader impact of their crusade. Homosexuality destroys man's capacity for procreation, the taste of human life and eventually life itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there was}} {{support on the}} Long Island side of the sound, the amount of support in Rye was not as upbeat. In July1965, Robert Moses had to {{redesign}} the route for the new bridge, so that rather than the Cross Westchester meeting the bridge, the Playland Parkway would meet the new bridge. Opposition with Rye involved {{the fact that it}} would take $3million of property demolition to fit the new bridges, although the original proposal would take over $6million. Moving the approach to Playland did not amuse residents of Rye either, which would cost Playland Park its pool, bathhouse and some of the beach on the park. Other complaints included that while more houses would be saved, they would be in the area of heavy traffic. Clay Johnson, mayor of Rye opposed the project, citing it would ruin the neighborhoods of Rye. Rutherford Hubbard, the leader of the [...] "Rye Citizens Advisory Committee Against The Sound Bridge" [...] stated that Moses <b>should</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the people and be more democratic about his decisions.|$|E
