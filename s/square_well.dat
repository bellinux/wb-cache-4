Even though the aluminum apex is still connected to the columns with large copper rods, it is no longer part of the lightning protection system because it is now disconnected from the present lightning rods which shield it. The two lightning rods present since 2013 are connected to the iron columns with two large braided aluminum cables leading down the surface of the pyramidion near its southeast and northwest corners. They enter the pyramidion at its base, where they are tied together (electrically shorted) via large braided aluminum cables encircling the pyramidion [...] above its base. The bottom of the iron columns are connected to ground water below the monument via four large copper rods that pass through a [...] <b>square</b> <b>well</b> half filled with sand {{in the center of the}} foundation. The effectiveness of the lightning protection system has not been affected by a significant draw down of the water table since 1884 because the soil's water content remains roughly 20% both above and below the height of the water table.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} motion of a {{classical}} particle interacting with one, two, and finally an infinite chain of 1 D <b>square</b> <b>wells</b> with oscillating depth. For a single well we find complicated scattering behavior {{even though there is}} no topological chaos due to the absence of hyperbolic periodic orbits. In contrast, for two coupled <b>square</b> <b>wells</b> there is chaotic scattering. The infinite oscillating chain yields the generic transition to chaos, with diffusion in energy and in space, as the separation between wells is increased. We briefly discuss the relevance of our results to solid state physics. ...|$|R

2500|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{particle}} {{in a box}} model (also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite <b>square</b> <b>well)</b> describes a particle free to move in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers. [...] The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems. [...] In classical systems, for example, a ball trapped inside a large box, {{the particle}} can move at any speed within the box {{and it is no}} more likely to be found at one position than another. However, when the well becomes very narrow (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. [...] The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels. [...] Likewise, it can never have zero energy, meaning that the particle can never [...] "sit still". [...] Additionally, it {{is more likely to be}} found at certain positions than at others, depending on its energy level. [...] The particle may never be detected at certain positions, known as spatial nodes.|$|E
