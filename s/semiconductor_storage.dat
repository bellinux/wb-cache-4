40|$|The I/O stack is {{probably}} one of the most basic and stable structures in computer systems. This classic design creates a stack of multiple abstraction layers and allows each layer to evolve independently and interoperably. However, it also creates a great challenge for adopting emerging technologies??A major technology change, especially those happening at the lower layers, often has a strong implication to other layers, even though the interfaces between them still remain unchanged. How to adopt technical innovations seamlessly into the I/O stack is an important but challenging issue. Recent paradigm shift from rotating medium to <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage,</b> such as NAND flash and byte-addressable persistent memory, is deeply changing the landscape of storage systems. Effectively integrating these pivotal technologies into today's I/O stack is crucial to allowing computer systems to benefit from such technical advancement and in the meantime avoid unnecessary disruption. In this paper we present our efforts in the past few years on integrating <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> technologies into the existing I/O hierarchy effectively and efficiently. We have made extensive efforts to achieve the goals in three different but consistent ways, namely a black-box approach, a gray-box approach, and a hinting approach. Based on our experience, we find that adopting these unconventional technologies into the existing ecosystem demands careful considerations on not only exploiting their great performance potential but also minimizing disruptive changes and retaining system design continuity. We believe that achieving both goals is the key to the success of these game-changing technologies in practice. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of the quantity of data {{that needs to be}} stored gave rise to different storage media. From stone in pre-history, to punched tape and cards {{from the beginning of the}} information age, to today's optical, magnetic and <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> units, the need for better ways of storing data is still increasing. One of the most widely used data storage units is the hard disk drive. It consists of several rigid platters coated with magnetic material and magnetic heads, which magnetize the surface of the platter (write) or detect the magnetisation of the surface (read). The data is stored on the platter in tracks divided into sectors and magnetized areas of different orientation. The movable parts of the HDD are vulnerable to external factors and with time they can wear out and fail, a fact which reduces the hard disks reliability. Despite this, HDD's are the primary choice for data storage in personal computers because of their high capacities and relatively low prices. The most popular alternative and competition to hard disks today are <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> units, solid-state drives. SSD’s do not have moveable parts. The data in a SSD can be stored in faster, non-persistent DRAM memory or the slower, persistent flash NAND memory, which retains data without power. This makes them very fast, not affected by external factors and energy efficient compared to HDD's but they are also more expensive and can store less data. SSD's with flash NAND memory are meant for mainstream users, but they do have a limited write cycle life. ...|$|E

30|$|In recent years, nanocrystal-based {{memory devices}} have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{as a possible}} solution to overcome the scaling issue of electronic nonvolatile memories (NVMs) [URL] By using discrete nanocrystals instead of the conventional continuous floating gate as charge storage nodes, local-defect-related leakage can be reduced efficiently to improve data retention [1]. In this regard, discrete-trap type <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> materials such as Si and Ge nanocrystals (Si- and Ge-ncs) embedded in a dielectric matrix have been demonstrated as potential candidates for the fabrication of high-speed, high-density, low-power-consuming, and nonvolatile memories [2 – 6]. Several approaches have been reported for nanocrystal formation in a dielectric matrix, such as chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, or sputtering. The main attention was devoted to two major ones, namely deposition in vacuum and ion beam synthesis, since they are also used in the semiconductor industry for other purposes other than nanocrystal fabrication. Another approach for the fabrication of Si-ncs is the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, as discussed previously [7 – 11]. The excess Si content in the layers {{can be obtained by}} several ways. One of them is the sputtering of two separated (pure Si and SiO 2) targets [7, 8, 12] or one composed (SiO 2 target topped by Si chips) target in pure argon plasma [7, 13, 14]. The other one is the reactive approach, which deals with the sputtering of pure SiO 2 target in mixed argon-hydrogen plasma [9 – 11] or pure Si target in argon-oxygen mixture [15]. The Si excess is controlled by varying the hydrogen [9 – 11] or oxygen flow rate [15] in the plasma. After subsequent high-temperature annealing, Si-ncs can be easily formed in these Si-rich SiO 2 (SRSO) composite layers [7 – 15].|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} a novel group of GaAs charge storage devices. These devices, which are an integration of bipolar and {{junction field effect transistor}} structures were conceived, designed, fabricated, and tested within this study. The purpose was to analyse new types of charge storage devices, which are suitable for fabrication and lead to the development of dynamic and nonvolatile memories in III-V compound semiconductors. Currently, III-V <b>semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> devices consist only of capacitors, where data is destroyed during reading and electrical erasure is difficult. In this work, four devices types were demonstrated that exhibit nondestructive reading, and three of the prototypes can be electrically erased. All types use the junction field effect transistor (JFET) for charge sensing, with each having different bipolar or epitaxial layer structure controlling the junction gate. The bottom epitaxial layer in each case served as the JFET channel. Two of the device types have three alternately doped layers, while the remaining two have four alternately doped layers. In all cases, removal of majority carriers from the middle layers constitutes stored charge. The missing carriers deplete the current carrying a region of the JFET channel. Drain current of the JFET becomes an indicator of stored charge. The basic function of each JFET memory element type is independent of interchanging n- and p- type doping within the structure type. Some performance advantage can be realized, however, by sensing with an n-type channel as compared to p- type due to increased carrier mobility. All device types exhibit storage time characteristics of order ten seconds. Devices are constructed in epitaxial layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) reactors. The design of the epitaxial layers is an intrinsic part, together with the electrical design, of the storage device concept. These concepts are implemented first with photolithography masks which are used in device fabrication. The fabrication methods employ wet chemical etching and ohmic metal liftoff techniques. Electrical dc and charge retention time characteristics along with functionality read/write operations for the memory element group are measured using commercial electronic test equipment...|$|E
30|$|Flash {{memory is}} {{basically}} a MOSFET nonvolatile device that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed [3, 45]. It is a technology that is primarily used in memory cards and Flash drives for general storage and transfer of data between computers and other digital products. Since {{the invention of the}} transistor, NVSM had been the most important invention in the electron device field. The floating gate memory was used to store the information and a tunneling current for programming and erasing operations. The charge is injected into or removed from the floating gate and the floating gate remains in that state, even after power is removed, which means that Flash memory is nonvolatile. The invention of NVSM further gave rise to a new class of memory devices and hence broadened its applications to become ubiquitous. There are a large number of products in the market now which use Flash devices exclusively as secondary storage. Few examples of their applications include medical diagnostic systems, notebook computers, digital audio players, digital cameras, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, digital televisions, universal serial bus (USB) Flash personal disks, Global Positioning Systems, and many more. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>storage</b> devices store data in tiny memory cells made of very small transistors and capacitors made of semiconductor materials such as silicon. Each cell can hold 1 bit of information and an array of cells stores a large chunk of information. Flash devices are gaining popularity over conventional secondary storage devices like hard disks. The Flash memory fabrication process is compatible with the current CMOS process and is a suitable solution for embedded memory applications. A Flash memory cell is simply a MOSFET cell, except that a polysilicon floating gate [46] (or a silicon nitride charge trap layer) is sandwiched between a tunnel oxide and an inter-polyoxide to form a charge storage layer [47]. Although Flash memory is likely the standard charge storage device for the next generation, scaling may eventually be limited by the tunnel oxide limit [8]. In terms of the operation speed of program and erase, Flash memory requires a thin tunnel oxide to enhance the carrier transport between the floating gate and the silicon substrate. However, the very thin tunnel oxide suffers from many reliability issues like reduction in operation voltage, and after a considerable number of program and erase cycles, the tunnel oxide undergoes deterioration loss [48]. Thus, researchers have focused on possible solutions and proposed alternate technologies, including nitride-based memory, nanocrystal memory, and switching memory. All other nonvolatile memories require integration of new materials that are not as compatible as the conventional CMOS process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} in <b>semiconductor</b> technologies, <b>storage</b> class RAMs (SCRAMs) such as FRAM and PRAM are emerging rapidly. Since SCRAMs are nonvolatile and byte-accessible, there are attempts to use these SCRAMs as part of nonvolatile buffer caches. A nonvolatile buffer cache provides improved consistency of file systems by absorbing write I/Os as well as improved performance. In this paper, we discuss the optimality of cache replacement algorithms in nonvolatile buffer caches and present a new algorithm called NBM (Nonvolatile-RAM-aware Buffer cache Management). NBM has three salient features. First, it separately exploits read and write histories of block references, and thus it estimates future references of each operation more precisely. Second, NBM guarantees the complete consistency of write I/Os since all dirty data are cached in nonvolatile buffer caches. Third, metadata lists are maintained separately from cached blocks. This allows more efficient management of volatile and nonvolatile buffer caches based on read and write histories, respectively. Trace-driven simulations show that NBM improves the I/O performance of file systems significantly compared to the NVLRU algorithm that is {{a modified version of}} LRU to hold dirty blocks in nonvolatile buffer caches...|$|R
