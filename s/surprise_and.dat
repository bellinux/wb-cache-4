5|$|Aman {{delivered}} its {{warning to}} Israeli commanders just {{nine and a}} half hours before the outbreak of hostilities, falling considerably short of the expected 24–48 hours warning period.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, the {{employees}} confront Michael to hear about the surprise, but Michael's awkward stalling tactics cause them to finally realize there is no <b>surprise,</b> <b>and</b> they leave.

5|$|Eva and {{her ex-husband}} take Ellen {{to the airport}} for her flight to college. A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and {{stops in front of}} the house on her way to pick up Ellen from the airport. He sees her and she awkwardly waves.

5|$|Fischer had {{not played}} {{competitive}} chess for eighteen months, and many {{thought he would}} never return. Then, to general <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> delight, he {{agreed to participate in}} the Soviet Union vs. the Rest of the World in 1970 in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Madero {{sent some}} of his forces to make a diversionary attack on Agua Prieta, which proved successful; the {{resulting}} First Battle of Agua Prieta was significant {{in that it was}} the first time railroads were used by the rebels to gain <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> that US forces were involved in the fighting. The town was recaptured by federal troops two weeks later once additional reinforcements arrived.|$|E

5|$|Olid next marched inland to the Naco Valley. One of his captains caught González Dávila {{and his men}} by <b>surprise,</b> <b>and</b> marched {{them under}} guard back to Naco, where they were imprisoned. Now that Olid had gained the upper hand, Briones feared his vengeance for not coming to his support, and pledged his {{allegiance}} to Hernán Cortés. Olid imprisoned Las Casas in Naco with González.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kharistan {{was fought}} between {{the forces of}} the Umayyad Caliphate and the Turkic Turgesh in December 737 near the town of Kharistan in Juzjan, eastern Khurasan (modern {{northern}} Afghanistan). The Umayyads under the governor of Khurasan, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, managed to <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> defeat the Turgesh khagan, Suluk, and his ally the Arab renegade al-Harith ibn Surayj, thereby forestalling the collapse of Arab rule over Khurasan.|$|E
5|$|The fact that, in a digitally-connected world, {{a modern}} {{aircraft}} could disappear {{was met with}} <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> disbelief by the public. While changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented, airlines and air transport authorities responded swiftly to take action on several measures to {{reduce the likelihood of}} a similar incident.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> tactical success, but {{was ultimately}} a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft. The Germans, however, lost many pilots {{that they could not}} readily replace.|$|E
5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing their instruments through downtown Los Angeles. The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the camera pans towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens in <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the {{reinforcements}} that al-Muwaffaq {{had promised}} arrived from Iraq, {{under the command}} of his own son, Abu'l-Abbas. The combined Abbasid forces advanced to Shayzar, where the Tulunid army was still encamped. The latter was caught completely by <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> was defeated; many of the Egyptians were killed in the fighting. The survivors fled to Damascus, but upon learning that the Abbasid army was headed for them they abandoned the city, allowing the Abbasids to retake it in February 885. The Tulunid forces continued south to Ramlah in the district of Palestine, where they wrote to Khumarawayh of what had transpired. Khumarawayh now decided to personally lead his troops against the Abbasids, and departed from Egypt for Syria.|$|E
5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> {{were unable to}} organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, the French military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling the French to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> won concessions from the authorities.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, likely in Chang'an. He failed, to his <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he {{probably}} failed because his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
