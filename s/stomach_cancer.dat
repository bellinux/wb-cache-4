5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be <b>stomach</b> <b>cancer.</b> Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report.

Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including <b>stomach</b> <b>cancer.</b> Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and <b>stomach</b> <b>cancer.</b> A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

On March 31, 1952 (exactly 21 years after the death of Knute Rockne), McMillin died of a heart attack; his funeral was attended by many fellow coaches and former players.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and <b>stomach</b> <b>cancer.</b> However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E

5000|$|The {{analysis}} of 630 human primary tumors in 11 tissues shows that hypermethylation of the WRN CpG island promoter (with loss of expression of WRN protein) {{is a common}} event in tumorigenesis.

The WRN protein helicase is important in homologous recombinational DNA repair and also has roles in non-homologous end joining DNA repair and base excision DNA repair.|$|R

5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on <b>stomach</b> <b>cancer.</b> The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
