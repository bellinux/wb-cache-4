40|$|This article compares three {{different}} algorithms used to compute Euler angles from {{data obtained by}} the angular rate sensor (e. g., MEMS gyroscope) —the algorithms based on a rotational matrix, on transforming angular velocity to time derivations of the Euler angles and on unit quaternion expressing rotation. Algorithms are compared by their computational efficiency and accuracy of Euler angles estimation. If attitude of the object is computed only from data obtained by the gyroscope, the quaternion-based algorithm seems to be most suitable (having similar accuracy as the matrix-based algorithm, but taking approx. 30 % less clock cycles on the 8 -bit microcomputer). Integration of the Euler angles’ time derivations has a singularity, therefore is not accurate at full range of object’s attitude. Since the error in every real gyroscope system tends to increase with time due to its offset and thermal drift, we also propose some measures based on compensation by additional sensors (a magnetic compass and accelerometer). Vector data of mentioned <b>secondary</b> <b>sensors</b> has to be transformed into the inertial frame of reference.

40|$|Realistic {{material}} {{models to}} simulate the behavior of brain tissue at large deformations and high strain rates are necessary when designing equipment to protect against ballistic impacts. Acquiring experimental data for brain tissue response is critical to developing appropriate models. Current in vivo and in situ procedures for testing the material behavior of soft tissues are dominated by indentation techniques. The major challenge for this testing configuration is in finding a unique solution to the "inverse problem" i. e., obtaining material properties that are uniquely defined by the indentation force-displacement response. Much of the information related to the interplay between shear and bulk compliance in the deformation field beneath the indenter is lost when capturing the single force-displacement output. To address this challenge, we propose a material testing technique that follows the well- proven path of conventional indentation methods, but also enriches the signal by acquiring displacement data for an offset, passive surface tracking sensor. We present {{the results of a}} finite element (FE) study to demonstrate that the addition of a <b>secondary</b> <b>sensor</b> can help to discern between materials with varying degrees of compressibility. To this end, a large displacement in vivo dynamic indentation surface tracking (DIST) tool was designed and manufactured. This tool incorporates the <b>secondary</b> <b>sensor</b> concept to measure the force-displacement response of brain tissue at strain rates up to 1000 %/s. The technique is applied in vitro to measure the response of porcine brain tissue. To select an appropriate constitutive framework for porcine brain tissue in vitro, uniaxial compression tests measuring the corresponding lateral stretch response are performed. (cont.) A three-dimensional large deformation constitutive model for brain tissue is developed. The model accounts for the observed features of the material response including non-linearity, conditioning, hysteresis, and strain-rate dependence. The model is incorporated into an FE simulation of the brain indentation tests performed with the DIST tool. The effectiveness of the DIST as a material-testing tool is assessed. by Asha Balakrishnan. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007.

One important aspect is the need and wish of older people to live as long as possible in their own home and maintain an independent life. As people grew older, their social networks disperse, with friends and families moving to other parts of town, other cities or even countries. Additionally, people become less mobile with age, leading to less active participation in societal life. Combined, this normal, age-related development leads to increased loneliness and social isolation of older people, with negative effects on mental and physical health of those people. In the AGNES project, a home-based system has been developed that allows connecting elderly with their families, friends and other significant people over the Internet. As most older people have limited experience with computers and often special requirements on technology, one focus of AGNES was to develop with the users novel technological means for interacting with their social network.

Subsequently, a real-world case study is performed to investigate if fusion in SSL is also beneficial when assumptions of the minimal model are not met. In particular, a flying robot learns to map pressure measurements to sonar height measurements and then fuses the two, resulting in better height estimation.

40|$|Abstract — Cognitive radio based dynamic {{spectrum}} {{access network}} {{is emerging as}} a technology to address spectrum scarcity. In this study, {{we assume that the}} channel is licensed to some primary (licensed) operator. We consider a sensor network with cognitive radio capability that acts as a secondary (unlicensed) network and uses the channel in underlay mode. The secondary network uses interference temperature model [3] to ensure that the interference to the primary devices remain below a predefined threshold. We use Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the interference temperature dynamics of the primary channel. On sensing the event of interest, the sensor nodes transmit observation packets (to some central monitoring station), which constitutes the interference traffic on the primary channel. One of the <b>secondary</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes periodically measures the interference temperature on the channel. If the measured interference temperature is greater than a predefined threshold, then the measuring node records symbol 1; otherwise it records symbol 0. Using a sequence of symbols measured over a period of time, the node constructs and trains an HMM using Baum-Welch procedure. The trained HMM is shown to be statistically stable. The node uses this trained HMM to predict the future sequences and use them in computing the value of Channel Availability Metric for the channel, which is used to select a primary channel. Results of application of such trained HMMs in channel selection in multi-channel wireless network are presented.

Traditionally, sensing has been performed through energy detection by each individual secondary user. In order to increase accuracy, individual measurements are aggregated using different fusion functions. However, even though collaborative spectrum sensing can increase accuracy under benign settings, it is prone to falsification attacks, where malicious secondary users report fake sensings. Previous studies have designed trust (reputation) based systems to contain {{the effect of the}} adversaries, ignoring to a large extent the wireless channel irregularities when performing the computation.

DTCS 3 is a collaborative spectrum sensing system that takes into account both a <b>secondary</b> <b>sensor</b> node’s trust and its capability to sense the channel. Through thorough evaluations that consider a large variety of attack strategies, we show that by accounting for wireless induced effects while calculating the reporting trust of a secondary user, we can significantly improve the performance of a collaborative spectrum sensing system as compared to existing schemes in the literature. In particular, the true positive/negative rates can be improved by as much as 36 %, while DTCS 3 is able to track and respond to dynamic changes in the adversaries behavior...|$|E
