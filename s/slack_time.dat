40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{energy savings}} have {{become one of}} the most {{critical}} issues. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach to scheduling periodic real-time tasks in the multicore context. Within a voltage/frequency domain (VFD), a simple static voltage/frequency scaling schedule (SimpleVS) is first introduced to select the utilization of the heaviest-loaded core as the shared operating frequency of this VFD. Next, the slack reallocation policy is proposed to further reclaim <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> while satisfying timeliness requirements. The slack reallocation strives to redistribute the <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> uniformly to the cores on the same VFD by appropriate job migrations. Experimental results show that compared with the static frequency schedule, our proposed policy can achieve energy savings up to 22 percent when the system is under-utilized...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} robust {{schedule}} coordination scheme which combines timetable planning with a semi-flexible departure delayed control strategy {{in case of}} disruptions. The flexibility is provided by allowing holding for the late incoming bus within a safety control margin (SCM). In this way, the stochastic travel time is addressed by the integration of real-time control and slacks at the planning phase. The schedule coordination problem then jointly optimises the planning headways and <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> in the timetable subject to SCM. Analytical formulations of cost functions are derived for three types of operating modes: uncoordinated operation, departure punctual control and departure delayed control. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed integer programming model and solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Numerical results provide an insight into the interaction between SCM and <b>slack</b> <b>times,</b> and demonstrate that the proposed model leads to cost saving and higher efficiency when SCM is considered. Compared to the conventional operating modes, the proposed method also presents advantages in transfer reliability and robustness to delay and demand variation...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} that globalization {{and information technology}} affect the patterns of transport and logistic activities has increased interest in the integration of intermodal transport resources. There are many significant advantages provided by integration of multiple transport schedules, such as: (1) Eliminating direct routes connecting all origin-destinations pairs and concentrating cargos on major routes; (2) improving the utilization of existing transportation infrastructure; (3) reducing the requirements for warehouses and storage areas due to poor connections, and (4) reducing other impacts including traffic congestion, fuel consumption and emissions. This dissertation examines a series of optimization problems for transfer coordination in intermodal and intra-modal logistic networks. The first optimization model is developed for coordinating vehicle schedules and cargo transfers at freight terminals, {{in order to improve}} system operational efficiency. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) within the studied multi-mode, multi-hub, and multi-commodity network is formulated and solved by using sequential quadratic programming (SQP), genetic algorithms (GA) and a hybrid GA-SQP heuristic algorithm. This is done primarily by optimizing service frequencies and <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> for system coordination, while also considering loading and unloading, storage and cargo processing operations at the transfer terminals. Through a series of case studies, the model has shown its ability to optimize service frequencies (or headways) and <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> based on given input information. The second model is developed for countering schedule disruptions within intermodal freight systems operating in time-dependent, stochastic and dynamic environments. When routine disruptions occur (e. g. traffic congestion, vehicle failures or demand fluctuations) in pre-planned intermodal timed-transfer systems, the proposed dispatching control method determines through an optimization process whether each ready outbound vehicle should be dispatched immediately or held waiting for some late incoming vehicles with connecting freight. An additional sub-model is developed to deal with the freight left over due to missed transfers. During the phases of disruption responses, alleviations and management, the proposed real-time control model may also consider the propagation of delays at further downstream terminals. For attenuating delay propagations, an integrated dispatching control model and an analysis of sensitivity to <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> are presented...|$|R

Slack water following high tide can improve underwater visibility, as the previously incoming tide brings clear water with it.

6000|$|The {{intimate}} {{psychology of}} work is a thing altogether too little considered and discussed. One asks: [...] "What keeps a workman working properly at his work?" [...] and it seems a sufficient answer {{to say that it}} is the need of getting a living. But that is not the complete answer. Work must to some extent interest; if it bores, no power on earth will keep a man doing it properly. And the tendency of modern industrialism has been to subdivide processes and make work more boring and irksome. Also the workman must be satisfied with the living he is getting, and the tendency of newspaper, theatre, cinematograph show and so forth is to fill his mind with ideas of ways of living infinitely more agreeable and interesting than his own. Habit also counts very largely in the regular return of the man to his job, and the fluctuations of employment, the failure of the employing class to provide any alternative to idleness during <b>slack</b> <b>time,</b> break that habit of industry. And then, last but not least, there is self-respect. Men and women are capable of wonders of self-discipline and effort if they feel that theirs is a meritorious service, if they imagine the thing they are doing is the thing they ought to do. A miner will cut coal in a different spirit and with a fading zest if he knows his day's output is to be burnt to waste secretly by a lunatic. Man is a social animal; few men are naturally social rebels, and most will toil very cheerfully in subordination if they feel that the collective end is a fine thing and a great thing.|$|E
40|$|Transit Schedule Design (TSD) in {{this work}} is defined as {{selecting}} the location of timing points and the <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> associated with them. The selection of these variables affects several cost components such as waiting time cost of boarding passengers, in-vehicle waiting time cost of through passengers and the operational cost of transit vehicles. To make a balance between these cost components, the TSD problem must be treated as an optimization problem where {{the objective is to}} select a set of timing points and corresponding <b>slack</b> <b>times</b> such that a generalized cost function is minimized. However, this problem takes a considerable amount of time to solve when there are numerous timing point/slack time options. This paper designs a practical algorithm based on the Ant algorithm optimization technique to find an optimal TSD. To check the performance of the algorithm, it is calibrated using the generated data from micro-simulation modelling of a bus route in Melbourne, Australia. The results demonstrate the ability of the developed algorithm to solve the problem for the modelled bus route in a manageable processing time. When the problem becomes more complex, i. e. more feasible schedule designs, the algorithm examines a lower portion of the feasible designs to reach the solution. The paper presents a range of practical benefits of the algorithm in bus route planning...|$|R

60|$|Squire Norman had a {{clerical}} friend whose rectory of Carstone lay {{some thirty}} miles from Normanstand. Thirty miles {{is not a}} great distance for railway travel; but it is a long drive. The days had not come, nor were they ever likely to come, for the making of a railway between the two places. For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their old University days. Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been chums at Trinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted. When Harold An Wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming Midland manufacturing town, it was Norman's influence which obtained the rectorship for his friend. It was not often that they could meet, for An Wolf's work, which, though not very exacting, had to be done single-handed, kept him to his post. Besides, he was a good scholar and eked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school. An occasional mid-week visit to Normanstand in the <b>slack</b> <b>time</b> of school work on the Doctor's part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the rectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many years the measure of their meeting. Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son had kept him closer to home. Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway accident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the time Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the afflicted man, and to give him what was under the circumstances his best gift, sympathy. After an interval of a few years the Squire's courtship and marriage, at which his old friend had assisted, had confined his activities to a narrower circle. The last time they had met was when An Wolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his friend's wife. In the process of years, however, the shadow over Norman's life had begun to soften; when his baby had grown to be something of a companion, they met again. Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death been able to tear himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and Stephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him. An Wolf gladly promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked forward to their meeting. Each found the other somewhat changed, in all but their old affection.|$|E
