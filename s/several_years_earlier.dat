5|$|Ip Mans {{original}} title was controversial. It was disputed when film director Wong Kar-wai {{announced plans to}} make his own Ip Man film with Tony Leung Chiu-wai while filming 2046. Wong had planned his own Ip Man biopic titled The Great Master (一代宗师), with Leung playing the role of Ip. Wong's film, however, had been in development hell, having been announced <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Producer Raymond Wong wanted to name his film Grandmaster Yip Man, which bore a resemblance to the title Wong Kar-wai wanted to use for his film.|$|E

5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully {{bring an end to}} the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E

50|$|The exact room-temperature crystal {{structure}} of sodium bismuth titanate {{has been a}} matter of debate for <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Early</b> studies in the 1960s using X-ray diffraction suggested Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 to adopt either a pseudo-cubic or a rhombohedral {{crystal structure}}. In 2010, based on the high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, a monoclinic structure (space group Cc) was proposed. On heating, Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 transforms at 533 ± 5 K to a tetragonal structure (space group P4bm) and above 793 ± 5 K to cubic structure (space group Pmm).|$|R
5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought {{to locate a}} woman he had met <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E

As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E

Ireland progressed to the second stage of the competition. They were grouped with New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and lost all three of their matches. In 2009, Ireland played nine ODIs, winning the seven they played against Associate nations, losing their only match against a Test team (England), and one match was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Pompey's death {{did not see}} the end of {{the civil}} wars since {{initially}} Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.|$|E

This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 <b>several</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth.

Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
