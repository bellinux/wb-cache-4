The [...] campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State LA {{the largest in}} the California State University system. Maxwell Starkman & Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. The first on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at double occupancy for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During 1984 Summer Olympics that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Lesser also pioneered “underground parking”, with his Cal State LA development, at the time considered unusual enough to merit a separate newspaper <b>section</b> <b>header,</b> [...] "Parking Underground", which described a two-level underground parking lot as a [...] "concept" [...] of [...] "subterranean spaces". A newly debuted Halisi Scholars Black Living-Learning Community, an effort to “enhance the residential experience for students who are a part of or interested in issues of concern to the black community living on campus by offering the opportunity to connect with faculty and peers, and engage in programs that focus on academic success, cultural awareness, and civic engagement.” ...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2015. Major: Health Informatics. Advisor: David Pieczkiewicz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiiii, 84 pages. Operative report documentation (ORD) {{is a fundamental}} part of surgical practice that has a direct and significant role in quality, medico-legal and billing, and other secondary uses of operative reports. Traditionally, operative reports are created by the primary surgeon through dictation and subsequent transcription of details of the operative procedure after its completion. With the advent of widespread electronic health record (EHR) adoption, {{there is a potential}} opportunity to improve aspects of ORD through synoptic reporting and templating of operative reports, as well as to leverage operative report sections and high-level phases described with surgical procedures in operative report. This research seeks to illuminate knowledge about high-level ORD structure including an assessment of attitudes and opinions towards ORD in surgical education, evaluation of structured operative report section names, and appraisal of high-level phases of surgical descriptions in operative reports with the application of automated methods to classify these phases. An electronic survey about ORD teaching and practices was sent to surgical program directors. While most program directors responding to the survey consider ORD teaching a priority, few provide ORD instruction, and significant barriers were perceived by program directors for ORD instruction and ORD using synoptic reporting. To evaluate operative report sections, the HL 7 Implementation Guide for Clinical Document Architecture Release 2. 0 Operative Note Draft Standard for Trial Use (HL 7 -ON DSTU) Release 1 and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®) structured sections were evaluated on 384 unique <b>section</b> <b>headers</b> from 362, 311 operative reports. HL 7 -ON DSTU alone and HL 7 -ON DSTU with LOINC® <b>section</b> <b>headers</b> covered 66 % and 79 % of <b>sections</b> <b>headers</b> (93 % and 98 % of <b>header</b> instances), respectively. <b>Section</b> <b>headers</b> contained large numbers of synonyms, formatting and word form variation, as well as coverage gaps in the current terminology sources. In a third study, high-level phases of the "Surgery Description" from operative reports were identified by surgeons. Automatic classification with support vector machines using topic analysis and information gain for feature selection was then used to identify these high-level phases, followed by assessment of subtopics for phases. Five high-level "Surgery Description" section phases were identified: Preliminaries, Getting Started, Main Part, Closure, and Epilogue, as well as need for Observations to describe findings, events, and other important clinical information. Automated classification of high-level sections performed well on a set of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and random surgery operative reports and was associated with the identification of meaningful subtopics. Overall, this research demonstrates the variability in ORD practices for surgeons nationally and individually with respect to section structure, as well as the value of high-level phases to group content in these important clinical documents. Future work will seek to leverage our understanding of ORD structure to improve information extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for secondary use of operative reports...|$|R
