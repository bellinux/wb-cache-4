5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of <b>survival,</b> <b>and</b> fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete <b>survival,</b> <b>and</b> compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that {{give them an}} advantage over their competitors {{are more likely to}} pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite.
