The expression of this construct allows normal plant and seed development but inhibits seed germination. Plants containing the SL construct were crossed with plants containing the tet R gene to derive plant lines where {{the expression of the}} SL construct is repressed. Plant lines that contained both constructs allowed normal seed formation and germination, whereas seeds in which the SL construct was separated from the R gene through segregation did not germinate.

5000|$|The EPA regulates {{substances}} with pesticide characteristics, {{looking at}} potential threats {{to human health}} or the environment. They claim not to regulate the genetically modified plants, but the pesticides produced by the plants or properties that change the usage of applied pesticides [...] This includes; plants engineered to produce resistance to herbicides (e.g. Roundup Ready), plants that produce their own pesticides (e.g. BT) and virus resistant plants. Authority to regulate the pesticide properties in genetically modified organisms was granted in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The EPA published regulations in 1994 and begun acting on them in 1995. In 1994 they proposed the exemption of three categories of genetically modified plants under their regulation. These were plants where the genetic material originated in <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> (cisgenic), plants that used physical barriers to prevent the target pest from attaching itself, and plants expressing viral coat proteins to protect against virus infection. In 2001, rules regarding exemption of cisgenic plants had been finalised. The other two proposed exemptions were still under review in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{resistance}} (R) genes {{involved in}} gene-for-gene interactions with pathogens tend to undergo co-evolutionary arms races in which plant specificity and pathogen virulence continually adapt {{in response to}} each other. Studies in this regard have documented that genes resistant for different plant pathogens—fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes—are highly conserved in some motifs among a variety of <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Based on these studies, disease resistance genes have been isolated from several <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Although originally believed to provide durable resistance, only a few exceptional R genes proved able to control pathogens for an extended period. By exploiting new developments in plant transformation technology, isolated R genes can be transferred from donor species to sexually incompatible recipients. In some instances functional R gene transfer was successful, although {{in some cases it}} was limited to members of the same family. In these studies recipient transgenic plants were challenged with the same pathogen or avirulence product that the R gene donor species recognized. These data therefore show that signal transduction molecules that activate a resistance response are conserved among non-sexually <b>compatible</b> <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> However they do not provide insight into the ability of heterologous R genes to recognize pathogen species that they have not previously encountered.

30|$|Intensive high-input {{farming is}} {{known as one of}} the main drivers of the {{continuous}} biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Diversity and abundance of the weed flora provide relevant indicators for farmland biodiversity. While HR cropping facilitates weed control for farmers and makes chemical weed management more flexible, it is accompanied by increased herbicide use and less crop rotation. Toxic effects of the complimentary herbicides on non-target organisms, e.g. soil and aquatic organisms have been shown. Due to the widespread use of glyphosate, at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species have evolved worldwide. To counter resistance evolution in weeds, integrated weed management is recommended. But continuous and widespread HR cropping is still very common. The commercial trend is to develop new GM crops with stacked HR traits and GM varieties with increased glyphosate resistance. However, this approach will not reduce the overall herbicide amounts used in agriculture. Control problems can also arise due to HR volunteers or feral plants, e.g. HR oilseed rape. In centres of crop origin and regions where <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> occur, transfer of HR genes to wild relatives can be expected. Biodiversity will be affected by HR cropping systems by the very efficient removal of weed plants which in turn leads to a further reduction of flora and fauna diversity and abundance. A prominent example in this respect may be the decline of monarch butterfly populations in the US which has been linked to the massive loss of their food plants upon widespread adoption of HR crops. Since it has been shown that HR systems are not compatible with measures to stop the loss of biodiversity on farmland, a more sustainable model of agriculture is needed, which, according to the present experience, cannot reasonably integrate approaches like HR cropping.|$|R

Spatial isolation can also be a key component for a strategy to minimize pollen-mediated gene flow in Mexico between transgenic maize and <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> of maize conventional hybrids, landraces, and wild relatives. The objective of this research was to generate field maize-to-maize outcrossing data to help guide coexistence discussions in Mexico. In this study, outcrossing rates were determined and modeled from eight locations in six northern states, which represent the most economically important areas for the cultivation of hybrid maize in Mexico. At each site, pollen source plots were planted with a yellow-kernel maize hybrid and surrounded by plots with a white-kernel conventional maize hybrid (pollen recipient) of the same maturity. Outcrossing rates were then quantified by assessing the number of yellow kernels harvested from white-kernel hybrid plots. The highest outcrossing values were observed near the pollen source (12. 9 % at 1 m distance). The outcrossing levels declined sharply to 4. 6, 2. 7, 1. 4, 1. 0, 0. 9, 0. 5, and 0. 5 % as the distance from the pollen source increased to 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 25 m, respectively. At distances beyond 20 m outcrossing values at all locations were below 1 %. These trends are consistent with studies conducted in other world regions. The results suggest that coexistence measures that have been implemented in other geographies, such as spatial isolation, would be successful in Mexico to minimize transgenic maize pollen flow to conventional maize hybrids, landraces and wild relatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of existing plant breeding techniques, such as cisgenesis, allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar quicker and {{with little to}} no genetic drag. Cisgenesis is the genetic modification of a recipient plant with natural gene(s) from a <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plant.</b> Unlike transgenesis, which is the genetic modification of a recipient plant with gene(s) from any non‐plant organism, or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant, the results of cisgenesis could occur naturally over time. Currently, both cisgenic and transgenic products are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and are labeled as such in countries which require mandatory GMO labeling. Critics claim that cisgenic products should be exempt from the GMO legislation and therefore no mandatory labeling should apply for cisgenic products. This study analyzes European consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards a cisgenic product, rice, and estimates consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, as cisgenic, as with environmental benefits or as any combination of these attributes. The {{data were collected from}} 3, 002 respondents through an online survey administrated in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to estimate consumers 2 ̆ 7 WTP in each country. The results highlight significant differences across countries in terms of attitudes towards and between cisgenic and transgenic rice, WTP and demographics affecting the WTP. In all the five studied countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM. In all the studied countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly different and lower WTP to avoid to consume rice labeled as cisgenic compared to rice labeled as GM. In addition, consumers in Spain and in France are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. Finally, the results suggest that consumers differentiate cisgenic and transgenic products and that they tend to have a more positive attitude towards cisgenic rice than transgenic rice. This seems to indicate that not all GMOs are the same in consumers 2 ̆ 7 eyes and thus, can have important policy implications in terms of labeling and importation of cisgenic products...|$|R
40|$|Both {{cisgenesis}} and transgenesis are {{plant breeding}} techniques {{that can be}} used to introduce new genes into plant genomes. However, transgenesis uses gene(s) from a non-plant organism or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant while cisgenesis involves the introduction of gene(s) from a crossable [...] <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> [...] <b>plant.</b> Traditional breeding techniques could possibly achieve the same results as those from cisgenesis, but would require a much larger timeframe. Cisgenesis allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar more quickly and with little to no genetic drag. The current regulation in the European Union (EU) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) treats cisgenic plants the same as transgenic plants and both are mandatorily labeled as GMOs. This study estimates European consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, cisgenic, with environmental benefits (which cisgenesis could provide), or any combination of these three attributes. Data were collected from 3, 002 participants through an online survey administered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to model consumers' WTP in each country. Model estimates highlight significant differences in WTP across countries. In all five countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid purchasing rice labeled as GM. In all countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly higher WTP to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM compared to rice labeled as cisgenic, suggesting that inserting genes from the plant's own gene pool is more acceptable to consumers. Additionally, French consumers are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. These findings suggest that not all GMOs are the same in consumers' eyes and thus, from a consumer preference perspective, the differences between transgenic and cisgenic products are recommended to be reflected in GMO labeling and trade policies...|$|R

For identification of the parental types of cpDNA, these studies used parents that have differences in restriction fragment length polymorphisms and exhibit partial sexual incompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we used <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> parents of the isogamous colonial volvocalean Gonium maiaprilis that seemed an ideal species to identify the pattern of cpDNA inheritance based on the length difference in the putative group I intron interrupted in the Rubisco large subunit gene and objective identification of mating types by {{the presence or absence}} of the minus-dominance (MID) gene.

In this study, we compared the symbiotic efficiency of Sinorhizobium meliloti strains Sm 1021, 102 F 34, and FSM-MA, and Sinorhizobium medicae strain WSM 419 on the two widely used M. truncatula accessions A 17 and R 108.

We showed that Sm 1021 efficiently induced nodule organogenesis but cannot fully activate the differentiation of the symbiotic nodule cells, explaining its weaker performance.

In a greenhouse, we determined bottom-up (by the plants) and top-down (by natural enemies of the nematodes) control of two root-feeding nematode species (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Meloidogyne hapla) in the rhizospheres of two range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> Centaurea stoebe and Geranium pyrenaicum, and two congeneric natives, Centaurea jacea and Geranium molle. Pots with plants growing in sterilized soil were inoculated with either a microbial soil community from the newly colonized natural habitat, a mixture of native microbial nematode antagonists, {{or a combination of}} these two communities. We tested the hypotheses that bottom-up control of root-feeding nematodes would be strongest in the root zone of range expanders and that top-down control would be strongest in the root zone of native <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> We observed profound intra- and interspecific differences in bottom-up and top-down control among all four <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Bottom-up control by the range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was either strong or weak. Top-down control by microbes was strongest in native Centaurea. The addition of a mixture of both microbial communities reduced control of M. hapla in the root zones of the native <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> and enhanced its control in the root zones of range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> We conclude that there was species-specific bottom-up and top-down control of root-feeding nematodes among the four <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> tested. Range-expanding <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> influenced their microbial rhizosphere community differently compared to native <b>plant</b> <b>species,</b> but top-down control in the root zone of natives was not systematically superior to that of range-shifting <b>plant</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
40|$|Endemic {{seed plants}} are {{important}} floral components in tropical rainforests, {{and are often}} sensitive to human disturbance. However, few reports exist of the impacts of forest logging on these species. In this study, based on surveys of 164 quadrats of 25 m× 25 m in Jianfengling, Hainan Island, the species composition and relationships between species richness of Hainan endemic seed plants and the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness were analyzed. Each of the 164 quadrats was grouped into one of three forest types, including old-growth, selectively logged and clear-cut forests. Then changes in species diversity were studied by comparing species–area relationships, cumulative species–individual relationships and species abundance distributions for the Hainan endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> among the three forests types. Results highlighted the abundance and diversity of endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. We found 158 species which acount for 40 % of all endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> found on Hainan Island, including 98 woody species (excluding lianas). Fifty-two woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> (excluding lianas) from Hainan Island were recorded in the 164 quadrats; 53 % of all woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> in Jianfengling. Among them, Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Rubiaceae are dominant families. The richness of the woody seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> endemic to Hainan Island was linearly correlated with the total <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> richness in the quadrat. After forest logging, the number of woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> appears to increase slightly, especially in selectively logged forests. However, the woody endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> that appear to increase post-logging only occur in 1 – 2 quadrats and have relatively small and unstable populations, and may therefore disappear during forest succession. On the other hand, some endemic seed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> still have medium populations after logging, such as Nephelium topengii, Madhuca hainanensis and Castanopsis jianfenglingensis...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> are {{adapted to the}} seasonal variation in ant activity, i. e. that ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits when the activity of their seed dispersers is especially high. Two testable predictions of this hypothesis exist: 1. Ant dispersed and differently dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> differ in their seasonal development, i. e. ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> fruit (flower) earlier or {{later in the year}} than other <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Floristic investigations yielded ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> to flower and fruit 1. 5 - 2 month earlier than non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species.</b> Since other factors such as growth form, seed size or pollination mode may have caused this seasonal difference, multivariate analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that these additional factors had only little influence on the seasonal difference and that the effect was mainly due to the mode of seed dispersal. 2. At times when ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> produce ripe fruits the ant activity must be higher than at times when non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> do. Investigations of seasonal frequencies of ant individuals and of seasonal seed removal rates revealed ant activity to be especially high from May to July. Mean fruiting time of ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was the beginning of July. Mean fruiting time of non-ant dispersed <b>plant</b> <b>species</b> was end of August / beginning of September. Statistical tests revealed that if ant dispersed plants had fruited as late as the other plants, they would have suffered a significant loss in seed removal. These results support the hypothesis drawn up in the beginning. The early fruiting times of ant dispersed plants appear to be an adaptation to the seasonal variation in ant activity...|$|R
