5|$|On 1 December 2010, {{the bridge}} was closed {{for the first time}} due to heavy snow. After several {{accidents}} meant <b>snowploughs</b> were unable to clear the carriageways, {{the bridge was}} closed in both directions at 6.40a.m. and remained closed for several hours. As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.|$|E
25|$|Land Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, <b>snowploughs,</b> and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.|$|E
500|$|During winter NSB {{had large}} costs keeping the line snow-free. Large {{diesel-electric}} <b>snowploughs</b> were stationed at Finse, {{and tens of}} kilometers of snow sheds were built on the most vulnerable parts. Especially the [...] part between Finse Station and Hallingskeid was a drain on resources, and heavy snowfall and drifts regularly closed the entire line. A solution was proposed by NSB's director Robert Nordén in 1984, involving construction of a [...] tunnel between the two stations.|$|E
5000|$|The Class DD15 was {{developed}} from the Class DD13 locomotive design, {{with the addition of}} <b>snowplough</b> units at either end. The <b>snowplough</b> units could be detached, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods. However, with the <b>snowplough</b> units mounted, the locomotive axle load was nearly 16 t, restricting use on rural lines, and so the class was superseded by the later Class DE15 locomotives, which had separate <b>snowplough</b> units. As with the Class DD13 locomotives, the Class DD15 had two [...] DMF31SB diesel engines.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Class DD13 6th-batch locomotives, the Class DD14 was a single-end-cab design with a rotary <b>snowplough</b> {{unit at the}} cab end. It was the first {{diesel-powered}} rotary <b>snowplough</b> built by JNR. The locomotives had two [...] diesel engines. One engine {{could be used for}} propulsion with the other driving the rotary <b>snowplough</b> unit, giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 3,000 tonnes per hour, or the unit could be operated in multiple with a second locomotive allowing both engines to drive the rotary <b>snowplough,</b> giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 4,000 tonnes per hour.|$|R
50|$|The Class DE15 was {{developed}} from the Class DE10 locomotive design, {{with the addition of}} separate two-axle <b>snowplough</b> units at either end. The <b>snowplough</b> units could be attached and detached relatively easily, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods, unlike the <b>snowplough</b> units on the earlier Class DD15 locomotives, which were mounted directly onto the locomotives and required a crane to be attached and detached.|$|R
500|$|To {{haul the}} trains, the mining company took {{delivery}} of a Vossloh G1000 BB. Built new in 2009, it was delivered to Kirkenes on 12 February 2010. The unit deviates from standard production by having its maximum speed reduced by software from it is further equipped with <b>snowploughs,</b> air supply to open the hopper car doors, radio remote control and janney couplers. As a back-up, the company will retain the MaK G 1203. The old hooper cars were renovated and put into service, while the track received new concrete ties. The train runs up to 20 trips per day.|$|E
60|$|When all was over, {{a hearty}} vote of thanks was passed to Aunt Cyrilla and her basket. The {{sealskin}} lady {{wanted to know}} how she made her pound cake, and the khaki boy asked for her receipt for jelly cookies. And when two hours later the conductor came in and said the <b>snowploughs</b> had got along and they'd soon be starting, they all wondered if it could really be less than twenty-four hours since they met.|$|E

5000|$|Six Class DE15-1000 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} between 1971 and 1973 by Nippon Sharyo using the DML61ZB engine uprated to [...] Locomotive DE15 1002 had a <b>snowplough</b> unit designed for clearing single-track lines, {{while the other}} five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one <b>snowplough</b> unit, but locomotives DE15 1002, 1004, and 1006 were subsequently modified with <b>snowplough</b> units at both ends. DE15 1002 was renumbered DE15 2052.|$|R
50|$|Between 1979 and 1983, four {{locomotives}} (DD16 2, 5, 4, and 13) {{were converted}} at JNR's Nagano and Matto workshops to become self-propelled <b>snowplough</b> units, numbered DD16 301 to 304, {{with the addition}} of bogie <b>snowplough</b> units on either end.|$|R
50|$|Gives {{information}} to <b>snowplough</b> crews. A yellow or white 'V' shape indicates 'lower snowplough', an inverted yellow or white 'V' indicates 'raise snowplough'. These are placed {{to warn the}} crew to raise the <b>snowplough</b> {{so as to avoid}} hitting any obstructions at rail level, such as level crossings/grade crossings.|$|R

50|$|On {{almost all}} the beltway, the speed limit is 90 km/h and filling {{stations}} are present. A regular service of gritters is active during winter, including <b>snowploughs</b> when needed.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 {{the depot}} had an {{allocation}} of Class 08 shunters. The depot also had two <b>snowploughs.</b> Other locomotives usually stabled at the depot included Classes 26, 27, 37 and 47.|$|E
5000|$|Six Class DE15-0 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} between 1967 and 1969 by Kisha and Nippon Sharyo. The locomotives {{were based on}} the Class DE10-0 design and were equipped with a [...] engine and train-heating steam generator. Locomotive DE15 3 had a <b>snowplough</b> unit designed for clearing single-track lines, while the other five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one <b>snowplough</b> unit, but locomotives DE15 1 to 3 and 6 were subsequently modified with <b>snowplough</b> units at both ends. DE15 3 was renumbered DE15 2053.|$|R

50|$|The KiYa 143 {{locomotives}} {{are used}} as self-propelled snowplough units during the winter season, replacing ageing JNR Class DD15 and JNR Class DE15 locomotives, and for hauling non-revenue services during other periods with the <b>snowploughs</b> removed.|$|E
50|$|These {{sets were}} built {{for use on}} the Kosei Line, due to the heavy amounts of {{snowfall}} in the region. They feature semi automatic doors, <b>snowploughs</b> and improved brakes. Some trains were also transferred to the Sagano Line.|$|E

50|$|Tb is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive used by Banverket of Sweden for line service and <b>snowploughing.</b> Ten locomotives were built for Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) in 1969-70 by Nydquist & Holm (NOHAB) for combined freight and <b>snowploughing</b> service, along with 20 smaller Tc locomotives.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{off-road}} capabilities, Unimogs {{can be found}} in jungles, mountains and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as <b>snowploughs,</b> municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road-rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version).|$|E
50|$|In 1987, the {{allocation}} of the depot included Classes 20, 26, 27, 37 and 47, and DMU Classes 101 and 104. Meanwhile, Class 08 shunters were also stabled. At that time, the depot had a wheel lathe and two <b>snowploughs.</b> The depot's logo is commonly noted as having been a Scottie dog, however it was more closely reflective of a West Highland White Terrier.|$|E
