5000|$|The player {{typically}} strums the chords {{with the}} left hand. The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings. A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note. Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings, which produces a mandolin-like tremolo. The bounce rate is somewhat fixed, as {{it is based on}} the spring steel <b>strip</b> <b>length,</b> hammer weight, and string tension—but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip, effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer.|$|E
40|$|Variation {{of lower}} {{resonance}} frequency with center <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> {{is shown in}} Figure 7 (b). It is found that resonance frequency decreases with increasing width of notch (i. e. center <b>strip</b> <b>length).</b> Results of proposed method are {{similar to that of}} FDTD method. Little variation in the two results is due to approximation involved in the cavity theory that is used for equivalent circuit model. The variation of lower resonance frequency as a function of side <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> is shown in Figure 7 (c) along with the reported results. It is observed that the resonance frequency decreases with side <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> and the results from proposed method are in good agreement with the FDTD method. It may be mentioned that all the data obtained from proposed method are almost in good agreement with reported results. This validates the veracity of proposed method of analysis. 5. CONCLUSION It may therefore be inferred from this analysis that H-shaped patch exhibits dual resonance behavior and the resonance frequency are very sensitive to the dimensions of the notch. Such antenna can be successfully used at two different frequencies as per requirement...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the physical and mechanical performance of flakeboard reinforced with bamboo strips. The study investigated three different bamboo strip alignment patterns and an experimental control. All panels were tested in static bending both along parallel and perpendicular to the lengths of the bamboo strips. Internal bond strength, thickness swelling, linear expansion, and water absorption were also examined. As expected, modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) were substantially greater for all three experimental panel types as compared to the control group. Linear expansion (LE) was also improved for all three experimental panel groups. The bamboo strip alignment patterns had no significant effect on thickness swelling, water absorption and internal bond. The sample means for MOR, MOE, and LE tested perpendicular to the bamboo <b>strip</b> <b>lengths</b> yielded slightly lower mean values than corresponding samples tested parallel to the bamboo <b>strips</b> <b>lengths.</b> This difference in mechanical properties is largely attributed to low panel density in the failure zones...|$|R

40|$|Given {{a set of}} {{irregular}} shapes, {{the strip}} nesting problem {{is the problem of}} packing the shapes within a rectangular strip of material such that the <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> is minimized, or equivalently the utilization of material is maximized. If the packing found is to be repeated, e. g., on a roll of fabric or a coil of metal, then the separation between repeats {{is going to be a}} straight line. This constraint can be relaxed by only requiring that the packing produced can be repeated without overlap. Instead of minimizing <b>strip</b> <b>length</b> one minimizes the periodicity of these repeats. We describe how to extend a previously published solution method (Egeblad, Nielsen & Odgaard 2006) for the nesting problem such that it can also handle the relaxation above. Furthermore, we examine the potential of the relaxed variant of the strip packing problem by making computational experiments on a set of benchmark instances from the garment industry. These experiments show that considerable improvements in utilization can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is studying the effect of stripping thermocouple electrical insulation on peltier surface measurement. Analytical, numerical, and experimental analyses have been performed to investigate the effect of different <b>stripped</b> <b>lengths</b> on temperature measurement of peltier surface. Two sizes of type K thermocouple, 80 μm and 200 μm, with different <b>stripped</b> <b>lengths</b> (0 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm) are used to measure different peltier surface temperature of 4 oC, 8 oC, 15 oC, 25 oC and 35 oC. During measurements thermocouple probe was {{in direct contact with}} peltier surface while the wires were extended vertically and exposed to natural convection from the external environment. Analytical results of thermocouple wire with insulation confirm that there is no specific value of the critical radius and the rate of heat flux around the thermocouple wire continuously increases with the wire diameter even though it is larger than the critical radius (or diameter). Numerical simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics software also confirms this that there is a negligible effect of the electrical insulation. Moreover, experimental results agree well with those obtained by the analytical and numerical methods and further reveal that the size of the thermocouple causes an impact on temperature measurement...|$|R

40|$|Strips of {{urinary bladder}} smooth muscle were {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} quick release measurements. Each measurement consisted of several releases and resets to the original length, made during one contraction. The complete length-force characteristic of series elasticity was quantified by estimating H, the amplitude of quick release necessary to reduce the active force to exactly zero, and Db, a measure for the deviation of the characteristic from a straight line. By measuring a series of contractions at increasing stretched strip lengths, the length dependence of these parameters was studied. It was found that H depends linearly on stretched <b>strip</b> <b>length.</b> On average H/length amounted to 0. 04. Db decreased when strips were stretched, i. e. a straight line was more closely approximated.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{architecture}} for interactive unstructured volume rendering. Our system moves all the computations necessary for order-independent transparency and volume scan conversion from the CPU to the graphics hardware, {{and it makes}} a software sorting pass unnecessary. It therefore provides the same advantages for volume data that triangle-processing hardware provides for surfaces. To address a remaining bottleneck – the bandwidth between main memory and the graphics processor – we introduce two new primitives, tetrahedral strips and tetrahedral fans. These primitives allow performance improvements in rendering tetrahedral meshes similar to the improvements triangle strips and fans allow in rendering triangle meshes. We provide new techniques for generating tetrahedral strips that achieve, on the average, <b>strip</b> <b>lengths</b> of 17 on representative datasets. The combined effect of our architecture and new primitives is a 72 to 85 times increase in performance over triangle graphics hardware approaches.

In this paper, we investigate the use of vertex caching to transparently reduce geometry bandwidth. Use of an indexed triangle strip representation permits application programs to animate the meshes at video rates, and provides backward compatibility on legacy hardware. The efficiency of vertex caching is maximized by reordering the faces in the mesh during a preprocess. We present two reordering techniques, a fast greedy strip-growing algorithm and a local optimization algorithm. The strip-growing algorithm performs lookahead simulations of the cache to adapt <b>strip</b> <b>lengths</b> to the cache capacity. The local optimization algorithm improves this initial result by exploring a set of perturbations to the face ordering.
