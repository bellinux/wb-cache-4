Psychotherapy, support groups, and life events can influence identity development; similarly, self-awareness, self-conception, and identity may evolve during treatment. It can change sexual orientation identity (private and public identification, and group belonging), emotional adjustment (<b>self-stigma</b> and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change {{of religious and}} moral belief, behavior and motivation).

50|$|A {{task force}} {{commissioned}} by the APA found that religious identity and how one outwardly identifies one's sexual orientation (see sexual orientation identity) can develop through life. Psychotherapy, support groups, and life events can influence how one identifies privately and publicly. Similarly, self-awareness, and self-conception may evolve during treatment. Some practitioners insist that improvement {{may be seen in}} emotional adjustment (<b>self-stigma</b> and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behaviour and motivation). However, such an approach to treatment is widely regarded as poorly-advised, risky and potentially damaging to the individual.|$|E
50|$|The {{internalization}} of stigmas {{may lead}} to self-prejudice which in turn can lead a person to experience negative emotional reactions, interfering with a person's quality of life. Research has shown {{a significant relationship between}} shame and avoiding treatment. A study measuring this relationship found that research participants who expressed shame from personal experiences with mental illnesses were less likely to participate in treatment. Additionally, family shame is also a predictor of avoiding treatment. Research showed that people with psychiatric diagnoses were more likely to avoid services if they believed family members would have a negative reaction to said services. Hence, public stigma can influence <b>self-stigma,</b> which has been shown to decrease treatment involvement. As such, the interaction between the two constructs impact care seeking.|$|E
40|$|Stigma is {{considered}} an important barrier to seeking mental health services. Two types of stigma exist: public stigma and <b>self-stigma.</b> Theoretically, {{it has been argued}} that public stigma leads to the development of <b>self-stigma.</b> However, the empirical support for this assertion is limited to cross-sectional data. Therefore, the goal of this research was to examine the relationship between public stigma and <b>self-stigma</b> over time. Perceptions of public and <b>self-stigma</b> were measured at Time 1 (T 1) and then again 3 months later at Time 2 (T 2). Using structural equation modeling, we conducted a cross-lag analysis of public stigma and <b>self-stigma</b> among a sample of 448 college students. Consistent with assertions that public stigma leads to the development of <b>self-stigma,</b> we found that public stigma at T 1 predicted <b>self-stigma</b> at T 2, whereas the converse was not true. These findings suggest that if <b>self-stigma</b> develops from public stigma, interventions could be developed to interrupt this process at the individual level and reduce or eliminate <b>self-stigma</b> despite perceptions of public stigma...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 32 - 39) The {{purposes of}} this study were to determine: (a) whether public stigma associated with seeking psychological help was related to <b>self-stigma</b> associated with seeking psychological help, (b) whether <b>self-stigma</b> was related to help-seeking attitudes toward psychological help, (c) whether help-seeking attitudes were related to willingness to seek psychological help, (d) whether the effect of public stigma on help-seeking attitudes was fully mediated through <b>self-stigma,</b> and (e) whether the effect of public stigma on help-seeking willingness was fully mediated through <b>self-stigma</b> and help-seeking attitudes. The current study found that public stigma was significantly and positively related to <b>self-stigma.</b> <b>Self-stigma</b> was significantly and negatively related to help-seeking attitudes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Paradoxically, insight is {{associated}} with positive outcomes, such as better treatment adherence and recovery, and negative outcomes, such as depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, and quality of life. <b>Self-stigma</b> as a moderating variable can be decisive whether more insight leads to better or worse outcome. On the other hand, <b>self-stigma</b> {{can act as a}} mediator between insight and outcomes. We therefore examined <b>self-stigma</b> both as a moderator and a mediator. METHODS: Insight, <b>self-stigma,</b> demoralization, symptoms, and functioning were assessed among 145 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using questionnaires and structured interviews. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the cross-sectional data. RESULTS: Results confirmed <b>self-stigma</b> as a moderator: The association of insight and demoralization was stronger as <b>self-stigma</b> increased. <b>Self-stigma</b> also partially mediated the positive relationship between insight and demoralization. Moreover, demoralization fully mediated the adverse associations of <b>self-stigma</b> with psychotic symptoms and global functioning. DISCUSSION: Given the decisive role of <b>self-stigma</b> regarding the detrimental consequences of insight, interventions should address <b>self-stigma,</b> particularly if psychoeducational or other interventions have increased insight. Therapeutic implications for changes of dysfunctional beliefs related to illness and self and change of self-concept in the context of recovery at the level of narrative identity are discussed.

40|$|Objective: <b>Self-stigma</b> in {{overweight}} and obese individuals has strong associations with impairment in mental and global health. This {{study sought to}} explore self-compassion as a psychological resource in the <b>self-stigma</b> process. Methods: In a 2012 representative German population survey of N = 1, 158 {{overweight and}} obese individuals, self-compassion was examined as a mediator between <b>self-stigma</b> and {{mental and physical health}} outcomes, including BMI (kg/m 2), using structural equation modeling and controlling for sociodemographic factors. Results: Psychological variables were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires. Self-compassion partially mediated the relationships between <b>self-stigma</b> and depression, somatic symptoms, and health status / quality of life, lowering the predictive effect of <b>self-stigma</b> on the outcomes by approximately one-third. In contrast, self-compassion, because it was unrelated to BMI, did not mediate the association between <b>self-stigma</b> and BMI. Conclusion: Self-compassion has the potential to act as a buffer against the mental and global health detriments of <b>self-stigma</b> in overweight and obesity and could thus represent a target for interventions to reduce <b>self-stigma</b> and prevent these health impairments. In order to influence the association between <b>self-stigma</b> and BMI, self-compassion should conceptually be linked to weight management...|$|E
40|$|<b>Self-stigma</b> {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in schizophrenia {{and can be}} seen as an important factor leading to low self-esteem. It is however unclear how psychological factors and actual adverse events contribute to <b>self-stigma.</b> This study empirically examines how symptom severity and the experience of being victimized affect both <b>self-stigma</b> and self-esteem. Persons with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (N = 102) were assessed with a battery of self-rating questionnaires and interviews. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was subsequently applied to test the fit of three models: a model with symptoms and victimization as direct predictors of <b>self-stigma</b> and negative self-esteem, a model with an indirect effect for symptoms mediated by victimization and a third model with a direct effect for negative symptoms and an indirect effect for positive symptoms mediated by victimization. Results showed good model fit for the direct effects of both symptoms and victimization: both lead to an increase of <b>self-stigma</b> and subsequent negative self-esteem. Negative symptoms had a direct association with <b>self-stigma,</b> while the relationship between positive symptoms and <b>self-stigma</b> was mediated by victimization. Our findings suggest that symptoms and victimization may contribute to <b>self-stigma,</b> leading to negative self-esteem in individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Especially for patients with positive symptoms victimization seems to be an important factor in developing <b>self-stigma.</b> Given the burden of <b>self-stigma</b> on patients and the constraining effects on societal participation and service use, interventions targeting victimization as well as <b>self-stigma</b> are needed...|$|E
40|$|Section A {{reviews the}} {{literature}} from two areas: it looks first at empirical studies exploring <b>self-stigma</b> in psychosis and secondly at psychological flexibility in psychosis. In doing so, the review aims {{to consider the}} question as to whether the psychological flexibility model, as presented by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, can help us to understand how and why <b>self-stigma</b> can have a detrimental impact on some individuals experiencing symptoms of psychosis. Section B reports on a quantitative study of <b>self-stigma,</b> psychological flexibility, psychological well-being and quality of life in a First Episode Psychosis population. Research suggests that individuals experiencing psychosis may self-stigmatise, whereby negative beliefs and stereotypes about mental health difficulties are internalised. This in turn has been found to impact negatively on a number of areas. The psychological flexibility model presented by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may help us to understand this. This study aimed to explore <b>self-stigma</b> using both an explicit and implicit measure of <b>self-stigma</b> to see how these were related to psychological flexibility, quality of life and well-being. Twenty-six participants experiencing first episode psychosis were recruited. They completed self-report questionnaires pertaining to quality of life, psychological well-being, psychological flexibility and explicit <b>self-stigma.</b> In addition, they completed a computer based reaction-time task designed to measure implicit <b>self-stigma.</b> Significant relationships were found between explicit <b>self-stigma</b> and well-being, and between psychological flexibility, explicit <b>self-stigma,</b> quality of life and well-being. Explicit <b>self-stigma</b> was found to statistically mediate the relationship between flexibility and well-being. Implicit <b>self-stigma</b> was not related to any investigated variable. The findings suggest psychological inflexibility may lead to greater <b>self-stigma,</b> which in turn decreases psychological well-being. This implied that interventions geared towards increasing flexibility may not only improve well-being, but may also help address issues of <b>self-stigma...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Few studies have {{examined}} the stigma of problem gambling and little is known about those who internalize this prejudice as damaging <b>self-stigma.</b> This paper aimed to identify psychological factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and coping mechanisms associated with the <b>self-stigma</b> of problem gambling. Methods An online survey was conducted on 177 Australian adults with a current gambling problem to measure <b>self-stigma,</b> self-esteem, social anxiety, self-consciousness, psychological distress, symptom severity, most problematic gambling form, stigma coping mechanisms, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results All variables significantly correlated with <b>self-stigma</b> were considered for inclusion in a regression model. A multivariate linear regression indicated that higher levels of <b>self-stigma</b> were associated with: being female, being older, lower self-esteem, higher problem gambling severity score, and greater use of secrecy (standardized coefficients: 0. 16, 0. 14, â 0. 33, 0. 23, and 0. 15, respectively). Strongest predictors in the model were self-esteem, followed by symptom severity score. Together, predictors in the model accounted for 38. 9 % of the variance in <b>self-stigma.</b> Discussion and conclusions These results suggest that the <b>self-stigma</b> of problem gambling may be driven by similar mechanisms as the <b>self-stigma</b> of other mental health disorders, and impact similarly on self-esteem and coping. Thus, <b>self-stigma</b> reduction initiatives used for other mental health conditions may be effective for problem gambling. In contrast, however, the <b>self-stigma</b> of problem gambling increased with female gender and older age, which are associated with gaming machine problems.

Despite evidence that high levels of <b>self-stigma</b> exist among PLHIV, and is experienced to a far greater extent than stigma received from the broader community, there is a paucity of research aimed at understanding causes and functions of <b>self-stigma,</b> and an absence of interventions to mitigate its harmful effects. Understanding the core beliefs underlying <b>self-stigma</b> is therefore essential. METHODS This pilot study used a qualitative approach to analyse interviews and written statements to uncover core beliefs underlying <b>self-stigma,</b> the functions thereof, and strategies used to overcome it, among a heterogeneous group of PLHIV in Ireland. RESULTS Core beliefs underlying HIV-related <b>self-stigma</b> were uncovered and grouped into four categories: disclosure; sexuality and sexual pleasure; self-perception; and body, illness and death. Reported functions of <b>self-stigma</b> included contributing to maintaining a "victim" status; providing protection against stigma received from others; and justifying non-disclosure of HIV status. To cope with <b>self-stigma,</b> participants highlighted: community involvement and professional development; personal development; and connection to others and sense of belonging.

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of effective means for dealing with mental health issues, the majority of high school youth do not seek needed treatment. Research has shown that {{one reason for this}} is the internalization of public stigma, or <b>self-stigma</b> (Corrigan, 2004), however the nature of this barrier to help-seeking is not well understood. This study examined two potentially related factors, which have not been studied to date, namely perceived mattering (others are interested in me) and anti-mattering (others do not care about me) to determine possible links to <b>self-stigma.</b> Self report measures of mattering, anti-mattering, and <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help were administered to Grade 12 students at three public high schools in a large metropolitan Canadian city (n = 134). A significant negative correlation was found between levels of perceived mattering and the <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help, but no significant correlation was found between levels of perceived anti-mattering and the <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help. A key finding was that gender was determined to be a significant moderator between perceived mattering and anti-mattering and the <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking psychological help, with perceived mattering predicting <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help for female students and perceived anti-mattering as a negative predictor of <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help for male students. This is the first study to explore the relationships between perceived mattering and the <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help, perceived anti-mattering and the <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking help, and the influence of gender on these relationships. This study highlights factors involved in high school students experiences of <b>self-stigma</b> of seeking psychological help, and suggests that there may be differences in the way male and female youth process feelings of whether or not they matter, and the impacts these feelings on the likelihood of them seeking help should it be needed.

Furthermore, it also discourages therapy. The aim of our study was to examine {{associations}} between <b>self-stigma</b> and adherence to treatment and discontinuation of medication in patients from various diagnostic groups. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved outpatients attending the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic. The level of <b>self-stigma</b> was measured with the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness and adherence with the Drug Attitude Inventory. The patients also anonymously filled out a demographic questionnaire which included a question asking whether they had discontinued their medication in the past. Results: We examined data from 332 patients from six basic diagnostic categories (substance abuse disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders). The study showed a statistically significant negative correlation between <b>self-stigma</b> and adherence to treatment in all diagnostic groups. <b>Self-stigma</b> correlated positively and adherence negatively with the severity of disorders. Another important factor affecting both variables was partnership. <b>Self-stigma</b> positively correlated with doses of antidepressants and adherence with doses of anxiolytics. <b>Self-stigma</b> also negatively correlated with education, and positively with a number of hospitalizations and number of psychiatrists visited. Adherence was further positively correlated with age and age of onset of disorders. Regression analysis showed that <b>self-stigma</b> was an important factor negatively influencing adherence to treatment and significantly contributing to voluntary discontinuation of drugs. The level of <b>self-stigma</b> did not differ between diagnostic categories. Patients suffering from schizophrenia had the lowest adherence to treatment. Conclusion: The study showed a significant correlation between <b>self-stigma</b> and adherence to treatment. High levels of <b>self-stigma</b> are associated with discontinuation of medications without a psychiatristâs recommendation. This connection was present in all diagnostic groups.

Method: We used qualitative data from focus groups and individual interviews with early psychosis patients to develop a pilot scale with 15 concern issues and 48 items. We recruited 40 early psychosis patients in order to validate the scale. Of these, 15 were invited to complete the questionnaire twice within two to three weeksâ time for measuring the test-retest reliability for the scale.

40|$|As {{habitual}} <b>self-stigma</b> {{can have}} a tremendous negative impact on people with mental illness, it {{is of paramount importance}} to identify its risk factors. The present study aims to examine the potential contributory role of attentional bias in habitual <b>self-stigma.</b> People with mental illness having strong (n = 47) and weak (n = 47) habitual <b>self-stigma</b> completed a computerized emotional Stroop task which included stigma-related, positive, and non-affective words as stimuli. The strong habit group was found to exhibit faster color-naming of stigma-related words (compared to non-affective words), whereas the weak habit group showed no difference in the speed of response to different stimuli. These findings suggest that people with stronger habitual <b>self-stigma</b> may be more able to ignore the semantic meaning of stigma-related words and focus on the color-naming task. Moreover, people with stronger habitual <b>self-stigma</b> may have greater attentional avoidance of stigma-related material. The present study is the first to demonstrate a specific relationship between habitual <b>self-stigma</b> and biased processing of stigma-related information.

40|$|Public and self-stigmas {{have been}} implicated as {{factors in the}} underutilization of {{individual}} counseling. However, group counseling is also underutilized, and yet scholars {{know very little about}} the role of different types of stigma on attitudes toward seeking group counseling. Therefore, the current study examined the relationships between public and <b>self-stigma</b> and attitudes toward group counseling among a sample of 491 U. S. college students. Results of structural equation modeling analyses indicated that public stigma is internalized as <b>self-stigma</b> and <b>self-stigma</b> is then negatively related to attitudes toward group counseling. Furthermore, public stigma and <b>self-stigma</b> explained 52 % of the variance in attitudes toward seeking help...|$|E
40|$|Internalized stigma (or <b>self-stigma),</b> one of {{the most}} painful effects of stigma, causes people with mental health {{problems}} profound negative consequences, for example, psychological adversity, demoralization, and feelings of hopelessness. However, knowledge about <b>self-stigma</b> in people with different mental disorders is insufficient. We hypothesized that people with different psychiatric diagnoses have different levels of <b>self-stigma.</b> Through convenience sampling, we used the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale to compare people diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 161), depressive disorder (n = 98), bipolar disorder (n = 43), and anxiety disorder (n = 45) in southern Taiwan. We found that people with schizophrenia (mean, 2. 09 - 2. 30) and those with bipolar disorder (mean, 2. 16 - 2. 38) had significantly higher levels of <b>self-stigma,</b> except for the Stigma Resistance, than did those with anxiety disorder (mean, 1. 74 - 1. 87). Our results suggest that clinicians should use different interventions to reduce <b>self-stigma</b> for populations with different psychiatric diagnoses. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} aimed at {{exploring}} {{the relationship between}} <b>self-stigma,</b> readiness for change and psychosocial treatment adherence among individuals with schizophrenia. Between March 2007 and January 2008, 105 adults with schizophrenia were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess participants' level of <b>self-stigma,</b> readiness for change, insight, and general self-efficacy. The corresponding case therapists reported participants' level of treatment adherence, psychopathology, and global functioning. Findings of stepwise multiple regression suggested that individuals with higher global functioning, better readiness for action, and lower level of <b>self-stigma</b> demonstrated better treatment participation. Individuals with lesser severity of psychiatric symptoms and female participants had better treatment attendance. The results of discriminant function analysis showed the combined score of <b>self-stigma,</b> stages of change, and global functioning measures correctly classified 76. 2 % participants into adherent/nonadherent group membership. Suggestions for further studies and development of <b>self-stigma</b> reduction program to facilitate recovery and treatment adherence were made. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Category G â Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders: no. G 17 Congress Theme: Yin and Yang of Mental Health in Asia - Balancing PolaritiesBACKGROUND: Stigma {{has been}} {{identified}} as a significant barrier to psychiatric treatment and intervention for psychosis patients. In particular, <b>self-stigma</b> significantly affects oneâs life goals and quality of life. Yet, few studies have measured the stigma of both patients and their caregivers. The present study aimed to examine (1) the relationships between perceived public stigma, <b>self-stigma,</b> and affiliate stigma; and (2) the correlates of <b>self-stigma</b> for patients presenting with first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong. METHODS: A total of 44 patients (23 males) presenting with first-episode psychosis and their caregivers were recruited. Patients were all diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. Patients completed assessments on demographics, clinical and psychological measurements, while caregivers completed assessments on affiliate stigma and perceived public stigma. RESULTS: Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationships of patientâs <b>self-stigma</b> with potential correlates. There were no significant associations between <b>self-stigma</b> and affiliate stigma. However, the perceived public stigma of patients was correlated with the perceived public stigma of caregivers (r = 0. 33, p < 0. 05). Correlation analyses revealed that loss of face (r = 0. 56, p < 0. 0001), medication attitude (r = â 0. 36, p < 0. 05), perceived public stigma (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 0001), and psychological health of quality of life (r = â 0. 31, p < 0. 05) were correlated with patientâs <b>self-stigma.</b> Multiple regression demonstrated that loss of face (odds ratio = 0. 35, p < 0. 01) and higher degree of perceived public stigma (odds ratio = 0. 46, p < 0. 01) were independently associated with the high level of patientâs <b>self-stigma.</b> CONCLUSION: In a group of Chinese young patients with first-episode psychosis and their caregivers, we found that perceived public stigma between patients and caregivers were related, but not the <b>self-stigma</b> and affiliate stigma. Loss of face and higher degree of perceived public stigma were shown to independently associate with patientâs <b>self-stigma.</b> Further research can investigate the psychosocial intervention to address these factors for the sake of minimising the development of patientâs <b>self-stigma.</b> link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective Little {{is known}} about the {{consequences}} of tobacco smoking stigma on smokers and how smokers may internalize smoking-related stigma. This review summarizes existing literature on tobacco smoking <b>self-stigma,</b> investigating to what extent smokers are aware of negative stereotypes, agree with them and apply them to themselves. Methods We carried out a systematic search of Pubmed/Web of Science/PsycInfo databases for articles related to smoking <b>self-stigma</b> through June 2013. Reference lists and citations of included studies were also checked and experts were contacted. After screening articles for inclusion/exclusion criteria we performed a quality assessment and summarized findings according to the stages of <b>self-stigma</b> as conceptualized in Corrigan's progressive model of <b>self-stigma</b> (aware, agree, apply and harm). Initial searches yielded 570 articles. Results Thirty of these articles (18 qualitative and 12 quantitative studies) met criteria for our review. Awareness of smoking stigma was virtually universal across studies. Coping strategies for smoking stigma {{and the degree to which}} individuals who smoke internalized this stigma varied both within and across studies. There was considerable variation in positive, negative, and non-significant consequences associated with smoking <b>self-stigma.</b> Limited evidence was found for subgroup differences in smoking-related stigma. Conclusion While there is some evidence that smoking <b>self-stigma</b> leads to reductions in smoking, this review also identified significant negative consequences of smoking <b>self-stigma.</b> Future research should assess the factors related to differences in how individuals respond to smoking stigma. Public health strategies which limit the stigmatization of smokers may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships between traditional Western masculine norms, <b>self-stigma,</b> and attitudes toward counseling among 4, 748 men from different community sizes, and different education and income levels. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses suggest that, across all male subgroups, masculine norms were linked to <b>self-stigma</b> and, in turn, attitudes toward counseling. However, several clear differences in {{the strengths of the}} relationships between model variables were found, including a relationship between masculine norms and <b>self-stigma</b> that was twice as strong for rural men than for other men. The importance of attending to the varying relationships among masculine norm conformity, <b>self-stigma,</b> and help-seeking attitudes for men from these diverse demographic backgroundsâin the context of clinical practice, prevention, and future researchâis discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that people with first-episode psychosis who are more mindful will have lower <b>self-stigma,</b> and hence better social functioning. Thirty-four participants experiencing first-episode psychosis completed self-report questionnaires, in a cross-sectional design. Consistent with the hypothesis, higher levels of mindfulness predicted lower <b>self-stigma</b> and better social functioning, and <b>self-stigma</b> statistically mediated the mindfulness â social functioning relationship. However, contrary to expectations, when symptom severity was included as a covariate, evidence of mediation was lost. Limitations and implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{apply the}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) {{and the two}} {{additional}} concepts <b>self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers to the help-seeking behavior for sexual problems in women with epilepsy. Methods In this 18 -month follow-up study, TPB elements, including attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention along with <b>self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers in seeking help for sexual problems were assessed in nÂ =Â  818 women with epilepsy (94. 0 % aged â¤Â  40 Â years). The basic TPB model (model 1) and the TPB model additionally including <b>self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers (Model 2) were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results Both SEM models showed satisfactory model fits. According to model, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention explained 63. 1 % {{of the variance in}} help-seeking behavior. Variance was slightly higher (64. 5 %) when including <b>self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers (model 2). In addition, the fit indices of the models were better highlighting the importance of <b>self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers in help-seeking behavior for sexual problems. Conclusion Theory of Planned Behavior is useful in explaining help-seeking behavior for sexual problems in women with epilepsy. <b>Self-stigma</b> and perceived barriers are additional factors that should be considered in future interventions aiming to adopt TPB to improve help-seeking behavior for sexual problems.

40|$|Research {{evidence}} suggests that individuals with schizophrenia are prone to self-stigmatization, which reduces their psychosocial treatment adherence. A <b>self-stigma</b> reduction program was developed based on a theoretical framework proposed by our team. The effectiveness of such program to reduce <b>self-stigma,</b> enhance readiness for change, and promote adherent behaviors among individuals with schizophrenia was investigated. This program consisted of 12 group and four individual follow-up sessions. An integrative approach including psychoeductaion, cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, social skills training, and goal attainment program was adopted. Sixty-six self-stigmatized individuals with schizophrenia were recruited. They were randomly allocated to the <b>self-stigma</b> reduction program (N= 34; experimental protocol) or the newspaper reading group (N= 32; comparison protocol). Measures on participants' level of <b>self-stigma,</b> readiness for change, insight, general self-efficacy, and treatment adherence were taken for six assessment intervals. The findings suggested that the <b>self-stigma</b> reduction program has potential to reduce self-esteem decrement, promote readiness for changing own problematic behaviors, and enhance psychosocial treatment adherence among the self-stigmatized individuals with schizophrenia during the active interventional stage. However, {{there was a lack}} of therapeutic maintenance effects the 6 -month follow-up period. Recommendations for further improving the effectiveneduringss of <b>self-stigma</b> reduction program are suggested. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
