40|$|The term extractives defines {{chemical}} compounds of different classes {{that can be}} extracted from wood or bark by means of polar or non-polar solvents. Extractives are derived mostly from the metabolic processes of the tree, particularly the sapwood to heartwood transformation. The first objective of the research was to study the distribution of extractives within Sitka spruce trees at different heights in the trunk, {{as well as the}} distribution between bark, rootwood, knotwood, heartwood and sapwood. The second aim of the work was to learn about the influence of yield class, site elevation, North/East location and thinning on the extractives content and composition of Sitka spruce across Scotland. The samples were sawdust obtained in different ways from either discs, knots or roots sawn from Sitka spruce trees freshly cut in the forest, or collected during the coring of trees from 64 sites all around Scotland and northern England. The extraction was carried out on <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extractors</b> using acetone as solvent. Two analytical techniques were used: gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results of the research showed that the extractive content and composition of Sitka spruce differed according to the type of wood studied with the largest amount detected in bark and the lowest in heartwood and sapwood. The last two types of wood were studied in more detail, showing that the difference in extractive content between heartwood and sapwood was consistent at all heights in the trunk. The chromatographic analysis of heartwood, sapwood, knotwood, rootwood and bark showed that their compositions differed slightly from published data on Norway spruce.

40|$|Within {{the entire}} complex {{procedure}} required to measure dioxins and related compounds in biological matrices, the extraction step {{is often seen}} as a well controlled step. Although maybe true for many human and food-related matrices, the situation is very different for animal feed and feed ingredients. Specific European guidelines (e. g. Commission Directive 2006 / 13 /EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009) exist for animal feed but only list general requirements for the various stages of the procedure. The liberty is left to laboratories to select, for example, the tools used for the extraction steps. This has the advantage to allow ‘in-house’ methods to be used, {{as long as they}} satisfy with all the requirements of the EU Regulation. In that context, it is foreseen that the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) will soon propose a standard for the determination of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in animal feed that would be the reference method to be used to solve potential issues in case of dispute over results reported from different laboratories. A major point of concern is that it has been reported earlier 1 that most commonly accepted extraction procedure can conduct to significantly different results for the extraction of dioxins and related compounds in feed and feed additives such as mineral clays and various oxides. Several non-instrumental and instrumental automated approaches are available for extraction. <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>extractors</b> have long been the most used tools for non-instrumental extraction of solids. They have proven to be very efficient but some limitations encouraged the development of other approaches based on instrumental techniques. For feed extraction, pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) (also branded as accelerated solvent extraction ASE®) is the technique of choice for high sample throughput. This study reports on the investigation of the use of various solvent mixtures, extraction temperatures, and instruments (parallel PLE, sequential ASE®) for the extraction of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dioxin-like PCBs in mineral clay, bovine feed, fish meal, and in-house quality control animal compound feed.

The nature of the flocs formation for all the plant extracts were observed to be smoky rather than aggregating into denser masses and resulted in turbidity and colour removal efficiencies of 0. 71 - 18. 57 % and 1. 17 - 22. 38 % respectively. The coagulation activities were subjected to T-Test Analysis and it indicated that there was statistically (P< 0. 05) significance difference at different concentrations. The results also revealed slight decrease in pH in the range of 8. 1 - 7. 55 exhibited by all the extracts. From the results of the turbidity and colour removal efficiencies, it can be concluded that these plant materials have the potential of improving the quality of pond or surface water (which most rural communities in developing countries depend for many purposes) that are heavily turbid; However, for them to perform effectively, a coagulant aid is required...|$|R
