With <b>superheated</b> <b>steam,</b> {{there is}} no direct {{relationship}} between temperature and pressure, Therefore, at a particular pressure it is possible for <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> to exist at a wide range of temperatures higher than that of its saturated steam. The heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of saturated steam during heat transferring, and it takes a relatively long time to cool, during which time the steam is releasing very little energy and transmitted long distances. The mechanisms of <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> stimulation are mainly pointed to the performance of crude oil viscosity reduced, flow environment improved, rock wettability changed, oil displacement efficiency improved. Physical simulation shows that oil displacement efficiency by <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> is 6 - 12 % higher than that of saturated steam at the same temperature, and under the condition of carrying the same heat, <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil steam ratio increased by 0. 7. <b>Superheated</b> <b>steam</b> stimulation was put into Kazakstan’s heavy oil reservoir after two cycles of saturated steam stimulation.

Two furnishes were investigated, thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and a TMP/kraft pulp blend. Drying of handsheets under matched conditions in air {{was used as the}} basis of comparison. TMP paper dried in <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> has a slightly higher surface roughness, by about 0. 5 $ mu$m at a roughness around 8 $ mu$m. This difference decreases with drying fluid temperature. It is also reduced by about half after a very light blade coating. Surface roughness of paper from 50 / 50 TMP/kraft blend is unaffected. <b>Superheated</b> <b>steam</b> drying reduces substantially the linting propensity of TMP paper, by about 30 %- 60 % depending on the criteria used. Improved lignin softening by higher web temperature from the beginning of drying in <b>superheated</b> <b>steam</b> drying is believed an important mechanism in improving bonding of surface fines and short fibre fragments.

Irreversible shrinkage was reduced by up to 30 % for sheets dried in <b>superheated</b> <b>steam.</b> However, these effects on hygroexpansivity were caused mainly by the high drying temperature and the resulting high drying rate regardless of the drying fluid.
