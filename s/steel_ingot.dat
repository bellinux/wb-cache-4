40|$|Abstract. Through {{establishing}} solidification-heat transfer {{mathematical model}} of the super heavy <b>steel</b> <b>ingot,</b> the temperature distribution at different moments in the solidification process of <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> has been simulated. Based on the simulated temperature field and the law of solute redistribution, the carbon macrosegregation in the solidification process has been calculated. The results show that, the complete solidification time of the 600 T <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> is 68. 34 hours, and positive segregation of carbon forms in the ingot head, and the concentration of carbon near the upper axis which is higher than 81 percent of the ingot’s height is over 2 times than the average value...|$|E

40|$|Central {{shrinkage}} crack {{is a common}} defect encountered in <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> casting. It is necessary to limit the degree of crack in case of further propagation in forging.

Then, thermo-mechanical simulation using an elasto-viscoplastic finite-element model was conducted to analyze the stress-strain evolution during ingot solidification. A new criterion considering mush mechanical property in the brittle temperature range as well as shrinkage porosity was used to identify the shrinkage crack potential, where the degree of shrinkage porosity is regarded as a probability factor using a modified sigmoid function. Different casting processes, such as pouring speed, mould preheating and riser insulation, were optimized with the simulation model.
