50|$|Pityopsis graminifolia is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family known by the common name narrowleaf <b>silkgrass.</b> It is native to the southeastern United States, occurring {{as far north as}} Ohio and Maryland.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} asters, the Maryland golden-aster has broader leaves and larger flowers. Because of its silky stems, the Maryland golden-asters are {{also known as}} <b>silkgrass.</b> Like its {{relatives}} the Prairie golden-aster and the Grass-leaved golden-aster, the Maryland golden-aster blooms only from August to October. The Maryland golden-aster grows one to two feet tall.|$|E

The shrub layer may be well-developed, with hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), or other acid-tolerant species most characteristic. Herbs are usually sparse but may include narrowleaf <b>silkgrass</b> (Pityopsis graminifolia) and goat-rue (Tephrosia virginiana).|$|E

50|$|Southern Appalachian low-elevation {{pine forests}} occur {{on a variety}} of {{topographic}} and landscape positions, including ridgetops, upper- and mid-slopes, and in lower elevations (generally below 2300 ft) such as mountain valleys. These forests dominated by shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana).Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) may sometimes be present. Hardwoods are sometimes abundant, especially dry-site oaks such as southern red oak (Quercus falcata), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), but also pignut hickory (Carya glabra), red maple (Acer rubrum), and others.

50|$|Factors {{such as the}} patchiness of {{vegetation}} and species composition of the ground layer may affect habitat suitability by influencing foraging success {{and the availability of}} food and nesting material. In Georgia, Bachman's sparrows did not occur in open areas with uniformly dense herbaceous vegetation, despite these sites having a similar volume {{of vegetation}} â‰¤3 feet (1 m) above ground as recently burned pineland sites that were occupied by Bachman's sparrow. Although measurements were not taken, observations of Bachman's sparrow in clearcuts in eastern Texas suggest they may favor tall grass in clumpy rather that uniform distribution. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, explanations suggested for a lack of evidence of ground layer features influencing selection of breeding territories included importance of habitat characteristics that were not measured, such as patchiness of the herbaceous layer and species composition. In a predominantly longleaf pine forest in Georgia, Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p=0.04) more abundant in areas where ground cover was primarily Beyrich threeawn (Aristida beyrichiana), compared to relatively disturbed communities of bluestems (Andropogon spp.) and <b>silkgrass</b> (Pityopsis spp.).|$|E
30|$|Contrary to the {{predictions}} of the disturbance sensitivity hypothesis, I {{found no evidence that}} repeated fires negatively affected forest indicative herbs at the sites studied here. In fact, the forest indicator openflower rosette grass increased in response to fire between 2009 and 2013. Matlack (2013), who criticized the use of fire in mesic deciduous forests (within which he includes mixed oak-pine forests of the southern Appalachians, and the eastern interior Coastal Plain), argued that most forest plant species lack the adaptations to fire (e.g., smoke-cued germination, resprouting from rhizomes) necessary to respond positively to fires. It is possible that the sites studied here occurred on soils that were not as moist or fertile as those envisioned by Matlack and therefore lacked many of the forest specialists that would have responded negatively to frequent fires. If true, the disturbance sensitivity hypothesis may need to be refined and restricted to more mesic ecosystems (e.g., mesic floodplain terraces and steep ravines). Groundcover herbs in the forests studied here were tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity surface fires, perhaps because many species were perennials with rhizomes, deep taproots, or belowground bud or seed banks that were protected from damage by such fires (e.g., Helianthus spp., Desmodium spp., Lespedeza spp., Dichanthelium spp.). It may not be true that oak-dominated forests lack fire-adapted herbs. Narrowleaf <b>silkgrass</b> (Pityopsis graminifolia [Michx.] Nutt] is associated with oak and oak-pine forests of the interior Coastal Plain and Highlands of the southern US and occurred at the sites studied here. I previously showed that this species exhibited increased flowering in response to fires or simulated fires during the peak season of coincidentally high lightning frequency and extended rain-free intervals (mid- to late summer, early fall; Brewer 2009).|$|E
