25|$|The town grew {{strongly}} in the 19th century. In 1801 the population was 3,095. By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. <b>Such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> demanded a railway connection but the town had to wait {{a long time for}} one. The London and Birmingham Railway (L) had been built through Tring in 1838, and the Great Northern Railway was built through Hitchin in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L at Leighton Buzzard was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, construction terminated at Dunstable in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to Bute Street Station, and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858. The line was later extended to Welwyn and from 1860 direct trains to King's Cross ran. The Midland Railway was extended from Bedford to St Pancras through Leagrave and Midland Road station and opened on 9 September 1867.|$|E

Birmingham experienced <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> that it was called the [...] "Magic City". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the state's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.|$|E

More than any other religious group in the state, it embodied {{the ideal of the}} “beloved community” that Martin Luther King, Jr., articulated as the ultimate goal of the civil rights movement: the vision, rooted in Christian millennial expectation, of a spiritualized polity characterized by justice, love, and the “total interrelatedness” of all people." [...] The progress was worked [...] "At the midpoint of the traumatic first year of mandatory statewide school desegregation in South Carolina, as disenchantment with the civil rights movement set in among many Blacks and Whites around the country and the competing rhetorics of Black power and White conservatism dominated the national political discourse, the teams of young Bahá’ís taught that God had sent a new Messenger to unite the human race." [...] "Almost overnight, the Bahá’í Faith in South Carolina had gone from a tiny community in a handful of localities to a mass movement with members in every county. In 1970, there were eight Local Spiritual Assemblies in South Carolina; the next year, after the winter project, there were 108, more than any other state in the country. By the middle of 1972, some 20,000 people—mostly African Americans, but hundreds of Native Americans and European Americans as well—had become Bahá’ís in South Carolina.… [...] fully one-third of the national community resided in South Carolina." [...] However [...] "Their small numbers," [...] he continues, [...] "severely limited the ability of the Bahá’ís in South Carolina and elsewhere to promote the wholesale transformation of society anticipated in their sacred scriptures, and for which enlightened contemporary leaders like King were increasingly calling." [...] "Teachers on the ground in South Carolina, however, were already {{coming to terms with the}} difficulties of sustaining <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth.</b> Reinforced by a stream of home-front pioneers and traveling teachers—many of them young adults and new Bahá’ís themselves— they set about the difficult business of establishing Bahá’í community structures and practices in dozens of localities scattered across the state." ...|$|E
60|$|At last we {{anchored}} within Sydney Cove. We {{found the}} little basin occupied by many large ships, {{and surrounded by}} warehouses. In the evening I walked through the town, and returned full of admiration at the whole scene. It is a most magnificent testimony {{to the power of}} the British nation. Here, in a less promising country, scores of years have done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have effected in South America. My first feeling was to congratulate myself that I was born an Englishman. Upon seeing more of the town afterwards, perhaps my admiration fell a little; but yet it is a fine town. The streets are regular, broad, clean, and kept in excellent order; the houses are of a good size, and the shops well furnished. It may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from London and a few other great towns in England; but not even near London or Birmingham is there an appearance of <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth.</b> The number of large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising; nevertheless, every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in procuring a house. Coming from South America, where in the towns every man of property is known, no one thing surprised me more than not being able to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged.|$|E

China is {{fortunate}} to have sustained <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> economic <b>growth</b> over <b>such</b> a long period, {{but it does not}} take a genius to realize that it will not last forever. The only questions are when will it end, what form will the economy assume when it ends, and what will the repercussions be?

50|$|After September 11, the {{insurance}} market hardened. This {{led to a}} period of rapid growth for risk retention groups. Between 2000 and 2008 the number of RRGs quadrupled to reach 262. Besides the hard insurance market, {{a number of other}} factors led to <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> in the industry. Captive insurance really came into its own during the early 2000s with more and more states enacting captive laws and seeking alternative risk transfer vehicles as a steady source of revenue. Many states, including the District of Columbia and Montana, began to develop their captive programs, creating captive departments, and courting potential groups.|$|E

50|$|<b>Such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> (due {{partially}} to speculation) was unsustainable, however. The market contracted in the mid-1990s, {{leading to}} the closure of many Direct Market shops. Diamond and Capital City began closing local warehouses, moving from a decentralized model in which many local warehouses provided full service to a given area to a centralized one with a few shipping hubs and no local walk-in service at all. In 1994, Capital City created controversy by announcing penalties for publishers who didn't deliver their products within promised deadlines; this move followed an industry-wide push for 30-day returnability, a practice formerly in use when comics were primarily distributed in newsstands.|$|E

30|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} BBDF provides a reliable option {{as a substitute}} for oil-based drilling fluids due to the continuous increase of the global biodiesel production.
