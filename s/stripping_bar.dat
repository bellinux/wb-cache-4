50|$|Cold rolling {{occurs with}} the metal below its {{recrystallization}} temperature (usually at room temperature), {{which increases the}} strength via strain hardening up to 20%. It also improves the surface finish and holds tighter tolerances. Commonly cold-rolled products include sheets, <b>strips,</b> <b>bars,</b> and rods; these products are usually smaller than the same products that are hot rolled. Because of the smaller size of the workpieces and their greater strength, as compared to hot rolled stock, four-high or cluster mills are used. Cold rolling cannot reduce the thickness of a workpiece as much as hot rolling in a single pass.|$|R

40|$|The term Reinforced Earth is {{referred}} to as strengthening the soil by inclusion of artificial reinforcement elements, in the form of <b>strips,</b> <b>bars,</b> grids, or sheets fabricated or manufactured from metals or geosynthetics. The reinforcement restrains the tensile deformations of the soil and thus increases the overall performance of the composite soil through interfacial bond resistance, but limited by its own tensile strength. Some of the numerous applications of reinforced earth or soil structures include retaining walls, embankments, subgrades beneath the pavements, etc. Owing to the flexibility of reinforced structures, they can withstand large displacements and are found to perform better under seismic conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Some comedy {{clubs and}} <b>strip</b> <b>bars</b> may allow patrons to enter without paying a fee, with the {{implicit}} or explicit {{expectation that the}} customers will buy alcoholic beverages while inside. Some bars with [...] "no cover charge" [...] policies may have higher prices for their snacks and beer {{to make up for}} the lack of a cover charge. Many nightclubs oriented towards electronic dance music have a cover charge, in some cases because many of their patrons are not drinking alcohol due to use of other drugs such as MDMA. Bottles of water are also often priced at up to $10 to offset the loss of revenue from reduced sales of alcohol.|$|R
