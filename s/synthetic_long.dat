50|$|A risk {{reversal}} is {{a position}} which simulates {{profit and loss}} behavior of owning an underlying security; therefore it is sometimes called a <b>synthetic</b> <b>long.</b> This is an investment strategy that amounts to both buying and selling out-of-money options simultaneously. In this strategy, the investor will first make a market hunch; if that hunch is bullish he will want to go long. However, instead of going long on the stock, he will buy an {{out of the money}} call option, and simultaneously sell an out of the money put option. Presumably he will use the money from the sale of the put option to purchase the call option. Then as the stock goes up in price, the call option will be worth more, and the put option will be worth less.|$|E

Therefore, there is a pressing demand for improvements of existing vaccines with particular reference to higher efficacy and undisputed safety profiles. To this effect, as an alternative to available vaccine technologies, there has been a drive to develop vaccine candidate polypeptides by chemical synthesis. In our laboratory, we have recently developed a technology to manufacture <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> peptides of up to 130 residues, which are correctly folded and biologically active.

5000|$|Methadone {{has been}} used for opioid {{dependence}} since 1964, and studied the most of the pharmacological treatment options. It is a <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> acting opioid, so it can replace multiple heroin uses by being taken once daily. It works by binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, activating them, reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings while suppressing the [...] "high" [...] that other opioids can elicit. The decrease in withdrawal symptoms and cravings allow the user to slowly taper off the drug in a controlled manner, decreasing the likelihood of relapse. It is not accessible to all addicts. It is a regulated substance, and requires that each dose be picked up from a methadone clinic daily. This can be inconvenient as some patients are unable to travel to a clinic, or avoid the stigma associated with drug addiction.|$|E
50|$|Sequencing and epitope {{prediction}} algorithms identified neoantigens in mouse tumors that {{functioned as}} tumor-specific T cell targets. Neoantigens were recognized by T cells in melanoma patients and were likely the {{major contributor to}} positive clinical effects of adoptive cell transfer. Mouse models established that neoantigens were the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade therapy and that <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides comprising these neoantigens were effective when administered as vaccines with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs. Cancers with higher mutation burdens, and an associated likelihood of expressing neoantigens, appear most likely to respond to checkpoint therapy. In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response. Increased PD ligand 2 (PD-L2) transcript expression and an immune “cytolytic” gene signature also correlated with neoantigen load and tumor response. CTLA-4 expression was a response indicator, which along with PD-L2 were likely expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. An inflamed TME prior to treatment is also associated with response.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{over-the-counter}} {{film has}} long been used for astrophotography. Film exposures range from 10 minutes to over an hour. Commercially available color film stock is subject to reciprocal failure over long exposures, in which sensitivity to light of different wavelengths appears to drop off as the exposure time increases, leading to color shift in the image. This is compensated for by using the same technique used in professional astronomy of taking photographs at different wavelengths that are then combined to create a correct color image. Since film is much slower than digital sensors, tiny errors in tracking can be corrected without much noticeable effect on the final image. Film astrophotography is becoming less popular due to the low cost of digital photography.Since the late 1990s amateurs have been following the professional observatories in the switch from film to digital CCDs for astronomical imaging. CCDs are more sensitive than film, allowing much shorter exposure times, and have a linear response to light. Images can be captured in many short exposures to create a <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> exposure. Digital cameras also have minimal or no moving parts {{and the ability to}} be operated remotely via an infrared remote or computer tethering, limiting vibration. Simple digital devices such as webcams can be modified to allow access to the focal plane and even (after the cutting of a few wires), for long exposure photography. Digital video cameras are also used. There are many techniques and pieces of commercially manufactured equipment for attaching digital single lens reflex(DSLR) cameras and even basic point and shoot cameras to telescopes. Consumer level digital cameras suffer from image noise over long exposures, so there are many techniques for cooling the camera, including cryogenic cooling. Astronomical equipment companies also now offer a wide range of purpose-built astronomical CCD cameras complete with hardware and processing software. Many commercially available DSLR cameras have the ability to take long time exposures combined with sequential (time-lapse) images allowing the photographer to create a motion picture of the night sky.|$|E

In 18 / 18 evaluable patients, vaccination induced antigen-specific CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T-cell and antibody responses, starting early after initiation of immunotherapy and lasting at least one year. The T-cells responded antigen-specifically, with strong secretion of IFNγ and TNFα, irrespective of patients' HLAs. The most immunogenic regions of the vaccine peptide were NY-ESO- 189 - 102 for CD 8 (+) and NY-ESO- 183 - 99 for CD 4 (+) T-cells. We discovered a novel and highly immunogenic epitope (HLA-DR 7 /NY-ESO- 187 - 99); 7 / 7 HLA-DR 7 (+) patients generated strong CD 4 (+) T-cell responses, as detected directly ex vivo with fluorescent multimers. Thus, vaccination with the <b>long</b> <b>synthetic</b> NY-ESO- 179 - 108 peptide combined with the strong immune adjuvant CpG-B induced integrated, robust and functional CD 8 (+) and CD 4 (+) T-cell responses in melanoma patients, supporting the further development of this immunotherapeutic approach...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{recently}} developed a HIVconsv vaccine strategy, consisting of combined conserved regions of HIV- 1, to adequately cover viral diversity. To evaluate efficacy in nonhuman primates, an equivalent SIV-derived immunogen SIVconsv {{was designed and}} delivered as plasmid DNA or <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides. DESIGN: Rhesus macaques lacking protective MHC class I alleles Mamu-A* 001  :  01, B* 008  :  01, B* 017  :  01 were immunized with either SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides (S) alone or in combination with plasmid DNA encoding the same conserved regions (D) using SSS or DDSS regimens. METHODS: The SIVconsv <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptide vaccine consisted of 46 approximately 30 -amino acid-long peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA- 720 and adjuvanted with pegylated type I interferon and imiquimod. RESULTS: Both SSS and DDSS regimens generated high frequencies of SIV-specific IFN-γ-producing cells comparable with reported adenoviral vector systems. Strong polyfunctional CD 4 ⁺ T-cell and modest CD 8 ⁺ T-cell responses were generated, which were of central memory T-cell phenotype. Furthermore, SIVconsv-specific antibody responses were induced capable of recognizing the Env glycoprotein. Eight weeks after the last immunization, control and SIVconsv-vaccinated animals were challenged intrarectally with 10 MID 50 of pathogenic SIVmac 251. Two out of six animals in the DDSS group were protected against infection, while all 14 animals in the SSS and two control groups were infected. Vaccine induced SIV-specific IgG responses in mucosal washes prechallenge were highest in the two protected animals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that vaccine-elicited responses towards conserved regions can afford partial protection against a high-dose intrarectal SIVmac 251 challenge...|$|E

40|$|A novel T-cell vaccine {{strategy}} {{designed to}} deal with the enormity of HIV- 1 variation is described and tested {{for the first time in}} macaques to inform and complement approaching clinical trials. T-cell immunogen HIVconsv, which directs vaccine-induced responses to the most conserved regions of the HIV- 1, proteome and thus both targets diverse clades in the population and reduces the chance of escape in infected individuals, was delivered using six different vaccine modalities: plasmid DNA (D), attenuated human (A) and chimpanzee (C) adenoviruses, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (M), <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides, and Semliki Forest virus replicons. We confirmed that the initial DDDAM regimen, which mimics one of the clinical schedules (DDDCM), is highly immunogenic in macaques. Furthermore, adjuvanted <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides divided into sub-pools and delivered into anatomically separate sites induced T-cell responses that were markedly broader than those elicited by traditional single-open-reading-frame genetic vaccines and increased by 30 % the overall response magnitude compared with DDDAM. Thus, by improving both the HIV- 1 -derived immunogen and vector regimen/delivery, this approach could induce stronger, broader, and theoretically more protective T-cell responses than vaccines previously used in humans...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LC) are {{professional}} antigen presenting cells (APCs) that initiate humoral {{and cellular}} immune responses. Targeted delivery of antigen towards DC- or LC-specific receptors enhances vaccine efficacy. In this study, {{we compared the}} efficiency of glycan-based antigen targeting to both the human DC-specific C-type lectin receptor (CLR) DC-SIGN and the LC-specific CLR langerin. Since DC-SIGN and langerin are able to recognize the difucosylated oligosaccharide Lewis Y (LeY), we prepared neoglycoconjugates bearing this glycan epitope to allow targeting of both lectins. LeY-modified liposomes, with an approximate diameter of 200 nm, were significantly endocytosed by DC-SIGN+ DCs and mediated efficient antigen presentation to CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Surprisingly, although langerin bound to LeY-modified liposomes, LCs exposed to LeY-modified liposomes could not endocytose liposomes nor mediate antigen presentation to T cells. However, LCs mediated an enhanced cross-presentation when antigen was delivered through langerin using LeY-modified <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides. In contrast, LeY-modified <b>synthetic</b> <b>long</b> peptides were recognized by DC-SIGN, but did not trigger antigen internalization nor antigen cross-presentation. These data demonstrate that langerin and DC-SIGN have different size requirements for antigen uptake. Although using glycans remains an interesting option {{in the design of}} anti-cancer vaccines targeting multiple CLRs, aspects such as molecule size and conformation need to be taken in consideration...|$|E
