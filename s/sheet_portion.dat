40|$|Successful {{prediction}} of protein folding from an {{amino acid sequence}} is a challenge in computational biology. In order to reveal the geometric constraints that drive protein folding, highlight those constraints kept or missed by distinct lattices and for establishing which class of intra- and inter-secondary structure element interactions is the most relevant for the correct folding of proteins, we have calculated inter-alpha carbon distances {{in a set of}} 42 crystal structures consisting of mainly helix, sheet or mixed conformations. The inter-alpha carbon distances were also calculated in several lattice "hydrophobic-polar" models built from the same protein set. We found that helix structures are more prone to form "hydrophobic-hydrophobic" contacts than beta-sheet structures. At a distance lower than or equal to 3. 8 Å (very short-range interactions), "hydrophobic-hydrophobic" contacts are almost absent in the native structures, while they are frequent in all the analyzed lattice models. At distances in-between 3. 8 and 9. 5 Å (short-/medium-range interactions), the best performing lattice for reproducing mainly helix structures is the body-centered-cubic lattice. If protein structures contain <b>sheet</b> <b>portions,</b> lattice performances get worse, with few exceptions observed for double-tetrahedral and body-centered-cubic lattices. Finally, we can observe that ab initio protein folding algorithms, i. e. those based on the employment of lattices and Monte Carlo simulated annealings, can be improved simply and effectively by preventing the generation of "hydrophobic-hydrophobic" contacts shorter than 3. 8 Å, by monitoring the "hydrophobic-hydrophobic/polar-polar" contact ratio in short-/medium distance ranges and by using preferentially a body-centered-cubic lattice...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} conversion in a methanol reactor is restricted by equilibrium, therefore the synthesis loop is operated at high pressure and unconverted gas is recycled. Such a synthesis loop consumes {{large amounts of}} compression work. In this paper a new flow sheet for methanol synthesis is presented. In this flow sheet the high recycle and operating pressure of the reactor is exploited to produce power. A turbine expander and compressor pair {{is placed in the}} recycle stream and utilises the reactor heat at the maximum possible temperature in a process gas power cycle. In conventional systems the reaction heat is often transferred to generate steam to drive steam turbines, but the heat is reduced in quality due to the temperature-driving forces in the heat exchange equipment. Simulation models of the new flow sheet and a conventional flow sheet are created to compare the systems based on energy consumed per kg methanol produced. In the conventional flow sheet the reaction heat is used to generate steam for use in steam turbines. In the new flow <b>sheet</b> a <b>portion</b> of the reaction heat is still transferred to a steam cycle to limit the temperature in the reactor.

Previous studies considered idealized geometries of continental scale to investigate parameters related to the surging phenomena (cf., Horstemeyer & Gullett, 2003). These continental scale simulations of the Laurentide Ice Sheet provide boundary conditions for our local scale fi nite element simulations to allow us to examine effects of varying precipitation rates on the larger ice sheet. To further the work of Horstemeyer and Gullett, we performed three dimensional simulations, added a deformable basal till layer, and modifi ed the problem domain from a generic dome to a slab representing the front edge of the Des Moines Ice Lobe. These three dimensional simulation results illustrate clear surging lobing effects that have been observed in nature...|$|R
40|$|Clearing {{of native}} woody {{vegetation}} in the New South Wales northern wheatbelt was mapped {{for the period}} 1985 – 2000. The study area comprises the Moree 1 : 250, 000 scale map <b>sheet</b> and <b>portions</b> of adjacent map sheets. Unpublished draft mapping of native woody vegetation types, based on 1985 aerial photography and a large set of floristic data from field surveys, {{was used as a}} baseline for this study. Mapping of clearing was carried out by intensive visual interpretation of Landsat TM satellite imagery. Systematic validation, which compared the satellite interpretation to low-level aerial photography at randomly allocated point locations, showed that the method was highly accurate in detecting vegetation clearing including in the open woodlands and shrublands that characterise much of the study area. Comparisons with previously published mapping of statewide clearing patterns, based on an automated classification of Landsat TM imagery, showed that our intensive visual interpretation detected substantially more clearing. Average annual clearing rates were 8 times higher that those derived from the previous mapping. Results of the study show that substantial clearing of native woody vegetation is continuing in the northern wheatbelt. Over 110, 000 ha of native woody vegetation were cleared between 1985 and 2000. Clearing rates were highest in the four year monitoring period that preceded the introduction of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act. The subsequent two year monitoring period saw substantially lower clearing rates, though further monitoring is needed to determine if this trend will continue. An analysis of spatial patterns highlighted continued high rates of loss in the most depleted parts of the study area.

The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the venusian atmosphere relative to Earth's also indicates that the atmosphere has undergone significantly different evolution {{over the age of}} the Solar System(1). Present-day thermal escape is low for all atmospheric species. However, hydrogen can escape by means of collisions with hot atoms from ionospheric photochemistry(2), and although the bulk of O and O- 2 are gravitationally bound, heavy ions have been observed to escape(3) through interaction with the solar wind. Nevertheless, their relative rates of escape, spatial distribution, and composition could not be determined from these previous measurements. Here we report Venus Express measurements showing that the dominant escaping ions are O+, He+ and H+. The escaping ions leave Venus through the plasma <b>sheet</b> (a central <b>portion</b> of the plasma wake) and in a boundary layer of the induced magnetosphere. The escape rate ratios are Q(H+) /Q(O+) = 1. 9; Q(He+) /Q(O+) = 0. 07.

40|$|Meniscus-defined {{techniques}} {{for the growth}} of thin silicon sheets fall into two categories: vertical and horizontal growth. The interactions of the temperature field and the crystal shape are analyzed for both methods using two-dimensional finite-element models which include heat transfer and capillarity. Heat transfer in vertical growth systems is dominated by conduction in the melt and the crystal, with almost flat melt/crystal interfaces that are perpendicular to the direction of growth. The high axial temperature gradients characteristic of vertical growth lead to high thermal stresses. The maximum growth rate is also limited by capillarity which can restrict the conduction of heat from the melt into the crystal. In horizontal growth the melt/crystal interface stretches {{across the surface of the}} melt pool many times the crystal thickness, and low growth rates are achievable with careful temperature control. With a moderate axial temperature gradient in the <b>sheet</b> a substantial <b>portion</b> of the latent heat conducts along the sheet and the surface of the melt pool becomes supercooled, leading to dendritic growth.

Various systems differing in the customized β-sheet breaker structure have been studied. Specifically we have considered three kinds of β-sheet breakers, namely Ac-LPFFD-NH 2 and two variants thereof, one obtained by substituting the acetyl group with the sulfonic amino acid taurine (Tau-LPFFD-NH 2) and a second novel {{one in which the}} aspartic acid is substituted by an asparagine (Ac-LPFFN-NH 2). Thioflavin T fluorescence, Circular Dichroism and Mass Spectrometry experiments have been performed indicating that β-sheet breakers are able to inhibit in vitro fibril formation and prevent the β <b>sheet</b> folding of <b>portions</b> of the Aβ 1 - 40 peptide. We show that Molecular Dynamics simulations and far UV Circular Dichroism provide consistent evidence that the new Ac-LPFFN-NH 2 β-sheet breaker is more effective than the other two in stabilizing the native α-helix structure of Aβ 1 - 40. In agreement with these results Thioflavin T fluorescence experiments confirm the higher efficiency in inhibiting Aβ 1 - 40 aggregation. Furthermore, Mass Spectrometry data and Molecular Dynamics simulations consistently identified the 17 - 21 Aβ 1 - 40 portion as the location of the interaction region between peptide and the Ac-LPFFN-NH 2 β-sheet breaker...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{energy savings}} can be {{achieved}} by improving efficiency of water removal in the press section of a paper machine, rather than energy-intensive evaporative dryer cans. Impulse drying is a novel technology to remove water from the sheet in the press section by using a heated press roll. 	Delamination is a major challenge to be overcome before impulse drying can be implemented successfully. Delamination is caused by a region of high temperature liquid water under high pressure in the press. Upon exiting the nip, the pressure drops and the high temperature water flashes to steam. If the expansion of the steam is too strong, the bonds between the fibers will fail and a blister will form. The formation of this blister is characteristic of delamination. 	The goal of this project was to understand the internal mechanics of a wet web as it exits the nip of an impulse dryer. In this way, the components of the sheet can be tailored to open the operating window of impulse drying. A mathematical model, developed to describe the deflection and delamination of an elastic membrane, was utilized in this work. Three failure criteria were employed to represent delamination of this pliable membrane from the more rigid sub layers in the <b>sheet.</b> 	The experimental <b>portion</b> of this effort was devoted to showing the validity of these models and which was the best fit. A series of experiments were employed to validate the model. A peel test was used to determine the amount of work needed to pull a membrane from a rigid substrate. Pressurized blister experiments were conducted to find the relationship between critical pressure and initial defect size. The predictions from the mathematical model were then compared to these experimental values. Finally, work was done to understand the physics of the delamination of a porous membrane. M. S.
