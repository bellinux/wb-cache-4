Isochronal Boltzmann I (V) and kinetic parameter values obtained by fitting the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to the clamp currents were compared with the values originally set in the model.

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} {{functions of}} a single neuron, such as propagation and generation of synaptic or action potentials, {{a detailed description of}} the kinetics and distribution of the underlying ionic conductances is essential. In voltage-clamp experiments, incomplete <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> distorts the recorded currents, rendering accurate analysis impossible. Here, we present a simple numerical algorithm that corrects such distortions. The method performs a stepwise approximation of the conductance density at the site of a local voltage clamp. This is achieved by estimating membrane conductances in a simulation that yields simulated clamp currents, which are then fitted to the distorted recordings from the non-space-clamped structure, relying on accurately reconstructed cell morphology and experimentally determined passive properties. The method enabled accurate retrieval of the local densities, kinetics, and density gradients of somatic and dendritic channels. Neither the addition of noise nor variation of passive parameters significantly reduced the performance of the correction algorithm. The correction method was applied to two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of K+ currents from the apical dendrite of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons. The generality and robustness of the algorithm make it a useful tool for voltage-clamp analysis of voltage-gated currents in structures of any morphology that is amenable to the voltage-clamp technique...|$|R

Overall, the results of trending analysis show that the AVHRR instruments on NOAA- 18 / 19 and MetOp-A are functioning well outperforming the channel noise specification limits. The backup NOAA- 17 AVHRR functioned well for the on-orbit period prior to the onset of scan motor failure around April 11, 2010. The sun-earth-satellite geometry driven seasonality is exhibited by temperature measurements from thermistors on various instrument housing components including blackbody {{with the exception of}} patch temperature which is typically maintained stable.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} method {{for determining the}} stability properties of a uniform nerve membrane is developed. Two basically similar tests of stability are considered: examination of the real characteristic roots of the linearized equations and application of a modified Nyquist criterion to the linearized alternating current admittance. The method {{is applied to the}} Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the squid axon membrane at 6. 3 °C to decide theoretically whether stable membrane behavior might be expected in a <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> experiment. The equations are solved for step depolarizations similar to those used in voltage clamp experiments. Each solution can be represented by a trajectory in the phase space of the variables V, m, h, and n. The stability of motion of a phase point on a given trajectory, and hence the adequacy of the control of the membrane potential, is shown to be a function of the effective conductance in series with the membrane. (For a patch of membrane away from the point controlled by feedback, the effective conductance is the combined conductance of the axial current electrode, axoplasm, and an external layer of sea water, all in series.) In particular, there is a (uniquely determined) critical conductance, defined as the minimum effective series conductance consistent with stability, associated with each point on the trajectory. During a step depolarization the critical conductance goes through a maximum. The values of such maxima as a function of voltage are closely similar to the negative slopes of the peak inward current versus voltage curve. This empirical correlation may be helpfup in the prediction of stability in experimental situations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In atrial muscle, {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) {{decreases the}} slow inward current (l~i) {{and increases the}} time-independent outward K § current. However, in ventricular muscle, ACh produces a marked negative inotropic effect only {{in the presence of}} positive inotropic agents that elevate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). A two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method was used on cultured reaggregates of cells from 16 - 20 -d-old embryonic chick ventricles {{to determine the effects of}} ACh on I~i and outward current during fl-adrenergic stimulation. Only double penetrations displaying low-resistance coupling were voltage-clamped. Cultured reaggregates are advantageous because their small size (50 - 250 /a-n) permits better control of membrane potential and adequate <b>space</b> <b>clamp.</b> Tetrodotoxin (10 - ~ M) and a holding potential of- 50 to- 40 mV were used to eliminate the fast Na + current. Depolarizing voltage steps above- 40 mV caused a slow inward current to flow that was sensitive to changes in [Ca]o and was depressed by verapamil (10 - 6 M). Maximal l~i was obtained at- 10 mV and the reversal potential was about + 25 inV. Isoproterenol (10 - 6 M) increased l~i at all clamp potentials. Subsequent addition of ACh (10 - 6 M) rapidly reduced Isi to control values (before isoproterenol) without a significant effect on the net outward current measured at 300 ms. The effects of ACh were reversed by muscarinic blockade with atropine (5 • 10 - 6 M). We conclude that the anti-adrenergic effects of ACh in ventricular muscle are mediated by a reduction in Ca 2 + influx during excitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} cable equation was solved numerically {{by means}} of an implicit procedure. The correlation between end-plate length and fiber diameter was determined in frog (Rana pipiens) sartorius muscles stained with gold chloride (Löwit, 1875). The diameter of the fibers stained by the Löwit method was 80 (74 - 85) micron (median and its 95 % confidence interval for 52 fibers), the length of the end plates in the same fibers was 382 (353 - 417) micron. The fibers simulated were 80 micron in diameter. To solve the equation the muscle fibers were represented by 500 segments 20 micron long, and the equation was solved in steps of 10 microseconds; a double exponential function was incorporated to the first seven segments to represent the neuromuscular junction. The potential of the first segment of the cable was set to the clamping level and the membrane potential of the remaining segments calculated. The current needed to hold the first segment was estimated by adding the current flowing through the first segment to the current flowing from it to the second segment. Our results indicate that the lack of <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> in the point voltage-clamp studies of the frog neuromuscular junction introduces serious errors in the estimates of the end-plate conductance value, the kinetics of the conductance changes, and the reversal potential of the end-plate currents. The possibility of an efficient voltage-clamp technique is also explored.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{electrical}} coupling to be more ubiquitous than previously thought, and coupling through gap junctions is known to {{play a crucial role}} in neuronal function and network output. In particular, current spread through gap junctions may affect the activation of voltage-dependent conductances as well as chemical synaptic release. Using voltage-clamp recordings of two strongly electrically coupled neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion and conductance-based models of these neurons, we identified effects of electrical coupling on the measurement of leak and voltage-gated outward currents, as well as synaptic potentials. Experimental measurements showed that both leak and voltage-gated outward currents are recruited via gap junctions from neurons coupled to the clamped cell. Nevertheless, in spite of the strong coupling between these neurons (~ 23 %), the errors made in estimating voltage-gated conductance parameters were relatively minor (< 10 %). Thus, in many cases isolation of coupled neurons may not be required if a small degree of measurement error of the voltage-gated currents or the synaptic potentials is acceptable. Modeling results show, however, that such errors may be as high as 20 % if the gap junction position is near the recording site or as high as 90 % when measuring smaller voltage-gated ionic currents. Paradoxically, improved <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> increases the errors due to electrical coupling because voltage control across gap junctions is poor for even the highest realistic coupling conductances. Furthermore, the common procedure of leak subtraction can add an extra error to the conductance measurement, the sign of which depends on the maximal conductance...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is presented for current and voltage clamp of multifiber bundles {{in a double}} sucrose gap. Attention is focused on methodological errors introduced by the intercellular cleft resistance. The bundle is approximated by a continuous geometry. Voltage distribution, {{as a function of}} radial distance and time, is defined by a parabolic partial differential equation which is specified for different membrane characteristics. Assuming a linear membrane, analytical solutions are given for current step and voltage step conditions. The theoretical relations (based on Bessel functions) may be used to calculate membrane conductance and capacity from experimental clamp data. The case of a nonlinear membrane with standard Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics for excitatory Na current is treated assuming maximum Na conductances (gNa) of 120, 10, and 1 mmho/cm 2. Numerical simulations are presented for potential and current distribution in a bundle of 60 microns diameter during depolarizing voltage steps. Adequate voltage control is restricted to the peripheral fibers of the bundle whereas the membrane potential of the inner fibers deviates from the command level during early inward current, tending to the Na equilibrium potential. In the peak current-voltage diagram the loss of voltage control is reflected by an increased steepness of the negative region and a decreased slope conductance of the positive region. With gNa = 120 mmho/cm 2, the positive slope conductance is approximately 25 % of the slope expected from ideal <b>space</b> <b>clamping.</b> With the lower values of gNa, the slope conductance ratio is in the order of 50 %.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between excitation and inhibition {{is crucial for}} brain computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, {{it is important to}} separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation [...] - the slope corresponds to the total conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of the <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> effect, the measured conductance in general deviates substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear {{interaction between}} the clamp current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity in neuronal computation...|$|R

40|$|Studying {{ion channel}} {{currents}} generated distally from the recording site {{is difficult because}} of artifacts caused by poor <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> and membrane filtering. A computational model can quantify artifact parameters for correction by simulating the currents only if their exact anatomical location is known. We propose that the same artifacts that confound current recordings can help pinpoint the source of those currents by providing a signature of the neuron's morphology. This method can improve the recording quality of currents initiated at the spike initiation zone (SIZ) that are often distal to the soma in invertebrate neurons. Drosophila being a valuable tool for characterizing ion currents, we estimated the SIZ location and quantified artifacts in an identified motoneuron, aCC/MN 1 -Ib, by constructing a novel multicompartmental model. Initial simulation of the measured biophysical channel properties in an isopotential Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model partially replicated firing characteristics. Adding a second distal compartment, which contained spike-generating Na+ and K+ currents, was sufficient to simulate aCC's in vivo activity signature. Matching this signature using a reconstructed morphology predicted that the SIZ is on aCC's primary axon, 70 μm after the most distal dendritic branching point. From SIZ to soma, we observed and quantified selective morphological filtering of fast activating currents. Non-inactivating K+ currents are filtered ∼ 3 times less and despite their large magnitude at the soma they could be as distal as Na+ currents. The peak of transient component (NaT) of the voltage-activated Na+ current is also filtered more than the magnitude of slower persistent component (NaP), which can contribute to seizures. The corrected NaP/NaT ratio explains the previously observed discrepancy when the same channel is expressed in different cells. In summary, we used an in vivo signature to estimate ion channel location and recording artifacts, which {{can be applied to}} other neurons...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{behavior of}} small single frog atrial trabeculae {{in the double}} sucrose gap has been investigated. The currents injected during voltage clamp experiments did not behave as predicted from the assumption of spatial uniformity of the voltage across a Hodgkin-Huxley membrane. Much of the difference {{is due to the}} geometrical complexities of this tissue. Nonetheless, two transient inward currents have been identified, the faster of which is blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The magnitude of the slower transient varies markedly between preparations but always increases in a given preparation with increase of external calcium. The fast transient current traces, at small to intermediate depolarizations, are often marred by the presence of notches and secondary peaks due most probably to the loss of <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> conditions. In many preparations these could be removed by reducing the current magnitude through application of a partially-blocking dose of TTX. Conversely, in the preparations whose fast transient was fully blocked by TTX, notches and secondary peaks in the slow transient could by induced through increasing calcium concentration and thereby the slow current magnitude. Previously used techniques for the measurement of the reversal potential of the fast inward transient {{have been shown to be}} invalid. In so far as they can be measured, the reversal potentials of the fast and slow inward transient are in the same neighborhood, i. e. around 120 mV from rest. The true values may be quite a bit apart. The total charge flow in the capacitive transient was measured for different sized nodes and preparations. From these data and estimates of plasma membrane area per unit trabecular volume, specific membrane capacitances of around 3 muF/cm 2 were calculated for small bundles. The apparent ion current densities on this basis are approximately 1 / 10 of those measured in axons. The capacitive current occurring in small bundles decayed as the sum of at least three exponential functions of time. On the basis of these data and the anomalously large stable node widths, we suggest a coaxial core model of the preparation with the inner elements in series with an additional large extracellular resistance...|$|R

Contraction was blocked by recording in hypertonic sucrose solutions. For depolarizations smaller than 0 mV the decay of the transient, slow, inward current, recorded {{in the presence of}} external tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and by replacing Cl- for CH 3 SO 3 -, followed a complex time course. For larger depolarizations, after the initial inward current, there was a prominent, slow, outward current which showed two phases: after reaching a peak (time to peak 1. 0 sec, peak amplitude 20 - 50 microA/cm 2 at 20 mV) it slowly declined to a steady level in about 2 - 3 sec at 23 degrees C. The inward current was greatly reduced or abolished by the adding of 2 mM-Cd 2 + or by replacing external Ca 2 + with Mg 2 +. The amplitude and time course of slow, outward currents were not obviously modified by replacing Ca 2 + with Mg 2 +, having the two described phases. However, in the presence of Cd 2 + the first transient phase of the outward current was not detected and only outward currents slowly increasing to a steady level were observed. Reliable ICa records were obtained by further blocking K+ outward currents by incubating the muscles in a K+-free TEA+- and Cs+-containing solution prior to experiments. Tubular <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> was improved by recording ICa from small fibres with 20 - 30 microns radius. The decay phase of ICa under a maintained depolarization in incubated muscles was fitted by a single exponential. The corresponding rate constant determined between 12 and 24 degrees C strongly depended on temperature, as expected for a gating process. The values for the activation energy and the corresponding Q 10 (calculated for a 10 - 20 degrees C transition) were respectively: 17. 5 +/- 1. 0 kcal/mole and 2. 9 +/- 0. 2 at 0 mV, and 18. 0 +/- 1. 5 kcal/mole and 3. 0 +/- 0. 3 at - 20 mV. The activation phase of ICa, analysed following the m alpha h Hodgkin-Huxley kinetic model, showed a similar temperature dependence with a Q 10 of 3. 0 +/- 0. 3. The peak amplitude of ICa and the limiting Ca 2 + permeability had a lower Q 10 value of about 1. 6. For a given temperature the rate constant of decay was independent of ICa peak amplitude in disagreement with a current-dependent process (intratubular Ca 2 + depletion or intracellular Ca 2 + accumulation) for the decay of ICa. In conclusion, our results favour a gating process (inactivation) as the principal mechanism underlying the decay phase of ICa under a maintained depolarization...|$|R

40|$|Hypertension is {{associated}} with marked cardiac sympathetic over-activity and end organ hyper-responsiveness. The sympathetic dysfunction is caused by aberrant calcium (Ca 2 +) handling resulting in enhanced neurotransmission. However, it remains unclear whether the sympathetic neuron or the myocytes is the primary driver behind the initiation and maintenance of the autonomic phenotype. The work in this thesis characterises the Ca 2 + dysfunction and regulation at the membrane level. Further, it employs physiologically coupled sympathetic neurons and ventricular myocytes to determine the cellular driver of cardiac dysautonomia in the pro-hypertensive state. Chapter 1 provides a general overview {{of the field of}} autonomic hypertension with a specific focus on the sympathetic control of cardiac excitability. In particular, the role of Ca 2 + and cyclic nucleotides in the facilitation of neurotransmission are explored. Chapter 2 details the methods used in this thesis. It provides rationale for the approaches taken to record membrane Ca 2 + currents, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) activity, and the development and uses of a co-culture of coupled sympathetic neurons and ventricular myocytes. Chapter 3 describes the successful development of an effective voltage clamp method to isolate whole cell Ca 2 + currents in sympathetic neurons. It details the issue of <b>space</b> <b>clamp</b> problem when using this technique on peripheral neurons and provides experimental guidance on how to quantify and limit theses issues. Chapter 4 identifies that the pro-hypertensive four-week old neurons from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) have significantly larger whole cell Ca 2 + currents when compared to normotensive (Wistar Kyoto-WKY) neurons, that are largely N-type in nature. Restoring the cGMP cyclic nucleotide dysfunction seen in these cells, rescues the ion channel phenotype and bring the Ca 2 + down to levels seen in the normotensive WKY neuron. Further, it identifies that phosphodiesterase (PDE) 2 A inhibition differentially affects the currents in the WKY and SHR, further supporting the notion of PDE 2 A dominance. Chapter 5 identifies the presence and functional relevance of cGMP cross-talk with the cAMP-PKA pathway in sympathetic neurons. This cross talk is significantly altered in the pro-hypertensive state, via the differential involvement of PDEs. It functionally identifies the presence of PDE 3 and PDE 2 A and provides further evidence that these enzymes could be dysregulated in pro-hypertensive neurons. Chapter 6 describes the use of a co-culture model of ventricular myocytes and sympathetic neurons. Physiological stimulation of the sympathetic neuron with nicotine whilst monitoring cAMP levels in the myocytes confirms that the cellular phenotypes seen in the individual cells are functionally present in the co-culture. Using cross-cultures, it identifies the neuron as the principal driver behind the cardiac sympathetic responses observed in pro-hypertension. The results provide evidence for a dominant role played by the neuron in driving the adrenergic phenotype seen in cardiovascular disease and highlights the potential of using healthy neurons to turn down the gain of neurotransmission, akin to a smart pre-synaptic β-blocker. Chapter 7 forms the concluding discussion that summarises the main findings of this thesis and attempt to place it in a clinical context, and highlights avenues of further research. In particular, the possibility of using a cell therapeutic approach to treat sympathetic hyperactivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} discontinuous space vector PWM (DPWM) {{techniques for}} a seven-phase {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI). Space vector model of a seven-phase VSI shows that there exist 128 space vectors with different lengths and maps into fourteen sided polygons. A number of possibilities could arise to implement modulation of inverter legs due to large number of available space voltage vectors. Two strategies are adopted here; one utilising large and two middle sets of space vectors to implement discontinuous <b>space</b> vector PWM. <b>Clamping</b> of legs of inverter to either positive or negative dc bus leads to discontinuity in the switching and consequently offers reduced switching loss modulation strategy. A significant reduction in switching losses can be achieved while employing DPWM in a seven-phase VSI. A generalised method is also proposed to realize the DPWM in a seven-phase VSI. Comparison of continuous and discontinuous PWM is presented in terms of switching current ripple. The experimental set-up is illustrated and the experimental results are presented. </p...|$|R
50|$|Mycena mustea {{is similar}} to the North American species M. umbrinovinosa, which is {{distinguished}} by having a vinaceous-brown to purplish-black cap, irregularly shaped cheilocystidia that are covered at their tips with long, flexuous excrescences, and clamp connections. Mycena mustea is also similar to the European species M. urania, which differs in its blackish-violet cap, broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia covered with numerous, evenly <b>spaced</b> warts, and <b>clamp</b> connections. Mycena mustea also resembles the Japanese M. fonticola, a species described concurrently with M. mustea. Unlike that of M. fonticola, the cap of M. mustea typically becomes pale grayish-purple when mature; the cheilocystidia have several short finger-like excrescences at their tips; and the stem cuticle is made up of smooth hyphae. In contrast, the cap of M. fonticola becomes dark violet-brown when mature; there are no excrescences on the cheilocystidia; and the hyphae of the stem cuticle are sparsely covered with diverticulae that resemble warts or fingers.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new type of}} opposed-anvil high pressure cell with substantially improved <b>space</b> efficiency. The <b>clamp</b> cell and the gasket are made of non-magnetic Ni-Cr-Al alloy. Non-magnetic tungsten carbide (NMWC) is used for the anvils. The assembled cell with the dimension ϕ 29 mm × 41 mm is capable of generating pressure up to 9 GPa over a relatively large volume of 7 mm 3. Our cell is particularly suitable for those experiments which require large sample space to achieve good signal-to-noise ratio, such as the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment. Argon is used as the pressure transmitting medium to obtain good hydrostaticity. The pressure was calibrated in situ by measuring the fluorescence from ruby through a transparent moissanite (6 H-SiC) window. We have measured the pressure and temperature dependences of the 63 Cu nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) frequency of Cu 2 O, the in-plane Knight shift of metallic tin, and the Knight shift of platinum. These quantities can be used as reliable manometers to determine the pressure values in situ during the NMR/NQR experiments up to 9 GPa.

30|$|Crystallinity and phase {{analysis}} of the films were carried out using X-ray diffraction method (Rigaku Rint 2000 series). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and structural studies {{have been carried out}} using transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM- 2100). Transmission spectra have been recorded using UV–VIS–NIR spectrophotometer (Jasco V- 570). Lithium iodide, iodine and acetonitrile purchased from Sigma-Aldrich have been used as received for the preparation of electrolyte. The redox electrolyte with [I_ 3 ^ -]/[I−] 1 : 9 was prepared by dissolving 0.5  M LiI and 0.05  M I 2 in acetonitrile solvent. Since LiI is extremely hygroscopic, electrolytes were prepared in a dry room maintained at dew point of 60  °C. The counter electrode was prepared by using platinum chloride as follows: the H 2 PtCl 6 solution in isopropanol (2  mg/ml) was deposited onto the ITO glass by spin coating method. TiO 2 electrode annealed at 500  °C was immersed in the extracted dye solution at room temperature for 24  h in the dark, since the grape dye extract is not stable under prolonged illumination of light. The electrode was then rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess dye present in the electrode and then the electrode was dried. The counter electrode was placed {{on the top of the}} TiO 2 electrode, such that the conductive side of the counter electrode facing the TiO 2 film with a spacer separating the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clamped firmly together using a binder clip. Now the prepared liquid electrolyte solution was injected into the <b>space</b> between the <b>clamped</b> electrodes. The electrolyte enters into the cell by capillary action. This resulted in the formation of sandwich type cell. Natural dye-sensitized TiO 2 -based solar cells have been fabricated with area of 0.25  cm 2, and it was found that the cell efficiency was independent of cell area in this range as reported by Yamazaki et al. [17]. The J–V characteristics of the cell were recorded using a Keithley 4200 -SCS meter. A xenon lamp source (Oriel, USA) with an irradiance of 100  mW/cm 2 was used to illuminate the solar cell (equivalent to AM 1.5 irradiation).|$|R
40|$|In the {{surgical}} treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the single proximal cross-clamp {{can be placed}} at 3 alternative aortic levels: infrarenal, hiatal, and thoracic. We performed this retrospective study to evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the 3 main aortic clamping locations. Eighty patients presented at our institution with abdominal aortic aneurysms from March 1993 through May 1998. Fifty of these patients had intact aneurysms and underwent elective surgery, and 30 had ruptured aneurysms that necessitated emergency surgery. Proximal aortic clamping was applied at the infrarenal level in 24 patients (22 from the intact aneurysm group, 2 from the ruptured group), at the hiatal level in 34 patients (22 intact, 12 ruptured), and at the thoracic level (descending aorta) via a limited left lateral thoracotomy in 22 patients (6 intact, 16 ruptured). Early mortality rates (within 30 days) were 4 % (2 of 50 patients) among patients with intact aneurysms and 40 % (12 of 30 patients) among those with ruptured aneurysms. In the 2 patients from the intact aneurysm group, proximal aortic clamps were applied at the hiatal level. In the ruptured aneurysm group, proximal aortic clamps were placed at the thoracic level in 10 patients, the infrarenal level in 1, and the hiatal level in 1. According to our study, the clinical status of the patient and the degree of operative urgency [...] as determined by the extent of the aneurysm [...] generally dictate the proximal clamp location. Patients who present with aneurysmal rupture or hypovolemic shock benefit from thoracic clamping, because it restores the blood pressure and allows time to replace the volume deficit. Infrarenal placement is advantageous in patients with intact aneurysms if there is sufficient <b>space</b> for the <b>clamp</b> between the renal arteries and the aortic aneurysm. In patients with juxtarenal aneurysms, hiatal clamping enables safe and easy anastomosis to the healthy aorta. Clamping at this level also helps prevent late anastomotic aneurysm formation, which is frequently encountered after inadvertent anastomosis of the graft to a diseased portion of the aorta. Further studies are needed in order to confirm these results...|$|R
40|$|The major {{challenge}} in the aerospace industry represents the design of technologies and electrically powered systems to improve the performances of tomorrow`s aircraft. In the last 30 years significant researches are made to increase the overall reliability, availability, efficiency, maintainability and operational costs {{for the next generation}} of aircrafts. The general requirements of these power circuits are: the system must be fault tolerant with ability to continue operating properly (possibly at a reduced level) in case of a failure, the systems must have small size, low weight and must work in harsh conditions such as high temperature, humidity, vibrations and low maintenance. Matrix Converter is an "all silicon" solution which can direct connect an AC source to an AC load without the need of DC-link electrolytic capacitor. This AC to AC topology is a very promising alternative topology which can replace the actual two step power conversion solution, AC to DC to AC. The advantages of this topology are related to the lack of DC-link electrolytic capacitor, high output voltage quality, high input current quality, power factor control, high dynamic response, four quadrant operation, low current and low voltage stress of bidirectional switches. Despite these advantages, their market penetration is quite low, mainly due to their poor voltage transfer ratio, complexity in terms of structure and control, higher sensibility to input disturbances and its load parameter dependent. The main goal of this work is to design and implement a MC topology which can be used for aircraft applications. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters and in the end are presented the conclusions, appendices and references. In Chapter 1 the research starts with the presentation of the actual electrical system of an aircraft Boeing 787 and continues with the presentation of possible topologies which can be true fault tolerant. Next, a comparison is made between the most suitable topologies which can be used in AC to AC power conversion (MC and V-BBC) from the power components needed point of view for a three-phase load. The Chapter 2 is dedicated to MC study and analysis. Within this part, are presented the most used MC topology structures (DMC and IMC). An important part of the study is focused on bidirectional switches arrangement, safe commutation methods for bidirectional switches and control methods which can be applied. Next, in Chapter 3 the study continues with MC input filter design. MC is a direct AC to AC power conversion and because of this, special protection circuits are designed. An important part of the chapter is accorded to power switches selection and currents, voltages and temperature measurement circuits. In Chapter, 4 the DMC is simulated for two different control methods, 2 L-PWM and DSVM. The simulations are made for two types of source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz on a RL load. Chapter 5 contains the electrical circuit schemes and the layout of the DMC "Main Board" and "Driver Board" which are used in prototype realization. Chapter 6 is divided into experimental test results for individual components and experimental results of DMC with DSVM algorithm for both source frequencies, 50 Hz and 400 Hz. Finally, at the end of the thesis are presented the conclusions drawn from this research and recommendations for future work which must be done to improve the waveforms quality. In the appendices sections is presented the code used in Matlab-Simulink for both simulations and also the LabVIEW implementation of the DSVM algorithm.

40|$|DPA' is a {{digitally}} {{designed and}} manufactured artifact {{resulting from a}} research project to establish the technical and mechanical limitations of machine and material within a highly controlled Computer Numeric machining process. The author has developed am indepth and personal knowledge of CNC milling software and hardware {{over a period of}} twenty years. This intimate understanding of the relationship between code and form has enabled Masterton to challenge established conventions and boundaries enabling the development of innovative and unique metalwork. Towering triumphantly at its wafer edge, each layer shimmering, light dancing in all directions; a liquid surface, flowing. The blade emerges, unyielding, from its base; the plateau, scarred by tools, that nick and chatter, gouge and tear. Precision milling unearths caves of glimmering alloy, the circular spinning teeth of an industrial saw separates the billet from its parent. Marked with a digital ID, hard gunmetal grey; pitted and scratched from transit impacts. Concept: As a child growing up in Scotland I spent many weekends walking the highlands with my mum and dad, often we would happen upon plane wreckage, torn pieces of aluminium fuselage strewn amongst the heather. I collected these oxidised and distorted forms, fascinated by their technological achievements and failure. DPA or Destructive Physical Anaylsis is an acronym used to describe the process of testing a design or component until it fails. This form of testing provides the manufacturer with useful information about how, why and when a part may fail enabling them to improve or refine the design. Destructive testing is used for objects of mass production as destroying one-offs is not economical. Complex measuring devices such as strain gauges and high speed cameras are used to document the failure point. For the piece ‘DPA’ I wanted to push the material, machine and cutting tools to their limits, possibly even past their failure point, the aim was not to achieve a beautifully finished and controlled piece of work but rather to work right on the edge of all their limits. Early test pieces enabled me to establish what these limits might be and how I could work with them to achieve a unique and technically challenging one off piece. The form is drawn from my interests in aerospace and is influenced by the complex CNC milling of individual turbine blades used in jet engines; widely {{regarded as one of the}} most technically challenging manufacturing processes. However my blade is more interested in utilising the cutting tools specific mark potential as part of the aesthetic language than trying to achieve a uniform surface finish. Technical Challenges: The piece challenged me from the outset as the starting billet of metal was larger than anything I have ever cut at 800 mm long and a total of 39 KG in weight. I want the piece to reveal every step of the process in achieving the thin blade like form, to show the different forming processes that this material had taken through its life, hence none of the marks or edges have been cleaned or polished. One of the first challenges was designing a clamping method in order to hold the metal on the bed of the milling machine. The horizontal deep pockets along the lower edge of the piece are the <b>spaces</b> for 10 <b>clamps</b> to stop the piece from vibrating. The use of a ruby crystal touch probe enabled me to accurately measure the exact centre of the metal and align the work to my digital cutting space. Specialist cutting tools were purchased from Mitsubishi Carbide with extremely long cutting reach and internal cooling channels to minimise thermal expansion of the cutting tips during long cutting cycles. I had to rely on audio feedback from the cutting in order to constantly tune the cutting speeds due to the constant need for liquid coolant which obscured any view of the metal. Total cutting time for the piece was over 90 Hours. The final cutting of the blade surface removed 0. 2 mm of material at a cutting speed of less than 200 mm per min due to the high vibration generated in both the long cutting tool and the extremely thin cross section of the surface (0. 4 mm thick) ...|$|R
