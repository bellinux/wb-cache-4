5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek <b>society</b> <b>can</b> also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
5|$|As of April of the 2010–2011 school year, Whitney High School runs forty-seven clubs. Many {{of these}} clubs, {{including}} those pertaining to art, dance, music (the school's band and orchestra), foreign language, and the United States Air Force Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, directly correspond to official classes that {{are run by}} the school itself. Others, including the California Scholarship Federation and National Honor <b>Society,</b> <b>can</b> be used as catalysts to fulfill the community service graduation requirement. The high school's yearbook, known as Details, was awarded a Silver Crown Award at the 2009 Scholastic Awards Convention at Columbia University alongside Rocklin High School's yearbook; in addition, Whitney's yearbook placed first in the 2006 National Student Press Association Best-of-Show's Yearbook length 1–224 pages category.

25|$|The 20th-century Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci drew great {{inspiration}} from Machiavelli's writings on ethics, morals, {{and how they}} relate to the State and revolution in his writings on Passive Revolution, and how a <b>society</b> <b>can</b> be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{politics}} over economics. The making {{and implementation of}} policy {{is not one of}} discovery, but rather of top down implementation. Rigid state control will limit how a <b>society</b> <b>can</b> respond to tensions and crisis, and thus politics creates its own presuppositions and limits creativity and alternative solutions.|$|E
25|$|Key {{questions}} for mitigation are {{the viability of}} methods, the roles of government and private sector and how early these solutions are implemented.

However, they warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars, and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.|$|E

25|$|Driving Unger's {{political}} engagement is {{the idea}} that <b>society</b> <b>can</b> be made and remade. Unlike Mill or Marx, who posited a particular class as the agent of history, Unger does not see a single vehicle for transformative politics. He advocates world-wide revolution, but does not see this happening as a single cataclysmic event or undertaken by a class agent, like the Communist movement. Rather, he sees the possibility of piecemeal change, where institutions can be replaced one at a time, and permanent plasticity can be built into the institutional infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|If {{desire is}} repressed, {{it is because}} every {{position}} of desire, no matter how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire is asocial, on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries think about this, desire is revolutionary in its essence — desire, not left-wing holidays! — and no <b>society</b> <b>can</b> tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.|$|E
25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political <b>society</b> <b>can</b> create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{philosophical}} and systemics perspectives, personoid <b>societies</b> <b>can</b> {{also be seen}} as the carriers of a culture. According to N. Gessler, the personoids study can be a base for the research on artificial culture and culture evolution.|$|R

25|$|Satoyama {{have been}} disappearing {{due to the}} drastic shift in natural {{resources}} from charcoal and firewood to oil and the change from compost to chemical fertilizer. Also, the problem of aging in Japanese <b>society</b> <b>can</b> cause the disappearance of satoyama because there are fewer people who can work in satoyama which are considered as intermediate disturbance on forests such as harvesting trees for timber and charcoal, cutting shrubs for firewood and collecting litter as compost. These human impacts can help {{the success of the}} forest occur. As the final causality of the disappearing of satoyama, pine dominated secondary forests in satoyama were increasingly destroyed since pine wilt disease devastated pine forests in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the Dutch honours {{system was}} {{extensively}} revised after {{almost thirty years}} of discussion. This revision by law intended {{to create a more}} democratic honours system, disconnecting the level of the honours from rank and social status. In principle, since then everyone in Dutch <b>society</b> <b>can</b> be honoured. An honour is only awarded on the basis of special, personal merits for society. Before this revision the Order consisted of five grades with additional Honorary Medals (gold, silver and bronze). The Honorary medals were only affiliated with the Order and bearers were not formally included in the Order. In 1996, the Honorary medals were abolished and replaced by the Member Class of the Order of Orange-Nassau, which is reserved only for Dutch citizens.|$|E
25|$|Americans, by and large, {{are often}} fascinated by new {{technology}} and new gadgets. There are many within the United States that share the attitude that through technology, many of the evils in the <b>society</b> <b>can</b> be solved. Many of the new technological innovations {{in the modern world}} were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include: the lightbulb, the airplane, the transistor, nuclear power, the personal computer, video games and online shopping, as well as the development of the Internet. By comparison with Japan, however, {{only a small fraction of}} electronic devices make it to sale in the US, and household items such as toilets are rarely festooned with remotes and electronic buttons as they are in some parts of Asia.|$|E
