40|$|The dynamic {{strain aging}} (DSA) {{phenomenon}} {{is present in}} C–Mn steels and associated welds commonly used in many industrial applications. This phenomenon, which appears in metals containing solute atoms interacting with dislocations, induces an increase in flow stress and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) {{as well as a}} decrease in ductility. The DSA phenomenon was studied by tensile, strain rate sensitivity and internal friction tests between 20 uC and 350 uC in two C–Mn steels with very different sensitivities to DSA (a fully killed A 42 steel and a <b>semikilled</b> A 48 steel). The internal friction technique, which allows one to evaluate the balance between carbon and nitrogen atoms free in the lattice and carbon and nitrogen atoms interacting with mobile dislocations, appears to give results well correlated with those obtained by tensile (and strain rate sensitivity) tests. The ductility loss or the UTS increase is shown to be proportional to Snoek peak height. It is concluded that, even in industrial materials, a single internal friction test can give a good evaluation of DSA sensitivity...|$|E
