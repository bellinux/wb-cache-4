50|$|The {{source of}} the unusual {{features}} of the sample relative to other H5 chondrites {{has yet to be}} agreed upon. The olivine and pyroxene ratios may result from the metamorphic history of the parent body; reactions between olivines, low-Ca pyroxenes and Fe metal could result in a larger abundance of low-Ca pyroxene in reducing conditions. Alternatively, plagioclase and olivine can produce orthopyroxene at high temperatures, or high <b>sulphidation</b> may have caused the olivines to break down into Fe metal and orthopyroxenes. All explanations are plausible, however no consensus has been reached to identify the most probable process, as each holds implications that are not fully supported by the observations in Mason Gully.|$|E

The work includes both systematic thermodynamic assessment and targeted experimental investigations. Thermodynamic calculation results studying the effect of reactants composition, temperature and different sulphur sources (H 2 S and elemental S) showed that chromite can be selectively sulphidised at a controlled atmosphere of partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) below 10 &# 8722; 10 atm and partial pressure of sulphur (pS 2) above 10 &# 8722; 6 atm. The addition of carbon with sulphur was found to be useful for the chromite <b>sulphidation</b> reaction. The optimum quantity of sulphur reactant to carbon was found to be 3 : 1 (in mole) for 1 mol of chromite. <b>Sulphidation</b> experiments on a mixture of natural ilmenite and chromite at 1100 &# 0176;C for 5 h using 5 %H 2 S as a sulphur source showed that the ilmenite was preferentially sulphidised first, which was also in a good agreement with the thermodynamic assessment. <b>Sulphidation</b> of a naturally occurring chrome spinel contaminated ilmenite concentrate showed that the degree of weathering also {{played a role in the}} <b>sulphidation</b> of the chrome spinel.

This phenomenon could have been explained in studying the kinetics of NiS <b>sulphidation</b> as a function of sulphur activity. It has been found that the parabolic rate constant of this reaction increases with sulphur activity, strongly suggesting that cation vacancies, and not cation interstitials, are the prevailing defects.

40|$|Coatings, {{obtained}} by preoxidation of Incoloy 800 H at low PO 2 show good <b>sulphidation</b> resistance {{due to the}} higher chromia content in the oxide scale.

It was observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that the sulphur uptake of the catalysts was much in excess {{to the amount}} necessary for complete <b>sulphidation</b> of nickel and molybdenum and occurred even with the non-impregnated supports. Simultaneously, a peak attributable to niobium in an oxidation state lower than + 5 appeared in the XPS spectra. A good linear correlation {{was found between the}} atomic percentage of sulphur, above the one necessary to sulphide the supported metals, and the atomic percentage of niobium in the reduced state, showing that partial reduction-sulphidation of the support occurred during the <b>sulphidation</b> treatment. The slope of the best line through the experimental points was 1. 99, indicating that a surface niobium sulphide with stoichiometry close to NbS 2 was formed during the treatment. While the reduction-sulphidation of niobium was enhanced by the presence of supported nickel and especially molybdenum, it was inhibited by phosphate. The supports and catalysts were tested in the hydrocracking of cumene at 623 K and 2. 7 MPa. When the materials were sulphided under 15 % H 2 S/H- 2 at 673 K, a linear correlation was observed between the activity and the extent of reduction-sulphidation of the supports, indicating that the surface niobium sulphides were principally responsible for their acidic activity. However, when the materials were sulphided at 623 K with the feed containing CS 2 as a sulphiding agent, before the catalytic test, no such correlation was found and the activity in cumene hydrocracking was much smaller, showing that the lower temperature is insufficient for complete development of the support <b>sulphidation,</b> especially with the molybdenum catalysts. It was observed by XPS that, at 673 K, reduction of the molybdenum to the + 4 state during <b>sulphidation</b> is nearly complete with an alumina support, but not with the niobia supports, which suggests the existence of a strong molybdena-niobia interaction.

The hydrothermal overprint produced pervasive and massive <b>sulphidation</b> with stratoid pyritized lenticular bodies within the oolitic ironstone layer. These sulphide lenses are spatially associated with strike-slip faults and extend laterally from them. Following the massive <b>sulphidation</b> stage (Fe-As, stage 1), subsequent fracturing allowed the deposition of base metals (stage 2) and Pb-Sb-Au (stage 3) parageneses in veins. The dominant brittle structures are vertical extension veins, conjugate shear veins and strike-slip faults of various orders. All these structures {{are filled with}} the same paragenetic sequence. Deformation analysis allows the identification of structures that developed incrementally via right lateral simple shear compatible with bulk strain affecting the Central Armorican Domain. Each increment corresponds to a fracture set filled with specific parageneses. Successive hydrothermal pulses reflect clockwise rotation of the horizontal shortening direction. Geothermometry on chlorite and arsenopyrite shows an input of hot hydrothermal fluids (maximum of 390 - 350 °C) during the main sulphide stage 1. The subsequent stages present a marked temperature drop (300 - 275 °C). Lead isotopes suggest that the lead source is similar for all hydrothermal stages and corresponds to the underlying Neo-proterozoic basement. Lead isotope data, relative ages of deformation and comparison with neighbouring deposits suggest large-scale fluid pulses occurred during the whole Hercynian orogeny rather than pulses restricted to the late Hercynian period. The vicinity of the Hercynian internal domain appears as a key-control for deformation and fluid flow in the oolitic ironstones which acted as a chemical and structural trap for the hydrothermal fluids.

At high <b>sulphidation</b> epithermal indication zone in Datarkorot is dominated by advanced argillic alteration. Mineralization occurred is in the disseminated pyrite form and the concentrated hematite oxide mineral, goethite, and jarosite is a condition of changing sulfide mineral acids. Mineralization is controlled by lithology, by tuff unit which is interpreted lithocap of a diaterme breccia generated by a dacite porphyry intrusion.

The catalyst material starts as one or more molybdenum (VI) oxide(s), but the oxidation state reduces to Mo(IV) during <b>sulphidation.</b> Despite the extensive analytical studies carried out on these systems over the past 25 years, the fundamental questions still remain [...] {{what is the nature}} of the catalytic site on the molybdate hydrodesulphurisation catalyst, and is the site identical on promoted and unpromoted catalysts?;A new approach to catalyst film preparation was developed using thin supported molybdate films. The films could be easily prepared and their compositions could be easily changed, and they could be readily studied using modern surface analytical equipment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was chosen as the primary tool to characterise the molybdate films, while laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) was used to complement the information gained from XPS.;The surfaces of supported molybdenum oxide thin films were characterised following calcination, reduction, and <b>sulphidation</b> treatments. Special peak broadening of Mo(VI) oxide films have been observed on electrically conducting thin films deposited on planar alumina and graphite substrates. This peak broadening decreases as the film thickness increases. This phenomenon may be influenced either by aggregate sizes and the local electronic environment of the molybdate clusters, or it may be indicative of multiple, unresolved Mo(VI) species. Thermal reduction of supported MoOdollar 3 dollar in Hdollar 2,dollar Ndollar 2,dollar or in vacuo at 500 dollar∘dollarC for extended periods yields a mixture of MoOdollar 2 dollar and higher Mo(3 d) oxidation states, including a non-octahedral Mo(VI) species. The diversity of reduction products observed under these conditions can be adequately explained using crystallographic shear mechanisms. <b>Sulphidation</b> of thin film molybdenum oxides yields a variety of Mo(3 d) species including oxide and sulphide components.
