A control strategy of fuzzy sliding model variable structure will be presented, and it is applied in the model achieved by identifications, adopting the method of fuzzy control system approximating equivalent control and designing switching controller based on fuzzy control gain dynamic regulation, could inhabit the buffeting existing in sliding model variable structure control. Simulation results show that performance of an electro-hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>oil</b> film stiffness control system is improved significantly for hydrostatic center frame based on fuzzy sliding model variable structure controller, which can’t only effectively inhabit buffeting, reduce steady-state error, but also has strong robustness for uncertainties of structure parameter...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils due {{to their}} better natural propertiescan {{be used as an}} {{alternative}} to reduce the dependency on the conventional lubricants. With the depletion of conventional resources at faster pace, need of hour is to approach the safer alternatives for ensuring the availability of such resources for longer periods with lesser harm to the mankind and sorroundings. This workevaluates the prospects of Castor oil based lubricant for automotive applications in contrast to the available commercial <b>servo</b> gear <b>oil.</b> Experimentation has been performed on four ball tester set up. Material used is carbon steel balls. Refined castor and mahua oils are blended in fixed ratios and subjected to friction and wear tests. Experimentation reveals that castor mahua oil blend possess immense potential in contrast to <b>servo</b> gear <b>oil</b> due to good wear reducing traits apart from environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|Titanium alloys {{have very}} high tensile {{strength}} and toughness, light weight, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, {{the high cost of}} both raw materials and processing limit their use to military applications, aircraft, spacecraft, medical devices, connecting rods on expensive sports cars, some premium sports equipment and consumer electronics. Surface finish plays vital role in service life of components, to ensure a great reliability of sensitive aeronautical components, surface integrity of titanium alloys should be satisfied. Therefore, it required to optimize process parameters like cutting speed, feed and depth of cut while machining titanium components for better surface finish and also high tool life {{in order to reduce the}} tool cost. In order to reduce high temperatures in the machining zone, cutting fluids are employed in machining. Cutting fluid improves the surface conditions of the work piece, tool life and the process as a whole. It also helps in carrying away the heat and debris produced during machining. This project work deals with performance evaluation and optimization of process parameter in turning of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy with different coolant conditions using Taguchi’s design of experiments methodology on surface roughness by uncoated carbide tool. The results have been compared among dry, flooded with <b>Servo</b> cut <b>oil</b> and water and flooded with Synthetic oil coolant conditions. From the experimental investigations, the cutting performance on Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy with synthetic oil is found to be better when compared to dry and <b>servo</b> cut <b>oil</b> and water in reducing surface roughness. The results from ANOVA shows that while machining Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy, the Synthetic oil is more effective under high cutting speed, high depth of cut and low feed rate compared to dry and <b>servo</b> cut <b>oil</b> and water conditions. The ANOVA also reveals that feed rate is dominant parameter under dry, <b>servo</b> cut <b>oil</b> and water and synthetic oil conditions in optimizing the surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Servo</b> agro spray <b>oil</b> (petroleum based {{horticulture}} oil) {{was evaluated}} {{in the laboratory}} against tea red spider mite, Oligonychus coffeae to determine its effect on adult mortality, viability of eggs, oviposition deterrence and repellent properties. The same was also evaluated {{in the field to}} determine its effect on mite population. Direct spray method was used in the laboratory at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 %. Mortality of O. coffeae was both concentration and time dependent. Deposition of eggs by adult mites on treated leaf surfaces decreased significantly and the viability of eggs was also significantly reduced. In addition, different concentrations of the Servo agro spray also exhibited repellent properties against adult mites. In the field <b>Servo</b> agro spray <b>oil</b> significantly reduced the mite population and its bio-efficacy was comparable to that of the synthetic pesticide (propargite 57 EC). No phytotoxic effect was observed when tea bushes were sprayed with different doses of Servo agro spray. Tea samples were taint free. Quality (appearance of liquor, flavour, taint and taste) of made tea was not adversely affected by treatments with <b>Servo</b> agro spray <b>oil.</b> Therefore <b>Servo</b> agro spray <b>oil</b> may be a potential agent {{to be used in the}} sustainable management of tea red spider mite...|$|R

For example, robots designed to support human movement must be light {{for safety and}} to enable standing and walking, and machines used for construction must have sufficient force to manipulate large objects. Hydraulic actuators are commonly used in these applications because of their power-to-weight ratios and their remote driving units (i.e., power sources, electric motors, <b>servo</b> units, and <b>oil</b> tanks).|$|R

At the Davis Cup Group II semi-final Pakistan were beaten by Chinese Taipei 3–2, with Aisam winning two of his three rubbers.

40|$|Abstract-Vegetable oils have {{traditionally}} been applied in food uses but recent trend suggests that it has economic usefulness as an industrial fluids. Increasing crude oil prices and emphasis {{on the development of}} renewable, environment friendly fluids have brought vegetable oils to a place of prominence. As environment pollution and health problem {{are becoming more and more}} concerned, the use of environment friendly lubricants is strongly supported by manufacturers’. The objective of this work is to determine the influence of lubricant on surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) by using CNC LATHE Machine with AISI D 2 steel. Taguchi Method is used for determining and optimising operating parameters. The experimentation is proposed to identify the influence of cotton seed oil on AISI D 2 steel. Further the usability of cotton seed oil will be checked in turning operation at low and high speeds. The performance of cotton seed oil is compared with <b>servo</b> cut <b>oil</b> and soybean oil. The above experimentation results may help practitioners to compare and increase MRR, Surface finish using more environment friendly oil as lubricant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- CFX {{simulation}} {{has become}} a powerful and popular tool for the thermal hydraulic design and analysis of heat exchangers, while shell and tube heat exchanger {{is the most common}} type of heat exchanger and widely use in high pressure application. However, the computation load is usually too heavy to simulate a whole shell & tube heat exchanger applying the traditional modelling method. In the present study single tube geometry is use for analysis. The processes in solving the simulation consist of modelling and meshing the basic geometry of single tube heat exchanger using the ANSYS 14. 0 package CFX. Then, the boundary condition will be set before simulate based on the experimental parameters. Parameter that had been used was the same parameter of experimental at constant material of hot fluid (<b>Servo</b> Prime <b>Oil)</b> and varies with cold fluid volume fraction (Water). Thus, this paper presents the simulation of heat transfer in shell and tube heat exchanger model and validation to heat transfer in shell and tube heat exchanger studies unit no. 5 of thermal power station Ukai (TPSU) for the analysis. Oil used for lubrication is servo prime 46. The oil which comes out from turbine casing after lubrication is having temperature around 550 C and it is required to cool it down before using it once again for further lubrication. The present work shows that CFX model is validated by comparison to the experimental results within 10 % error...|$|R
