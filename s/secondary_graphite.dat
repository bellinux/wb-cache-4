40|$|One {{of the key}} {{sources of}} {{transverse}} impedance in the LHC has been the <b>secondary</b> <b>graphite</b> collimators that sit close to the beam at all energies. This limits the stable bunch intensity due to transverse coupled-bunch instabilities and transverse mode coupling instability. To counteract this, new secondary collimators have been proposed for the phase II upgrade of the LHC collimation system. A number of designs based on different jaw materials and mechanical designs have been proposed. A comparison of the beam coupling impedance of these different designs derived from simulations are presented, {{with reference to the}} existing phase I secondary collimator design...|$|E

40|$|Self-lubricating polymer {{compounds}} {{are currently}} {{used for a}} wide range of applications such as bearings, gears, and water meters. Under severe conditions such as high pressure, high velocity, and/or high temperatures, the material fails (PV limit). In this study, we investigated the effect of graphite on the tribological properties of polystyrene (PS) with “ball-on-three-plates” tests. Graphite-filled PS plates were produced via an internal mixer and compression molding. Unhardened steel (1. 4401) and nylon (PA 66) balls were used for the tribological tests. Our results indicate that graphite loading, graphite type, and particle size have a big influence on the friction coefficient, the wear resistance, and the PV limit of PS both against steel and PA 66. In particular, primary synthetic graphite performs better than <b>secondary</b> synthetic <b>graphite</b> due to the higher degree of crystallinity...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{processing}} and property improvements {{can be achieved}} by copolymerization of state-of-the-art bisimides with various vinyl stilbazole derivatives to give both fire resistance and high-temperature properties from hot-melt compositions. Significant improvement in mechanical properties is achieved through these modifications, which may make these new matrix resins ideal candidates for fireworthy <b>secondary</b> <b>graphite</b> composite structures. Phosphorous modifications of maleimido polymers through phosphonate structure and tricyclophosphazene derivatives provide families of new matrix resins for short-time applications in severe thermo-oxidative environments. With further research these may provide matrix resins for long-term thermo-oxidative stability of advanced composites at temperatures up to 400 to 500 C...|$|E

40|$|The main {{requirements}} {{for the development of}} a new grade for the later finishing section of the mill are : good oxidation and thermal behaviour, high wear resistance, good resistance to rolling incidents. The approach of Marichal Ketin to improve the rolling performances in the last finishing stands is presented. The Hi-Cr cast iron possesses excellent wear resistance due to the presence of hard chromium carbides, but its thermal conductivity and sticking properties are fairly low. A graphite precipitation could contribute to an improvement in thermal conductivity and serve as lubricant preventing sticking. The new material, called graphitic chromium iron, shows good oxidation, wear and thermal behaviour allowing its use as work roll in the last stands of the finishing section of a HSM. In the as-cast condition, graphite precipitation in high Ni and Si chromium cast iron occurs at a temperature of 950 degrees C. Moreover, the amount and volume of free graphite may be increased by <b>secondary</b> <b>graphite</b> precipitation during suitable heat treatment. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Vinystilbazole (vinylstryrylpyridine) and vinylpolystyrulpyridine were {{prepared}} {{for the purpose of}} modifying bismaleimide composite resins. Cure studies of resins systems were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The vinylstyrylpyridine-modified bismaleimide composite resins were found to have lower cure and gel temperatures, and shorter cure times than the corresponding unmodified composite resins. The resin systems were reinforced with commercially avialable satin-weave carbon cloth. Prepregs were fabricated by solvent or hot melt techniques. Thermal stability, flammability, moisture absorption, and mechanical properties of the composites (such as flexural strength, modulus, tensile and short beam shear strength) were determined. Composite laminates showed substantial improvements in both processability and mechanical properties compared to he bismaleimide control systems. The vinylstyrylpyridine modified bismaleimide resins can be used as advanced matrix resins for <b>graphite</b> <b>secondary</b> structures where ease of processing, fireworthiness, and high temperature stability are required for aerospace applications...|$|R
40|$|The Phase II {{upgrade to}} the LHC {{collimation}} system calls for complementing the 30 high robust Phase I <b>graphite</b> <b>secondary</b> collimators with 30 high Z Phase II collimators. This paper reports on BPM and impedance considerations and {{measurements of the}} integrated BPMs in the prototype rotatable collimator to be installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. The BPMs are necessary to align the jaws with the beam. Without careful design the beam impedance can result in unacceptable heating of the chamber wall or beam instabilities. The impedance measurements involve utilizing both a single displaced wire and two wires excited in opposite phase to disentangle the driving and detuning transverse impedances. Trapped mode resonances and longitudinal impedance are to also be measured and compared with simulations. These measurements, when completed, will demonstrate the device is fully operational and has the impedance characteristics and BPM performance acceptable for installation in the SPS.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the suppression of secondary electron emission significantly improves the performance of electron beam collectors (ref. 1). However, a complete analysis {{of the effects of}} secondary electron emission with respect to collector performance has not been possible {{because of the lack of}} quantitative data on angular distributions of secondary electrons. Secondary electrons are emitted with energies ranging from near zero to the energy of the incident primary. For our purposes, we define elastically scattered electrons as secondary electrons within 20 percent of the incident energy. Elastically scattered electrons are of great concern because their energy allows them to follow trajectories that can carry them almost anywhere within the vacuum envelope. If these secondaries leave the collector and reenter the slow wave circuit, they can produce undesired signal distortion and oscillation. This apparatus, which was built by Krainsky (ref. 2), was used at the NASA Lewis Research Center to obtain detailed measurements of the angular distributions of elastically scattered secondaries. Data were obtained for three surfaces of significant interest to collector applications: highly polished copper, copper roughened by ion sputtering, and isotropic graphite. Lewis researchers discovered that elastically scattered electrons have a complex angular distribution that is strongly dependent on the atomic number and surface morphology of the target material, as well as the energy and angle of incidence of the primary beam. At low energies, secondary emission from polished copper in the chosen energy range is primarily directed back to the source of primary electrons (backscattering). Forward scattering increases with primary energy until, at high energies, forward scattering dominates the angular distribution. Although back-scattered secondaries dominate the distributions of the textured copper surface, the yield is substantially lower. From the standpoint of <b>secondary</b> emission, isotropic <b>graphite</b> is the most attractive material because it exhibits low yield and little back scattering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{original}} {{work of the}} authors published recently, describing the influence of B on the matrix of the Cuadded spheroidal graphite cast iron. The effect of Cu has been corrected as a ferrite formation promoter in the matrix of the grey cast iron by the usage of high-purity material. Also, this paper focuses on the ferrite formation and the observation of the Cu distribution in the B-added and B-free Cu-containing spheroidal graphite cast iron. The Cu film on the spheroidal graphite can be successfully observed in the B-free sample using a special etching method. However, in the B-added sample, no Cu film could be found, while the <b>secondary</b> <b>graphite</b> was formed {{on the surface of}} the spheroidal graphite. The interaction between B and Cu is stressed as a peculiar phenomenon by the employment of a contrast experiment of B and Mn. The heat treatment could make Cu precipitate more significantly in the eutectic cells and in the matrix in the form of large Cu particles because of the limited solubility of Cu...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{electroluminescence}} detector (ELD) {{with high}} energetic resolution can lead to several times higher X-ray diffraction intensities and to a better peak to background ratio in comparison with a <b>secondary</b> <b>graphite</b> monochromator and a scintillation counter. However the use of ELD in simple operation mode with a single channel analyser showed some disadvantages: For Cu-radiation the K-beta to K-alpha ratio can be reduced only just to 1 - 2 percent, so that K-beta reflections of main phases or strong reflecting lattice planes can disturb the diagram evaluation. Additionally we got a K-alpha reduction to 75 - 80 percent the background was considerably higher compared to the graphite monochromator. For solving this problem a multichannel software version for the ELD system was realised within the APX 63 software package, which deals with the superimposing K-alpha and K-beta peaks of the characteristic lines of the X-ray tube. For accurate separation of these peaks an asymmetric Gau ssian profile is used for modelling the peak shape. Start values for the iteration (peak position, peak width) are gained from a pulse height analysis. During measurement a non-linear least square fit is perforated to predict the actual intensity values. This fit consumes no additional computing time because of the multitasking operation between measurement and evaluation processes. The fitting algorithm is insensitive to small drufts of the detector pulse height. Applying the MCA version of the ELD to thin surface layers dense silicon nitride, implanted with Ti, 0, N, were analysed in grazing incidence geometry...|$|E
