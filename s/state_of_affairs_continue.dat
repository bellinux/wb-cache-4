[...] "If there is {{anything}} about Clarke that I do not know and that I should know I want you to tell me. Personally I like the fellow. I am not saying that to make you think you ought to like him because I do. You might not care for him at all, but that would be no good reason for your actions. Betty, in these frontier settlements a man is soon known for his real worth. Every one at the Fort liked Clarke. The youngsters adored him. Jessie liked him very much. You know he and Isaac became good friends. I think he acted like a man to-day. I saw the look Miller gave him. I don't like this fellow Miller, anyway. Now, I am taking the trouble to tell you my side of the argument. It {{is not a question of}} your liking Clarke--that is none of my affair. It is simply that either he is not the man we all think him or you are acting in a way unbecoming a Zane. I do not purpose to have this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continue.</b> Now, enough of this beating about the bush." ...|$|E

25|$|The small half-timbered {{church was}} {{unusable}} after 1813 {{and had to}} be torn down in 1822 because it was at risk of collapsing. The congregation arranged to meet in a prayer room in a house near the manor. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the Church of the Redeemer was finished in 1844.|$|R
50|$|Thus when Wigtown or Whithorn {{were the}} {{returning}} burgh, with a casting {{vote in the}} event of a tie, the candidate backed by the Stewarts won. At other elections the Dalrymple supported candidate had a chance. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until 1784 when the Dalrymple interest gained control of the Whithorn Council.|$|R

50|$|Afterwards {{the castle}} became the {{residence}} of the Créqui-Lesdiguières family, who were the lords of Château de La Tour d'Aigues. Despite owning the castle, they never took residence in it, and this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> {{until the beginning of}} the French Revolution. After the Revolution, and despite having two more owners, the castle slowly descended into ruins.|$|R

50|$|The Arth company {{started by}} {{building}} {{the line from}} Rigi Staffelhöhe to Rigi Kulm, and this was ready for opening {{in time for the}} summer traffic in 1873. This line made an end-on connection with that from Vitznau and the Vitznau company operated their trains over it, paying the Arth company a ground rent for its use. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the merger in 1992.|$|R
50|$|This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> {{until the}} late 1990s, when growing support for mice with a scroll wheel after the 1996 {{introduction}} of Microsoft's IntelliMouse incidentally made 3-button pointing devices ubiquitous on OEM hardware. The one major holdout, Apple, finally went multi-button in 2005 with their Mighty Mouse, though all Apple laptops would continue to use one-button trackpads until their first buttonless trackpad in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the lack}} of resources, little {{modernisation}} of the house had taken place since Victorian times. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until 1946 when the miller and resident at that time, Henry Thomason, wired the house for electricity. Though the house had lights and power, Thomason refused to electrify the mill, saying it would be dangerous. When Thomason died in 1957, the mill sat unused for a time.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Luapula {{occasionally}} bursting its banks at Chembe in {{the rainy season}} and halting the Chembe Ferry for a few days, this happy <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the Congo Crisis of 1961 when travel on the pedicle stopped for security reasons {{and had to be}} routed by air or via Kasama. Although the interruption did not last long, it highlighted the vulnerability of the route.|$|R
50|$|The realm came to {{be ruled}} by the Mag Uidhir (Maguire) clan {{by the end of}} the 13th century and this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> on until 1607, when the last king of Fermanagh; Cú Chonnacht Óg Mag Uidhir; was one of the Gaelic Irish leaders who fled to the European Continent during the Flight of the Earls.

50|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948 this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> and {{the pattern of}} passenger and goods trains remained relatively unaffected by the new common ownership. However the decline in usage of {{the railways}}, especially local railways in sparsely populated areas, forced consideration of rationalisation, and {{it was determined that}} the former NBR route should continue, with the former SNER route closing. This took effect in 1967.|$|R
2500|$|Retirement {{and death}} {{eventually}} reduced the regimental strength in 1934 {{to just one}} combatant officer, Major Sir Ronald D Ross Bt, MC. This became a source of amusement in society and the North Irish Horse was given the sobriquet of the [...] "One Man Regiment". This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until 1938, when the British Government decided {{to increase the number}} of available regiments to meet the possible threat of war from the emergent Nazi regime in Germany.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{appropriation}} of church assets by the Church of Ireland, the majority population who adhered to Roman Catholicism were obliged to conduct their services elsewhere. From {{the time of the}} English Reformation onwards, those archbishops appointed by Rome had to make their throne in whichever house in Tipperary would hide them from the forces of the crown. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the late 18th century when some of the harsher provisions of the Penal Laws were relaxed.|$|R
25|$|Under Vail, AT began {{buying up}} {{many of the}} smaller {{telephone}} companies including Western Union telegraph. These actions brought unwanted attention from antitrust regulators. Anxious to avoid action from government antitrust suits, AT {{and the federal government}} entered into an agreement known as the Kingsbury Commitment. In the Kingsbury Commitment, AT and the government reached an agreement that allowed AT to continue operating as a monopoly. While AT periodically faced scrutiny from regulators, this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the company's breakup in 1984.|$|R
50|$|The {{temple was}} {{initially}} owned by Morakkala Mana, but {{the prosperity of}} family was challenged and the day-to-day affairs were in question. The high priest finally approached the Maharajah of Cochin and handed the temple over {{to him in the}} 1930s. The King ordered the renovation of the temple and the Nithya Nidhanam (daily pooja) was funded by Nadumittom Devasom. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> with minor changes until the Fall of the Kingdoms when India got Independence. Again the temple affairs was in disarray.|$|R

5000|$|Despite several sorties {{led by the}} French garrison, this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued.</b> On New Year's Eve, Boutellier {{asked for}} {{negotiations}} with the English. Following ten days of negotiation, the French defenders decided they would surrender on 19 January 1419 if no help had arrived. The surviving French {{would be allowed to}} keep their homes and property if they paid 300,000 gold crowns and swore allegiance to the English. Alain Blanchard, who had executed English prisoners, was executed by the English when the city fell.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} uneventful convoys followed, as the U-boat arm {{withdrew from the}} North Atlantic after Black May, a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> which <b>continued</b> {{until the end of}} the year.|$|R
2500|$|Furthermore, it {{headed off}} future legal turf wars by prohibiting the Supreme Court any {{jurisdiction}} {{in matters of}} revenue (Diwāni) or Regulations of the Government enacted by the British Parliament. [...] This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until 1797, when a new Act extended {{the jurisdiction of the}} Supreme Court to the province of Benares (which had since been added to the Company's dominions) and [...] "all places for the time being included in Bengal." [...] With the constituting of the Ceded and Conquered Provinces in 1805, the jurisdiction would extend as far west as Delhi.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1979 an {{election}} {{was held in}} Zimbabwe Rhodesia in which 63% of the black population voted, and on 1 June 1979, Bishop Abel Muzorewa {{was sworn in as}} the first black Prime Minister of Rhodesia. Meanwhile, the Peace Talks at Lancaster House continued in a rather [...] "on again-off again" [...] fashion. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until October and then as the light began to appear {{at the end of the}} tunnel, the United Kingdom sent out feelers to various Commonwealth nations that troops might be needed for a special operation.|$|R
50|$|Hubasha was {{one among}} the {{greatest}} marketplaces of Arabia. It {{was in the}} territory of the Azdi tribe in Tihama, six days' journey from Mecca. It was the last of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic Arabia) markets to be destroyed. For many years, it was overseen annually during the month of Rajab by troops appointed by the governor <b>of</b> Mecca. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until 197 AH (AD 812-813), when the governor's appointee was killed by a tribesman. Under the advice of Meccan scholars, the Governor of Mecca, Da'ud b. ‘Isa b. Musa, decided to destroy the market.|$|R
50|$|In 1600, a new Lê emperor {{took the}} throne, Lê Kính Tông. The new emperor, like the {{previous}} Lê emperors, was a powerless figurehead {{under the control}} of Trịnh Tùng. Also, a revolt broke out in Ninh Bình Province, possibly instigated by the Trịnh. As a consequence of these events, Nguyễn Hoàng formally broke off relations with the Court, rightly arguing that it was the Trịnh who ruled, not the Lê emperor. This uneasy <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> for the next 13 years until Nguyễn Hoàng died in 1613. He had ruled the southern provinces for 55 years.|$|R
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> to loom over Nerva's reign, and {{ultimately}} erupted into {{a crisis in}} October 97, {{when members of the}} Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|R
50|$|Despite the name, the archdiocese's episcopal seat (the cathedra) lies {{in neither}} of the towns of Cashel and Emly, but in nearby Thurles. This {{is due to the}} supplanting of the Roman Catholic archbishops from their see by the appointees of the crown on behalf of the {{established}} Church of Ireland. From the time of the English Reformation onwards, those archbishops appointed by the Holy See had to make their throne in whichever house in Tipperary would hide them from the forces of the Crown. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the late 18th century when some of the harsher provisions of the Penal Laws were relaxed.|$|R

50|$|Shirehampton {{looks across}} the Avon towards the rural Failand Hills of Somerset. For many centuries the only direct {{connection}} with Somerset was via a small rowed ferry which crossed from near The Lamplighters pub ("The Lamps") {{to the village of}} Pill, Somerset opposite. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the completion of the M5 Avonmouth Bridge in 1974. From the limestone ridge of Penpole Point (whose name meant approximately 'Land's End' in the Celtic language spoken here before English), there used to be extensive and far-reaching views across the River Severn to the distant hills of South Wales, but tree growth has restricted this once spectacular prospect.|$|R
40|$|Lake {{and river}} {{water is the}} prime source for drinking, {{irrigation}} and other domestic purposes. Bellandur Lake {{is one of the}} major Lakes of Bangalore city. The addition of effluents from urbanized Bangalore city has changed the characteristics of the Lake from being a natural ecologically healthy Lake to an artificial reservoir of domestic sewage and industrial effluents. The DO of the Bellandur Lake water ranged from 3. 8 - 6. 3 mg/l. The Bellandur lake water BOD ranged from 89 - 99 mg/l due to absorption of pollutants by aquatic flora in lake system. If the present <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continues</b> for long, the Bellandur Lake may soon become an ecologically inactive Lake...|$|R
50|$|The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> {{until the}} 1960s when IBM, already a leading {{hardware}} vendor, stopped work on existing systems and put all its effort into developing the System/360 series of machines, {{all of which}} used the same instruction and input/output architecture. IBM intended to develop a single operating system for the new hardware, the OS/360. The problems encountered {{in the development of}} the OS/360 are legendary, and are described by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month—a book that has become a classic of software engineering. Because of performance differences across the hardware range and delays with software development, a whole family of operating systems was introduced instead of a single OS/360.|$|R

50|$|In the Western Hindi-speaking areas, for a {{long time}} the {{prestige}} dialect was Braj Bhasha, but this was replaced in the 19th century by the Khariboli-based Hindustani. Hindustani was strongly influenced by Sanskrit and Persian, with these influences leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language. This <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>continued</b> until the division of the British Indian Empire in 1947, when Hindi became the official language in India and Urdu became official in Pakistan. Despite the different script the fundamental grammar remains identical, the difference is more sociolinguistic than on actual language basis. Today it is widely understood/spoken as a second or third language throughout South Asia {{and one of the most}} widely known languages in the world in terms of number of speakers.|$|R
