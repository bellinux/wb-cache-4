25|$|Pathological {{response}} {{can vary}} with the immune status of the host. Infection with B. henselae {{can result in a}} focal <b>suppurative</b> reaction (CSD in immunocompetent patients), a multifocal angioproliferative response (bacillary angiomatosis in immunocompromised patients), endocarditis, or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Ascending (<b>suppurative)</b> sialadenitis – an {{infection}} of the major salivary glands (usually the parotid gland) that may be recurrent. It is associated with hyposalivation, as bacteria are able to enter the ductal system against the diminished flow of saliva. There may be swollen salivary glands even without acute infection, possibly caused by autoimmune involvement.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} {{acute otitis media}} and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic <b>suppurative</b> otitis media have higher risks of developing conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Globally approximately 141nbsp&million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population). This {{is more common in}} males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).|$|E
25|$|BCG vaccine {{should be}} given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local {{infection}} and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either <b>suppurative</b> and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence {{for the treatment of}} these complications is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the disease, lymph nodes enlarge, as may occur in any {{infection}} of the same areas as well. Enlarged nodes are called buboes. Buboes are commonly painful. Nodes commonly become inflamed, thinning and fixation of the overlying skin. These changes may progress to necrosis, fluctuant and <b>suppurative</b> lymph nodes, abscesses, fistulas, strictures, and sinus tracts. During the infection and when it subsides and healing takes place, fibrosis may occur. This can result in varying degrees of lymphatic obstruction, chronic edema, and strictures. These late stages characterised by fibrosis and edema are also known as the third stage of LGV and are mainly permanent.|$|E
25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those children who do complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic <b>suppurative</b> otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Otitis {{media is}} a group of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic <b>suppurative</b> otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes of discharge from the ear. It may be a complication of acute otitis media. Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss. The hearing loss in OME, due to its chronic nature, may affect a child's ability to learn.|$|E
2500|$|Acute {{otitis media}} {{is very common}} in childhood. It {{is the most common}} {{condition}} for which medical care is provided in children under five years of age in the US. Acute otitis media affects 11% of people each year (709 million cases) with half occurring in those below five years. Chronic <b>suppurative</b> otitis media affects about 5% or 31 million of these cases with 22.6% of cases occurring annually under the age of five years. Otitis media resulted in 2,400 deaths in 2013 [...] down from 4,900 deaths in 1990.|$|E
