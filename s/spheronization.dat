40|$|<b>Spheronization</b> is a rapid {{process for}} {{production}} of microspheres. The process involves the dry mixing of drug with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), which on subsequent wetting with water forms a plastic mass suitable for extrusion and <b>spheronization.</b> As in any pharmaceutical operation, {{large number of}} factors may affect the production of pellets, which {{can be related to}} formulation or processing machinery.

Using ES (cross-hatch), ES (teardrop), and RP (teardrop), spheroids with similar mass median diameter (MMD) and span were produced using equivalent formulation and <b>spheronization</b> conditions. During <b>spheronization,</b> the teardrop-studded rotating frictional surface, with increased peripheral tip speed and duration, produced spheroids of equivalent MMD and span to those {{produced by the}} cross-hatch rotating frictional plate surface.

The present study investigated formulation and processing attributes in extrusion and <b>spheronization</b> necessary for design of MCC-free alginate spheroids. The physicochemical characteristics of these spheroids were examined and compared against MCC-Ioaded alginate spheroids using chlorpheniramine maleate and tolbutamide as water-soluble and poorly water-soluble drugs respectively. Alginate spheroids demonstrated a slower release of hydrophilic drug due to ease of matrix swelling and aggregation {{in the absence}} of MCC. This reduced their specific surface area for drug dissolution. Crosslinking of alginate with soluble calcium densified the surface of spheroids and hindered matrix aggregation. It led to faster drug release from alginate than alginate-MCC spheroids. Fast drug release was also noted in spheroids embedded with hydrophobic drug when MCC was absent as drug adsorbent.

Also, {{the effects of}} processing and silicification on CII materials were investigated. Particle modification through spray drying, wet granulation and <b>spheronization</b> was employed to improve CII performance. Spray-drying (SDCII) and wet granulation (WGCII) produced materials with no difference in mechanical or disintegration properties from unprocessed CII, but did show an increase in density and particle flow. Conversely, <b>spheronization</b> (SPCII) showed the poorest mechanical properties compared to CII. Further, SDCII showed better dilution potential than CII. Thus the advantages of SDCII were apparent when it was mixed with a poorly compressible drug (acetaminophen) because fibrous CII was converted to spheroidal particles through spray drying. The rapid disintegration of SDCII and CII compacts was due to water wicking through capillaries followed by compact bursting.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{preliminary}} results of co-extrusion and <b>spheronization</b> of wet masses are reported. A ram co-extruder, manufactured in-house, was designed with two concentric single dies mounted on two concentric and independent chambers. This equipment {{has allowed the}} production of three types of extrudates. (rod or solid extrudates, tubular or hollow extrudates. and co-extrudates). Different wet mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, a non-soluble in water dye and water were produced and used to feed the chambers of the ram co-extruder. Extrusions of the wet masses were carried out at different speeds of the ram (25 - 400 mm/min). The extrudates were evaluated according to surface characteristics (by visual inspection), force of extrusion and duration of steady-state (after recording the force applied to the ram and its displacement). Simultaneously, for each process of extrusion {{it was possible to}} assess the angles of convergence {{to the bottom of the}} chambers for both the external and internal chambers. These angles reflected the high complexity of the extrusion occurring on the external chamber in consequence of its annular geometry, in which the bisecting-line was not parallel to the axis of the extruder, by opposition to the converging angle in the internal chamber, where the bisecting-line was perfectly aligned to the axis of the extruder. Variations in the amount of water in the formulations and the speed of extrusion affected both the production and the quality of the extrudates and their ability to provide pellets. The rod extrudates were the easiest to produce and the relationships between the formulations, the processing conditions and the properties of the extrudates were immediately apparent. On the other hand, co-extrudates were more complex to characterise, although identical relationships between formulations, processing conditions and the properties of the co-extrudates were observed as for the rod extrudates. Different batches of extrudates (rod, tubular and co-extrudates) were spheronized to a maximum <b>spheronization</b> time of 10 min at 1000 rpm. The pellets were characterized with respect to size, size distribution, sphericity and density. Results have shown that for a larger diameter of the co-extrudates, the pellets produced were bigger (approximate to 3. 38 mm) than the pellets produced from rod extrudates (1. 22 mm). For longer times of <b>spheronization,</b> the aspect ratio and the density increased for both pellets produced from rod (0. 95 and 1. 46 g/cm(3)) and co-extrudates (0. 90 and 1. 47 g/cm(3)).

The traditional approach determined an organic system was necessary for Propranolol HCl to yield a stable extended release product. The aqueous sustained release coating studies for Metoprolol Succinate found the polymer coating level, humidified curing condition, and curing duration were important factors. Altering the excipient blend formulation during initial tabletting trials minimized segregation and bead damage. ^ The full factorial design {{for the development of}} immediate release beads identified <b>spheronization</b> time as a statistically significant factor in determining the standard deviation and relative standard deviation for sphericity. The Box-Behnken design for sustained release beads found the polymer coating levels to be a statistically significant main effect for the dissolution profile. Significant surface damage was apparent throughout the full factorial tabletting design, with a “best case” approach yielding an improved dissolution profile.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the phase transitions occurring in nitrofurantoin and theophylline formulations during pelletization by extrusion-spheronization. An at-line process analytical technology (PAT) approach was used to increase the understanding of the solid-state behavior of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) during pelletization. Raman spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were used in the characterization of polymorphic changes during the process. Samples were collected at the end of each processing stage (blending, granulation, extrusion, <b>spheronization,</b> and drying). Batches were dried at 3 temperature levels (60 °C, 100 °C, and 135 °C). Water induced a hydrate formation in both model formulations during processing. NIR spectroscopy gave valuable real-time data about the state of water in the system, but it was not able to detect the hydrate formation in the theophylline and nitrofurantoin formulations during the granulation, extrusion, and <b>spheronization</b> stages because of the saturation of the water signal. Raman and XRPD measurement results confirmed the expected pseudopolymorphic changes of the APIs in the wet process stages. The relatively low level of Raman signal with the theophylline formulation complicated the interpretation. The drying temperature had a significant effect on dehydration. For a channel hydrate (theophylline), dehydration occurred at lower drying temperatures. In the case of isolated site hydrate (nitrofurantoin), dehydration was observed at higher temperatures.

40|$|Objective: The {{effects of}} type and {{concentration}} of binding agent on properties of Eudragit RS based pellets were studied. Materials and methods: Pellets containing ibuprofen (60 %), Eudragit RS (30 %), Avicel (10 %) were prepared by extrusion <b>spheronization.</b> PVP K 30, PVP K 90, HPMC 6 cp, HPMC K 100 LV or HPMC K 4 M {{were used as}} binders in concentrations of 2, 4 or 6 % based on the total weight of formulation. The process efficiency, pellet shape, size distribution, crushing strength, elastic modulus and drug release were examined. The effect of curing on pellet properties was also investigated. Results: The process of extrusion <b>spheronization</b> became difficult with increase in binder viscosity and/or concentration. An increase in binder viscosity and/or concentration resulted in reduction in the yield of pellets, wider particle size distribution and departure from spherical shape {{especially in the case}} of HPMC binder. The crushing strength and elastic modulus of pellets decreased with increase in PVPs concentration. However this was not the case for pellets containing HPMCs. Drug release rate increased as the concentration of binder increased. Pellets containing 2 %w/w of PVP K 30 showed the slowest release rate. For those pellets with brittle nature, curing changed the behavior of pellet under mechanical test to plastic deformation. Yield point and elastic modulus of all formulations decreased after curing. Curing decreased the drug release rate. Conclusion: Binder type and concentration significantly affected the properties of pellets.

A factorial design revealed {{the effects of}} microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), polyethylene oxide (PEO), water, and <b>spheronization</b> speed and time on pellet properties. Response surface modeling allowed optimization of the responses with expansion to a central composite design. Pellet yield, size, shape, friability and drug release profile were studied, along with surface and interior morphology. Pellets were spherical irrespective of the formulation and process variables and exhibited physical and mechanical characteristics appropriate for further processing. Yield in the 12 / 20 mesh cut was lower with FPEC than observed with coarse particle ethylcellulose (CPEC), but FPEC-containing pellets were more rugged and the PEO to obtain optimal pellets was lower for FPEC compared to CPEC. Immediate release products were obtained and ethylcellulose particle size was of no consequence to drug release. Observed responses for the optimized product agreed with predicted values, demonstrating {{the success of the}} optimization procedure. These results suggest that FPEC is a good diluent for extrusion-spheronization...|$|E
40|$|Drying is {{a common}} {{pharmaceutical}} process, whose potential to modify the final drug and/or dosage form properties is often underestimated. In the present study, pellets consisting of the matrix former calcium stearate (CaSt) incorporating the active pharmaceutical ingredient ibuprofen were prepared via wet extrusion and <b>spheronization.</b> Subsequent drying was performed by either desiccation, fluid-bed drying, or lyophilization, and the final pellets were compared {{with respect to their}} microstructure. To minimize the effect of solute ibuprofen molecules on the shrinking behavior of the CaSt, low ibuprofen loadings were used, as ibuprofen is soluble in the granulation liquid. Pellet porosity and specific surface area increased during desiccation, fluid-bed drying, and lyophilization. The inlet-air temperature during fluid-bed drying affected the specific surface area, which increased at lower inlet-air temperatures rather than the pellet porosity. The in vitro dissolution profiles were found to be a nonlinear function of the specific surface area. Overall, the microstructure, including porosity, pore size, and specific surface area, of CaSt pellets was a strong function of the drying conditions...|$|E
40|$|In present times, the {{pelletization}} {{technologies are}} gaining much attention as they represent an efficient pathway for manufacture of oral drug delivery systems. This {{is due to}} the reason that pellets offer many therapeutic, technological as well as biopharmaceutical advantages over the conventional oral dosage forms. Pelletization technique enables the formation of spherical beads or pellets with a mean diameter usually ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 0 mm which can be eventually coated for preparation of modified release dosage forms. Pelletization leads to an improvement in flowability, appearance and mixing properties thus avoiding generation of excessive dust and reducing segregation, and, generally, eliminating undesirable properties and improving the physical and chemical properties of fine powders. Pellets are produced by various techniques, such as, extrusion/ <b>spheronization,</b> layering, cryopelletization, freeze pelletization, spray congealing, spray drying and compression. Amongst various techniques, Extrusion/Spheronization technique is the most widely utilized technique due to its high efficiency and simple and fast processing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review some general aspects about pellets and pelletization and some common techniques being utilized in the pharmaceutical industry...|$|E
