5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks <b>softwoods,</b> including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} to {{classify}} wood as either softwood or hardwood. The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from dicotyledons (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and <b>softwoods</b> are not necessarily soft.

40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can delignify and {{brighten}} unbleached hardwood kraft pulp {{within a few}} days, but <b>softwood</b> kraft pulps require longer treatment. To determine the contributions of higher residual lignin contents (kappa numbers) and structural differences in lignins to the recalcitrance of <b>softwood</b> kraft pulps to biobleaching, we tested <b>softwood</b> and hardwood pulps cooked to the same kappa numbers, 26 and 12. A low-lignin-content (overcooked) <b>softwood</b> pulp resisted delignification by T. versicolor, but a high-lignin-content (lightly cooked) hardwood pulp was delignified {{at the same rate}} as a normal <b>softwood</b> pulp. Thus, the longer time taken by T. versicolor to brighten <b>softwood</b> kraft pulp than hardwood pulp results from the higher residual lignin content of the <b>softwood</b> pulp; possible differences in the structures of the residual lignins are important only when the lignin becomes highly condensed. Under the conditions used in this study, when an improved fungal inoculum was used, six different <b>softwood</b> pulps were all substantially brightened by T. versicolor. <b>Softwood</b> pulps whose lignin contents were decreased by extended modified continuous cooking or oxygen delignification to kappa numbers as low as 15 were delignified by T. versicolor {{at the same rate as}} normal <b>softwood</b> pulp.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{assess the}} {{potential}} use of both <b>softwood</b> and hardwood bark broiler litters as a feedstuff for ruminants, the nutrient composition and in vitro digestibility for both raw and ensiled bark litters were chemically evaluated and compared to <b>softwood</b> planer shavings broiler litter.

Ensiling studies showed the lactic acid content was higher for hardwood bark litters than for <b>softwood</b> planer shavings. <b>Softwood</b> bark litter contained the least amount of lactic acid after fermentation in mini-silos. In vitro dry matter digestibility was higher for hardwood bark litters than for <b>softwood</b> bark litters or <b>softwood</b> planer shavings. No difference in in vitro dry matter digestibility was observed between raw and ensiled bark litter. No differences in ash, phosphorus, ether extract, nitrogen, total energy, and acid detergent fiber content were observed among the litters tested. The pH. of ensiled hardwood bark was lower than ensiled <b>softwood</b> bark. Results indicate that from a nutritive standpoint, bark litters are potentially useful as a ruminant feed.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States and Canada {{have been involved in}} a long-standing dispute regarding the <b>softwood</b> lumber trade. Canada is the primary exporter of <b>softwood</b> lumber to the United States. In 2008, Canada exported approximately $ 3. 2 billion worth of <b>softwood</b> lumber products to the United States, about 17 times the amount supplied by the next biggest exporter to the United States. After several years of litigation related to U. S. allegations of unfair Canadian subsidies, the United States and Canada signed the 2006 <b>Softwood</b> Lumber Agreement ("agreement"). The agreement ended ongoing litigation and requires, among other things, Canadian federal and provincial governments to establish export charges and quotas for Canadian lumber exports and for the two countries to exchange information to support monitoring compliance with the agreement. In 2008, the United States passed the <b>Softwood</b> Lumber Act that requires, among other things, that the U. S. government reconcile and verify <b>softwood</b> lumber trade data. The act also requires GAO to report on (1) whether countries that export <b>softwood</b> lumber or <b>softwood</b> lumber products to the United States are complying with international agreements entered into by those countries and the United States; and (2) the effectiveness of the U. S. government in carrying out the reconciliations and verifications mandated by the <b>Softwood</b> Lumber Act. This letter contains information in response to the first mandate concerning compliance with international <b>softwood</b> lumber agreements. In accordance with our agreement with the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Ways and Means Committee, we will issue a separate report in December 2009 that will supply additional information and findings on U. S. efforts to monitor compliance and will also address U. S. efforts to reconcile and verify <b>softwood</b> value data. We focused on Canada because it is the only country with which the United States has an agreement specifically related to <b>softwood</b> lumber and is by far the largest exporter of <b>softwood</b> lumber to the United States. We are not conducting a legal review of compliance with the <b>Softwood</b> Lumber Agreement. Our objectives in this review are to describe (1) U.

The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood.

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{softwood}} and hardwoods timbers {{are used as}} ties, oak, jarrah and karri being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources.

Softwood is treated, while creosote is the most common preservative for railway ties, preservatives are also sometimes used such as pentachlorophenol, chromated copper arsenate and a few other preservatives. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as copper azole or micronized copper. New boron-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas.

25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable <b>softwoods</b> at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E

Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of timber products in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., {{where many of the}} forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and <b>softwoods.</b> Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, forest destruction by the private sector is routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran’s forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran’s Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year.
