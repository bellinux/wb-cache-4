5|$|The {{motorway}} {{carries a}} considerable {{volume of traffic}} throughout the year; however, in the summer, its peak volume is nearly double the average, as traffic intensifies because of tourists travelling to Adriatic Sea resorts and back. Furthermore, the southernmost sections of the motorway serve Zagreb's sizeable <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The road, {{as well as}} {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. The road carries an annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer as the road is used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of the road is significantly more congested as it carries Pula <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heavier <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Melbourne network saw {{a greater}} {{strain on the}} block working then used, which {{required}} {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} London <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> caused {{problems in}} the King's Cross area, as there were only 2 tracks through the various tunnels, and also goods trains entering King's Cross goods yard had to cross the down line on the level. Pending doubling of the tunnels, a connection was made between Finsbury Park and the North London Railway at Canonbury, and some <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> then ran into Broad Street. The Broad Street trains were operated by the NLR as the LNWR, part owners of Broad Street, blocked GNR attempts to gain access.|$|E
25|$|Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) {{coaches are}} used for <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> in large cities – mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches {{numbered}} 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.|$|E
25|$|The Albion to Jacana line {{opened on}} 1 July 1929 to allow freight trains {{to avoid the}} steeper grades and busy <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Broadmeadows line via Essendon. Built as double track, two major steel viaducts were {{required}} to cross the Maribyrnong River and Moonee Ponds Creek valleys. In 1962 the east line was converted to standard gauge {{as part of the}} Melbourne to Sydney gauge standardisation project.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century the Leith station was {{unsuitable}} for the developing <b>suburban</b> passenger <b>traffic,</b> and a new branch to Leith Central station was built, opening in 1903.|$|R
50|$|In 1920, {{the line}} {{was taken over by}} the Deutsche Reichsbahn. It {{attained}} great importance for long distance, regional and <b>suburban</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} in freight traffic.|$|R
25|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{financial}} recovery lay in the exploitation of London <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic.</b> By the late 1880s the LB had developed the largest suburban network of any British railway, with 68 route miles in the suburbs {{in addition to its}} main lines, in three routes between London Bridge and Victoria: the South London Line, the outer South London Line and the Crystal Palace lines, and the LB was earning more from season tickets than any other British railway.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, the Metropolitan Railway built {{a branch}} from its main line at Wembley Park to Stanmore. The line, {{as with many}} others in the {{northwest}} London area, was designed to absorb commuter traffic from the new and rapidly expanding suburbs. The line presented the Metropolitan with a problem – so successful was the <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> that, by the early 1930s, the lines into Baker Street were becoming overloaded, a problem which was exacerbated by the post-war flight from the City of London to the West End of London.|$|E
25|$|It {{opened in}} stages from 1888, being {{extended}} to Neilston and Newton, giving the Caledonian Railway a fully independent route by 1904. At the Ayrshire end the line duplicated the existing Glasgow and South Western Railway route {{at a time}} when bulk coal exports could be handled more economically in Clydebank, so that {{the primary purpose of the}} line was short-lived. The Caledonian Railway hoped to develop <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> in south Glasgow where the new line passed through those districts, but street tramcars limited the success of this.|$|E

50|$|The Great Northern Railway (GNR) Class L1 (LNER Class R1) was a 0-8-2T side tank steam {{locomotive}} designed by Henry Ivatt. It was originally designed for <b>suburban</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> on the Metropolitan City Lines.|$|R
25|$|When World War II hit, the VR had {{no chance}} to rebuild, with {{resources}} being directed towards the war effort, only patch up work and essential maintenance was possible. Furthermore, passenger travel had been restricted by government, then cut even further due to fuel shortages, with trains taking longer and buffet carriages removed. Despite this, in 1948-49 country passenger business was up 76 percent on that of 1938-39, which were considered the best pre war years, and <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> was up 22 percent. In addition, goods traffic was up by 53 percent, with more goods being handled {{than any of the}} war years.|$|E
25|$|The LB greatly {{encouraged}} commuters into London {{by reducing}} the prices of season tickets and introducing special workmen's trains for manual workers in 1870. This ultimately changed {{the character of the}} railway and had a profound influence upon its motive power policy and passenger train services. In the 1870s and 1880s it led to the building of new standard tank engine classes such as the Terrier and D1 classes under William Stroudley. R. J. Billinton replaced these with the D3, E3, E4, and E5 classes designed for London suburban services, during the 1890s. When steam locomotives became unable to cope with the increased <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> and competition from electric trams in the early twentieth century, it resulted in the electrification of the London suburban network.|$|E
25|$|With the Southern Railway {{concentrating on}} the design of larger {{locomotives}} for the increasingly heavy express passenger traffic on the South Eastern and South Western sections, with designs such as the King Arthur, Schools and Lord Nelson classes, and later the Bulleid Pacifics, as well as the expansion of the electrified third rail system from suburban roles (a system which had replaced the LB overhead electrification, which in turn had replaced the role of the D class tanks on <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> from around 1910), the company was not concerned about replacing the veteran tank engines on branch line workings, especially as many of the smaller branch lines were not economically viable for electrification, or were isolated {{from the rest of the}} electrified network. As a result, the Southern Railway felt that perseverance with the older locomotives such as the A1X on rural routes was the most economically viable option.|$|E
50|$|A railway {{connecting}} Moscow with Kashin {{and further}} with Sonkovo and Saint-Petersburg crosses {{the eastern part}} of the district. There is a regular <b>suburban</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> between Moscow and Savyolovo, and a regular infrequent traffic between Savyolovo and Kashin.|$|R
50|$|Since 2009, {{the company}} is not a direct carrier of passengers. The <b>suburban</b> <b>traffics</b> are {{exercised}} by the passenger companies founded by the executive agencies of the Russian Federation, Russian Railways and private investors. These are such companies as JSC TSPPK, LLC Aeroexpress, JSC CSPC and so on. By 2012, the number of SPCsin Russia has reached 26. Especially for the SPC a zero tariff {{for the use of}} railway infrastructure was introduced. Russian Railways receives 25 billion rubles subsidies as compensation annually from the State. Commuter traffic in the whole network increased in 2011 on 5.6% and is about 878.33 million people. Passenger turnover rail in the Russian regions ranges from 5% to 30% in total passenger traffic.|$|R

500|$|Upon opening, Cannon Street Station was a {{stopping}} point for all services {{to and from}} Charing Cross, including boat trains to Continental Europe. A shuttle service between the two stations ran every 20 minutes and became a popular way of travelling between the City and the West End. However, {{the opening of the}} District Railway as far as Blackfriars caused traffic to drop off, and its extension to Mansion House the following year reduced it further. The SER's route could not compete with the Underground, which was more direct and reliable, but <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> to Cannon Street remained popular, and the bridge was widened to [...] in the late 1880s, allowing ten tracks with sidings. The rebuilt bridge was opened on 13 February 1892. The signal boxes outside the station were upgraded the following year.|$|E
500|$|<b>Suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> quickly grew {{with the}} opening of {{stations}} at Hornsey in 1850, Holloway Road in 1856, [...] in 1859 and Seven Sisters Road (now [...] ) in 1861. Midland Railway services to [...] via [...] and [...] began running from King's Cross on 1 February 1858. More platforms were added in 1862; No.2 was full-length but No.3 was stepped into the northern end of the station. In 1866, a connection was made via the Metropolitan Railway to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway at , with goods and passenger services to South London via [...] A separate suburban station {{to the west of the}} main building, housing platforms 911 [...] and known initially as [...] "Kings Cross Main Line (Local) Station", opened in August 1875. It was followed by a connection to the Metropolitan line on 1 February 1878. Two platforms (now 5 and 6) were opened on 18 December 1893 to cater for increased traffic demands. An iron footbridge was built halfway down the train shed to connect all the platforms. By 1880, half the traffic at King's Cross was suburban.|$|E
2500|$|... 30th Street Station {{displays}} its majestic—and traditional—architectural {{style with}} its enormous waiting room and its vestibules. The station, {{in spite of}} its architectural classicism, opened in 1933, when modern and Art Deco styles were more popular. Its construction was needed to accommodate increased intercity and <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic.</b> It replaced the 32nd Street Station (West Philadelphia). It is now the primary rail station in Philadelphia, serving long-distance and commuter trains.|$|E
50|$|A railway {{connecting}} Moscow with Kashin {{and further}} with Sonkovo and Saint-Petersburg passes Kimry.

50|$|The passenger-only {{station was}} opened on 10 April 1878. On 4 October 1925 an {{electric}} S-Bahn train reached the station {{for the first}} time. While south of Birkenwerder station the tracks for <b>suburban</b> and long-distance <b>traffic</b> were separate, both services shared the tracks north of it, and thus also in Lehnitz station. One track of the line was lifted after 1945 for war reparations. After it was relaid, <b>suburban</b> and long-distance <b>traffic</b> each used a separate track. Since only S-Bahn trains stopped in Lehnitz, the eastern platform was therefore not used from 1964.|$|R
2500|$|While the Metropolitan was run as {{an outer}} {{suburban}} route with steam-hauled trains and goods services, the LPTB wished {{to focus on}} electrified trains and <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic.</b> Goods services were passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, which also took {{over the role of}} providing steam locomotives for trains beyond the end of electrification at Rickmansworth. All services north-west of [...] were withdrawn by 1936 though services returned to [...] between 1943 and 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{rostered}} for <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{the class}} was soon displaced to the countryside by Dugald Drummond's M7 class. [...] Most of {{the class was}} scrapped {{around the end of}} the First World War, and further decreases meant that all of them were due to be withdrawn by 1929. [...] However, the class was noted for its long service on the Lyme Regis branch line, and three members of this long obsolete class were utilised on this duty until 1962, when suitable replacements became available. [...] One has survived and {{can be found on the}} Bluebell Railway.|$|E
2500|$|South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR) : the SE&CR was a {{so-called}} working union in 1899 of two railways {{in the south}} east of England; the South Eastern Railway (opened in 1842) and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (1859). [...] Like the LB&SCR and the L&SWR, it had a large <b>suburban</b> <b>traffic</b> base and served many of the south east coast seaside resorts. [...] As a result of merging the two networks it had more London termini than any other company: London Bridge and Victoria (both shared with LB&SC), Charing Cross, Blackfriars and Holborn Viaduct. [...] Its main lines ran from these termini via Maidstone or Tonbridge, and Ashford, to Ramsgate, Dover, Folkestone and Hastings.|$|E
