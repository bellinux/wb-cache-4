30|$|From these results, the {{shrinkage}} {{factors of}} the structure height and in-plane direction periodicity were approximately 16 % for both sizes. In this templating process, {{we believe that the}} shrinkage of solution-derived ZnO itself did not dominantly contribute to the shrinkage of the resultant 3 D structure because the structural features strongly depend on the SU- 8 template that works as a starting framework. Therefore, this indicates that the solution-derived ZnO shrinking has an effect on the thickness of ZnO nanoshells and does not affect the periodicity of the in-plane direction for the resultant structure. Thus, when fabricating precise and accurate 3 D structures, {{it is important to consider}} the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factor.</b> We compared the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factor</b> {{of the structure}} height in this study to that in a similar study [23] using a polymeric template and TiO 2 precursor.

40|$|Ridge {{regression}} with heteroscedastic marker variances {{provides an}} alternative to Bayesian genome-wide prediction methods. Our objectives were to suggest new methods to determine marker-specific <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors</b> for heteroscedastic ridge regression and to investigate their properties with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy of estimated effects. We analyzed published data sets of maize, wheat, and sugar beet as well as simulated data with the new methods. Ridge regression with <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors</b> that were proportional to single-marker analysis of variance estimates of variance components (i. e., RRWA) was the fastest method. It required computation times of less than 1 sec for medium-sized data sets, which have dimensions that are common in plant breeding. A modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm that yields heteroscedastic marker variances (i. e., RMLV) resulted in the most accurate marker effect estimates. It outperformed the homoscedastic ridge regression approach for best linear unbiased prediction in particular for situations with high marker density and strong linkage disequilibrium along the chromosomes, a situation that occurs often in plant breeding populations. We conclude that the RRWA and RMLV approaches provide alternatives to the commonly used Bayesian methods, in particular for applications in which computational feasibility or accuracy of effect estimates are important, such as detection or functional analysis of genes or planning crosses...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} low-complexity {{adaptive}} biased estimation algorithms, called group-based shrinkage estimators (GSEs), for parameter estimation and interference suppression scenarios with mechanisms to automatically adjust the shrinkage factors.

GSE schemes improve the performance of the conventional least squares (LS) estimator in terms of the mean-squared error (MSE), while requiring a very modest increase in complexity. An MSE analysis is presented which indicates the lower bounds of the GSE schemes with different group sizes. We prove that our proposed schemes outperform the biased estimation with only one <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factor</b> and the best performance of GSE can be obtained with the maximum number of groups.

PnP is a method to form 3 D polymeric periodic structures utilizing a 3 D intensity distribution of light into a photopolymer, generated by the passage of light through a phase shift mask with periodic relief patterns. This process has high flexibility in the design of structural sizes by changing the relief pattern because the intensity distribution depends strongly on its design. Thus, this process can resolve the problems of templating process from colloidal self-assembly such as difficulty in structural modification and non-uniformity caused from defects [30]. The purpose of this study is to fabricate a nanoshell-based 3 D hierarchical architecture by a consistent non-vacuum method using solution-derived ZnO.

A global, multi-stage chemical kinetic mechanism was integrated into the main framework of the CFD model and employed to account for the process of biomass devolatilization. A 3 -parameter shrinkage model was used to describe the variation in particle size due to biomass decomposition. This particle shrinkage model was then used in combination with a quadrature method of moment (QMOM) to solve the particle population balance equation (PBE). The evolution of biomass particle size in the fluidized bed was obtained for several different patterns of particle shrinkage, which were represented by different values of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors.</b> In addition, pore formation inside the biomass particle was simulated for these shrinkage patterns, and thus, the density variation of biomass particles is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{a one-way}} layout with one {{directional}} observation per factor level. Each ob-served direction is {{a unit vector}} in Rp measured with random error. Information accom-panying the measurements suggests that the mean directions, normalized to unit length, follow a trend: the factor levels are ordinal and mean directions at nearby factor levels may be close. Measured positions of the paleomagnetic north pole in time illustrate this design. The directional trend estimators studied in this paper stem from penalized least squares (PLS) fits in which the penalty function is the squared norm of first-order or second-order differences of mean vectors at adjacent factor levels. Expressed in spectral form, such PLS estimators suggest a much larger class of monotone shrinkage estimators that use the orthog-onal basis implicit in PLS. Penalty weights and, more generally, monotone <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors</b> are selected to minimize estimated risk.

40|$|Efficient {{portfolio}} is a portfolio that yields maximum expected return given {{a level of}} risk or has a minimum level of risk given a level of expected return. However, the optimal portfolios {{do not seem to}} be as efficient as intended. Especially during financial crisis period, optimal {{portfolio is}} not an optimal investment as it does not yield maximum return given a specific level of risk, and vice versa. One possible explanation for an unimpressive performance of the seemingly efficient portfolio is incorrectness in parameter estimates called “estimation risk in parameter estimates”. Six different estimating strategies are employed to explore ex-post-portfolio performance when estimation risk is incorporated. These strategies are traditional Mean-Variance (EV), Adjusted Beta (AB) approach, Resampled Efficient Frontier (REF), Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Single Index Model (SIM), and Single Index Model incorporating <b>shrinkage</b> Bayesian <b>factor</b> namely, Bayesian Single Index Model (BSIM).

40|$|The {{two-level}} normal {{hierarchical model}} (NHM) {{has played a}} critical role in the theory of small area estimation (SAE), one of the growing areas in statistics with numerous applications in different disciplines. In this paper, we address major well-known shortcomings associated with the empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) of a small area mean and its mean squared error (MSE) estimation by considering an appropriate model variance estimator that satisfies multiple properties. The proposed model variance estimator simultaneously (i) improves on the estimation of the related <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors,</b> (ii) protects EBLUP from the common overshrinkage problem, (iii) avoids complex bias correction in generating strictly positive second-order unbiased mean square error (MSE) estimator either by the Taylor series or single parametric bootstrap method.

We suggest an approach with multiple imputation via van Buurens MICE library followed by stepwise model selection.

A generalized Wald-test by Rubin gives suitable diagnostics for {{the next step in}} the model selection procedure. Once we know how to do the model selection on a series of imputed datasets using a proportional hazards approach, we can repeat this procedure any number of times in a bootstrap setting. In this way it is possible to assess the calibration and discrimination abilities of our final model following the approach of Harrell et al. The bootstrap also enables to estimate the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>factors</b> for the final model to get a better calibration.
