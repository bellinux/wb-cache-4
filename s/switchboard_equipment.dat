There has been growing in-terest in the development of new microactuator technologies with an increasing re-quirement for low cost microswitch arrays providing large air gap and large force at the same time. In particular, large air gap/large force microactuators are essential for high voltage switching in automobile electronics, test <b>equipment</b> <b>switchboards</b> and in net-work remote reconfiguration.

The necessity {{to reduce the size of}} actuators and at the same time increase the force and the air gap has placed severe constraints on the suitability of current microactuator technology for various applications. This has led to {{the development}} of new actuator technologies based on novel materials or modifying existing systems. As an effort in this direction, this thesis presents the details of the work on the design, fabrication and testing of a new hybrid microactuator, combining electromagnetic and piezoelectric actuation mechanisms. The design and fabrication of electromagnetic actuators using planar coils and a soft magnetic core has long been established. However, in many instances these designs are constrained by difficulties in the fabrication of the multi layer planar coils, which is tedious, often resulting in a low yield. Hence device performance is limited by the|$|R
