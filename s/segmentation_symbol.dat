The handwritten mathematical expression is preprocessed and rendered to an image.

The stroke pair shape context features covers the current stroke and the following stroke in time series. The local neighborhood shape context features includes the current stroke and its three nearest neighbor strokes in distance while the global shape context features covers the expression.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{the recent}} {{advances}} in handwriting recognition, handwritten two-dimensional (2 D) languages are still a challenge. Electrical schemas, chemical equations and mathematical expressions (MEs) are examples of such 2 D languages. In this case, the recognition problem is particularly difﬁcult due to the two dimensional layout of the language. This paper presents an online handwritten mathematical expression recognition system that handles mathematical expression recognition as a simultaneous optimization of expression <b>segmentation,</b> <b>symbol</b> recognition, and 2 D structure recognition under the restriction of a mathematical expression grammar. The originality of the approach is a global strategy allowing learning mathematical symbols and spatial relations directly from complete expressions. A new contextual modeling is proposed for combining syntactic and structural information. Those models are used to ﬁnd the most likely combination of segmentation/recognition hypotheses proposed by a 2 D segmentation scheme. Thus, models are based on structural information concerning the symbol layout.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method to segment printed mathematical documents precisely and extract formulas automatically from their images. Unlike prior methods, {{it is more}} directed towards the segmentation rather than the recognition, isolating mathematical formulas outside and inside text-lines. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} delimit parts of text that could disturb OCR application, not yet trained for formula recognition and restructuring. The method is based on a global and a local segmentation. The global segmentation separates isolated formulas from the text lines using a primary labeling. The local segmentation propagates the context around the meted mathematical operators to discard embedded formulas from plain text. The primary labeling identifies some mathematical symbols by models created at a learning step using fuzzy logic. The secondary labeling reinforces the results of the primary labeling and locates the subscripts and the superscripts inside the text. Some heuristics has been defined that guides this automatic process. In this paper, the different modules making up the automated segmentation of mathematical document system are presented with examples of results. Experiments done on some commonly seen mathematical documents, show that our proposed method can achieve quite satisfactory rate making mathematical formula extraction more feasible for real-world applications. The average rate of primary labeling 2 of mathematical operators is about 95. 3 % and their secondary labeling can improve the rate about 4 %.

40|$|Math {{expressions}} are {{an essential}} part of scientific documents. Handwritten math expressions recognition can benefit human-computer interaction especially in the education domain and is a critical part of document recognition and analysis. Parsing the spatial arrangement of symbols is {{an essential part}} of math expression recognition. A variety of parsing techniques have been developed during the past three decades, and fall into two groups. The first group is graph-based parsing. It selects a path or sub-graph which obeys some rule to form a possible interpretation for the given expression. The second group is grammar driven parsing. Grammars and related parameters are defined manually for different tasks. The time complexity of these two groups parsing is high, and they often impose some strict constraints to reduce the computation. The aim of this thesis is working towards building a straightforward and effective parser with as few constraints as possible. First, we propose using a line of sight graph for representing the layout of strokes and symbols in math expressions. It achieves higher F-score than other graph representations and reduces search space for parsing. Second, we modify the shape context feature with Parzen window density estimation. This feature set works well for symbol <b>segmentation,</b> <b>symbol</b> classification and symbol layout analysis. We get a higher symbol segmentation F-score than other systems on CROHME 2014 dataset. Finally, we develop a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) based parser using Edmonds 2 ̆ 7 algorithm, which extracts an MST from the directed line of sight graph in two passes: first symbols are segmented, and then symbols and spatial relationship are labeled. The time complexity of our MST-based parsing is lower than the time complexity of CYK parsing with context-free grammars. Also, our MST-based parsing obtains higher structure rate and expression rate than CYK parsing when symbol segmentation is accurate. Correct structure means we get the structure of the symbol layout tree correct, even though the label of the edge in the symbol layout tree might be wrong. The performance of our math expression recognition system with MST-based parsing is competitive on CROHME 2012 and 2014 datasets. For future work, how to incorporate symbol classifier result and correct segmentation error in MST-based parsing needs more research...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{has been}} a natural way for humans to express their {{thoughts}} and ideas since ancient times. People got used to create and understand illustrations. Many wellde ned formal notations have evolved including technical drawings, musical scores, and various diagrams. On the other hand, people use free-form sketches or ad hoc intuitive notations often. Electronic devices equipped with a touch screen take part in our daily lives and make {{it is easier to}} create and share drawings. Naturally, it is more and more desired to have methods for automatic recognition and understanding of drawings. It is much easier and desired in the case of formal drawings consisting of well de ned entities. A computer system can work further with such recognized drawing { beautify the drawing, rearrange a diagram, perform some actions according to a diagram, or manufacture something according to a technical drawing. On the other hand, it is extremely di cult and potentially unnecessary in the case of free-form sketches. It is often enough to provide the user with tools for easier creation and manipulation with sketches. The reason is that these sketches are meant to be understood by humans only and the computer system serves for their creation, storage, and sharing. Obviously, we can classify drawing into formal drawings and free-from sketching. This thesis deals with two tasks: recognition of formally de ned diagrams and segmentation of object of interest in free-form sketches. These two apparently di erent topics are strongly related. We assume that the drawing is created on an electronic device and thus it is in form of a sequence of strokes rather than a raster image. We propose a recognition framework for arrow-connected diagrams. We introduce a model for recognition by selection of symbol candidates, based on evaluation of relations between candidates using a set of predicates. It is suitable for simpler structures, in which the relations are explicitly given by symbols, arrows in the case of diagrams. Knowledge of a speci c diagram domain is used. The two domains are owcharts and nite automata. We created a benchmark database of diagrams from these two domains. Although the individual pipeline steps are tailored for these, the system can be readily adapted for other domains. The recognition pipeline consists of the following major steps: text/non-text separation, symbol <b>segmentation,</b> <b>symbol</b> classi cation, and structural analysis. We performed a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for recognition of owcharts and nite automata and veri ed that our approach outperforms them. We also analysed our system thoroughly and identi ed most frequent causes of recognition failures. The situation is more complicated {{in the case of a}} free-from sketching where the user can draw and write anything freely. We cannot expect any particular structure. We can often nd a combination of pictorial drawing with more structured gures and text in form of labels. The classical segmentation by recognition can not be used here. In some cases, the understanding of a sketch might be di cult even for humans. Speci cally, the identi cation of an individual object in a drawing may di er from user to user, case to case. Recent research showed that a single linkage agglomerative clustering of strokes with trainable distance function can be used for segmentation of objects from prede ned symbol classes in formal drawings. The proper distance function can be learned from annotated data. It requires a lot of data and time. We propose an approach combining several pre-trained distance functions for particular structures together to segment object in free-form sketches. We show that the desired segmentation can be achieved in many cases by combining together distance functions trained for very general object types like rows, columns, words, or compact images. We also show that the best combination of distance functions can be found from a very limited data in real time. We propose a segmentation approach, which estimates the optimal combination of clustering distance functions from an initial selection of one object. It results in segmentation of objects, which have similar characteristics to the initial one. Based on this approach, we designed a selection tool bringing additional functionality allowing to select and manipulate the segmented objects seamlessly. The method is suitable for fast rearrangement of sketches during collaborative content creation (brainstorming). Katedra kybernetik...|$|E
