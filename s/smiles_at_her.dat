5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Shaun Silva, was filmed in Paris, London, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Union Station hotel is featured as {{a train station}} in the video. Kelley explained that the director decided to shoot parts of the music video in Europe because he wanted the video to be [...] "as authentic as possible". The video begins with a young woman, Joy, played by actress Danielle Donn, entering a train and discovering an iPad in her backpack. The iPad has a video of her lover with a sign written in French words that mean [...] "Don't forget about me," [...] and also some videos of the couple's travels throughout London, Paris, and Berlin, after which the couple bid each other farewell. A subsequent scene shows Joy's boyfriend finding her sitting on a train seat and they share a kiss. Joy is then seen awoken from sleep as a man named Brady, who looks exactly like the boyfriend in Joy's dream, sits next to her. Brady apologizes for waking her and asks if she minds if he sits next to her. The two make introductions, and Joy mentions her dream. Brady then takes out his iPad case (exactly the same case as the one Joy had in her dream), and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Joy smiles back, having experienced this deja vu moment. The group members are seen singing at a Tennessee train station, and on the train itself.|$|E

500|$|Juliet is in bed after {{sleeping}} with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, {{and when she}} determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses {{to let her go}} home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the current date, September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of [...] "Left Behind". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's [...] "implant" [...] has been [...] "activated" [...] and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the drop point to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. While setting up her shelter, Juliet looks around the camp and ties a final double knot as Jack <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E

6000|$|She {{took his}} arm with a frank {{confidence}} {{that went to}} his heart; and once more laying by all serious thoughts, she entertained him, as they crossed the park, with her agreeable gaiety of mind. Near the Marble Arch they found a hansom, which rapidly conveyed them to the terminus at Euston Square; and here, in the hotel, they sat down to an excellent breakfast. The young lady's {{first step was to}} call for writing materials, and write, upon one corner of the table, a hasty note; still, as she did so, glancing with <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> companion. [...] "Here," [...] said she, [...] "here is the letter which will introduce you to my cousin." [...] She began to fold the paper. [...] "My cousin, although I have never seen her, has the character of a very charming woman and a recognised beauty; of that I know nothing, but at least she has been very kind to me; so has my lord her father; so have you--kinder than all--kinder than I can bear to think of." [...] She said this with unusual emotion; and, at the same time, sealed the envelope. [...] "Ah!" [...] she cried, [...] "I have shut my letter! It is not quite courteous; and yet, as between friends, it is perhaps better so. I introduce you, after all, into a family secret; and though you and I are already old comrades, you are still unknown to my uncle. You go, then, to this address, Richard Street, Glasgow; go, please, as soon as you arrive; and give this letter with your own hands into those of Miss Fonblanque, for that is the name by which she is to pass. When we next meet, you will {{tell me what you think}} of her," [...] she added, with a touch of the provocative.|$|E
