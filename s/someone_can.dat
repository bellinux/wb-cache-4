5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|The {{popular culture}} concept of “photographic memory,” where (e.g.) <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> briefly {{look at a}} page of text and then recite it {{perfectly}} from memory, {{is not the same}} as seeing eidetic images, and photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.|$|E

40|$|Supply Chain Management is the {{optimized}} {{operation of}} the supply chain. It requires <b>someone</b> who <b>can</b> optimize the resources {{while at the same}} time interacting with the forces that cause pressures against the supply chain. Itrequires <b>someone</b> who <b>can</b> develop a strategic plan for continuous optimization and improvement. It requires a supply chain manager. So what is a supply chain manager? This individual is <b>someone</b> who <b>can</b> identify the critical resources that move through the supply chain; <b>someone</b> who <b>can</b> identify the forces that come into play and that affect the performance of these resources; and <b>someone</b> who <b>can</b> use this information to develop goals,objectives, and a strategy around which to optimize the flow of the supply chain. This sounds like a big task, and it is. But numerous tools are available to help you with this task, and as we move forward we will learn more about these tools. There are several types of managers, and they can be categorized in numerous ways. One type is the sunrise manager who has a view toward the future, as opposed to the sunset manager who fights fires in the here and now. Another way to classify managers is to consider their attitudes toward their subordinates. The two extremes are the authoritarian manager and the participative manager...|$|R
25|$|A 2013 {{episode of}} MythBusters {{featured}} Johnathan Hillstrand and Junior Campbell traveling to M5 Industries in San Francisco to help bust three myths related to crab fishing: that <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> {{get caught in}} a pot's rope as it is dumped and be dragged to the bottom (plausible), that 20-minute naps every 6 hours can double effectiveness over a 30-hour shift (confirmed) and that crab pots are impervious to explosives (busted).|$|E

A picture has recently surfaced of known Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and a man who closely resembles the composite sketch, formed based on eyewitness' descriptions, of the Zodiac Killer. Police believe the photo was taken in San Francisco in the middle of 1966 or 1967. Police hope <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> identify the man in the photo.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} that <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and their perceptions of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.|$|E

25|$|A {{simple but}} less-used {{technique}} is checking oculomotor responses with an optokinetic nystagmus drum, where {{the subject is}} placed inside the drum and surrounded by rotating black and white stripes. This creates involuntary abrupt eye movements (nystagmus) as the brain attempts to track the moving stripes. There is a good correspondence between the optokinetic and usual eye-chart acuities in adults. A potentially serious problem with this technique is that the process is reflexive and mediated in the low-level brain stem, not in the visual cortex. Thus <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> have a normal optokinetic response and yet be cortically blind with no conscious visual sensation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 April 2012, the website of The Scotsman {{newspaper}} made available an extended 6 minute 23 second video of the proceedings. The extended video comprises visual footage from the standardised 4 minute 40 second video but a different audio track. The extended version is of note, because the audio track comprises 66 seconds of Jack Davidson QC's plea in mitigation. It was previously stated in the press that this specifically would not be filmed. Also included in the extended version is 4 seconds of heckling {{from members of the}} public gallery as David Gilroy is being led away. The majority of the heckling is inaudible, but <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> clearly be heard shouting 'die' before a court room police officer says 'quiet please'.|$|E
25|$|Wapishana is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Arawak language family. Wapishana is the only remaining Arawakan language in the circum-Roraima area. The term Arawak is more generally used to refer to the Arawakan or Lokono languages spoken in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and in some of the Antilles Islands. Most Brazilian Wapishana often speak Portuguese, instead of Wapishana and many Guyanese Wapishana speak English in addition to Wapishana. Portuguese is the dominant language among the Wapishana who live in urban areas that are bilingual in Portuguese and Wapishana, especially among the younger generations. According to Migliazza, more than 80% of Wapishana can speak the national language with which they are in contact, Portuguese in Brazil or English in Guyana. Since <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> cross the border between the two countries so easily, it is common to find people who speak Portuguese and English, as well as the maternal language.|$|E

25|$|French {{people have}} one, {{two or more}} given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost always the first, in the past often the last) is used in daily life (but <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for {{official}} documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of Jacques Chirac and never of Jacques René Chirac; and Henri Philippe Pétain is always referred to as Philippe Pétain (or Marshal Pétain), because Philippe was the given name that he used in daily life. Middle names in the Anglo-Saxon sense do not exist, and middle initials are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite Claude Allègre as Claude J. Allègre, this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a compound name was fairly common until the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the lyrics comes {{from some of the}} people the group met in the music industry, and are about the presumptuous superstar life, and how <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> get trapped in the world of fame, much like the Temptations' 1971 classic [...] "Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)".|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that <b>someone</b> <b>can</b> follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will come back {{at the beginning of a}} circle, although you have tried to get out of that particular circle." ...|$|E
