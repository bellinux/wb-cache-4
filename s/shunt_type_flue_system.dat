This comparison will be done with the aid of material flow analysis. In addition, investment costs will be taken into consideration. The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between <b>type</b> of <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with grate firing is considered. For this plant 10 different <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>systems</b> are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system,</b> starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack. The elements chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), cadmium and lead are considered. As a result of this work, two flue gas cleaning concepts seem to be very interesting for the construction of new plants: A plant with a wet <b>flue</b> gas cleaning <b>system</b> equipped with fabric filter followed by a two-stage scrubber system generates small amounts of residues by low investment costs.

This analysis describes outcomes {{at the stage}} 2 procedure and factors associated with a longer hospital length of stay (LOS). MethodsWe examined the association of <b>shunt</b> <b>type</b> with stage 2 hospital outcomes. Cox regression and bootstrapping were used to evaluate risk factors for longer LOS. We also examined characteristics associated with in-hospital death. ResultsThere were 393 subjects in the analytic cohort. Median stage 2 procedure hospital LOS (8 days; interquartile range [IQR], 6 - 14 days), hospital mortality (4. 3 %), transplantation (0. 8 %), median ventilator time (2 days; IQR, 1 - 3 days), median intensive care unit LOS (4 days; IQR, 3 - 7 days), number of additional cardiac procedures or complications, and serious adverse events did not differ by <b>shunt</b> <b>type.</b> Longer LOS was associated (R 2  =  0. 26) with center, longer post-Norwood LOS (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 93 per log day; P < . 001), nonelective timing of the stage 2 procedure (HR, 1. 78; P < . 001), and pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis (HR, 1. 56; P < . 001). By univariate analysis, nonelective stage 2 (65 % vs 32 %; P = . 009), moderate or greater atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation (75 % vs 24 %; P < . 001), and AVV repair (53 % vs 9 %; P < . 001) were among the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. ConclusionsNorwood LOS, PA stenoses, and nonelective stage 2 procedure, but not <b>shunt</b> <b>type,</b> are independently associated with longer LOS.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{children}} with single right ventricular (RV) anomalies, changes in RV size and function may be influenced by <b>shunt</b> <b>type</b> chosen {{at the time}} of the Norwood procedure. ObjectivesThe study sought to identify shunt-related differences in echocardiographic findings at 14 months and ≤ 6  months pre-Fontan in survivors of the Norwood procedure. MethodsWe compared 2 -dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic indices of RV size and function, neo-aortic and tricuspid valve annulus dimensions and function, and aortic size and patency at 14. 1 ± 1. 2 months and 33. 6 ± 9. 6 months in subjects randomized to a Norwood procedure using either the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) or right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS). ResultsAcceptable echocardiograms were available at both time points in 240 subjects (114 MBTS, 126 RVPAS). At 14 months, all indices were similar between shunt groups. From the 14 -month to pre-Fontan echocardiogram, the MBTS group had stable indexed RV volumes and ejection fraction, while the RVPAS group had increased RV end-systolic volume (p = 0. 004) and decreased right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (p = 0. 004). From 14 months to pre-Fontan, the treatment groups were similar with respect to decline in indexed neo-aortic valve area, >mild neo-aortic valve regurgitation (< 5 % at each time), indexed tricuspid valve area, and ≥moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation (< 20 % at each time). ConclusionsInitial Norwood <b>shunt</b> <b>type</b> influences pre-Fontan RV remodeling during the second and third years of life in survivors with single RV anomalies, with greater RVEF deterioration after RVPAS. Encouragingly, other indices of RV function remain stable before Fontan regardless of <b>shunt</b> <b>type.</b> (Comparison of Two <b>Types</b> of <b>Shunts</b> in Infants with Single Ventricle Defect Undergoing Staged Reconstruction—Pediatric Heart Network; NCT 00115934...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{outcomes of}} systemic to pulmonary artery shunts (SPS) in patients weighing less than 3  kg {{with regard to}} <b>shunt</b> <b>type,</b> <b>shunt</b> size, and surgical approach. MethodsPatients weighing less than 3 kg who underwent modified Blalock-Taussig or central shunts with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts at our institution from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2011, were reviewed. Patients who had undergone other major concomitant procedures {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Primary outcomes included mortality (discharge mortality and mortality before next planned palliative procedure or definitive repair), cardiac arrest and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and shunt reintervention. ResultsIn this cohort of 80 patients, discharge survival was 96 % (77 / 80). Postoperative cardiac arrest or ECMO occurred in 6 / 80 (7. 5 %), and shunt reintervention was required in 14 / 80 (17 %). On univariate analysis, shunt reintervention was more common in patients with 3 -mm shunts (11 / 30, 37 %) compared with 3. 5 -mm (2 / 36, 6 %) or 4 -mm shunts (1 / 14, 7 %) (P < . 003). There were no statistically significant associations between <b>shunt</b> <b>type,</b> <b>shunt</b> size, or surgical approach and cardiac arrest/ECMO or mortality. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that a shunt size of 3 mm (P = . 019) and extracardiac anomaly (P = . 047) were associated with shunt reintervention, whereas no variable was associated with cardiac arrest/ECMO or mortality. ConclusionsIn this high-risk group of neonates weighing less than 3 kg at the time of SPS, survival to discharge and the next planned surgical procedure was high. Outcomes were good with the 3. 5 - and 4 -mm shunts; however, shunt reintervention was common with 3 -mm shunts...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to identify factors associated with death and cardiac transplantation in infants undergoing the Norwood procedure and to determine differences in associations that might favor the modified Blalock–Taussig shunt or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt. MethodsWe used competing risks methodology to analyze death without transplantation, cardiac transplantation, and survival without transplantation. Parametric time-to-event modeling and bootstrapping were used to identify independent predictors. ResultsData from 549 subjects (follow-up, 2. 7 ± 0. 9 years) were analyzed. Mortality risk was characterized by early and constant phases; transplant was characterized by only a constant phase. Early phase factors associated with death included lower socioeconomic status (P = . 01), obstructed pulmonary venous return (P < . 001), smaller ascending aorta (P = . 02), and anatomic subtype. Constant phase factors associated with death included genetic syndrome (P < . 001) and lower gestational age (P < . 001). The right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt demonstrated better survival in the 51 % of subjects who were full term with aortic atresia (P < . 001). The modified Blalock–Taussig shunt was better among the 4 % of subjects who were preterm with a patent aortic valve (P = . 003).
