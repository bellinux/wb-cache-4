40|$|Among {{business}} practitioners, it is {{a conventional}} wisdom that motivating <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> is essential for any organisation aspiring to succeed. However, the process of motivating is complicated because {{of the diversity of}} individual’s needs. Besides, differences in culture may lead to different job attribute preferences across countries. Based on the content theories on motivation, this paper explores the non-financial motivational factors on <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> in China. This study also illustrates how Chinese cultural heritages, specifically Confucius ideology have affected the needs and the job attribute preferences of <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> in modern Chinese societies. In addition, the dissertation provides information on the relationships between leadership styles and work motivation among the Chinese <b>sales</b> <b>staff.</b> The findings of this dissertation are based on a qualitative research, in which 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> from three companies in Beijing. The study revealed both compliances and discrepancies with traditional perceptions of Chinese employees’ work motivation derived from Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as well as Confucianism studies. This indicates that Chinese <b>sales</b> <b>staff’s</b> work motivations are undergoing changes with the development of economy. The <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> have played a revenue-producing role in enterprises, therefore, it is important for management to understand how to motivate them. Furthermore, China is emerging as one of the dominant economic powers in the world, a thorough understanding of Chinese employees’ needs and job attribute preferences is important for management researchers and international business practitioners to enhance managerial efficiency in China...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether any relationships exist between personality and the performance of <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> in a call centre environment. Personality type (measured by the Jung Type Indicator [JTI]) and sales personality type (measured by the Sales Preference Indicator [SPI]) were correlated with <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> performance in an insurance call centre environment. A quantitative survey was conducted using a sample of N = 146. Correlational and inferential statistical analyses revealed statistically significant positive, although weak, relationships between personality type and the performance of call centre <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> while statistically significant positive and negative correlations, although weak, were found between sales personality type and the performance of call centre <b>sales</b> <b>staff.</b> More female and black <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> members were found in the higher performing clusters than in the average and poorer performing clusters. The best subset of personality scales from the JTI that predicted univariate measures of performance were the extroversion-introversion scale and the judging-perceiving scale while the best subset of predictors from the SPI personality scale were the consistent-adaptive scale and the cooperative-competitive scale. Call centre performance criteria are based mainly on quantitative performance criteria. It emerged from the literature review that the call centre sales position is synonymous with emotional labour and it is, thus, recommended that future research should emphasise the importance of emotionally intensive labour and its measurement combined with quantitative performance measures.

40|$|Fluctuation poses an {{extremely}} important problem {{in the field of}} sales management and, therefore, it is necessary to research continually its impact on the company as a whole. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the frequency of fluctuation among the <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> and <b>sales</b> managers through empirical research while also determining the key factors contributing to a decision to leave the company. Results of research conducted on a sample of sales managers show their belief in the honesty of reasons reported by the <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> for leaving the company, the importance of financial factors as well as numerous material and non-material instruments of motivation employed in order to keep the fluctuation under control because it creates expenses for the company and increases their own workload, among other reasons. Most <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> reported a wish for career advancement as their primary motivation for changing jobs, claiming that they are prepared to inform their superiors of that decision without hiding the real reasons etc. From this research it is possible to observe both perspectives – that of sales managers as well as that of the <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> they manage.

However, before mentioning their commissions offer, the non-sales staff seem to be just happy with the pastries and they accept their apology, so the <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> withholds their commissions offer. Stanley almost gives away that they were planning to give 2% of their commissions to them (since he walked in the room after the non-sales staff simply accepted the pastries), but Jim quickly interrupts him and covers up his comment.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written in the last 10 years about the {{nurturing}} of relationships with retail customers, but there is limited empirical research concerning the dimensions and techniques in actual use by salespeople. In this research Queensland <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> of a national ladies apparel retailer were questioned to ascertain the behaviour they exhibited in order to nurture a relationship with their repeat customers. This behavioural study in Relationship Marketing (RM) was thus designed to identify and rank the relationship dimensions used to strengthen a long-term relationship. <b>Sales</b> <b>staff</b> were questioned about their behaviour through identifying their nurturing techniques, which {{are representative of the}} specific relationship dimensions. The results show that salespersons routinely used 13 specifically identified dimensions to nurture a relationship with customers. These 13 dimensions were widely applied by the <b>sales</b> <b>staff</b> and are ranked in order of usage rate. There is evidence that the techniques used are specific to a given retail product category and environment...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{identified}} {{per patient}} resource use and <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> at a cystic fibrosis (CF) outpatient unit {{from the health}} care provider's perspective. Methods: Personnel cost data were prospectively collected for all CF outpatients (n = 126) under routine conditions at the Charit 9 Medical School Berlin in Germany over a six month study period. Patients were grouped according to age, sex and two severity categories. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was performed to determine the impact of various independent variables on personnel costs. Results: The mean <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> were 8 ̆ 0142. 3 per patient over six months of outpatient service. Services provided by physicians were the biggest contributor to <b>staff</b> <b>costs.</b> Patient age correlated significantly and negatively with mean total costs per patient. Conclusions: Age of patient is a significant determinant of <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> for CF outpatient care. For a cost-covering remuneration of outpatient treatment it seems plausible to create separate reimbursement rates {{for two or three}} age groups and to consider additional costs due to tasks carried out by physicians without direct patient contact. The relatively low <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> identified by our study reflect a staffing level not sufficient for specialist CF outpatient care...|$|R
