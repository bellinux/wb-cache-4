40|$|A {{comprehensive}} world {{classification of}} the Poaceae {{is presented in}} which 720 currently accepted genera are distributed among five subfamilies (Pooideae, Bambusoideae, Arundinoideae, Chloridoideae, Panicoideae) and six <b>supertribes</b> (Triticanae and Poanae, in Pooideae; Bambusanae and Oryzanae, in Bambusoideae; Panicanae and Andropogonanae, in Panicoideae). Synonyms in recent use are listed under appropriate groups. The classification reflects a variety of numerical analyses of generic descriptions, accounting for original observations and compiled data on nearly 300 characters concerning mainly morphology, anatomy, physiology and cytology. The detailed group descriptions are fully comparative, and include statistical information on character state distributions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among 88 genera of Rosaceae were investigated using nucleotide sequence data from six nuclear (18 S, gbssi 1, gbssi 2, ITS, pgip, andppo) and four chloroplast (matK, ndhF, rbcL, and trnL-trnF) regions, separately and in various combinations, with parsimony and likelihood-based Bayesian approaches. The results {{were used to}} examine evolution of nonmolecular characters {{and to develop a}} new phylogenetically based infrafamilial classification. As in previous molecular phylogenetic analyses of the family, we found strong support for monophyly of groups corresponding closely to many previously recognized tribes and subfamilies, but no previous classification was entirely supported, and {{relationships among}} the strongly supported clades were weakly resolved and/or conflicted between some data sets. We recognize three subfamilies in Rosaceae: Rosoideae, including Filipendula, Rubus, Rosa, and three tribes; Dryadoideae, comprising the four actinorhizal genera; and Spiraeoideae, comprising Lyonothamnus and seven tribes. All genera previously assigned to Amygdaloideae and Maloideae are included in Spiraeoideae. Three <b>supertribes,</b> one in Rosoideae and two in Spiraeoideae, are recognized...|$|R
40|$|Forest litter-inhabiting {{arthropods}} except ants {{are poorly}} understood {{because of their}} small sizes and cryptic habitats. However, they play {{an essential role in}} nutrient cycling and contribute valuable data to study of comparative biodiversity and conservation. Soil beetles such as Pselaphine beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) are cosmopolitan, species-rich, and yet poorly studied, particularly in the tropics. While ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are a large component of the arthropod community on ground in forest ecosystems. We sampled pselaphine beetles and ants in three types of primary forest and two types of disturbed forest habitat in eastern Thailand to assess the utility of pselaphine beetles and ants to determine if one group could be predicted the diversity of other. We compared species richness, abundance and diversity of ground ants and pselaphine beetles in each forest types using 1 m 2 quadrat samples and extracted them with Tullgren funnels. A total of 1, 867 pselaphine individuals representing 114 species in six <b>supertribes</b> and 44, 135 individuals, 142 species in nine subfamilies of ants were collected in all habitats.

50|$|Recent {{classification}} systems place Yushania in the woody bamboo tribe Bambuseae, {{which is}} part of the <b>supertribe</b> Bambusodae.The species of Yushania are evergreen, spreading, thornless bamboos native to Himalayan, African, Chinese, and Southeast Asian mountains at moderate to high altitudes, up to 3000 m.|$|E
50|$|Andropogoneae is {{classified}} in <b>supertribe</b> Andropogonodae together with its sister group Arundinelleae. Subdivisions include 12 subtribes, but {{the position of}} several genera within them is still unresolved (incertae sedis).

40|$|The PlantTribes {{database}} ([URL] is a plant {{gene family}} database {{based on the}} inferred proteomes of five sequenced plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya, Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa. We used the graph-based clustering algorithm MCL [Van Dongen (Technical Report INS-R 0010 2000) and Enright et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 : 1575 – 1584) ] to classify all of these species’ protein-coding genes into putative gene families, called tribes, using three clustering stringencies (low, medium and high). For all tribes, we have generated protein and DNA alignments and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees. A parallel database of microarray experimental results {{is linked to the}} genes, which lets researchers identify groups of related genes and their expression patterns. Unified nomenclatures were developed, and tribes can be related to traditional gene families and conserved domain identifiers. <b>SuperTribes,</b> constructed through a second iteration of MCL clustering, connect distant, but potentially related gene clusters. The global classification of nearly 200 000 plant proteins was used as a scaffold for sorting ∼ 4 million additional cDNA sequences from over 200 plant species. All data and analyses are accessible through a flexible interface allowing users to explore the classification, to place query sequences within the classification, and to download results for further study...|$|R
50|$|The beetles are small, being between 0.65 to 0.85 mm long. Their {{bodies are}} brown to reddish brown {{in color and}} have a dense {{covering}} of hairs which are notably long. Because the fifth and sixth abdominal sterna are extended, and thus visible, the genus has been placed in the Scydmaeninae, <b>supertribe</b> Hapsomelitae.|$|E
50|$|Protoclaviger is an extinct Early Eocene {{transitional}} fossil myrmecophile of the rove beetle subfamily Pselaphinae, and a stem {{group of}} the modern <b>supertribe</b> Clavigeritae, of which Claviger is a representative. All modern Clavigeritae are morphologically specialized obligate colony parasites of ant nests, soliciting food via trophallaxis from worker ants, and preying on the nest brood.|$|E
50|$|Arundinarieae is a {{tribe of}} bamboo {{in the grass}} family (Poaceae), placed in its own <b>supertribe</b> Arundinarodae and {{containing}} a single subtribe, Arundinariinae, and 30 genera. These woody bamboos occur in areas with warm temperate climates in southeastern North America, Subsaharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia. The tribe forms a lineage independent of the tropical woody bamboos (Bambuseae) and the tropical herbaceous bamboos (Olyreae).|$|E
50|$|Paniceae {{is a large}} {{tribe of}} the Panicoideae {{subfamily}} in the grasses (Poaceae), the only in the monotypic <b>supertribe</b> Panicodae. It includes roughly 1,500 species in 84 genera, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Paniceae includes species using either of the C4 and C3 photosynthetic pathways, as well as presumably intermediate species. Most of the millets are members of tribe Paniceae.|$|E
50|$|Ektatotricha {{differs from}} the other member of the <b>supertribe,</b> Hapsomela, by having maxillary palpi which are almost equal in length, a {{different}} antenna shape, and by {{the depth of the}} punctures on the fore wings. Like Hapsomela, the protibia of Ektatotricha have a well-developed hook, which may have been used in mating or male-male combat between rivals. It has also been suggested that the hooks may have been used to capture prey.|$|E
50|$|Pterostichinae is a {{subfamily}} {{of ground}} beetles (family Carabidae). It {{belongs to the}} advanced harpaline assemblage, and if these are circumscribed sensu lato as a single subfamily, Pterostichinae are downranked to a tribe Pterostichini. However, as the former Pterostichitae <b>supertribe</b> of the Harpalinae as loosely circumscribed does seem to constitute a lineage rather distinct from Harpalus, its core group is here {{considered to be the}} present subfamily and the Harpalinae are defined more narrowly.|$|E
50|$|The Kasi (کاسي) or Kansi (کانسي) are a Pashtun <b>supertribe</b> son of Kharshbun son of Sarban tribal confederacy, {{primarily}} {{found in}} Pakistan, and Afghanistan. A {{large part of}} the Kasi tribe live in the city of Quetta, Balochistan, and Pakistan. Another {{large part of the}} Kasi confederacy is known as Shinwari, mainly settled in the eastern valleys of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan and around Landi Kotal in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Kohat District Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Species of the <b>supertribe</b> Clavigeritae, {{including}} those of the genus Colilodion, are presumed to be myrmecophiles due to the presence of trichomes exuding appeasement pheromones favouring their adoption by ants. The most common ant genera in the type locality of Colilodion schulzi are Camponotus, Paratrechina, and some other genera of the subfamily Myrmicinae. The role of broadened antennomeres is unknown. Their compact form could be an adaptation to myrmecophily, perhaps preventing their breakage when the beetles are transported by the ants to their colony.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} circumscription of the Heliantheae {{arises from}} Cassini's 19th-century classification of the Asteraceae. This broad group been divided by some authors into smaller tribes: Bahieae, Chaenactideae, Coreopsideae, Helenieae, Heliantheae sensu stricto, Madieae, Millereae, Perityleae, Polymnieae, and Tageteae. Because the Eupatorieae originated {{from within the}} Heliantheae (broadly defined), to maintain monophyletic taxa {{it is necessary to}} either make Eupatorieae a subtribe within Heliantheae or to split the Heliantheae into smaller tribes. Such classifications may define a <b>supertribe</b> Helianthodae including these smaller tribes, the Eupatorieae, and a few other tribes such as Inuleae.|$|E
50|$|The Ghoryakhel (غورياخېل) is Pashtun <b>supertribe</b> son of Kand son of Kharshbun son of Sarban, son of Qais Abdur Rashid, {{who lived}} in Ghwara Marghay Arghistan Qandahar but mostly settled in Ghazni on the basin of Tarnak River and Nangarhar, Logar, Kabul, Kunar, Kunduz of Afghanistan and also in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Peshawar Pakistan between the 15th and 16th century.

5000|$|The beetle is small, only 0.6 mm long, {{possessing}} a light brown body with yellowish brown legs, antennae, and head. Kachinus {{has a unique}} combination of characters found in both the Cephennini and Eutheiini tribes of the Scydmaeninae <b>supertribe</b> Scydmaenitae. [...] Elytra and pronotum which are not clearly discontinuous and a head which {{does not have a}} narrowed area from the vertex to the occiput are features found in the modern Cephennini genera. However the overall pronotum shape and body shape combined with shortened elytra are distinct features of Eutheiini. It is noted that with the distinctly elevated mesosternal keel Kachinus is similar in appearance to the modern genus Paraneseuthia.|$|E
50|$|The Dawars {{originally}} {{lived in}} the Shawal area, which lies partly in the present-day North Waziristan tribal agency of Pakistan and partly in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan. The Dawars are descended from the Shitak <b>supertribe</b> of the Pashtuns. Both the Dawars and their cousin tribe the Bannuchis descend from the Shitaks. In the 14th century, the Wazirs another Pashtun tribe, who were living in Birmal in the west, migrated eastwards to the Shawal area and fell into dispute with the Shitaks (Dawars and Bannuchis), and succeeded to oust the Shitaks northeastwards. Eventually, the Dawari Shitaks settled in the Tochi Valley in the modern-day North Wazisitan. At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century the tribe had some 5,200 fighting men.|$|E
50|$|The Banuchis {{originally}} {{lived in}} the Shawal area, which lies partly in the present-day North Waziristan tribal agency of Pakistan and partly in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan. The Banuchi, {{as well as their}} cousin tribe the Dawars descend from the Shitak <b>supertribe</b> who were settled in Shawal. In the 14th century, the Wazir tribe of Pashtuns, who were living in Birmal in the west, migrated eastwards to the Shawal area and fell into dispute with the Shitaks (Banuchis and Dawars), and succeeded to oust the Shitaks northeastwards towards the land between the Tochi and Kurram rivers. Eventually, the Banuchi Shitaks migrated to the Bannu District, where the Pashtun tribes of the Mangal and the Honai, as well as the Khattak were already settled. The Banuchis first defeated and drove away the Mangals and the Honais, then gradually pushed the Khattaks northwards to Kohat and Karak, and eventually captured and settled in Bannu District.|$|E
5000|$|Cecidomiidae are {{minute to}} small (0.5-3.0 mm), rarely larger (up to 8 mm, wing length 15 mm) flies with a {{delicate}} appearance. Except {{for a few}} genera with reduced wings, the eyes are holoptic. The mouthparts are reduced. Cecidomiid antennae are notably long, with 12-14 segments, (sometimes fewer and up to 40 in some genera). The antennal segments either consist of a basal thickening and petiole or they are binodal, with a proximal node, an intermediate petiole and a distal node. Basal, medial, and apical whorls of hairs occur on the antennal segments. In some species, whorls of loop-shaped sensory filaments are also found, the basal or medial one sometimes being reduced. Some gall flies have only one (basal) whorl of hairs on the antennal segments, and the sensoria (transparent sensory appendages) differ in size and shape. The filaments are thread-like in the Porricondylinae and in all the Cecidomyiinae and {{take the form of}} long loops in the <b>supertribe</b> Cecidomyiidi). Ocelli are present only in the Lestremiinae. The wings are usually clear, rarely patterned. The wing bears microtrichia, often as scales, and some species have macrotrichia. The number of longitudinal veins is reduced. Only veins R1, R4+5, M3+4 and Cu1 are well developed in most species. The medial veins M1 and M2 are developed only in primitive groups, and the costa usually has a break just beyond vein R5. The legs are long and slender, without apical bristles.|$|E
40|$|Using for {{comparison}} with, and as outgroups for, <b>supertribe</b> Cicindelitae, we describe and illustrate the mandibles and labrum-epipharynx of the basal geadephagans Trachypachus gibbsii LeConte, 1861 (family Trachypachidae), and family Carabidae: Pelophila rudis (LeConte, 1863) (<b>supertribe</b> Nebriitae, tribe Pelophilini) and Ceroglossus chilensis (Eschscholtz, 1829) (<b>supertribe</b> Carabitae, tribe Ceroglossini). The range and pattern {{of variation in}} structure of mandibles and labrum-epipharynx within the <b>supertribe</b> Cicindelitae was assessed using scanning-electron (SEM) images of these structures in nine exemplar taxa: Amblycheila baroni (Rivers, 1890), Omus californicus (Eschscholtz, 1829) and Picnochile fallaciosa (Chevrolat, 1854) (representing the Amblycheilini); Manticora tuberculata (DeGeer, 1778) (representing the Manticorini) : Tetracha carolina (Linnaeus, 1767) (representing the Megacephalini); Pogonostoma chalybeum (Klug, 1835) (representing the Collyridini); and Therates basalis Dejean, 1826, Oxycheila species, and Cicindela longilabris Say, 1824 (representing the Cicindelini). An evolutionary transformation series was postulated for the mandibles and labrum-epipharynx, based on a reconstructed phylogenetic sequence, which, in turn, was based on morphological and DNA evidence. Principal features of the transformation series for the mandibles included development of a densely setose basal face; wide quadridentate retinaculum; a lengthened incisor tooth; a multidentate terebra (one to five teeth; two-three most frequent), followed by subsequent loss {{of one or more}} such teeth; development of a diastema in the occlusal surface; development and subsequent loss of scrobal setae, and reduction and loss of the scrobe. Principal features of the transformation series for the labrum included evolution of form from transverse, sub-rectangular to elongate almost square, to triangular; position and number of setae evolved from dorsal to insertion on the apical margin, the number increased from 8 – 10 to as many as 36, and decreased to as few as four. The epipharynx broadened evolutionarily, the pedium evolving in form from narrow, triangular and nearly flat, to broad, palatiform, and markedly convex; anterior parapedial setae both increased and decreased in number, and in orientation, from a row parallel to the parapedial ridge to a setal row extended forward at about a right angle to the latter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The phylogenetic {{relationships}} in the families Rhynchitidae and Attelabidae have been reconstructed. The main synapomorphies have been revealed. The morphologically advanced groups have been distinguished in the families studied. The family Attelabidae forms two large branches. The most advanced is the <b>supertribe</b> Rhynchititae, the representatives of which could adapt not only to development {{in various parts of}} a plant, but also to rolling leaf packages. This <b>supertribe</b> consists of eight well-defined tribes forming three groups: (1) Auletini and Minurini; (2) Cesauletini, Eugnamptini and Isotheini; (3) Pterocolini, Rhynchitini and Byctiscini. The families Rhynchitidae and Attelabidae (leaf-rolling weevils) belong to the most surprising beetles on our planet. Some of them have developed the abil-ity to make leaf packages in which their larvae feed; others put eggs into fruits or vegetative parts of plants in which the larval development proceeds. The both families mostly inhabit forests and are associated with arboreal vegetation; those species that occur in open landscapes develop on herbs. These weevils are widel...|$|E
