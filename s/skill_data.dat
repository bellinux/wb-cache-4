The group will need guides, meaning Zone and Mag will have to come too. Zone is reluctant to go back, but Adelle threatens Zone once again. An alarm sounds and the group takes arms to defend themselves, but it turns out to be Anthony (still known as Victor) and his crew responding to a call from Echo. Victor and his crew (including former dolls such as Kilo and Romeo) are equipped with a new tech that allows them to swap out different skill sets with the use of a hand-held imprinting device and store their excess <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> on USB flash drives. Priya is not happy to be reunited with Victor, as she has been trying to keep T away from the imprinting tech, and is reluctant to leave. However, the groups join forces to reach the Dollhouse.|$|E
30|$|This section {{discusses}} {{approaches to}} estimating skill similarities given skill descriptions and people <b>skill</b> <b>data.</b> The basic {{idea is to}} encode the data source (skill descriptions or people <b>skill</b> <b>data)</b> into features that enable the computation of a similarity measure between skills. Based {{on the structure of}} the data, established methods from the literature such as word 2 vec [16] or TF–IDF [14, 15] have been used; these choices are not requirements and alternative feature options may be used.|$|E
40|$|Skill {{management}} systems serve as technical platforms for mostly, though not exclusively, corporate-internal market places for skills and know-how. The systems are typically built {{on top of}} a database that contains profiles of employees and applicants. Thus, the skills may be retrieved through database queries. However, these approaches incur two major problems, viz. the finding of approximate matches and the maintenance of <b>skill</b> <b>data.</b> In this paper we describe two systems that leverage corporate skill knowledge by offering advanced means for both. We present ProPer that uses means from decision theory to allow for compensate skill matching. Then, we describe OntoProPer that combines these methods with intelligent means for inferencing of <b>skill</b> <b>data.</b> For the latter an ontology provides background knowledge, i. e. conceptual structures and rules, which supplement the skill database with ground and inferred facts from secondary information, such as project documents. These suppl [...] ...|$|E

The tool developed by the author visualizes the <b>skills</b> <b>data</b> of persons and teams in several representations. It makes it easy to identify the features of teams and their members, and helps eliminate trial-and-error in the process of organizing teams.

30|$|Skill {{similarity}} {{from people}} <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> is computed {{based on the}} notion that if an employee has two skills, then a person may be trained from one to the other. Skill transition data are obtained from historical employee skill records as described in Sect.  3. As such, we look at each skill and compute a profile for that skill consisting of the union of all skills possessed by all employees with that skill. Then, similarity between the profiles of two skills gives us a measure of the adjacency between them.|$|E
30|$|Through the {{development}} of careful crosswalks with the International Standard Classification of Occupations from 1988 at 3 -digits level (ISCO 88), ONet data has been increasingly used by {{a large number of}} researchers and institutions outside the United States. 6 We merge the ONet job <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> with the Spanish Labor Force Survey with occupations disaggregated at 3 -digits level. 7 Like previous authors using the ONet dataset with European data, 8 we do so under the assumption that the occupations in the US and in Spain being examined herein are not that different with regards to the specified job contents.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} the final measure of intensity {{in each of the}} described job contents, we must realize that the standard deviation varies to a great extent depending on the skill under consideration. This problem is also detected and accounted for by Peri and Sparber (2009), who tackle it by transforming the ONet job <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> to reflect the relative importance of each skill among all US workers in 2000. Like them, we transform the original job content data to reflect the relative importance of each skill among all workers in Spain during the time period under examination.|$|E

40|$|How {{important}} is mastering information and communications technology (ICT) in modern labor markets? Previous research offers no guidance {{in assessing the}} labor-market returns to ICT skills, primarily because <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> have been unavailable. We draw on unique data that provide internationally comparable information on ICT skills in 19 countries. Using an instrument that leverages cross-country variation in the technologically determined probability of having Internet access, we find that ICT skills are substantially rewarded in the labor market.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{emphasized}} that an objective measure of fungibility between skills {{does not exist in}} the organization whose data have been used for this study; we believe this is the norm across organizations. Given the current state of no clear baseline and sparse SME inputs to work or validate models with, the similarity matrices from individual data sources already provide a measure of substitutability between skills. This paper further defines fungibility as a composite similarity score between skills, considering all available data sources in the organization; the improved outcomes from the composite measure demonstrate the potential for synergistic use of multiple <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> sources, that an organization might have, toward estimating an objective measure of fungibility between skills.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that the development of response inhibition and drawing skill are linked. The current research investigated whether this association reflects a more fundamental link between response inhibition and motor control. In Experiment 1, 3 - and 4 -year-olds (n= 100) were tested on measures of inhibition, fine motor control and drawing <b>skill.</b> <b>Data</b> revealed an association between inhibition and fine motor control, which was responsible for most of the association observed with drawing skill. Experiment 2 (n= 100) provided evidence that, unlike fine motor control, gross motor control and inhibition were not associated (after controlling for IQ). Alternative explanations for the link between inhibition and fine motor control are outlined, including a consideration of how these cognitive processes may interact during development...|$|E
30|$|Other than [18], these {{approaches}} are generally concerned with identifying {{employees who have}} certain (in-demand) skills {{so that they can}} be considered for deployment to meet such demand; they do not attempt to develop a quantitative notion of adjacency or fungibility of skills. While Ramamurthy et al. [18] do address this problem more directly than others, their approach still does not yield a pairwise skill fungibility estimate. More importantly, it is unable to infer a signal for skills that are new, or have been recently introduced, and thus have few or no employees associated with that skill. These issues are addressed in this paper through the use of multiple <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> sources, including unstructured skill descriptions, skill similarity matrix generation from each data source and skill similarity matrix integration into a skill fungibility estimate.|$|E
30|$|Estimating skill {{similarity}} using people <b>skill</b> <b>data</b> is done {{using the}} TF–IDF approach {{as shown in}} Fig.  2. For every skill S, a “document” is constructed, consisting of every skill (“token”) that a person with skill S has transitioned from. Then, the term frequency (TF) for skill T in that document represents {{the number of people}} with skill S who also have skill T. Similarly, the IDF for skill T measures how common the skill T is across people with all skills. Thus, every skill S is represented by a TF–IDF feature vector representation, and skill similarity is computed as the cosine similarity between the feature vectors. This similarity encodes the historical people-based evidence in the organization. For a given set of skills, a similarity matrix is thus obtained.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has altered {{the pattern of}} foreign direct investment (FDI) in North America. The theoretical analysis suggests that NAFTA affects the incentives of U. S. and non-U. S. firms locating in Mexico differently and may lead to investment diversion from the U. S. Combining U.
