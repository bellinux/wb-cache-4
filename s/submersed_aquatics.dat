Measures for the simple leaves of the stargrass were sums of measured triangles. Stem surfaces for both species were calculated as measured cylinders. Though {{the means of the}} stem length and leaf length were larger for stargrass samples, their mean surface area was 95 cm 2 which was less than the 108 cm 2 recorded for Eurasian watermilfoil samples. Relating surface area to dry weight for the stargrass was straightforward, with 1 mg of dry weight yielding an average 0. 678 cm 2 of surface area. Biomass measures for the water milfoil were confounded by the additional weight of epiphytic algae persisting on cleaned samples. The results suggest that a lesstime consuming method for surface area measures of plants with highly dissected leaves and a caveat for using biomass measures to estimate surface area in such plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to evaluate recent prairie wetland restorations {{to see if they}} are comparable to natural wetlands and to provide guidelines for site selection, design, and performance of future restorations. Detailed studies were made of the revegetation and water regime of 62 wetlands restored in 1988. Wetlands were evaluated to see if they have the potential to: (1) improve water quality, based on watershed land use, basin morphometry, and emergent vegetation development, and (2) provide wildlife habitat, based on landscape pattern, water regime, and vegetation composition. Most restorations are small (less than 4 ha) and are restored to be seasonal or semipermanent wetlands. Few restored wetlands (16. 1 %) seem to receive high loadings of agricultural pollutants because watersheds of most restored wetlands are more than one-half permanent cover. Wetlands restored by removing drainage tile (17. 5 %) that receive high loadings of nutrients may not improve water quality because residence time is too short. Inlets and outlets in these wetlands are typically adjacent to each other. The vegetation compositions of wetlands flooded for one, two and three years were compared to environmental and historical factors for the 62 wetlands. Mantel tests were used to determine if either factor accounted for vegetation differences among sites. The vegetation recolonizing restored wetlands within one year of flooding was found to be affected by past land use. A TWINSPAN ordination of these sites showed that wetlands drained by ditches or ineffectively drained by tile are recolonized by shallow emergent species that likely survived drainage as refugial populations. Tiled wetlands were colonized by mudflat annuals and <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatics.</b> Wet prairie and sedge meadow species were generally not found. A study of ten restored wetlands flooded for three years and ten natural wetlands showed that the mean number of species in the flora of natural wetlands and restored wetlands was 45. 8 and 26. 9 species per basin, respectively. Seedbanks of natural wetlands were also more diverse than those of restored wetlands with a mean of 15 species for natural wetlands and 8 species for restored wetlands. Thirty-seven wet prairie and sedge meadow species of natural wetlands (including typical dominants) were not found in restored wetlands...|$|E

40|$|Invasive aquatic weeds {{negatively}} affect biodiversity, fluvial dynamics, water quality, and water storage and conveyance {{for a variety}} of human resource demands. In California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, one submersed species-Brazilian egeria-and one floating species-waterhyacinth-are actively managed to maintain navigable waterways. We monitored the spatial and temporal dynamics of these species and their communities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta using airborne hyperspectral data and assessed the effect of herbicide treatments used to manage these species from 2003 to 2007. Each year, <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plant species occupied about 12 % of the surface area of the Delta in early summer and floating invasive plant species occupied 2 to 3 %. Since 2003, the coverage of <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants expanded about 500 ha, whereas the coverage of waterhyacinth was reduced. Although local treatments have reduced the coverage of <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants, Delta-wide cover has not been significantly reduced. Locally, multiyear treatments could decrease <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants spread, given that no residual plants outside the treated area were present. In contrast, the spread of waterhyacinth either has been constant or has decreased over time. These results show that (1) the objectives of the Egeria densa Control Program (EDCP) have been hindered until 2007 by restrictions imposed on the timing of herbicide applications; (2) <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants appeared to function as ecosystem engineers by enabling spread to adjacent areas typically subject to scouring action; (3) repeated herbicide treatment of waterhyacinth has resulted in control of the spread of this species, which also appears to have facilitated the spread of waterprimrose and floating pennywort. These results suggest that management of the Delta aquatic macrophytes may benefit by an ecosystem-level implementation of an Integrated Delta Vegetation Management and Monitoring Program, rather than targeting only two problematic species...|$|R

In contrast, results from the greenhouse study showed that V. americana had a strong inhibitory effect on H. verticillata colonization by fragments and increasing H. verticillata fragment density again increased colonization success.

40|$|Although {{relatively}} few insects {{have been reported}} to feed on <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants, field surveys on Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle for biological control agents have demonstrated that insect herbivores should be expected when surveying <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants in the native ranges. Beetles, or Coleoptera, especially the weevils (Curculionidae), are important herbivores. Weevils attack submersed plant species both when water is present and when water is absent during dry periods which leave the plants exposed. Pupal success appears to be the major determinant of weevil life cycle strategies. Donaciine leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) attack the roots or crowns of submersed species, but their feeding and damage is difficult to determine. Leaf-mining Hydrellia flies (Diptera: Ephydridae) are diverse and common on submersed species. Other flies, the midges (Chironomidae), are also common on submersed species, but many utilize the plants only for shelter. However, midge larvae ate the apical meristems on the tips of hydrilla stems. Aquatic caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) are the herbivores most eas-ily observed on submersed species because of their large size and conspicuous damage, but their host ranges might be too broad for use as biological control agents. More research is needed on the field biologies of aquatic insect herbivores.

The successful use of seeds in submerged aquatic plant restoration has been limited because methods for the harvesting, processing, and sowing of seeds have been limited to a single species (e. g.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study evaluates {{combinations}} of a contact herbicide (endothall) and two systemic auxin-type herbicides (2, 4 -D and triclopyr) {{to exploit the}} strengths of each herbicide class, with an objective of providing both rapid and complete control of the invasive, submersed plant, Eurasian watermilfoil. BACKGROUND: Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) is a widespread <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plant that causes nuisance problems across the continental United States. Eurasian watermilfoil is an herbaceous perennial <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plant that typically grows in water depths of 1 to 3 m (Aiken et al. 1979). Vegetative propagation is either by direct stem fragments or by autofragmentation {{through the development of}} an abscission layer in stem segments (Madsen et al. 1988). The production of these stem fragments, either by external forces or by autofragmentation, allows for widespread plant dispersal. Eurasian watermilfoil can form a dense surface canopy, which is the cause of both ecological harm and nuisance impacts. Eurasian watermilfoil is often responsible for reductions in oxygen exchange, depletions in dissolved oxygen, increases in water temperatures, and internal nutrient loading (Madsen 1998). Eurasian watermilfoil has been directly associated with declines in native plant species richness and diversity (Madsen et al. 1991 a, 1991 b); and indirectl...|$|R
40|$|DEFINITION: Micropropagation is a {{technique}} that manipulates small quantities of axenic plant mate-rial, ranging from single cells to stem segments, under conditions favorable {{to the formation of}} new plants. It has proven to be the most efficient and cost-effective method of propagating large numbers of clonal offspring for many agronomic crops, including both herbaceous and woody perennial species. Older and simpler techniques of cloning plants (cuttings, grafting, and division of parent stock material) are limited by seasonal constraints and the natural formation of new plant structures. Micropropagation, on the other hand, allows the year-round production of new plants at rates significantly higher than that achievable by all other methods. The plants produced are genetically uniform, vigorous, and free from associations with other organisms, an attribute particularly useful for the culture of underwater grasses where contaminating organisms can dominate other types of production systems. PURPOSE: This technical note outlines the applications and limitations of micropropagation for the production of <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> vascular plants used for habitat restoration, experimentation, and educa-tional demonstrations of the importance of these plant communities. <b>Submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> vascular plants are unique members of the plant kingdom because they are secondarily adapted to life underwater (Raven 1984, Den Hartog 1970).

40|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of each year, large patches of <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> macrophytes overgrow the bottom of the {{alluvial}} Warta River downstream of a large dam reservoir owing to water management practices. Environmental variables, macroinvertebrates (zoobenthos and epiphytic fauna, zooplankton) and fish abundance and biomass were assessed at this biologically productive habitat to learn intraseasonal dynamics of food types, and their occurrence in the gut contents of small-sized roach, dace, perch, ruffe and three-spined stickleback. Gut fullness coefficient, niche breadth and niche overlap indicated how the fishes coexist in the macrophytes. Chironomidae dominated in the diet of the percids. However, ruffe consumed mostly benthic chironomids, while perch epiphytic chironomids and zooplankton. The diet of dace resembled that in fast flowing water although this rheophilic species occurred at unusual density there. The generalist roach displayed the lowest gut fullness coefficient values and widest niche breadth; consequently, intraspecific rather than interspecific competition decided the fate of roach. Three-spined stickleback differed from the other fishes by consuming epiphytic simuliids and fish eggs. The diet overlap between fishes reaching higher gut fullness coefficient values was rather low when the food associated with the <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> macrophytes was most abundant; this is congruent with the niche overla...|$|R
40|$|Dye {{injection}} {{studies and}} direct velocity and water-level measurements {{were made in}} macrophyte stands and adjacent channels in order to observe {{the effects of the}} macrophyte stand on flow and mass exchange in the tidal Potomac River. During the summer, dense stands of <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plants cover most shoals < 2 m deep. Continuous summertime water-level records within a <b>submersed</b> <b>aquatic</b> plant stand and in the adjacent channel revealed time-varying gradients in water-surface elevation between the two areas. Water-level gradients are created by differing rates of tidal water-level change in vegetated and unvegetated areas. Results were consistent with the idea that on a rising tide the water was slower to enter a macrophyte stand, and on a falling tide it was slower to leave it. Differences in water elevation between the stand and the open channel generated components of velocity in the stand that were at right angles to the line of flow in the channel. Seasonal differences in flow speed and direction over the shoals indicate substantial differences in resistance to flow {{as a result of the}} vegetation. Estuaries are often characterized by channels flanked by extensive shoals and shallow embayments (Kuo and Park 1995).
