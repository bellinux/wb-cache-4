Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>dialing</b> is also {{available}} via Custom Calling features from the Telephone Company's Central Office. The numbers are programmed by the subscriber through the standard telephone dial, and speed dial calls are placed by dialing simply the digit and waiting a few seconds on a standard rotary dial phone and an older 10 key Touch Tone phone, or by dialing the number and the # key to instantly connect the call on a modern 12 key Touch Tone phone.|$|E

The number of elderly {{in the world is}} increasing by one million per month. There are concerns on the cost and quality of care to the elderly with increasing number of elderly. These problems can be solved by using technology which is an assistive technologies that help caregivers and families monitor the daily life and maintain the health of the elderly. Seniors Assistance System applications using Android as the media of assistive technology for caregivers and families. This application helps caregivers to monitor the location of the elderly and hospital search using Google Maps technology in the application.

Our handsets not only keep us connected with the world at large but also serve the purpose of entertainment gadget. From 1 G to 2. 5 G and from 3 G to 5 G this world of telecommunications {{has seen a}} number of improvements along with improved performance with every passing day. This paper aims at highlighting some of the concepts and technologies which will facilitate the affordable provision of very high data rates with virtually ubiquitous coverage and some of its features and benefits in 5 G wireless networks. 5 G is not a term officially used for any particular specification or in any official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as 3 GPP, WiMAX Forum or ITU-R. The developed world is already utilizing 4 G and it is beyond imagination that what will be engulfed in 5 G as everything is already embedded such as smallest mobile phones, <b>speed</b> <b>dialing,</b> largest memory, audio and video player, Microsoft office, etc[8].

40|$|Emergency Beacon System {{has become}} a {{necessity}} as the demand for double income families is increasing these days. Due to the limitation of reality, people nowadays are not capable {{of taking care of}} the elderly. At the same time, the tremendous increase of cases of sudden death among solitary living elderly had drawn attention to the society to solve this problem. Hence, attaching an emergency beacon system with the elderly will guarantee the safety of the elderly where immediate assistance will be provided when the system is activated. Currently, several types of cell phones in the market attempted to provide solution to this problem by including emergency beacon function such as <b>speed</b> <b>dialing.</b> However, these beacons are using voice based emergency system and is not efficient due to the nature where human will feel panic or blank out their mind when emergency occurs and resulting in difficulties in providing correct information when something emergency occurred. Besides that, it is difficult for elderly with vision problem to press the speed dial button if depending on cell phone. These issues might delay the rescue time and cause some avoidable tragedies. These limitations become a motivation to develop an easy to operate, low cost, SMS based and user friendly emergency beacon system. The purpose of this microcontroller-based emergency beacon system is to send multiple text messages to certain preset numbers by activating a push button via GSM network. Color coded dedicated push button make it easy for elderly to send emergency message. An alarm function will remind elderly to update their current status for their family or guardian. Necessary information will preset into the system and sent out automatically to resolve the issues of blank out during emergency. For further enhancement, this system can be integrated using a GPS module to detect the current location and it will become a perfect emergency beacon system which can be used in any place to trace the location of the sender to provide necessary assistance immediately...|$|E
