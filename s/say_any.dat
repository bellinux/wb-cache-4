[...] Melody Maker was also complimentary about the album, describing it as [...] "A beautiful selection, representing US pop at its finest." [...] Beat Instrumental concluded their review by stating [...] "It's true to say that the Byrds are one of the two best groups in the world.

Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to <b>say</b> <b>any</b> more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit.

500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really been doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may <b>say,</b> <b>any</b> circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Giles Worsley {{has described}} the chapel's east window as an instance of Gothic Revival architecture, rather than Gothic Survival, since a choice was made to use an outdated style– classical architecture had become accepted as [...] "the only style {{in which it was}} respectable to build". The window has seven main sections ("lights") topped with five-headed flower shapes, or cinquefoils, and tracery running vertically. The chapel is one of various buildings at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge from {{the first half of the}} 17th century where Gothic designs were deliberately chosen in preference to Classical; other examples are the chapel of Lincoln College, Oxford, the chapel windows and hall roof at Wadham College, Oxford, and the library of St John's College, Cambridge, where the library of 1624 was built with Gothic windows since [...] "some men of judgement" [...] preferred the old fashion as it was [...] "most meet for such a building". Similarly, the artist and art historian Aymer Vallance, writing in 1908, said that Gothic architecture, though [...] "ailing and doomed", [...] "lingered longest" [...] at Oxford University, adding that the chapel windows of Jesus and Wadham were [...] "almost as astonishing for their period" [...] as the [...] "magnificent" [...] 1640 fan-vaulted entrance to the hall of Christ Church, Oxford, built nearly three hundred years after fan vaulting had been used in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral. The only examples of classical style in Oxford before the Civil War were Archbishop Laud's Canterbury Quad at St John's and a few gateways such as those at the Botanic Garden by Nicholas Stone; Cambridge had even less. The chapel has not been universally appreciated, however: [...] the antiquarian and archivist Rowley Lascelles wrote in 1821 that [...] "excepting that it was built by private contributions from the gentry of Wales, it would be cruel to <b>say</b> <b>any</b> thing about it".|$|E

2500|$|Note: [...] For any {{arbitrary}} number of propositional constants, we can form {{a finite number}} of cases which list their possible truth-values.

[...] Below this list, one writes [...] rows, and below [...] one fills {{in the first half of}} the rows with true (or T) and the second half with false (or F). [...] Below [...] one fills in one-quarter of the rows with T, then one-quarter with F, then one-quarter with T and the last quarter with F. [...] The next column alternates between true and false for each eighth of the rows, then sixteenths, and so on, until the last propositional constant varies between T and F for each row. [...] This will give a complete listing of cases or truth-value assignments possible for those propositional constants.|$|E

The conversation turned to the pledges to renegotiate NAFTA made by the two Democratic contenders, Obama and Clinton. Brodie, apparently seeking to play down the potential impact on Canada, told the reporters that the threat was not serious and that someone from Clinton's campaign had even contacted Canadian diplomats to tell them not to worry because the NAFTA threats were mostly political posturing. The Canadian Press news agency quoted that source as saying that Brodie said that someone from Clinton's campaign called and was [...] "telling the embassy to take it with a grain of salt". The Clinton campaign denied it. [...] "We flatly deny the report," [...] said Clinton spokesperson Phil Singer.

The risque cover image was linked to a photogravure titled Kaloma that had been first published by a novelty company in 1914. [...] A 1998 investigative article in the Phoenix New Times revealed that Boyer could not prove the Clum manuscript existed and refused to allow the reporter access to the source documentation. [...] The article also disclosed that the university press' editor encouraged Boyer to embellish the account. During the interview, Boyer said that he had a responsibility to protect the reputation of the Earp brothers, and that he [...] "had a license to <b>say</b> <b>any</b> darned thing I please... lie, cheat, and steal."

2500|$|This {{time it was}} {{a problem}} of too much water.
