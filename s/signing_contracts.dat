5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{interest}} in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept control of their own work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy. The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group's departure.|$|E
5|$|FC Barcelona, nicknamed Barça, is a {{football}} club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain that competes in La Liga, {{the most senior}} football league in Spain. Since its founding in 1899, the club has had 40 different presidents. The club {{is owned by the}} club-members of FC Barcelona, and similarly to a limited liability company, they elect the president by a ballot. The president has the responsibility for the overall management of the club, including formally <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with players and staff. In Spain, it is customary for the president to watch the games in which the first-team participates, together with the president from the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|Haas was {{an amateur}} wrestler in high school, and {{attended}} Seton Hall University on a wrestling scholarship, {{before becoming a}} stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and teamed regularly with his brother, Russ, with the two winning numerous championships on the independent circuit, including the CZW World Tag Team Championship and the JAPW Tag Team Championship. After <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with WWE, The Haas Brothers were assigned to WWE's developmental territories, where they won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. After Russ' death in 2001 due to a heart attack, Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the HWA Heavyweight Championship once.|$|E
30|$|Essentially, senior {{editors and}} junior editors are treated {{differently}} in publishing houses, {{leading to a}} growing tension between them. First, senior editors and junior editors <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> based on different time spans. In the publishing houses I have examined, junior editors <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> once every year in their first three years. Beginning in their fourth year, only those “excellent” (well-behaved) editors are allowed to <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> once every three years. Maybe a few years later, they can <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> once every five years, depending on their performance. Meanwhile, senior editors initially <b>sign</b> their <b>contracts</b> once every three years according to the Labor Law effective in 1995. Afterwards, they <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> that guarantee their lifetime employment. Contracts for senior editors are more symbolic in meaning than real in their effects. They <b>sign</b> <b>contracts</b> only {{to conform to the}} requirements of the Labor Law.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, a U.S. congressional report {{listed a}} number of PMCs and other {{enterprises}} that have <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> to carry out anti-narcotics operations and related activities as part of Plan Colombia. DynCorp was among those contracted by the State Department, while others <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Defense Department. Other companies from different countries, including Israel, have also <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Colombian Defense Ministry to carry out security or military activities.|$|R
50|$|Private U.S. {{corporations}} have <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> {{to carry out}} anti-drug activities as part of Plan Colombia. DynCorp, the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Defense Department.|$|R
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, <b>signing</b> <b>contracts,</b> serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, {{thirteen}} states {{charged that}} Echostar, then {{the parent company}} of Dish Network, had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers' bank accounts for hidden fees. The company settled the lawsuit, paid $5 million, and promised to disclose all terms prior to <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with potential customers.|$|E
25|$|That Anthony had {{remained}} unmarried {{gave her an}} important business advantage in this work. A married woman at that time had {{the legal status of}} feme covert, which, among other things, excluded her from <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> (her husband could do that for her, if he chose). As Anthony had no husband, she was a feme sole and could freely sign contracts for convention halls, printed materials, etc.|$|E
50|$|According to a 2006 U.S. congressional {{report on}} U.S. {{enterprises}} that had <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> {{to carry out}} anti-narcotics activities as part of Plan Colombia, DynCorp, the largest private company involved, was among those contracted by the State Department, while others <b>signed</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Defense Department.|$|R

25|$|Recording {{companies}} like EMI Pakistan, Pepsi Pakistan Inc. and Sound Master started taking {{note of the}} new and rising stars. They started <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with bands including Strings, Vital Signs, Junoon, Benjamin Sister, and Awaz who would later become iconic pop-rock bands. At this time, various rock/pop bands earned a lot of recognition abroad after Vital Signs made its debut international concert in the United States in 1993.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 1857, Oregon's {{delegates to}} the state Constitutional Convention {{submitted}} proposals to legalize slavery and to ban blacks from the state, including a ban on <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> or owning land. The slavery amendment failed, but the exclusion law passed. Oregon was the only state admitted to the Union with such an exclusion law. There are no records that this law was enforced, and the legislature voted down a proposed 1865 law that would authorize sheriffs to deport black residents in their counties.|$|E
25|$|By {{the tenth}} {{year of the}} tournament, the event was firmly {{established}} and had grown so large that a legal entity was needed {{to take responsibility for}} <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> and handling finances. Jacksonville Marine Charities, Inc. (JMC) was founded in 1991 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to run the tournament and distribute the proceeds. Leona Sheddan was executive director of the tournament for eight years. The projects that JMC supports must be marine-oriented and originate with another not-for-profit group. In its history, JMC has awarded over $650,000 to other non-profits, which has benefited all Floridians, as well as First Coast residents.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong's successes {{were much}} the same in 1996. He became the first American to win the La Flèche Wallonne and again won the Tour DuPont. However, {{he was able to}} compete for only five days in the Tour de France. In the 1996 Olympic Games, he {{finished}} 6th in the time trial and 12th in the road race. In August 1996 following the Leeds Classic, Armstrong signed a 2-year, $2m deal with the French Cofidis Cycling Team. Joining him in <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with the French team were teammates Frankie Andreu and Laurent Madouas. Two months later, in October 1996, he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer.|$|E
25|$|Hillman {{knew the}} risks he was taking. The AFL refused to {{recognize}} the new union and the UGW regularly raided it, furnishing strikebreakers and <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with struck employers, {{in the years to}} come. He helped the Amalgamated solidify its gains and extend its power in Chicago through a series of strikes in {{the last half of the}} 1910s and to extend the union's membership into important garment centers in Baltimore and Rochester, New York, where the union had to overcome divisions within garment workers on ethnic lines and the opposition of the Industrial Workers of the World. Manning ramparts for Hillman in Rochester was Paul Blanshard.|$|E
25|$|The General Assembly {{remains the}} highest {{decision}} making {{body of the}} Federation although the actual program of the meeting has developed into a mixture of training, planning and evaluation sessions in between the legislative Plenary Sessions. The work in the Standing Committees of IFMSA is the essence for most delegates: <b>signing</b> <b>contracts,</b> presenting and planning projects are all in a day's work for the National Officers from the participating organizations. An extensive Training and Resource Development component has been integrated in the program, providing the participants with new skills needed in their work, but seldom found in the regular University curriculum: Lobbying Skills, Group Dynamics and Strategic Planning to name a few.|$|E

25|$|By the 1940s, college {{football}} conferences began <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> that tied their championship {{team to a}} particular bowl. In 1947, the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific Coast Conference, a forerunner of today's Pac-12 Conference, agreed to commit their champions {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl every year, an agreement that continued under the BCS. This system raised the possibility that the two top-ranked teams in the final poll would not play each other in a bowl game, even in situations when there was a clear-cut top two. Indeed, since the AP began releasing its final poll after the bowl games in 1968, the two top-ranked teams in the final regular-season AP Poll had only played each other in a bowl six times until special bowl arrangements began in 1992. Under these circumstances, it was not uncommon to have the Coaches Poll crown a different national champion than the AP Poll, resulting in a split championship. This situation arose a total of ten different seasons before BCS was formed (1954, 1957, 1965, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1991, 1997).|$|E
500|$|Following the team's {{loss to the}} Dodgers in the 1981 World Series, the Yankees had a 15-year {{absence from}} the World Series, the longest since the time before their initial {{appearance}} in 1921. As the 1980s progressed, the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents who were often aging and proved to be declining in performance. The atmosphere of turmoil around the club discouraged some players from <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> with New York; they either ignored the Yankees' offers or used them to get more money from other teams. Steinbrenner traded prospects for veterans; sportswriter Buster Olney called this [...] "a practice that ultimately inflicted serious damage on the organization, leaving the team without the needed influx of young and cheap talent." [...] With Steinbrenner at the helm, the team continued to change managers frequently; there were 21 managerial changes {{in his first two}} decades of ownership; Martin served five separate stints as New York's manager.|$|E

When it tried to disenfranchise those locals' members at the UGW's 1914 convention, those locals, representing {{two thirds of the}} union's membership, bolted to form the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.

2500|$|In 1930, {{the company}} made its first foray into the {{aviation}} industry by <b>signing</b> <b>contracts</b> to manufacture aircraft wheels and stainless steel wing ribs.

It was the first aircraft with a structure built out of stainless steel. This was the first aircraft for the Budd Company, and it made its first flight in 1931. Built under Restricted License NR749, its design utilized concepts developed for the Savoia-Marchetti S-56 and was powered by a single [...] Kinner C-5 five-cylinder radial engine.|$|E
