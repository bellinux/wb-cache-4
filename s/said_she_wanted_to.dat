Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out [...] "to do the right thing" [...] when his sister goes missing, and goes about it as a [...] "lone wolf" [...] who wants to take on the responsibility alone.

500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} an acoustic-jazz {{version of the}} song at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria in May 15, 2011. During the song, she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum, but she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> air the track in full. Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21, 2011, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where Gaga wore a metallic black dress, knee-high boots and a semi-circular metallic headdress. The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25, 2011, where she was joined by Clemons in person. Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the [...] "Idol" [...] stage, dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece. A trio of dancers were {{at the base of}} the set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top. At the end of the performance, Gaga and a dancer embraced each other, took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage, landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks, as steam shot up high in the air. Len Melisurgo from The Star-Ledger felt that the performance was too [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga [...] "went just a little too far for a family-oriented show that's geared toward a younger audience?" [...] Conversely, Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga's most memorable television performances. Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night, and felt that Gaga [...] "channeled Bruce Springsteen" [...] in her personality.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton ski mask while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and put you in this trance, which is why I didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, if you think about it. Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed {{a man in the}} bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
