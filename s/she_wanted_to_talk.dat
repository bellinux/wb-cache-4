5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Chinese Cafe", {{from the}} 1982 album Wild Things Run Fast, Mitchell sang, [...] "Your kids {{are coming up}} {{straight}} / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her." [...] These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold {{the story of the}} adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability {{to take care of her}} as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.|$|E
2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young lady}} was {{standing}} {{at the front of the}} hall. [...] "Won't you please come in," [...] she said, [...] "and see mother? <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Walford." ...|$|R

If I die, you two look after Missie Lackalanna. You take rifles, and you look after her daytime and night-time. If <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Mr. Tudor, all right. If <b>she</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> you make him keep away. Savvee?" ...|$|R

But the macoutes come with their guns and knives to stop them. When Jean-Desir is murdered, Paulie must face the truth: before the {{soldiers}} come back to take the boat, they must all leave—tonight, by sea.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{came to know}} Ann {{first as}} a moviegoer. I’d walk into various movie theaters and see the white hair up above the stadium seating. That’s how you'd know she was there. People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E

60|$|When {{she came}} back <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously, tragically, about Putney. But the doctor would not. He said that it paid to sit up with Putney, drunk or sober, and hear him go on. He {{repeated}} some things Putney said about Mr. Peck, about Gerrish, about Mrs. Munger.|$|E
50|$|On 23 November 2013, {{after the}} {{announcement}} by Cabinet of Ukraine about suspension {{of the process of}} signing of association agreement with the EU and after the beginning of Euromaidan, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel said <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the president Vladimir Putin about stopping the pressure on Ukraine.|$|R

She wishes that the letter would be like seeing the writer in person. She {{comments}} on where Adam and Ruby Johnson are staying and where Sallie and Sam went. She talks about her Jim and the picture he promised her. She asks Linnet to not share the information she is sending her. She received the book, knife and picture that was sent...|$|R

6000|$|Phil! The word jarred him, for suddenly--with {{his power}} to see all round a thing, he {{perceived}} why she was putting up with him like this. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about her lover! Well! If it was any pleasure to her! And he said: [...] "Ah! There {{was a bit of}} the sculptor in him, I fancy." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} led the way into the other room. Beaton knew <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him about {{something}} else; but he waited patiently to let her play her comedy out. She spread the cover on the table, and he advised her, as he saw she wished, against putting anything in the corners; just run a line of her stitch around the edge, he said.|$|E
60|$|We didn't {{see each}} other for some months after my resignation, but we kept up a {{frequent}} correspondence. She said twice over that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to say, and I went up to Oxford pretty definitely to see her--though I combined it {{with one or two}} other engagements--somewhere in February. Insensibly she had become important enough for me to make journeys for her.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was about}} {{three weeks before the}} time fixed for the marriage, that Cowles remarked to me one evening that he feared he would be late that night. [...] "I have had a note from Kate," [...] he said, [...] "asking me to call about eleven o'clock to-night, which seems rather a late hour, but perhaps <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over {{something}} quietly after old Mrs. Merton retires." ...|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Loretta and Monty are at home, {{things are}} normal again. LH, the {{superintendent}} of the building comes in {{with a bottle of}} scotch, celebrating his recent raise. Monty invites him to stay for dinner, and LH encourages Monty to try and leave his apartment in order to look for a job. Monty refuses, and it is revealed that Monty and LH are secret lovers. LH tells Monty that he has invited over the daughter of the building owner Paz, who is a documentary filmmaker. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Monty. Monty is unsure, but LH assures him that everything will be fine.|$|R
50|$|Goren is back {{to working}} the door at Arcadia with Stoat, and Melago {{approached}} Stoat, saying <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him alone. When she tells Stoat that Santana is out on bail, Stoat is stunned. Later, Stoat and Goren break into Santana's place and force Santana out of bed. Testarosa is also there and questions Santana while Stoat beats him. Santana denies everything, but Stoat finds Santana’s lighter wired. Since Goren already said that Santana was clean, Testarosa tells Goren to kill Santana there and now. When Goren pulls out a gun and points it at Santana’s head, the police burst in. We see Goren with his gun pointed at the police, with a stunned Eames pointing one right back at him.|$|R
6000|$|But she did {{not listen}} long; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> She sat, {{crouched}} together, by {{the corner of the}} hearthrug under the bookcase that supported the pig's skull, and looked into the fire and up at Ann Veronica's face, and let herself go. [...] "Let us put the lamp out," [...] she said; [...] "the flames are ever so much better for talking," [...] and Ann Veronica agreed. [...] "You are coming right out into life--facing it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Katharine, almost sadly. She {{understood}} that Mary {{was thinking of}} Ralph, and she felt it impossible to press her to reveal more of this exalted condition; she could only respect the fact that, in some few cases, life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass on. She {{rose to her feet}} accordingly. But Mary exclaimed, with unmistakable earnestness, that she must not go; that they met so seldom; that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her so much.... Katharine was surprised at the earnestness with which she spoke. It seemed to her that there could be no indiscretion in mentioning Ralph by name.|$|E
60|$|Here Crystal {{had been}} sitting with Maurice for the past quarter of an hour, while from the ballroom close by came as in a dream to her the gentle lilt of the waltz, and from behind her, a cluster of sweet-scented crimson roses filled the air with their fragrance. Crystal didn't feel that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> only to sit here quietly {{with the sound of}} the music in her ears and the scent of roses in her nostrils. Maurice sat beside her, but he did not hold her hand. He was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and he talked much and earnestly, the while she listened half absently, like one in a dream.|$|E
50|$|The Koenig-reflection {{isolates}} {{itself in}} the Moonbase observatory. From the room's expansive windows, it impatiently watches the assembly of the energy reflector's huge parabolic dish. When moving to caress the crystal sample brought from the asteroid, it is interrupted by Helena. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> questioning his recent harsh behaviour. Temper flaring, the replica blames {{the stress of the}} current crisis. Asserting her authority, the doctor coolly states that its exposure to an alien environment, coupled with its sudden personality change, is cause for a medical exam.|$|R
50|$|Yuma is a third-year {{student at}} Aikyō. Despite Aikyō {{transitioning}} {{to a school}} with {{both male and female}} students, Yuma still embraces the school as an all-girls school, and is seen as an upper-class type of girl. However, she loves the lesser expensive food of the working class, and is known to be quite a glutton in this respect. She is always reserved, and expressionless, though when <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>she</b> will often speak with a wicked tongue. Yuma is in the Naginatajutsu Club, and is very skilled at the sport.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was also}} {{emotional}} in the episode [...] "Lauren" [...] when Prentiss is stabbed by her nemesis, Ian Doyle. JJ joins the team {{waiting in the}} hospital lounge for results to inform them that Prentiss [...] "never made it off the table." [...] We see that Garcia can tell the news is not good by the look on JJ's face. In [...] "Hanley Waters", she is interviewed by Hotch about Prentiss' [...] "apparent death" [...] and says <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the times when Prentiss made her happy instead of about her being gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I found I {{could turn}} the {{consciousness}} you created in me into literary material, and so I was rather eager to go. I have got a point for my new story out of it. I shall have my fellow suffer all I didn't suffer in meeting the girl he knows his mother wants him to marry. I got on very well with those ladies. Mrs. Andrews {{is the mother of}} innocence, but she isn't innocence. She managed to talk of my story without asking about the person who wanted to anticipate the conclusion. That was what you call complex. She was insincere; {{it was the only thing}} <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the time}} did not drag so. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Jim, yet did not, {{because of the}} other passengers. Jim himself {{appeared}} influenced by their absorption in themselves. Besides, the keen, ceaseless vigilance of the guard was not without its quieting effect. Danger lurked ahead in the bends of that road. Joan remembered hearing Kells say that the Bannack stage had never been properly held up by road-agents, but that when he got ready for the job it would be done right. Riding grew to be monotonous and tiresome. With {{the warmth of the}} sun came the dust and flies, and all these bothered Joan. She did not have her usual calmness, and as the miles steadily passed her nervousness increased.|$|E
60|$|He {{then asked}} her {{to walk into the}} house--but she {{declared}} herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks later}} on September 9 Sulkowicz sent Nungesser a message [...] "Wanna hang {{out a little}} bit before meeting tonight? Maybe you have your phone back, I'll text yaaa". Sulkowicz said that <b>she</b> still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|R

60|$|My {{companion}} explained {{quite frankly}} to the doorkeeper {{that it did}} not matter what he said, {{she was not going to}} take any notice of him. He did not look a talkative man at any time, and, maybe, this announcement further discouraged him. In any case, he made no attempt to answer. All he did was to stand in the centre of the doorway with a far-away look in his eyes. The doorway was some four feet wide: he was about three feet six across, and weighed about twenty stone. As I explained, I was busy buying a programme, and when I returned my friend had her hat in her hand, and was digging pins into it: I think she was trying to make believe it was the heart of the doorkeeper. She did not want to listen to the opera, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> all the time about that doorkeeper, but the people round us would not even let her do that.|$|E

If she had been a man, she would have taken a chair and gone to Hyde Park. As it was, she hadn't the nerve for Hyde Park. At least she was afraid she hadn't. It might have to come to that. There was a trembling in her voice that annoyed her. She was so afraid she might cry. She wasn't out for anything crazy. She wanted only those things done that could be done if the people would but lift their eyes, look into one another's faces, see the wrong and the injustice that was all around them, and swear that they would never rest till the pain and the terror had been driven from the land. She wanted soldiers--men and women who would forget their own sweet selves, not counting their own loss, thinking of the greater gain; as in times of war and revolution, when men gave even their lives gladly for a dream, for a hope-- ...|$|E

You are to read that writing or to get it read and to print {{it so that the}} world may read it also. She said that 'Hubert' wishes you to do so. I am sure the name was Hubert, though she also spoke of him with some other title which I do not understand. That's all I can remember, except something about a city, yes, a City of Gold and a last great battle in which Hubert fell, covered with glory and conquering. I understood that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that because it isn't in the writing, but you interrupted and of course she's gone.
