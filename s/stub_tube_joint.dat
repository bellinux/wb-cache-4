40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) assessment of boiling water reactor (BWR) control rod drive penetration <b>stub</b> <b>tubes.</b> In particular, the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP- 1) <b>stub</b> <b>tube</b> leak history was analyzed {{to demonstrate that the}} PFM model could accurately simulate the <b>stub</b> <b>tube</b> leak trend. The model was then used to determine the probability of experiencing additional leaks in the future. It has been shown that the cause {{of a large number of}} leaks early in reactor life (4. 3 effective full power years (EFPY)) was due primarily to exposure of the sensitized Type 304 stainless steel to high conductivity water during the first four fuel cycles. The model predicts an expected future leak rate of about 2 <b>stub</b> <b>tubes</b> per startup if the plant is operated under normal water chemistry (NWC) conditions with conductivity below 0. 2 :S/cm. This leak rate agrees with plant experience averaged over the past 8 cycles which were run with low conductivity water. On the other hand, if the plant is run under hydrogen water chemistry (HWC), only two new leaks are predicted over the next 14 EFPY of operation...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniaturized}} ultrasonic {{scanning system}} for nondestructive in-place, non-immersion testing of brazed joints in stainless-steel tubing is described. The system {{is capable of}} scanning brazed <b>tube</b> <b>joints,</b> with limited clearance access, in 1 / 4 through 5 / 8 inch union, tee, elbow and cross configurations.

It was built around two spars, with stress bearing plywood skin forward of the rear spar forming a box spar. Aft, the wing and full span ailerons were fabric covered. On the prototype, all flying surfaces were edged with cord, resulting in a scalloped finish. All three all-moving, wood-framed and fabric-covered tail surfaces were identical and interchangeable, making the rudder appear unusually tall.

40|$|AbstractSwitch {{condenser}} {{is widely}} used in petroleum and chemical industries, especially in phthalic anhydride plants. The tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> is an important element for the switch condenser. The welding residual stress in the tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> {{is critical to the}} safety and reliability of the switch condenser. In this paper, FEM was used to predict the welding residual stress in the elliptical tube to tube sheet weld of a phthalic anhydride switch condenser. In order to validate the simulated results, a test sample with circular-shaped tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> was prepared. And then the welding residual stresses in the circular tube to tube sheet weld were simulated by the FEM and studied experimentally by the X-ray diffraction method. The simulated results were compared with the test results to verify the finite element analysis. The simulated results show that the residual stress initially decreased sharply and then decreased gradually with the increase of the distance along the direction of the long axis of the elliptical weld. It is found that the maximum welding residual stress in the elliptical tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> appeared at the location of 180 ° in the region of the elliptical weld and reached its peak value. Experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results...|$|R

Works carried out on weldability studies and high temperature properties of Super 304 H weld joints reported the tendency of Super 304 H to hot cracking and use of matching Super 304 H filler metal as an alternate to Ni-based filler metal (Vekeman et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014).

In literature many examples of sheet to sheet solid state welding between similar and dissimilar metals are presented and analyzed in detail. However, {{the most of the}} presented welding applications, which are very focussed on the academic level, are simple specimens for example for tensile test.

In contrast to this approach the majority of typical {{industrial applications}} demand the ability of manufacturing several welds in different positions on the same assembly application comparable to the spot welding process of an automotive car body. Here several spot welds are realised in a variety of positions by a robot mounted spot welding gun. The use of a stationary coil is no option here.
