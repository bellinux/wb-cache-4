He praised the film's cinematography and art direction, though concluded the film [...] "undercuts the figure who most represented the creative individual. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> meandering film {{there is a}} fascinating story about a fascinating person that deserves to be told in more coherent and cogent terms." ...|$|E
500|$|Burkhan Khaldun has {{a spiritual}} {{significance}} unmatched {{by any other}} mountain in Mongolia and is given the symbolic status of the “cradle” of Mongolia's nationhood fully representing the [...] "heritage and traditional ways of life of nomadic people of Mongolia". The (unconfirmed) Mongolian belief that Genghis Khan was born here and is buried <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> mountain has added to its sanctity, particularly since Khan offered worship here and declared the mountain as the most sacred in the country.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} many critics of the character, {{favorable}} comments came from several quarters. Columnist Erma Bombeck wrote, [...] "Kids {{need to know that}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world is a contemporary who can pull off all the things they can only fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live."

2500|$|Evolutionary {{biologist}} Richard Dawkins {{said that}} the discovery of fossil mammals in Precambrian rocks would [...] "completely blow evolution out of the water." [...] Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith doubted that a single set of anachronistic fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove {{the theory of evolution}} outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged [...] "Precambrian rabbits" [...] really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the [...] "fossils", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a hoax such as the Piltdown Man was shown to be. Even if the [...] "Precambrian rabbits" [...] turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific [...] "family tree" [...] that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, [...] "Precambrian rabbits" [...] would prove that there were one or more serious errors <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> package, and the next task would be to identify those errors.|$|E
