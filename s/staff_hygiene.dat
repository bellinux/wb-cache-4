40|$|In {{this article}} we report a {{nosocomial}} outbreak of enterovirus 71 (EV 71) in a newborn nursery and describe the clinical presentations of infected infants. Community outbreaks of EV 71 are quite common in epidemic areas, but a nosocomial outbreak of EV 71 is a rare occurrence. A total of 7 out of 19 infants (37 %) had symptoms. All infants had poor activity, 6 (86 %) had fever, 4 (57 %) had drowsiness, 3 (43 %) had diarrhoea, and 2 (29 %) had oral ulcers. Four infants (57 %) suffered from encephalitis. There were no deaths. EV 71 was isolated from 3 (43 %) of the young infants, while all were positive when tested for EV 71 using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A sequence analysis of the EV 71 partial gene revealed a 98. 6 - 100 % nucleotide similarity.

MethodsMicrobiological samples were collected {{from the hands of}} 112 hospital employees as well as from 120 high-frequency contact surfaces in four hospital departments. Samples were collected on agar plates, analyzed for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by standard microbiology testing, and partially genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. ResultsGenetically identical MRSA was identified on the surface of an electrocardiography device in the medical intensive care unit and on the same type of device in the neurosurgical unit. Genetically similar S. aureus was identified on an infusion pump in the medical intensive care unit and on the hands of several doctors in a different department who regularly use that pump. Genetically identical S. aureus was also identified on bedside rail restraint in the medical intensive care unit and on the hands of the nurse in the neurosurgical unit. Finally, genetically similar MRSA was identified both on the surface of an electrocardiography device and on the suction apparatus in the medical intensive care unit.

For nurses, this has become more important as the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals is increasingObjective: To identify factors that are important for adherence to hand hygiene among health care workers with patient contact. Method: Systematic literature review. Original articles were searched in PubMed and Cinahl. Results: Factors of importance for compliance was profession, lack of time, knowledge/education, physical work environment, attitudes toward hand hygiene, and dry hands. Conclusion: More education, less workload and more visible placement of hand disinfectant containers are examples of actions that could lead to the improvement of <b>staff</b> hand <b>hygiene</b> and reduce the incidence of healthcare associated infections. Due to the fact that health care workers around the world have different training and approaches, the result of this study may be difficult to use.

With the rapid development of out-patient operative care, the lack of adequately trained specialists in this area of sterile materials supply became obvious. The certification program, offered since 2003, closes this gap by focussing on the specific situation of doctor's offices and private-practice clinics, thus equalizing the discrepancies to the hospital situation.

40|$|Introduction: Healthcare-acquired {{infections are}} {{a major source of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in people living in residential aged care facilities. Compliance with hand hygiene by healthcare workers can reduce the risk of infection to residents, yet compliance rates are generally low. Infection-control advocates within the aged care sector are looking to conduct programs to improve rates among their staff. This review was conducted to identify a reproducible intervention to improve <b>staff</b> hand <b>hygiene</b> compliance within an Australian residential aged care facility. Method: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched for combinations of 'hand hygiene', 'hand washing', 'residential aged care facility', 'aged care', 'nursing home' and 'long-term care facility' from 2000 to current. Articles were excluded if the information was not clearly stated as pertaining to a residential aged care facility or if the data investigated staff knowledge or perceptions of hand hygiene. Results: Most of the five articles included in the review reported an improvement in compliance rates. Studies were multimodal, had an education or training component, and included the promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs. Several used aspects of the World Health Organization's hand hygiene initiatives. Compliance audit tools across the studies were not consistent; thus, results may not be comparable. Conclusion: There are few published studies which report interventions that improve hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers within residential aged care facilities. Successful studies included the promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs. More research is needed to improve hand hygiene compliance in the aged care sector...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} routes for the cross-transmission of {{infectious}} microorganisms is by the hands of health care workers (cf. Pittet et al., 1999). Recent health campaigns have highlighted the importance of hand-washing behaviou, especially in high-risk environments. Hence, this study used a hypothetical medical scenario to investigate face recognition linked to hand-washing behaviours (e. g. subject imagined she was a patient with an exposed injury in a hospital ward and observed the hand-washing habits of its medical staff). It was hypothesized that subjects would recognize the faces of staff who did not wash their hands better than the ones who washed them. There were 12 faces to be memorized in three conditions (washed hands, dirty hands, and neutral - i. e. unknown hand-washing behaviour). Experiment 1 (faces memorized individually) revealed that subjects (N= 29) remembered faces of staff who washed and did not wash their hands better than the neutral ones. Experiment 2 (group memorization) showed that subjects' (N= 31) accuracy to the faces in the three hand-washing conditions was statistically similar. No biases in reaction times were observed in the two experiments. In short, subjects did not attend differently to the hand-washing behaviour of medical <b>staff.</b> Since <b>hygiene</b> has strong biological roots (cf. Curtis, 2005), the {{lack of attention to}} hand-washing behaviours in a hazardous hypothetical scenario may be linked (among other reasons) to the fact that infectious microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye...|$|R

In connection with this goal, one research question has been identified: "What kind of care {{is provided by the}} individual nursing staff to the Alzheimer's clients?" The empirical part of the bachelor thesis was elaborated by the method of a qualitative research survey, which was carried out by the technique of unstructured observation of the nursing staff in providing nursing care to Alzheimer's patients in the Alzheimer Center. The observation itself was focused on how the selected nurse takes care of the client during the shift, especially in the provision of hygiene care, diet, rehabilitation, health care, and during communication with the client. The data obtained were processed by an open coding technique, in which six categories were created for individual areas of nursing care: <b>staff</b> reporting, <b>hygiene</b> care, nutrition, rehabilitation, client communication and health care. The research sample included nurse, medical assistants and social services workers. Based on the results of the research, we can describe the care provided as complex and individual.

Materials and Methods: This study was cross-sectional and census method was used as data collecting method. Sampling was done in the first half of the year 2008 so that Choliform bacterial situation in four ice manufacturing houses at the cities of Kerman was evaluated. Water and ice samples collected from three different process of ice-making (entrance, processing, exit). Samples were taken in the first two-month of Spring and last month of Summer (each month, ten times). Results: Results showed that 27 samples out of 120 samples had Choliform infection. Minimum infection was related to entrance process (approximately 7. 5 %) and maximum infection related to exit process (approximately 37. 5 %).

40|$|We {{describe}} polyclonal {{spread of}} colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in an acute general hospital in Italy. Between June and December 2011, 58 colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were recovered from 28 patients admitted to different wards, but {{mainly in the}} intensive care units. All isolates were tested for drug susceptibility and the presence of beta-lactamase (bla) genes. Clonality was investigated by repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) -PCR and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Fifty-two isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for colistin of 6 - 128 mg/L, carried bla(KPC 3) and were attributed to sequence type ST 258. The remaining six isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, exhibited MICs for colistin of 3 - 32 mg/L, and belonged to two different types, ST 15 and ST 273. Rep-PCR included all isolates in three clusters, one containing all ST 258 KPC- 3 -producing isolates and two containing ST 15 and ST 273 isolates. Cross-transmission containment measures and intensification of <b>staff</b> and environmental <b>hygiene</b> could not stop the outbreak. Selective pressure and horizontal transmission probably contributed to emergence and spread of three different strains of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae in the hospital. Strict implementation of the above measures and a wider awareness of the antimicrobial resistance threat are crucial to preserve the last therapeutic options of the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections...|$|R
40|$|Site visits {{were made}} to DOE {{beryllium}} handling facilities at the Rocky Flats Plant; Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant, LLNL; {{as well as to}} the AWE Cardiff Facility. Available historical data from each facility describing its beryllium control program were obtained and summarized in this report. The AWE Cardiff Facility computerized Be personal and area air-sampling database was obtained and a preliminary evaluation was conducted. Further validation and documentation of this database will be very useful in estimating worker Be. exposure as well as in identifying the source potential for a variety of Be fabrication activities. Although all of the Be control programs recognized the toxicity of Be and its compounds, their established control procedures differed significantly. The Cardiff Facility, which was designed for only Be work, implemented a very strict Be control program that has essentially remained unchanged, even to today. LLNL and the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant also implemented a strict Be control program, but personal sampling was not used until the mid 1980 s to evaluate worker exposure. The Rocky Flats plant implemented significantly less controls on beryllium processing than the three previous facilities. In addition, records were less available, management and industrial <b>hygiene</b> <b>staff</b> turned over regularly, and less control was evident from a management perspective...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a program}} {{intended}} to replace the present evaporative coolant at the gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs) with a non-ozone-depleting alternate, a series of investigations of the suitability of candidate substitutes in under way. One issue concerning a primary candidate, c-C 4 F 8, {{is the possibility that}} it might produce the highly toxic perfluoroisobutylene (PFIB) in high temperature environments. This study was commissioned to determine the likelihood and severity of decomposition under two specific high temperature thermal environments, namely the use of a flame test for the presence of coolant vapors and welding in the presence of coolant vapors. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop and evaluate available data to provide information that will allow the technical and industrial <b>hygiene</b> <b>staff</b> at the GDPs to perform appropriate safety evaluations and to determine the need for field testing or experimental work. The scope of this study included a literature search and an evaluation of the information developed therefrom. Part of that evaluation consists of chemical kinetics modeling of coolant decomposition in the two operational environments. The general conclusions are that PFIB formation is unlikely in either situation but that it cannot be ruled out completely under extreme conditions. The presence of oxygen, moisture, and combustion products will tend to lead to formation of oxidation products (COF 2, CO, CO 2, and HF) rather than PFIB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The primary {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} was that a lecture on basic hygiene routines could be associated with an increase in the use of disinfectant for hand hygiene. A secondary hypothesis was that the lecture could positively affect the staff’s knowledge of and attitudes toward basic hygiene routines. A quasi-experimental design including one ward of the department of orthopedics in a Swedish university hospital was adopted. During the pre-intervention test period the consumption of hand disinfectant was measured for 30 days and a questionnaire was distributed to all <b>staff.</b> The hospital <b>hygiene</b> nurse subsequently provided a lecture on basic hygiene routines to all employees on the ward. During the post-intervention test period the hand disinfectant consumption was measured for another 30 days, and the questionnaire was distributed once again. A follow-up measurement was performed 9 months after the intervention. After the lecture on hygiene routines, the consumption of hand disinfectant increased by 93 %. Nine months after the intervention, the consumption was still 21 % higher than before the intervention. The result of the questionnaire showed that the employees considered themselves applying the disinfectant more thoroughly after the intervention. Some employees changed their perspective on basic hygiene routines after the lecture and stopped using watches and private clothes at work. Our findings suggest that a single education session, a hygiene lecture, could be a simple and cost-effective method to increase the use of hand disinfectant, thereby reducing the number of nosocomial infections on the wards...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Background: Hand hygiene is the most {{important}} intervention to prevent infection in hospitals. Health care workers should clean their hands at least before and after contact with patients. Hand sanitizer dispensers are important to support hand hygiene because they can be made available throughout hospital units. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the usability of sanitizer dispensers correlates with compliance of staff in using the sanitizer in a hospital. This study took place in a Midwest, 404 -bed, private, nonprofit community hospital with 15 inpatient care units in addition to several ambulatory units. Methods: The usability and standardization of sanitizers in 12 participating inpatient units were evaluated. The hospital measured compliance of <b>staff</b> with hand <b>hygiene</b> as part of their quality improvement program. Data from 2010 - 2012 were analyzed to measure the relationship between compliance and usability using mixed-effects logistic regression models. Results: The total usability score (P =. 0046), visibility (P =. 003), and accessibility of the sanitizer on entrance to the patient room (P =. 00055) were statistically associated with higher observed compliance rates. Standardization alone showed no significant impact on observed compliance (P =. 37). Conclusion: Hand hygiene compliance can be influenced by visibility and accessibility of dispensers. The sanitizer location should be part of multifaceted interventions to improve hand hygiene. Funding support was provided through the Bronson Research Fund...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} factors associated with noncompliance to hand hygiene standards among nurses in one public hospital in Windhoek, Namibia. A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional research design was employed using a stratified sample comprising three categories of nurses (registered, enrolled and auxiliary nurses). Data collection was done using a structured questionnaire. Based on the results, there were more institutional than individual factors associated with noncompliance to hand hygiene. Compliance to hand hygiene was found to be lowest when nurses provide care for patients in non-isolation rooms, when the perceived risk of acquiring infection from patients was low and following brief encounters with patients. Dryness of the skin caused by hand hygiene agents and lack of active participation in hand hygiene promotion at individual level contributed to noncompliance to hand hygiene among nurses. In addition, the results showed that, institutionally there were no rewards/encouragement for hand hygiene, no sanctions for non-compliers and no workshops, seminars and continuing educational courses on hand hygiene. The study produced interesting insights into the vital role that good leadership plays in the implementation of hand hygiene policy guidelines. The key recommendations for this study included development of good leadership, characterized by dedication for hygiene standards to encourage <b>staff</b> to maintain <b>hygiene</b> practice and to ensure that there are adequate resources for the implementation of hand hygiene policy as well as rewards/incentives for compliers and sanctions for noncompliersHealth StudiesM.
