40|$|Apomorphine-induced {{locomotor}} {{activity in}} reserpine-pretreated mice was antagonized by pretreatment with (-) -sulpiride and (-) -sultopride. The (+) -enantiomers were inactive. Apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviour in rats were antagonized by (-) -sultopride {{but not by}} the (+) -enantiomer. Neither enantiomer of sulpiride prevented {{the onset of the}} stereotyped response. Both (-) -sulpiride and (-) -sultopride induced increases in striatal and mesolimbic HVA and DOPAC concentrations; (+) -sultopride elevated striatal and mesolimbic DOPAC concentrations but not HVA, while (+) -sulpiride had no effect on HVA or DOPAC in either area. Dopamine concentrations were reduced by the enantiomers of <b>sultopride</b> but not by sulpiride. Low concentrations (10 ? 9 ? 10 ? 66 M) of the (-) -enantiomers of both drugs displaced [3 H]spiperone from its specific binding site in rat striatal preparations, but the (+) -enantiomers were 40 and 100 times less active. However, neither enantiomer of either drug anatagonized the dopamine-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase in rat striatal preparations. The data suggest that the central pharmacological activity of sulpiride and <b>sultopride</b> resides in the (-) -enantiomers and that this activity occurs at cerebral dopamine receptors not dependent on adenylate cyclase for functional activity...|$|E

40|$|Haloperidol {{inhibited}} dopamine (DA) mediated behaviours and induced pronounced catalepsy in rodents. Metoclopramide, sulpiride, <b>sultopride,</b> tiapride and clebopride, in general, also inhibited these behaviours {{but only}} clebopride induced marked catalepsy. Haloperidol displaced 3 H-haloperidol and 3 H-spiperone from striatal binding sites and inhibited DA stimulated cyclase from striatal and mesolimbic regions. In general, substituted benzamide drugs displaced labelled ligands, {{but did not}} inhibit adenylate cyclase. Elevations of striatal HVA produced by haloperidol and sulpiride, but not other benzamide drugs, were partially reversed by atropine. Hypophysectomy did not prevent the elevation of forebrain HVA produced by sulpiride and metoclopramide.

40|$|A {{histidine}} residue (His(394)) that {{is likely}} to be located in the ligand-binding region of the D- 2 dopamine receptor has been mutated to a leucine (Leu(394)), and the properties of the mutant receptor have been determined. For a range of antagonists the mutation has only a minor effect on the affinity of the receptor for the antagonist. The mutation does, however, elicit a structurally specific effect on the affinity with which certain members of the substituted benzamide class of antagonist bind to the receptor. Some of these drugs, e. g., sulpiride, <b>sultopride,</b> and tiapride, bind with reduced affinity to the mutated receptor, whereas others, e. g., clebopride and metoclopramide, bind with increased affinity. However, the Na+/H+ sensitivity of the binding of sulpiride to the receptor is not reduced by the mutation. These findings have been interpreted in terms of the productive or unfavourable interaction of the His(394) residue with these compounds...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{acquired}} long QT syndrome results {{most often}} {{from the action}} of I(Kr) blocking-drugs on cardiac repolarization. We have evaluated a transgenic (TG) mouse (FVB) overexpressing a dominant-negative KvLQT 1 isoform, as an in vivo screening model for I(Kr) blocking drugs. RESULTS: In TG mice, six-lead ECGs demonstrated sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation. Various drugs were injected intraperitoneally after blockade of the autonomic nervous system and serial ECGs were recorded. The end of the initial rapid phase of the T wave corrected for heart rate using a formula for mouse heart (QTrc), {{was used as a}} surrogate for the QT interval. Dofetilide, a specific I(Kr) blocker, did not prolong the QTrc interval either in TG or in wild-type (WT) mice but dose-dependently lengthened the sinus period in TG mice but not in WT mice. Other I(Kr) blockers including E 4031, haloperidol, <b>sultopride,</b> astemizole, cisapride and terikalant behaved similarly to dofetilide. Tedisamil, a blocker of the transient outward current, dose-dependently prolonged the QTrc in WT mice but not in TG mice and also reduced the sinus rhythm in both WT and TG mice. Lidocaine dose-dependently shortened the QTrc interval in TG mice and also lengthened the P wave duration. Nicardipine dose-dependently shortened QTrc and also produced sinus arrest in both WT and TG mice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that KvLQT 1 -invalidated TG mice discriminates in vivo drugs that blocks I(Kr) from drugs that block the transient outward current, the sodium current or the calcium curren...|$|E
40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or <b>sultopride</b> or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
