Flash ADCs have been conventionally employed {{to achieve these}} goals but have been proved to be power hungry and ineffective for higher resolution. Time-interleaved converters are another option that relax the device speed and circuit complexity. Current research shows that at high input frequencies in the MultiGigaHertz range, the performance of these time-interleaved high speed ADCs is limited mainly by the sampling clock jitter. In this work, the effect of clock jitter on the data acquisition for a sampled data system is analyzed and discussed. Under the premise that, for a given jitter specification, it {{is relatively easy to}} generate a clean high frequency sinusoidal signal than a high frequency <b>squarewave</b> <b>signal,</b> this proposed work makes use of a clean sinusoid as the sampling clock. This high frequency sinusoidal clock, embedded with low frequency squarewave clocks, is employed in a proposed bottom plate sampling Track-and-Hold (T/H) architecture with the aim of improving the SNR at multi-GigaHertz frequencies. A comparative study on the performance of this T/H circuit (SNDR,ENOB) for sinusoidal sampling and conventional squarewave sampling is presented. The work concludes that for high frequency sampled data acquisition system, where sampling clock with sub- 1 ps jitter values are needed, the presented scheme of sinusoidal sampling is advantageous for reducing sampling clock uncertainty when compared against the conventional squarewave sampling technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a RF Pulse Width Modulator (RF-PWM) for switched-mode power am-plification of varying envelope signals. The general idea is to modulate the varying envelope <b>signal</b> using <b>squarewave</b> <b>signals</b> with varying width and subsequently drive a class D-type power amplifier. The linearity in the modulator is ensured by a novel combination of low frequency feedback combined with predistortion. Measurements on a frequency wise down-scaled prototype show that the RF-PWM modulator modulates a UMTS signal with more than 17 dB margin to the modulation mask and EVM below 0. 5 % RMS. This leads to the conclusion that sufficient linearity and modulation accuracy can be obtained using RF Pulse Width Modulation...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for demodulation and {{correlation of}} a code modulated 10 MHz signal is presented. The apparatus {{is comprised of}} a sample and hold analog-to-digital converter synchronized by a frequency coherent 40 MHz pulse to obtain four evenly spaced samples {{of each of the}} signal. Each sample is added or subtracted to or from one of four accumulators to or from the separate sums. The correlation functions are then computed. As a further feature of the invention, multipliers are each multiplied by a <b>squarewave</b> chopper <b>signal</b> having a period that is long relative to the period of the received signal to foreclose contamination of the received signal by leakage from either of the other two terms of the multipliers...|$|R
