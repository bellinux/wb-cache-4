40|$|Background Public {{policy and}} {{clinical}} treatment in tobacco addiction in the UK {{has focused on}} cessation: an abrupt attempt to stop all cigarettes. However, recent evidence suggests that allowing more gradual withdrawal from tobacco or even permanent partial substitution by nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) could lead to net benefits to public health. No jurisdiction has introduced smoking <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> in normal clinical care and the best methods for their implementation is uncertain. Community pharmacists offering smoking cessation services in the UK are ideally placed to implement <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes.</b> This pilot study aims therefore to examine the feasibility of implementing smoking <b>reduction</b> <b>programme</b> in pharmacies, and also to see if behavioural support and a longer treatment affect the success rate for cessation. Design and methods This is a 2 × 2 randomised factorial trial of behavioural support versus no support and short versus standard length <b>reduction</b> <b>programme.</b> The pharmacists will recruit 16 patients per pharmacy, 160 smokers altogether. Pharmacists will randomise each participant by sealed envelopes. In a standard supported programme, the pharmacist will give support for 34 weeks, inviting participants to set a treatment goal and providing {{advice on how to}} reduce cigarette use.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{quantify}} {{the contribution of}} locally implemented prevention programmes in contributing to reductions in treatment and care costs by averting HIV infections among those who inject drugs this study calculates net financial benefit of providing harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> using information from services being implemented in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China (between 2005 and 2010). Methods Information was collected to assess cost of providing methadone treatment (MMT) and needle and syringe programmes (NSP). HIV incidence was estimated among people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV infections averted were calculated. Net benefit was assessed by estimating costs of providing prevention programmes and comparing these to the costs of providing care. Results An estimated 5678 (range 3982 – 7599) HIV infections were averted between 2005 and 2010 and the net financial benefit of providing harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> compared to treatment and care costs for HIV infections averted was USD 4. 383 million {{during the same time}} period. Conclusion These results demonstrate the net and accumulating benefit of investing in harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> for PWID in Urumqi. The return on investment progressively increased during the time period studied and it is clear that these cost savings will continue to accrue with the continued implementation of HIV prevention interventions in the community that include harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> targeted at PWID. </p...|$|R

40|$|Living in impoverished urban areas, female headed {{households}} {{are most vulnerable}} to food insecurity. In {{order to reduce the}} risk and abate the experience of household food insecurity, civil society (NGO) and government have established numerous poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> and initiatives. However, in spite of ongoing efforts, the proportion of South African households experiencing food insecurity has not decreased but rather plateaued (SANHANES- 1, Shisana et al, 2013). In order to address this plateau, the research has answered the question - how do food insecure female headed households experience the contributions of poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> in meeting their food security needs? The purpose of the study has been to add to relevant literature, with the aim of describing what food insecure households consider the contribution of poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> to be in meeting their food security needs. The research had four objectives - to describe (1) what food insecure households believe food in/security is, (2) how food insecure households experience food insecurity, (3) the characteristics of effective poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspective of food insecure households, and (4) the characteristics of ineffective poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspective of food insecure households. A descriptive qualitative methodology was used with data gathered through the methods of Photovoice with photo-elicitation interviews, semi-structured interviews, collage, observation field notes and a self-constructed questionnaire. The research participants, five female heads of households, were purposively sampled from a low-income Cape Town community. The research found that participant's food insecurity could not be separated from their lived experience of poverty. Making use of and influenced by Internal and External Drivers, participants were found to actively engage their living conditions with the use of social networks to be of particular importance. Participants experienced the contributions of programmes as 'half a help'. While programmes did help the participants and their households, that help served to only sustain rather than uplift them out of poverty and towards food security. If the plateau is to be addressed, then this study has argued that local programmes need to better engage their users and join with other multi-scale actors to form integrated poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> which offer more comprehensive, collaborative and dynamic approaches to the realization of household food security in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to tailor lumbo-pelvic-hip (LPH) injury <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> in {{professional}} rugby union players based on screening data and examine its effectiveness. Design: Prospective case controlled study. Methods: Twenty-eight professional rugby union players were screened pre- and immediately post- the YO-YO intermittent recovery level 1 test using six hip and groin strength tests (adductor squeeze at 0 o, 60 o and 90 o, prone hip extension, abductor, adductor hand held dynamometry). The changes in hip and groin measures, were analysed using hierarchical cluster analysis.

The purpose of the study is to understand the situation in King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality and come up with recommendations that will assist government to enhance delivery of poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> in order to improve the quality of life of the rural poor in King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality. The research methodology for this study is descriptive, sourced from available literature. Due to the restricted extent of the research, no empirical survey is conducted. A number of normative criteria that deal with the research problem are identified from the available literature from which findings are drawn and recommendations made. The findings of the study show that; whilst significant progress has been made to address poverty through policy and legal frameworks and through implementation of poverty <b>reduction</b> strategies and <b>programmes,</b> there is a general consensus in literature that poverty is still widespread in South Africa and that activities put in place to reduce and eradicate it are not sufficiently translating into required outputs necessary for desired outcomes which ultimately impact on poverty.

40|$|Injection {{drug use}} is {{prevalent}} in northwestern Bangladesh. We sought to explore the context of needle/syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs (PWID), examining risk exposures to blood-borne infections like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis {{in a region where}} these dual epidemics are likely to expand. We used a qualitative research approach to learn about injection practices, conducting 60 in-depth interviews among PWID. We then conducted 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) that generated a checklist of salient issues, and followed up with personal observations of typical days at the drug-use venues. Content and interpretative frameworks were used to analyze qualitative information and socio-demographic information, using SPSS software. We found that needle/syringe-sharing behaviours were integrated into the overall social and cultural lives of drug users. Sharing behaviours were an central component of PWID social organization. Sharing was perceived as an inherent element within reciprocal relationships, and sharing was tied to beliefs about drug effects, economic adversity, and harassment due to their drug user status. Carrying used needles/syringes to drug-use venues was deemed essential since user-unfriendly needle-syringe distribution schedules of harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> made it difficult to access clean needles/syringes in off-hours. PWID had low self-esteem. Unequal power relationships were reported between the field workers of harm <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> and PWID. Field workers expressed anti-PWID bias and judgmental attitudes, and also had had misconceptions about HIV and hepatitis transmission. PWID were especially disturbed that no assistance was forthcoming from risk <b>reduction</b> <b>programme</b> staff when drug users manifested withdrawal symptoms. Interventions must take social context into account when scaling up programmes in diverse settings. The social organization of PWID include values that foster needle-syringe sharing. Utilization and impact of risk <b>reduction</b> <b>programmes</b> might be improved with expanded clean needle/syringe distribution at times and venues convenient for PWID, better trained and non-judgmental staff, and medical assistance for health problems, including drug withdrawal symptoms...|$|R
