5000|$|The {{first scene}} filmed {{for the second}} series was Episode 1, Scene 55, in which Pete sees Rachel and {{what he thinks is}} her baby in the {{supermarket}}. The scene was shot in a Morrisons supermarket on a Sunday evening after closing time. Although many babies played the one part, Tom Hooper found the scene difficult. Another scene in the same episode featured David pulling Josh from {{out of the way of}} an oncoming car. The scene was filmed in two parts; one of David pulling Josh out of the way, acting in front of a green screen, and the other of the car coming towards the camera. The two parts were composited afterwards. When rehearsing the scene, Bathurst picked up a lightweight dummy. As the child actor in the scene as filmed was much heavier, Bathurst had to drag him, as he could not pick him up. He believed the result looked more realistic. The paintball scenes in Episode 3 were filmed at Tatton Park in Cheshire. Tom Vaughan directed the scene like [...] "a bad action movie". Although <b>safety</b> <b>advisers</b> were on set, John Thomson and Rosie Cavaliero were injured by the paintballs.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the transport of dangerous substances by rail. The transport follows the instructions of international legal regulation which is called Regulations Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID). The Regulations is the main document for transport of dangerous substances in the CR and also in other forty contractual countries which accepted RID's conditions. Dangerous substances are transported a lot and the increase of transported substances {{in the future is}} predictable. The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis contains an enumeration of international and internal legal regulations which are related to problems of transport of dangerous substances. The theoretical part also describes risks of dangerous chemical substances and mixtures and the labelling of dangerous substances according to RID. The Regulations includes the description of particular categories of dangerous substances, the characteristic of substances and the pattern which is used on the precautionary sign. All the means of transport which are used for transport of dangerous substances are labelled according to UN system. This precautionary labelling must be on all the wagons. The important section of the theoretical part is the chapter focuses on activities and duties of <b>safety</b> <b>advisers.</b> The end of the theoretical part is the chapter about treatment with dangerous substances which includes packaging, loading and unloading. These goals were determined for processing of this thesis: To map and to describe the transport of dangerous substances from loading to unloading. To evaluate how safety the transport of dangerous substances by rail is. To evaluate preparedness of fire and rescue services for possible extraordinary events connected with leakage of dangerous substances during the transport by rail. Thanks to analysis of available literary sources and corresponding legal regulations was discovered that European regulations and international agreements are successfully accepted into legal regulations of the CR. For fulfilment of goals and for answer a research question, it was necessary to make qualitative research via prepared questionnaires. The questionnaire was created from sixteen open questions. These questions were aimed at <b>safety</b> <b>advisers</b> from different companies in the CR. The condition was: The companies have to deal with cargo transport of dangerous substances by rail according to RID. The questionnaire was mainly focused on duties and training of <b>safety</b> <b>advisers,</b> on the transport of dangerous substances by rail and their quantity, on the description of activities during loading and unloading, on activities of employees and fire and rescue services during the extraordinary events connected with leakage of dangerous substances. It is also focused on their own evaluation how safety the transport of dangerous substances by rail is. From the five addressed companies even four <b>safety</b> <b>advisers</b> were willing to cooperate and to contribute to creation of this bachelor thesis. They were willing to cooperate despite their workload. The goals were fulfilled thanks to gained data from the questionnaires. The research question was also answered. It was discovered that the transport of dangerous substances by rail is, according to specialists, safe for all the time during the treatment with dangerous substances. The most dangerous thing is the human failure during the loading and unloading processes. The fire and rescue services intervene during the leakage of dangerous substances which happens in the course of transport. The fire and rescue services cooperate with <b>safety</b> <b>advisers</b> and they solve the actual extraordinary event. Their preparedness is on the high level. It is because of regular training where it is simulated the leakage of dangerous substances according to inner emergency plan. Finally, some of the railway transit corridors for the regular transport of dangerous substances were mapped...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} and relevance of independent acceptance testing {{was assessed by}} means of an audit of acceptance procedures for 17 MRI systems, with field strengths in the range 0. 5 – 1. 5 T, acquired over 8 years. Signal-to-noise ratio and geometric linearity were found to be the image quality parameters most likely to fall below acceptable or expected standards. These received confirmed successful corrective action in 69 % of instances. Non-uniformity, ghosting and poor fat suppression were the next most common non-compliant parameters, but yielded less satisfactory outcomes. Spatial resolution was not found to be a sensitive parameter in determining acceptability. 49 % of all non-compliant parameters received verifiable corrective attention. A schedule of actual acceptance criteria is presented and shown to be reasonable. Parameter failure rates were shown not to have improved with time. A safety audit of 11 of the installations revealed the most common failings to be inadequate suite layout and poor use of signs. The mean number of safety issues per installation identified as requiring attention was 5, from a questionnaire of 100 points. A number of anecdotal errors and omissions are reported. The data support the importance of an appropriate acceptance procedure for new clinical MRI equipment and for the involvement of a suitably qualified <b>safety</b> <b>adviser</b> on the project team from the outset...|$|R

Trade union membership fell steadily during the 1980 s and 1990 s, from a peak of over 13 million in 1979 to 7. 9 million in the year ending March 20001. As a result of this decline, and of the increasing number of workers employed by small businesses, far fewer workers today are covered by trade union health and safety representatives.

40|$|Up to {{the late}} 1960 s the {{chemical}} industry looked upon safety as a non-technical subject but {{after a number of}} serious accidents technical people with production experience began to be appointed as <b>safety</b> <b>advisers.</b> There had been so little systematic thinking that it was not diffiult for them to make improvements such as: (a) the development of systematic methods, now widely used, for identifying and assessing hazards, (b) the development of inherently safer designs (in contrast, the industry has been slower to adopt this change), (c) {{the development of a new}} attitude towards human error. These, and other, changes produced a dramatic improvement in the industry’s accident rate and raised the reputation of the subject to today’s level. The 1980 s were a period of consolidation rather than innovation. Finally, we look ahead to the 1990 s. ...|$|E
40|$|Port {{areas are}} {{a meeting place}} for {{different}} modes of transport which are road, sea and railway. These transports can in some cases contain dangerous goods, and therefore different regulations apply depending on the mode of transport. In Sweden, ADR-S is applied on road transport, RID-S on railway and the IMDG-code with sea transports. In port areas, all these three regulations intersect and are all applicable but have different rules that overlap each other. Therefore, {{it is interesting to}} investigate where the interface between these regulations go, which has been done through a survey of how the regulations has been applied in Swedish ports today. The aim of this report is to examine where the interface between the three different regulations are within a port area with focus on how the ports work today. The report consists of three questions based on the aim of the report. The questions have been answered by using two methods, interview and questionnaires, to get qualitative data. An interview was done with the Swedish coast guard which have supervision of dangerous goods in port areas and the questionnaires was sent out to eleven different ports and their <b>safety</b> <b>advisers.</b> The questions both in the interview and questionnaires were based on the three main questions in the report. The replies gathered from the ports and the interview is presented in the result section of the report to then be discussed in the discussion section. After an analysis of the different replies the conclusion was that there is no specific border between the different regulations ADR-S, RID-S and the IMDG-code. However, the Swedish coast guard have a specific idea of where the borders go. The author’s recommendation is therefore that the ports should apply the interface {{in the same way as}} the Swedish coast guard has...|$|E
40|$|Background Anecdotal reports {{suggested}} that farmers were sustaining significant injuries while ear tagging newborn calves or clipping cattle prior to slaughter. Aims This national survey {{was designed for}} determining the incidence and nature of self-reported injuries to farmers that were sustained while tagging calves and clipping cattle. Methods A cross-sectional, anonymous, postal questionnaire survey was sent to {{all members of the}} National Farmers Union of Scotland with beef or dairy cattle (n = 4495). Results In total, 2439 (54 %) usable questionnaires were received and 1341 injuries were reported by 591 (24 %) respondents. Tagging-related injuries were reported by 297 (12 %) respondents. The most commonly described injury was bruising, but lacerations (3 %) and fractures (3 %) also occurred. Fifty-eight (20 %) individuals lost time from work, with a median of 3 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 2 – 7 days]. Four hundred and eighteen (17 %) respondents reported clipping-related injuries. The most common injury was bruising, but lacerations (6 %) and fractures (7 %) also occurred. Ninety-five (23 %) individuals lost time from work, with a median of 4 days (IQR = 2 – 14 days). Tagging injuries more commonly affected lower limbs and the trunk, while clipping injuries affected the upper limbs. Tagging injuries were associated with working alone, in an open field and with a vehicle nearby, while clipping injuries were associated with working alone, with beef cattle and with younger age. Both types of injury were associated with injuries from livestock in other circumstances. Conclusions Tagging calves and clipping cattle prior to slaughter are associated with a significant risk of injury, which may be severe, necessitating treatment and time lost from work. Policy makers, <b>safety</b> <b>advisers</b> and the farming community should reconsider whether these procedures are necessary and whether current guidelines should be modified in order to improve safety.
