5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community.

For them, <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties.

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and <b>social</b> <b>factors.</b> Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and <b>social</b> <b>factors</b> play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E

The authors propose to consider a methodology for evaluating the utilization efficiency of former industrial areas, which is based on principles of integral assessment which includes the <b>social</b> <b>factor.</b> The result of the author's methodology is that it: will, in view of the <b>social</b> <b>factor,</b> determine the amount of total investment as the sum of costs before entering contracts.

40|$|The modern {{sciences}} {{more often}} use the gender {{factor in the}} interpretative procedure. Demographers also have chance to involve this factor in analysis. There are some indicators of gender gaps or inequalities in distribution of resources located in both microenvironment (households) and macroenvironment. Human capital formation and development also demonstrate gender inequalities in process. Population mortality analysis usually uses sex variable in explanation of differences by age, time, causes of death, etc. We shall try to underline particularly gender factor in population mortality that is gender on social sense 1. We are interested in how social roles, social relations, gender (social) behavior influence on gender overmortality. Thus, in this paper gender factor will means only <b>social</b> <b>factor</b> in opposite to sex factor like biological one.

Moreover, we could not very often describe <b>social</b> <b>factor</b> of overmortality by the formal way.
