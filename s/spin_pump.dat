40|$|We {{investigate}} a nonadiabatic parametric quantum pump {{consisting of a}} nonmagnetic scattering region connected by two ferromagnetic leads. The presence of ferromagnetic leads allows electrons with different spins to experience different potential landscapes. Using this effect we propose a quantum <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> that drives spin-up electrons to flow {{in one direction and}} spin-down electrons to flow in opposite direction.

40|$|In Ref 1 [Phy. Rev. B 74, 195312 (2006) ] Fu and Kane {{propose a}} <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> for onedimensional (1 D) {{insulating}} Hamiltonians. They {{claim that this}} <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> is a Z 2 pump because For an isolated system, a single closed cycle of the pump changes the expectation value of the spin at each end even when spin-orbit interactions violate the conservation of spin. A second cycle, however, returns the system to its original state. A Z 2 topological invariant is proposed to characterize the Z 2 pump. In this comment we show their discussion on the <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> is inaccurate. Their reason why the isolated system return to its original state after second cycle is unjustified and several claims contradict to this return of the system are made in Ref 1. Detailed calculations and concrete examples show the degeneracy of the first excited state at t = 0, T; is not split by the electron-electron interaction in the way described in Ref 1 and there is level crossing at t = T. In fact, despite of a detailed search, not a single system behave as described in Fig. 1 (d) in Ref 1 has been found. Thus we conclude the isolated system won't return to its original state after two cycles and the <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> is not a Z 2 pump in general...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of a}} <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> {{in the presence of}} a superconducting lead. The <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> is facilitated by a rotating magnetic field which provides a spin flip mechanism and hence can generate a spin current without an accompanying charge current. Using a nonequilibrium Green's function method, we obtain a general solution of the pumped charge current and spin current in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. The numerical results for the charge current and spin current are presented as we vary different system parameters such as the gate voltage, the external magnetic field, and the pumping frequency. We find that for a quantum dot with a single resonant level in line with the Fermi energy of the left normal lead, a pure spin current is generated by a rotating magnetic field at any frequency. We have identified two kinds of photon-assisted processes which dominate at low pumping frequencies and high pumping frequencies, respectively. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The {{resonant}} tunneling <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a proposed}} semiconductor device that would generate spin-polarized electron currents. The resonant tunneling <b>spin</b> <b>pump</b> {{would be a}} purely electrical device {{in the sense that}} it would not contain any magnetic material and would not rely on an applied magnetic field. Also, unlike prior sources of spin-polarized electron currents, the proposed device would not depend on a source of circularly polarized light. The proposed semiconductor electron-spin filters would exploit the Rashba effect, which can induce energy splitting in what would otherwise be degenerate quantum states, caused by a spin-orbit interaction in conjunction with a structural-inversion asymmetry in the presence of interfacial electric fields in a semiconductor heterostructure. The magnitude of the energy split is proportional to the electron wave number. Theoretical studies have suggested the possibility of devices in which electron energy states would be split by the Rashba effect and spin-polarized currents would be extracted by resonant quantum-mechanical tunneling...|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate spin-orbit torques and <b>spin</b> <b>pumping</b> in NiFe/Pt bilayers {{with direct}} and interrupted interfaces. The damping-like and field-like torques are simultaneously measured with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance tuned by a dc bias current, whereas <b>spin</b> <b>pumping</b> is measured electrically through the inverse spin Hall effect using a microwave cavity. Insertion of an atomically thin Cu dusting layer at the interface reduces the damping-like torque, field-like torque, and <b>spin</b> <b>pumping</b> by {{nearly the same}} factor of ~ 1. 4. This finding confirms that the observed spin-orbit torques predominantly arise from diffusive transport of spin current generated by the spin Hall effect.

However, phenomenologically including dephasing modifies this picture as both Shot noise and more so the third moment are non-trivially affected. In fact non-local spin correlations are completely positive for maximal dephasing. Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 0808. 363...|$|E
