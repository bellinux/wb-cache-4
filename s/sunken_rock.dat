25|$|On 21 October 1796 Vanneau was wrecked at Porto-Ferrajo, Elba. She was sailing {{out of the}} harbour on {{a secret}} mission when she twice missed her stays. When the anchors she put out did not hold she was swept onto on a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deux Amis wrecked on 23–4 May 1799 on {{the back}} of the Isle of Wight; her {{passengers}} and crew were saved. She was sailing from Jersey to Portsmouth when on the night of the 23rd she struck a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> at Grange Chine. She had as passengers Lieutenants d'Auvergne and Lemprière, and Matthew Gosset, Viscount of Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 1812 Belette, under Sloane, {{was in the}} Kattegat leading Russian ships {{through the}} {{south-west}} passage of Anholt towards Gothenburg when she went aground on a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> called [...] "John" [...] (or [...] "Fannot") off Læsø. She filled with water and broke in two. The shoals werre shallow enough that her rigging remained above water. Her crew took to the rigging but during the night many died of exposure or fell into the sea when they lost their grip. Only six of her entire crew of 120 or so men and boys escaped death from exposure or drowning.|$|E

60|$|Again {{he looked}} where {{the waste of}} sea {{churning}} amongst the <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks</b> had been. He could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of great waves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing could he see. He was alone on the wild sea; in the dark.|$|R
60|$|Big Waller and Gibault darted away. Poor Bertram, having recovered, {{remained}} gazing in speechless agony at March, who, {{having made}} several fruitless efforts to seize {{hold of the}} <b>sunken</b> <b>rock,</b> was evidently growing weaker. Bounce also remained to gaze, {{as if he had}} lost all his wonted self-command.|$|E
60|$|But it was {{fated to}} be otherwise: some days {{afterwards}} {{the ship and}} fish passed over a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> which almost grazed the keel. Then the two parted company, with mutual expressions of tender regard, and a report which could be traced by those on board to no trustworthy source.|$|E

50|$|The Big/Great Roussel, Big Russel or Grand Ruau is {{the channel}} running between Herm on the west, and Brecqhou, and Sark on the east, in the Channel Islands.

60|$|As {{they spoke}} thus, they {{approached}} the little cove, which, concealed behind crags, and defended on every point by shallows and <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> could scarce be discovered or approached, except by those intimate with the navigation. An old shattered boat was already drawn {{up on the beach}} within the cove, close beneath the trees, and with precautions for concealment.|$|R
60|$|On the bridge, they {{paused and}} {{looked up and down}} the rapids rushing down the slope in all their wild variety, with the white crests of {{breaking}} surf, the dark massiveness of heavy-climbing waves, the fleet, smooth sweep of currents over broad shelves of <b>sunken</b> <b>rock,</b> the dizzy swirl and suck of whirlpools.|$|E
60|$|The {{remaining}} passengers seeing this, rushed {{upon the}} poop. At {{that moment the}} ship was lifted up, and hurled with such violence on a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> that her back was broken; the sea dashed against her side, separating the poop from the fore part of the vessel, and turning it completely over, so that every soul on board was plunged suddenly into the sea.|$|E
60|$|The damage {{sustained}} by the Red Eric during the storm {{was found to be}} more severe than was at first supposed. Part of her false keel had been torn away by a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock,</b> over which the vessel had passed, and scraped so lightly that no one on board was aware of the fact, yet with sufficient force to cause the damage to which we have referred. A slight leak was also discovered, and the injury {{to the top of the}} foremast was neither so easily nor so quickly repaired as had been anticipated.|$|E
6000|$|God {{seemed to}} have heard her prayer. Nay, more! He had mercifully allowed her to be the means of averting great danger.

And now [...] .|$|R

5000|$|The Watchkeeper (...) {{is a low}} rock fringed on {{the north}} side by <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> lying [...] north of Table Island in the South Shetland Islands.

It was charted by DI personnel on the Discovery II in 1935.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a nervous}} instant when the Dawn's bow first entered the narrow passage. The width, from rock to rock, {{speaking}} only of visible things, {{might have been}} thirty fathoms; and this strait narrowed, rather than widened, for several hundred feet, until it was reduced fully one-third. The tide ran like a mill-tail, and it was, perhaps, lucky for us {{that there was no}} time for reflection or irresolution; the aspect of things being so serious as might well have thrown the most decided man into uncertainty and doubt. The current sucked the vessel in, like the Maelstrom, and we were whirling ahead at a rate that would have split the ship from her keel to her top-timbers, had we come upon a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock.</b> The chances were about even; for I regarded the pilotage as a very random sort of an affair. We glanced on in breathless expectation, therefore; not knowing but each instant would involve us in ruin.|$|E
60|$|Just as we {{were about}} to leave the rock the wind shifted to the S.W., and, from a fresh gale, it became what seamen term a hard gale, or such as would have {{required}} the fisherman to take in two or three reefs in his sail. It is a curious fact that the respective tides of ebb and flood are apparent upon the shore {{about an hour and a}} half sooner than at the distance of three or four miles in the offing. But what seems chiefly interesting here is that the tides around this small <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> should follow exactly the same laws as on the extensive shores of the mainland. When the boats left the Bell Rock to-day it was overflowed by the flood-tide, but the floating light did not swing round to the flood-tide for more than an hour afterwards. Under this disadvantage the boats had to struggle with the ebb-tide and a hard gale of wind, so that it was with the greatest difficulty that they reached the floating light. Had this gale happened in spring-tides when the current was strong we must have been driven to sea in a very helpless condition.|$|E
60|$|Mowgli tucked {{his left}} arm round Kaa's neck, dropped his right close to his body, and {{straightened}} his feet. Then Kaa breasted the current as he alone could, and the ripple of the checked water stood up in a frill round Mowgli's neck, and his feet were waved to and fro in the eddy under the python's lashing sides. A mile or two above the Peace Rock the Waingunga narrows between a gorge of marble rocks from eighty to a hundred feet high, and the current runs like a mill-race between and over all manner of ugly stones. But Mowgli did not trouble his head about the water; little water {{in the world could}} have given him a moment's fear. He was looking at the gorge on either side and sniffing uneasily, for there was a sweetish-sourish smell in the air, very like the smell of a big ant-hill on a hot day. Instinctively he lowered himself in the water, only raising his head to breathe from time to time, and Kaa came to anchor with a double twist of his tail round a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock,</b> holding Mowgli in the hollow of a coil, while the water raced on.|$|E
60|$|Built upon {{a dismal}} reef of <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> some league {{or so from}} shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base, and storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.|$|R
60|$|But, as we said, this is {{a glorious}} July evening,--and you may discern two figures picking their way over those low <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> yellowed with seaweed, of which we have often spoken. They are Moses and Sally going on an evening walk to that {{favorite}} grotto retreat, which has so often been spoken of {{in the course of}} this history.|$|R
5000|$|Simpson Rocks (...) {{is a group}} {{consisting}} of a rock, 10 m high, surrounded by <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> lying 5 nautical miles (9 km) northeast of Cape Melville, King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands. The name [...] "Simpsons Islands" [...] appears on a chart of 1825 by British sealer James Weddell, but the term [...] "rocks" [...] is considered more descriptive than [...] "islands".|$|R
60|$|The little ship, {{the object}} of the children's delighted attention, had stuck among some tufts of the plant which bears the water-lily, that marked a shoal in the lake about an arrow-flight from the shore. A hardy little boy, who had taken the lead in the race round the margin of the lake, did not {{hesitate}} a moment to strip off his wylie-coat, plunge into the water, and swim towards {{the object of}} their common solicitude. The first movement of the Lady was to call for help; but she observed that the boy swam strongly and fearlessly, and as she saw that one or two villagers, who were distant spectators of the incident, seemed to give themselves no uneasiness on his account, she supposed that he was accustomed to the exercise, {{and that there was no}} danger. But whether, in swimming, the boy had struck his breast against a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock,</b> or whether he was suddenly taken with cramp, or whether he had over-calculated his own strength, it so happened, that when he had disembarrassed the little plaything from the flags in which it was entangled, and sent it forward on its course, he had scarce swam a few yards in his way to the shore, than he raised himself suddenly from the water, and screamed aloud, clapping his hands at the same time with an expression of fear and pain.|$|E
60|$|In this perilous predicament, indeed, {{he found}} himself placed between hope and despair--but {{certainly}} the latter was by much the most predominant feeling of his mind--situate upon a <b>sunken</b> <b>rock</b> {{in the middle of}} the ocean, which, in the progress of the flood-tide, was to be laid under water to the depth of at least twelve feet in a stormy sea. There were this morning thirty-two persons in all upon the rock, with only two boats, whose complement, even in good weather, did not exceed twenty-four sitters; but to row to the floating light with so much wind, and in so heavy a sea, a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as could, with propriety, be attempted, so that, in this way, about one-half of our number was unprovided for. Under these circumstances, had the writer ventured to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the Smeaton sooner up towards the rock, or in hopes of getting her boat brought to our assistance, this must have given an immediate alarm to the artificers, each of whom would have insisted upon taking to his own boat, and leaving the eight artificers belonging to the Smeaton to their chance. Of course a scuffle might have ensued, and it is hard to say, in the ardour of men contending for life, where it might have ended. It has even been hinted to the writer that a party of the pickmen were determined to keep exclusively to their own boat against all hazards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen Spike is {{a capital}} willian!" [...] exclaimed Jack, smelling at a ladle filled with his soup--"a capital willian, I call him. To think, at his time of life, {{of such a}} {{handsome}} and pleasant young thing as this Rose Budd; and then {{to try to get}} her by underhand means, and by making a fool of her silly old aunt. It 's wonderful what fools some old aunts be! Quite wonderful! If I was as great a simpleton as this Mrs. Budd, I'd never cross my threshhold. Yes, Stephen Spike is a prodigious willian, as his best friend must own! Well, I gave him a thump on the head that he'll not forget this v'y'ge. To think of carryin' off that pretty Rose Budd in his very arms, in so indecent a manner! Yet, the man has his good p'ints, if a body could only forget his bad ones. He's a first-rate seaman. How he worked the brig till he doubled the reef, a'ter she got into open water; and how he made her walk off afore the wind, with stun'sails alow and aloft, as soon as ever he could make 'em draw! My life for it, he 'll tire the legs of Uncle Sam's man, afore he can fetch up with him. For running away, when hard chased, Stephen Spike has n't his equal on 'arth. But, he's a great willian--a prodigious willian! I cannot say I actually wish him hanged; but I would rather have him hanged than see him get pretty Rose in his power. What has he to do with girls of nineteen? If the rascal is one year old, he's fifty-six. I hope the sloop-of-war will find her match, and I think she will. The Molly's a great traveller, and not to be outdone easily. 'T would be a thousand pities so lovely a craft should be cut off in the flower of her days, as it might be, and I do hope she'll lead that bloody sloop on some <b>sunken</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{a dreary}} morning. The great wind had passed; now it only blew in little gusts heavy with driving rain. The sea was sullen and grey and grand. It beat in thunder {{on the shore}} and flew over the <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks</b> in columns of leaden spray. The whole earth seemed one desolation, and all its grief was centred in this woman's broken heart.|$|R
60|$|It was true. The <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks</b> {{on which}} the vessel lay wrecked had burst their way through her lower timbers astern, and the water had welled up through the rifted wood.

What the cabin had been in the time of the fathers, that the cabin was now in the time of the sons.|$|R
60|$|He {{lay there}} musing and dreaming till the sun grew {{low in the}} {{afternoon}} sky, and the tide that isolated the little grotto had gone far out into the ocean, leaving long, low reefs of <b>sunken</b> <b>rocks,</b> all matted and tangled with the yellow hair of the seaweed, with little crystal pools of salt water between. He {{heard the sound of}} approaching footsteps, and Captain Kittridge came slowly picking his way round among the shingle and pebbles.|$|R
