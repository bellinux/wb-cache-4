5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (<b>social</b> <b>actors).</b> Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E

25|$|The work of Raymond Williams {{and other}} members of the Birmingham Center for British Cultural Studies would further extend the notion of {{mediation}} in cultural materialism. For Williams, this notion should connote a <b>social</b> <b>actor’s</b> position in relation to co-determining aspects of a social formation, or a multitude of pressures and limits that are always changing and being changed by the <b>social</b> <b>actor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Under this guise, {{mediation}} {{becomes a}} process of lived reality whereas <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> {{are not so much}} duped by ruling ideas as incredibly involved with the understanding and circulation of those ideas through their own expressions of individual will. This is a much more dynamic process of mediation than previous versions, but one heavily dependent on a more in-depth theorization of Gramsci’s notion of hegemony.|$|E
25|$|One of Dourish's most {{recognized}} contributions {{has been}} bringing sociological and phenomenological understandings {{of human activity}} {{to the design of}} technological systems. For example, his work on spatiality in virtual worlds and computer mediated communication has emphasized how people—in interaction with systems and with one another—evolve new understandings of space, media, and relationships. He also drew on Schutzian phenomenology to argue that tangible computing and social computing share an underlying emphasis on people as embodied, <b>social</b> <b>actors.</b> Emphasizing people as social and embodied points to the importance of how individuals are constituted through their interactions and movements in space with other people. This model is counterposed to models of the person in Human-Computer Interaction that focus exclusively on people's cognitive capabilities.|$|E
25|$|For Bourdieu, {{the social}} world has {{gradually}} divided into what he calls fields. For him, the differentiation of social activities led to the constitution of various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular species of capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} provide {{insights}} into the process of applying Lamb & Kling's user as <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> model as an institutional lens to analyse data and to generate findings of IS practice. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides an example from a recently published research project why the <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> model was chosen, and an application of how the model was operationalised in data collection and analysis. Findings - The paper provides two illustrations of theorising the <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> model at different levels: at an elementary level by using instantiation to map the model's constructs to a match in the transcript text; and {{at a higher level}} where the model enabled the paper to tie together a number of individual phenomena to construct a broader higher-level schema. Originality/value - As the <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> model is relatively new, and few guidelines or examples exist, the paper provides rich {{insights into the}} difficulties with the application of this model and a solution for coping with these so that other researchers can read of an example that may be similar to their own and therefore guide their work.

25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn {{due to the}} ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products are determined by various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by <b>social</b> <b>actors,</b> or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media {{is the key to}} the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{mediation}} in Marxism is {{also referred to}} as the problem of determination, or namely how <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker’s body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction that becomes a commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The only thing the worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker’s sole means of subsistence. The worker must get as much value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive.|$|E
500|$|Znaniecki {{coined the}} term [...] "humanistic coefficient" [...] for a method of social {{research}} by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only {{if they can be}} objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} aims to improve the {{reflexivity}} of the researchers in designing social studies, asking them two essential questions: what kind of relationship develops between the researcher and the <b>social</b> <b>actor?</b> And what kind of ethical impact has the participation required from the <b>social</b> <b>actor?</b> To answer these questions the article opens with {{a brief overview of}} how the relationship between researcher and object of study has been analysed in epistemological and sociological studies. A particular focus is dedicated to the critical perspectives of the Sixties and Seventies. Considering in particular these, the core of the paper consists in suggesting a new research participation model based on agapic acting. The effects of this ideal type are explored by rediscovering all the practices that include a particular attention and a specific involvement of the <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> in the research process. ...|$|R

The first-generation NHIN being developed has numerous advantages and limitations. One {{of the most}} difficult aspects of today’s NHIN is ensuring privacy and confidentiality for personal health data, because family and caregivers have multiple complex legal relationships to a patient.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of {{analyzing}} data {{from a series of}} socio-technical ICT studies, we have developed a multi-dimensional concept of a <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> to guide qualitative data collection and analysis. Three information and communication technology (ICT) studies have been used to develop and refine the concept: a mid- 1990 's study of online information services use, a 4 year study of intranet development and use, and a 5 -year study of ICT use in collaborative networking among scientists in academia and industry. The <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> concept has been theoretically supported by institutionalist approaches. However, in our continuing effort to formalize it, we have found that alternative, and equally convincing, supporting theoretical explanations can be put forward using actor-network theory (ANT), as well as structuration theory. In this paper, we explain the <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> using ANT concepts and structuration theory concepts, and then contrast these with institutionalist concepts, emphasizing where ANT and structuration theory provide added value and suggest directions for further research and conceptual refinement...|$|R

[...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as <b>Social</b> <b>Actors</b> (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating {{them as if they were}} real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{media studies}} {{mediation}} {{is also used}} in the same sense as in Marxist theory: thinkers try to look at how a given medium reconciles the various forces of history, culture, economics or the material world, and how <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> use that medium to navigate these various meanings and values.

2500|$|Rather he {{uses the}} logic of {{hermeneutic}} tradition (from interpretative sociology) to argue {{for the importance of}} agency in sociological theory, claiming that human <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> are always to some degree knowledgeable about what they are doing. Social order is therefore a result of some pre-planned social actions, not automatic evolutionary response. Sociologists, unlike natural scientists, have to interpret a social world which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. According to Giddens there is a [...] "Duality of structure" [...] by which social practice, which is the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component. [...] The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but also makes it possible. He also noted the existence of a specific form of a social cycle: once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and structural conditions, they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the [...] "double hermeneutic".|$|E

The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance.

Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present {{just the right amount of}} information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre, he {{had strong}} {{political}} views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By {{the time of}} his later work his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born, from an [...] "urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate." [...] Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effects — particularly the harm — of neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study 'The Weight of the World,' although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles. 'The Weight of the World' represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists, it also shows Bourdieu's collaborative character, indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category (he deplored the term 'role') of public intellectual. Nevertheless, Bourdieu's activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage, fulfilling his [...] "constructionist view of social life" [...] as it relied upon the idea of <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very public action of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm. It is notable that in his later writings Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals, describing them as [...] "like the Trojan Horse [...] " [...] for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description 'public intellectual,' worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.|$|E
