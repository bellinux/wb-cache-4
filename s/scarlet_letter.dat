5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Letter,</b> as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E

40|$|Of the six core virtues (wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence) that Peterson and Seligman (2004) used as {{the basis}} of their seminal {{classification}} system, temperance is the virtue least portrayed in movies. And even in its rare appearances on the silver screen, the portrait of this virtue is one of perversion, as in The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Letter’s</b> self-flagellating Reverend Dimmesdale. There are a number of reasons for this. Temperance is the least glamorous virtue; its expression is a direct contrast with the fast-paced culture of consumerism, and one is hard-pressed to find a film that does not depict a character who has surrendered impulse control and engages in smoking, drinking, drugging, overeating, compulsive sex, or aggressive behavior (Niemiec & Wedding, 2008). This corresponds with data from the VIA Institute on Character that indicate that temperance is the least endorsed virtue of the six, a finding drawn from data collected from over one million people who have taken the VIA Survey, a measurement tool assessing positive character (see www. viacharacter. org). It is therefore a surprise to see an extremely popular film break this trend. The vampire drama Twilight is based on the best-selling four-part novel series by Stepheni...|$|R

60|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, June 17, {{we learned that the}} King, as Monmouth was called {{throughout}} the West, was lying less than ten miles off with his forces, and that he would make his entry into the loyal town of Taunton the next morning. Every effort was made, as ye may well guess, to give him a welcome which should be worthy of the most Whiggish and Protestant town in England. An arch of evergreens had already been built up at the western gate, bearing the motto, 'Welcome to King Monmouth!' and another spanned the entrance to the market-place from the upper window of the White Hart Inn, with 'Hail to the Protestant Chief!' in great <b>scarlet</b> <b>letters.</b> A third, if I remember right, bridged the entrance to the Castle yard, but the motto on it has escaped me. The cloth and wool industry is, as I have told you, the staple trade of the town, and the merchants had no mercy on their wares, but used them freely to beautify the streets. Rich tapestries, glossy velvets, and costly brocades fluttered from the windows or lined the balconies. East Street, High Street, and Fore Street were draped from garret to basement with rare and beautiful fabrics, while gay flags hung from the roofs on either side, or fluttered in long festoons from house to house. The royal banner of England floated from the lofty tower of St. Mary Magdalene, while the blue ensign of Monmouth waved from the sister turret of St. James. Late into the night there was planing and hammering, working and devising, until when the sun rose upon Thursday, June 18, it shone on as brave a show of bunting and evergreen as ever graced a town. Taunton had changed as by magic from a city into a flower garden.|$|R
25|$|Anderson {{incorporates}} precursor {{texts that}} parallel Melinda's experience. In the story, Melinda's English class studies Nathaniel Hawthorne's The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Letter,</b> which features similar fairy tale imagery. Hester Prynne, an outcast protagonist like Melinda, {{lives in a}} cottage {{at the edge of}} the woods. Hester's cottage parallels Melinda's closet. For both women, the seclusion of the forest represents a space beyond social demands. The deciphering of Hawthorne's symbolism mimics the process faced by readers of Melinda's narrative. Similarly, Anderson connects Melinda's trauma to that of Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Melinda places a poster of Angelou in her closet. She admires Angelou because her novel was banned by the school board. Melinda and Angelou were both outcasts. Like Melinda, Angelou was silenced following her childhood rape.|$|E
25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes.

Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together.

For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Letter</b> in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|New England has a {{rich history}} in filmmaking {{dating back to}} the dawn of the motion picture era {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, {{sometimes}} dubbed Hollywood East by film critics. A theater at 547 Washington Street in Boston was the second location to debut a picture projected by the Vitascope, and shortly thereafter several novels were being adapted for the screen and set in New England, including The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Letter</b> and The House of Seven Gables. The New England region continued to churn out films at a pace above the national average for the duration of the 20th century, including blockbuster hits such as Jaws, Good Will Hunting, and The Departed, all of which won Oscars. The New England area became known for a number of themes that recurred in films made during this era, including the development of yankee characters, smalltown life contrasted with city values, seafaring tales, family secrets, and haunted New England. These themes are rooted in centuries of New England culture and are complemented by the region's diverse natural landscape and architecture, from the Atlantic Ocean and brilliant fall foliage to church steeples and skyscrapers.|$|E

This book {{deals with}} the critically urgent need for women to create [...] "empowered" [...] spaces for themselves, meaning, women {{need to create a}} space where they are not considered the [...] "weaker sex". Scarlet Song is about a marriage between a European woman and an African man. As So Long a <b>Letter,</b> <b>Scarlet</b> Song gained international attention. Mireille, whose father is a French diplomat gets married to Ousmane, son of a poor Senegalese Muslim family. Moving back from Paris to Senegal, Ousmane once again adopts his traditions and customs. But, as an occidental, Mireille cannot handle this kind of life, especially when Ousmane takes a second wife. However, Africa is a polygamous society and in their religion it is acceptable but Mireille did not accept it. She suffers the marriage. Most notably, the book criticizes the tyranny of tradition and expounds upon the despair of cross-cultural marriages. The tyranny of tradition is clearly brought out by a romanticized portrayal whereby YayeKhady enters into Ousmane's bedroom whilst he was still asleep with his wife Mireille. Djibril Gueye failed to play his role as a father thus he was supposed to act on his son's marriage instead he was absorbed by religion and he took religion as a source of escapism. Therefore, Djibril was custrated by colonialism and he was now voiceless thus failing to play his role as a father.by taffy mushipe from St Paul′s ...|$|R
