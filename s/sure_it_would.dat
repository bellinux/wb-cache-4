5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.|$|E
25|$|A bill {{to legalize}} {{same-sex}} marriage passed the New York State Assembly {{a second time}} in 2009. Later in 2009, Sen. Thomas Duane (D-Manhattan) claimed that he had lined up support from {{a sufficient number of}} Senators to pass same-sex marriage legislation, though opponents disagreed. Senator Malcolm Smith stated he would not put the bill to a vote until he was <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> pass.|$|E
25|$|Early Medieval courts {{generally}} {{followed a}} process called accusatio, largely based on Germanic practices. In this procedure, an individual would make an accusation against someone to the court. However, if the suspect was judged innocent, the accusers faced legal penalties for bringing false charges. This provided a disincentive to make any accusation unless the accusers were <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> stand. Later, a threshold requirement was {{the establishment of the}} accused's publica fama, i.e., the fact that the person was widely believed to be guilty of the offense charged.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{with the}} characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion. Halden criticized the character's opposing {{views on the}} matter, and stated that their reasonings were invalid. Halden wrote. [...] "I'm not even <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be possible for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working {{on the assumption that}} having a child in a world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who’s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her in a very good light, so it’s not like her arguments hold much water—which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion {{is the only one that}} matters." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and stated that Rick's arguments against Lori's attempts were obsolete.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the match against Surrey, the only Test match of the Australian's tour was played, also at the Oval. In his {{obituary}} in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, {{it was suggested that}} {{were it not for the}} accusations of throwing against Crossland, he would have been selected for the match. Cricket agreed, submitting that due to Fred Morley's absence from the England team due to injury, Crossland was the obvious choice to replace him, as he was the best fast bowler in the country. Despite this, they said that his non-selection showed that his action was not deemed fair by the selection panel. The Morning Post went a step further, and claimed that as Crossland had demonstrated he was England's best fast bowler, he should be selected to play in the Test match if his action was deemed fair, but that if it was not considered fair, he should not be allowed to continue to play for Lancashire either. An article written for The Argus, an Australian daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; [...] "with a delivery so like a throw that I feel <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be allowed in Australia; but, as we all know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more's the pity", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.|$|E
2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't {{think there would be}} any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1929, just a {{year after}} the {{purchase}} of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River. The Seneca people of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight’s Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam, and he proposed that Good Face, William Spotted Tail, John Sitting Bull and Flying Hawk, with their families, be invited to live in Cook Forest. McCreight explained his proposal to the U.S. Indian Field Service of the Department of the Interior in Wood, South Dakota: [...] “I wish you would see Good Face and talk with him about the Cook Forest Park. [...] It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> more than pay too. [...] The Clarion River runs through the property, and he could have his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists. [...] It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.” ...|$|E
