5|$|Fish {{typically}} have quite small brains relative to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, <b>some</b> <b>fish</b> have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E

5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, <b>some</b> <b>fish,</b> including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In <b>some</b> <b>fish,</b> capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. <b>Some</b> <b>fish,</b> like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{vibrations}} reveal {{that there is a}} floundering insect within range, <b>some</b> <b>fishing</b> spiders may take direct action - they run at pace {{across the surface of the}} water and grab the insect before it extracts itself from the water and flies to safety. <b>Some</b> <b>fishing</b> spiders use silk draglines to prevent themselves from speeding past the prey.|$|R

5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. <b>Some</b> <b>fish</b> have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the heart}} varies among the {{different}} animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging {{from those of the}} smallest mice (12mg) to the blue whale (600kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies {{in the middle of the}} ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. which in <b>some</b> <b>fish</b> may be connected to the peritoneum.|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and <b>some</b> <b>fish</b> feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E

5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch <b>some</b> <b>fish</b> and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares <b>some</b> <b>fish</b> with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. <b>Some</b> <b>fish</b> can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. <b>Some</b> <b>fish,</b> such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E

5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. <b>Some</b> <b>fish</b> have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. <b>Some</b> <b>fish</b> see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. <b>Some</b> <b>fish</b> had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and <b>some</b> <b>fish,</b> birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E
