25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given <b>subsequent</b> <b>information</b> to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.|$|E

5000|$|To {{save the}} {{prediction}} graph over flash memory with overheads (SRAM capacity) minimized, the <b>subsequent</b> LBA <b>information</b> of each regular node is saved at the spare {{area of the}} corresponding page. It is because that the spare area of a page in current implementations has unused space, and the reading of a page usually comes with the reading of its data and spare areas simultaneously. In such a way, the accessing of the <b>subsequent</b> LBA <b>information</b> of a regular node comes with no extra cost. Since a branch node {{has more than one}} subsequent LBA’s, the spare area of the corresponding page might not have enough free space to store the information. Thus, a branch table is maintained to save the <b>subsequent</b> LBA <b>information</b> of all branch nodes. The starting entry address of the branch table that corresponds to a branch node can be saved at the spare area of the corresponding page. The starting entry records the number of subsequent LBA’s of the branch node, and the subsequent LBA’s are stored in the entries following the starting entry. The branch table can be saved on flash memory. During the run time, the entire table can be loaded into SRAM for better performance. If there is not enough SRAM space, parts of the table can be loaded in an [...] fashion.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the role of}} affective priming during the {{processing}} of news articles. It is assumed that the valence of the affective response to a news article will influence the processing of subsequent news articles. More specifically, it is hypothesized that participants who read a positive article will recall <b>subsequent</b> positive <b>information</b> better than negative information. Similarly, participants who read a negative article will recall <b>subsequent</b> negative <b>information</b> better. To test this assumption, an experimental study was conducted (N = 87). Findings show that participants who read an initial positive article recalled more positive than negative <b>information</b> from six <b>subsequent</b> news articles. Participants who read an initial negative article recalled more negative information than positive <b>information</b> from <b>subsequent</b> news messages. Findings suggest that affective states induced by a news article influence how subsequent articles are processed and which information is learned...|$|R

6000|$|With the {{exception}} of occasional scares, there was no further excitement till Sunday the 27th February, when, whilst sitting on the verandah after lunch, I thought I {{heard the sound of}} distant artillery. Others present differed with me, thinking the sound was caused by thunder, but as I adhered to my opinion, we determined to ride into town and see. On arrival there, we found the place full of rumours, from which we gathered that some fresh disaster had occurred: and that messages were pouring down the wires from Mount Prospect camp. We then went on to camp, thinking that we should learn more there, but they knew nothing about it, several officers asking us what new [...] "shave" [...] we had got hold of. A considerable number of troops had been marched from Newcastle that morning to go to Mount Prospect, but when it was realised that something had occurred, they were stopped, and marched back again. Bit by bit we managed to gather the truth. At first we heard that our men had made a most gallant resistance on the hill, mowing down the advancing enemy by hundreds, till at last, their ammunition failing, they fought with their bayonets, using stones and meat tins as missiles. I wish that our <b>subsequent</b> <b>information</b> had been to the same effect.|$|E
60|$|In {{submitting}} {{to the public}} in a collected form the Letters which have already appeared in the daily press, a Special Correspondent has the option of one of two courses. The one course is, to publish the Letters as nearly as possible as they originally stood, as a journal written from day to day, and from week to week; the other, to recast the whole, to rewrite the Letters, and to give a continuous narrative of the expedition as of a past event. The second of these courses has the advantage of unity of purpose; it will contain fewer errors, fewer mistaken predictions of the probable course of events, and, above all, less of the repetitions which must unavoidably occur in a series of letters. The style, too, will naturally be far smoother and more polished than in the original letters, written as they usually were in haste and under circumstances of great difficulty. But, on the other hand, such a narrative would lose much of the freshness which original letters possess, and it would be deficient in that interest which a knowledge of the hopes and fears, the doubts and anticipations, the plans destined to be frustrated, and the opinions constantly varying with the course of events, must give to a narrative. The present tense too is far more pleasant and less monotonous than the preterite. I have therefore determined, in submitting my Letters for republication, to adhere as closely as possible to the original form and matter; not hesitating, however, to make many additions, alterations, and excisions, where <b>subsequent</b> <b>information</b> or the course of events have proved my opinions or conclusions to have been erroneous.|$|E

50|$|Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) {{proposed}} the belief-adjustment model {{to try to}} predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based {{on the type of}} mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and <b>subsequent</b> pieces of <b>information</b> are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than <b>subsequent</b> pieces of <b>information,</b> leading to a primacy effect.|$|R
