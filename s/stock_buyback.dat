One of the stores is located at Madison Square Garden, where Horton played {{as a member of}} the New York Rangers from 1969 to 1971. In 2009, Tim Hortons opened its first store in Albany, NY, with more stores on the way. Tim Hortons continued its southward expansion in the US by opening a restaurant at Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-December 2009. In November 2010, Tim Hortons announced it was closing 36 stores in the northeastern United States due to high competition with New England-based Dunkin' Donuts and Au Bon Pain. The stores, which made less than half the average company per-store sales, were concentrated heavily in the Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, areas, the former of which also has a concentration of stores from the locally-competing Honey Dew Donuts chain, itself with some 150 outlets in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. In the announcement, the chain stated that it will concentrate its efforts on its core markets such as western Canada. In the same statement, the company announced the sale of its portion of distribution company Maidstone Bakeries to Tim Hortons' European partners. It will use the C$400million generated by the sale for a <b>stock</b> <b>buyback.</b>|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{negative}} influence on public opinion {{caused by the}} 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms. A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs. Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with <b>stock</b> <b>buybacks</b> in a manner contrary to shareholder interests. These authors argued that, in part, corporate <b>stock</b> <b>buybacks</b> for U.S. Standard & Poors 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because {{of the effect of}} options.

2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a <b>stock</b> <b>buyback,</b> in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E

50|$|Another way of {{describing}} {{the supply of}} shares in the market is {{to call it the}} U.S. equity float. The change in supply is a change in the float.

A declining labor movement, increasing executive pay relative to the average worker, financialization of the economy, and increasing diversion of corporate profits to <b>stock</b> <b>buybacks</b> and dividends are some of the contributing factors to this wage stagnation.

40|$|We use {{new data}} from SEC filings to {{investigate}} how S&P 500 firms execute their open market repurchase programs.

Their repurchase activity is followed by a positive and significant abnormal return which lasts up to three months after the repurchase. These findings do not hold for large S&P 500 firms. Our interpretation is that small firms repurchase strategically, whereas the repurchase activity of large firms is more focused on the disbursement of free cash.

50|$|Writing in the Harvard Business Review in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record {{corporate}} <b>stock</b> <b>buybacks</b> for reduced {{investment in}} the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality. Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock. An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor. He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets (EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases). Restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} part of 1994, Unitrin was {{targeted}} for a hostile takeover. American General Corp., an insurance carrier headquartered in Houston, sent a $2.6 billion takeover bid. On June 26, Unitrin rejected the $50.38 per share offer and adopted a poison pill defense by initiating a <b>stock</b> <b>buyback</b> plan of ten million shares or 19% of its stock. American General then took Unitrin to court. A Delaware Chancery Court judge agreed and issued a restraining order against Unitrin's proposed <b>stock</b> <b>buyback</b> until September 27, 1994. Unitrin continued to resist the merger offer, and, on December 13, 1994, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned the lower court's injunction, allowing Unitrin to continue buying back its stock. (For details see Unitrin, Inc. v. American General Corp.) As 1994 ended, Unitrin's total revenues rose slightly to $1.37 billion, just over the previous year's $1.36 billion. However, Unitrin's net income rose from $95 million in 1993 to a shocking $148 million for 1994 fiscal year. As Unitrin entered its fifth year as an independent company, it continued buying back its stock to keep American General and, possibly, other suitors at bay. By the end of 1995, Unitrin had bought back 13.5 million shares at a cost of $661 million. Unitrin's poison pill defense worked: American General's takeover bid expired on February 7, 1995 and was not renewed.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{in the name}} of maximizing {{shareholder}} value, this financialized behavior, manifested by enormous <b>stock</b> <b>buybacks</b> and outsized executive pay, has become endemic to the U.S. economy. In an article, “Innovative Business Models and Varieties of Capitalism: Financialization of the U.S. Corporation,” that compares the United States and Japan, Lazonick shows how the persistence in the 1990s and 2000s of the Japanese institutions of stable shareholding, permanent employment, and main-bank lending, even in diminished form, imparted employment stability and income equity to the Japanese economy. [...] Although, in the United States, the New Economy business model has enabled rapid product development based on the technologies of the Internet revolution, Lazonick argues that financialization of the New Economy business model has undermined the innovative capability of U.S. industrial enterprises while contributing to employment instability and income inequity in the U.S. economy.|$|R
