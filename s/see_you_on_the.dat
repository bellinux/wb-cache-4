6000|$|Bertha {{threw the}} rug over Mart's knees {{before turning to}} offer her hand. [...] "I'm glad to meet you," [...] she responded, with gravity. [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street." ...|$|R
500|$|Korn held a {{press conference}} at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on January 13, 2006, announcing the <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Other Side Tour. 10 Years and Mudvayne were {{selected}} to open all dates of the trek, which kicked off in their hometown of Bakersfield, on what Mayor Harvey Hall officially declared as [...] "Korn Day", February 24.

500|$|While {{promoting}} <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Other Side in Europe, Jonathan Davis {{was diagnosed}} with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood platelet disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival. Despite the illness, the band still performed, with guest singers including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour fame, Trivium's Matt Heafy, Skindred's Benji Webbe and Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling {{the rest of their}} European bill for 2006, including the Hellfest Summer Open Air. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was [...] "dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated".|$|E
2500|$|The band Trailer Choir's song [...] "What Would You Say" [...] is a {{song about}} the Sago Mine Disaster. The {{following}} words appear in the song: [...] "13 men felt trapped in a mine in West Virginia,/only one made it out alive/but their love lives on in the words/I can not wait to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, lieutenant," [...] Captain O'Connor said. [...] "I {{think we}} have got them fairly trapped; but doubtless they would have made off if they hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch outside. It's that notorious scoundrel the Red Captain of Galway who is, I hear, hiding here with his gang." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mistake my purpose, I see, ma'am,' replied Mr Nickleby, in {{his usual}} blunt fashion. 'I have no money to throw away on miniatures, ma'am, and nobody to give one to (thank God) if I had. <b>Seeing</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs, I wanted to ask a {{question}} of you, about some lodgers here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dost thou hear that, John?" [...] exclaimed Richard. [...] "Ladders, man--get ladders, {{and to the}} wall. How I should {{delight to}} <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest round--thy knees shaking--thy hands {{grasping}} convulsively, like those of one in an ague fit--all air around thee, save a baton or two of wood--the moat below--half-a-dozen pikes at thy throat--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Soulfly {{moved away}} from the nu metal style and moved to styles such as death metal and thrash metal. Kittie {{abandoned}} the [...] style and started making music with elements of genres such as black metal and death metal. Korn and Mudvayne maintained their popularity during the mid-2000s, although they did not completely abandon the nu metal style. [...] Korn combined their earlier sound with influences from other genres, such as industrial. Korn's songs [...] "Coming Undone" [...] and [...] "Twisted Transistor", which both are on their 2005 album <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Other Side, reached the Billboard Hot 100; Pop music producers The Matrix helped produce the album. Mudvayne's 2005 album Lost and Found was seen as gravitating towards a more accessible sound. The album's song [...] "Happy?" [...] peaked at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 91 on Billboard Pop 100 chart. In 2005, Limp Bizkit released a record called The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) without promoting and advertising the record. The album was not very popular; its sales fell 67% during its second week of release. In 2006, Limp Bizkit went on hiatus.|$|E
2500|$|On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Schroeder was a 25-year-old {{captain in}} command of the 219men of Company F of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely put his arm around Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in your boat when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft. Before departing the Barnett to face the enemy, Schroeder wrote a letter to his wife: [...] "I told her where I was, what I was about to do, and how much I loved her".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Crewe lit a cigar, {{but he did}} {{not offer}} one to Austen, as he had to Mr. Tooting. [...] "I wanted to <b>see</b> what <b>you</b> were like," [...] he continued, with {{refreshing}} frankness. [...] "Of course, I'd <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. But <b>you</b> can get more of an idea of a man by talkin' to him, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While you {{are thus}} apologising for a venial offence, you forget {{it is to}} a man guilty of the same error. I knew your person, from having <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continent; and finding you {{disposed}} to go by the homely name of Sharp, {{in a moment of}} thoughtlessness, I took its counterpart, Blunt. A travelling name is sometimes convenient, though sooner or later I fancy all deceptions bring with them their own punishments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll excuse my {{coming here}} so abruptly," [...] she smiled, [...] "but I {{wanted to get}} before Mr. Leyton, who, I believe, wishes to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same {{business}} as myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! to the niece of that {{malignant}} {{enemy of}} mine, Alexander of Lorne?" [...] the king said laughing. [...] "Her friends would rather <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gibbet {{than at the}} altar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, your honour! There will trouble come of {{it unless}} you come up. He swears {{that he will not}} bear to be put off, and that he must <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{pretended to}} Martin that I was quite {{serious about the}} clothes, the {{garments}} I mean. I dolled myself all up last night and went swelling into my hangar and anxiously asked Martin if he didn't like the get-up, and he nearly threw a fit. [...] "Good Lord," [...] he groans, [...] "you look like an aviator on a Ladies Home Journal cover, guaranteed not to curse, swear or chaw tobacco.

6000|$|... 'Have you {{not tried}} it?' {{returned}} the other. 'Two {{or three years}} ago, did I not <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform of revival meetings, and was not your voice the loudest in the hymn?' ...|$|E

5000|$|The British {{journalist}} Malcolm Muggeridge {{may have}} been the first to use the actual phrase in the introduction to his book Muggeridge Through The Microphone (1967) in which he wrote; [...] "In the past if someone was famous or notorious, it was for something—as a writer or an actor or a criminal; for some talent or distinction or abomination.

5000|$|Darren Huckerby criticised Megson's {{coaching}} style, when {{explaining why}} he chose to sign for Norwich City, instead of Megson's West Bromwich Albion.
