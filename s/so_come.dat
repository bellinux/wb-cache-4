25|$|The limes {{was never}} able to prevent whole Germanic tribes from {{entering}} the territory of the Roman Empire. This was not the intention of the builders. Near the watch towers, the limes was open to passage, especially by traders or persons coming to live or work within the Empire, the purpose of the limes was control of this traffic. To cross the limes it was necessary to pass the towers, and <b>so</b> <b>come</b> to the notice of the garrison, or try to climb or destroy the wall and the stakes. Only individuals or small groups could climb the obstacles without being noticed, and they could not drive much stolen livestock with them. Large groups would be noticed, they could destroy one or several towers, but this also would come {{to the attention of the}} Romans. This knowledge of all traffic crossing the border was crucial to the Roman military. For a territory as large as the Roman Empire, there were amazingly few soldiers, almost all of the legions were based close to the frontiers, any hostile band that managed to pass this outer area of defense could travel within the Empire without much resistance. The purpose of the limes was as an early warning system, deterrence of casual small-scale raiding, and the ability to counteract while the enemy was still near the border fortresses and garrisons. Other researchers believe the limes may have been a bulwark to prevent illegal immigration, comparing it to the fence system along the American-Mexican border.|$|E

This time the bridge leads, not into another verse, but the song's middle 8 which again sees Rhys backed by multiple falsetto harmony backing vocals.

500|$|In [...] "Your Body", Aguilera sings {{of having}} a one-night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she [...] "angrily" [...] purrs, [...] "So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked". Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ <b>So</b> <b>come</b> on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|Gilles Grimandi, Dixon and Overmars {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's victory at Leicester City in early December. Matthew Upson {{was forced to}} come off the pitch before the half-hour mark, after {{suffering}} a knee injury. Arsenal only managed a draw against Wimbledon on 18 December 1999; Henry's second half goal cancelled out Wimbledon's opener – a cross by Marcus Gayle met Carl Cort, whose shot hit goalkeeper Alex Manninger's left leg and went in. The poor form over Christmas continued: Arsenal lost 3–2 to Coventry City on Boxing Day. Rob Hughes of The Times noted his concerns about Arsenal's defence, which: [...] "...conceded 17 goals last season but now, at the halfway stage, [...] have already let in 20", but did go on to add [...] "there was nothing lacking in the tenacity of Arsenal." [...] Vieira made his return for the match against league leaders Leeds United, who were eight points in front of Arsenal. Wenger reshuffled the defence, dropping Dixon and Winterburn for Luzhny and Sylvinho, while Grimandi replaced Keown who was injured. Ljungberg and Henry scored for Arsenal in their 2–0 win to put the team third at the end of 1999. Adams suggested after the Leeds match that his opponents' inexperience and thin squad would jeopardise their chances of winning the league: [...] "They are still involved in the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup as well. <b>So</b> <b>come</b> February time they will start to feel that pressure – and you don't know what it is like until you have been through it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, <b>so</b> <b>come</b> to your senses people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E

The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going {{for a minute or}} so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, <b>so</b> <b>come</b> on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E

The American people {{do not like the}} Jews nor do the Europeans, because the Jews by their very nature do not like anyone else.

"The Mount of Olives" [...] is {{the central}} {{eminence}} {{of a line of}} hills, of rather more than a mile in length, overhanging the city, from which it is separated only by the narrow bed of the valley of the brook Cedron.
