30|$|The {{ambiguity}} of author names {{is a major}} barrier {{to the analysis of}} large scientific publication databases on the level of individual researchers [1], [2]. Within such databases researchers generally appear only as they appear on any given publication i.e. by their <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> initials. Frequently, however, hundreds or even thousands of individual researchers happen to share the same <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> initials. Author name disambiguation is therefore an important prerequisite for the author level analyses of publication data. While many important and interesting problems can be examined without individual level data [3], [4] a great many other require such data to get to the real heart of the matter. Good examples include the role of gender in academic career success [5], whether ideas diffuse through the popularity of individual publications or the reputation of the authors [6], [7], how the specific competencies and experience of the individual authors recombine to search the space of potential innovations [8], [9], and whether one can predict scientific carriers [10]–[14]. Indeed, the importance of getting individual level data has been widely acknowledged, {{as can be seen in}} recent large scale initiatives to create disambiguated researcher databases [15], [16].|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (1) cal-culate age-specific and age-adjusted cause-specific mor-tality rates for Arab Americans; and (2) compare these rates with those for blacks and whites. Mortality rates were estimated using Michigan death certificate data, an Arab <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> list, <b>and</b> 2000 U. S. Census data. Age-specific rates, age-adjusted all-cause and cause-spe-cific rates were calculated. Arab Americans (75 ?) had higher mortality rates than whites and blacks. Among men, all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for Arab Americans were in the range of whites and blacks. How-ever, Arab American men had lower mortality rates from cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease compared to both whites and blacks. Among women, Arab Americans had lower mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes than whites and blacks. Arab Americans are growing in number. Future study should focus on designing rigorous separate analyses for this population...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tenets of academic writing is the avoidance of plagiarism. A Bibliography contains all sources consulted, including those providing background reading; a list of References comprises only sources cited in the text. Even if you have paraphrased (that is, put the author’s words into your own words) or summarised information, the author or authors should be acknowledged in a textual reference, and, of course, in the Bibliography/References. The Bibliography/References is the backbone of research writing, and should be compiled correctly and consistently, according to established academic and bibliographic stylistic conventions. The Cape Peninsula University of Technology uses the Harvard style of bibliographic citation. The following are some common errors encountered in bibliographic citation and compilation. Textual references without corresponding items in the bibliography Textual references without accompanying page numbers (or incorrectly cited page numbers) Bibliography not in alphabetical order Incorrect spelling of authors, titles, publishers Transposing author’s <b>surname</b> <b>and</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> Vagueness about the use of et al. for three or more authors No indication of editor/s No indication of edition, if not first Omission of subtitles of books, journal titles and journal articles Incorrect date of publication (impression rather than edition date) Inconsistent use of sentence case and title case in titles of books, titles of journal articles and titles of journals Confusion in respect of italicisation of titles of books and titles of journals (titles of journal articles incorrectly placed in italics) Underlining instead of italicising titles Insufficient details given for newspaper articles (author, date, title of article, page, column) Confusion between publisher and printer Confusion about place of publication (countries, cities, US states, UK counties) Omission of page numbers of journal articles and chapters in books Incorrect corporate author (frequently no author) cited in government publications and legislatio...|$|R

Making use of experience with IraLIS (International Registry for Authors: Library and Information Science = Links to Identify Scientists; [URL] this study examines how authorities are registered in two Spanish OAI-PMH-compliant projects: Recercat and E-Prints Complutense. The authorities database of the two repositories analysed were downloaded. The style of signing - the recommended one should contain only two elements - was recorded by field of knowledge, using the topic classifi cation systems of the Intute project and the ANEP agency. The most commonly used signing style involved two surnames (76 % in Recercat and 94 % in E-Prints Complutense). The social sciences showed the greatest adoption of the recommended signing style (20 % of all records in this area). The adoption rate of the recommended signing style in both repositories was low, especially in E-Prints Complutense. The index of the use of the recommended signing style by knowledge fi eld reveals a true picture of these Open Access repositories.

Indeed, the social sciences were those which most frequently followed the recommended system. The areas of technology, health and life sciences, the arts and humanities should be the subjects of awareness campaigns.
