25|$|In 1844, {{he married}} Lydia, {{youngest}} {{daughter of the}} Rev. Henry North. In 1847, he was appointed an assistant-surgeon to the hospital, and Arris and Gale professor at the Royal College of Surgeons. He held this professorship for six years and each year gave six lectures in <b>surgical</b> <b>pathology.</b> The first edition of these lectures, which were the chief scientific work of his life, was published in 1853 as Lectures on <b>Surgical</b> <b>Pathology.</b> He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. In October 1851, he resigned the wardenship of the hospital. He had now become known as a great physiologist and pathologist; he had done for pathology in England what Rudolf Virchow had done in Germany, but he had hardly begun to get into practice, and he had kept himself poor so he might pay his share of his father's debts, a task that took him 14 years to fulfill.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{pathology}} (Commonwealth) or Anatomic pathology (U.S.) is {{a medical}} specialty that {{is concerned with the}} diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues. Over the last century, <b>surgical</b> <b>pathology</b> has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovan Battista Morgagni from Forlì.|$|E
25|$|After {{working and}} {{teaching}} in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the 1920s and 1930s, Illingworth was appointed Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow, in 1939. Over the next 25 years, he established the Glasgow School of surgery, with generations of his students influencing surgical research and teaching in Britain and abroad. His textbooks were also highly influential, including his co-authorship of Text Book of <b>Surgical</b> <b>Pathology</b> (1932). Illingworth travelled and lectured widely, and helped initiate and present a 1963 television series on postgraduate medical training. His research included early work in the 1960s on hyperbaric oxygen therapy.|$|E

25|$|His work in {{pathology}} {{was even more}} important. He filled the place {{in pathology}} left empty by Hunter's death in 1793; {{this was the time}} of transition from Hunter's teaching, which for all its greatness was hindered by want of the modern microscope, to the pathology and bacteriology of the present day. Paget's greatest achievement was that he made pathology dependent, in everything, {{on the use of the}} microscope, especially the pathology of tumours.

25|$|In 1901, Archibald was {{appointed}} {{as a staff}} member at the Royal Victoria Hospital Department of <b>Surgical</b> <b>Pathology.</b> However, soon after he entered this position, the surgeon began to develop a cough, lose weight and experience fatigue. These symptoms were confirmed to be {{as a result of}} tuberculosis by the hospital's Chief of Medicine, and Archibald moved to the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium in upstate New York to experience a change of climate. The surgeon returned to Canada upon his recovery, and in 1904 {{was appointed}} to the Royal Victoria Hospital's Department of Surgery. The same year, Archibald married Agnes Maud Black Barron. The head of that Department, a Dr. Ruddick, encouraged Archibald to develop the new practices he had learned during his time in Europe, and his work in this field has led to many dubbing him Canada's first neurosurgeon. In 1908, Archibald published Surgical Affection and Wounds of the Head, a monograph that was at the time considered to be the most comprehensive text on the subject.|$|E

[...] To be licensed to practice pathology, {{one has to}} complete medical school and secure a license to practice medicine.

2500|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{specimens}} submitted for <b>surgical</b> <b>pathology</b> analysis: biopsies and surgical resections. [...] A biopsy is {{a small piece of}} tissue removed primarily for <b>surgical</b> <b>pathology</b> analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis. Types of biopsies include core biopsies, which are obtained through the use of large-bore needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging. [...] Incisional biopsies are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious lesion, whereas excisional biopsies remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic surgical resections. Excisional biopsies of skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. Surgical resection specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs). These procedures are often intended as definitive surgical treatment of a disease in which the diagnosis is already known or strongly suspected, but pathological analysis of these specimens remains important in confirming the previous diagnosis.|$|E
