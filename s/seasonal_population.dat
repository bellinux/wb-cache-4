5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the <b>seasonal</b> <b>population</b> fluctuations may be taken advantage of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the eradication of established C. mutica.|$|E

25|$|Fresh {{water has}} always been a {{significant}} constraint on any permanent settlement. Aside from the early castaways noted above, the Islands have only had a small <b>seasonal</b> <b>population</b> of fishermen. The present fishermen all have permanent residence elsewhere, mainly in Geraldton, but their island shacks are used as a base during the season. For example, North Island has a seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishers, with individual moorings and simple dwellings. During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, the island hosts up to 130 people. The camp is serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and taking out the catch and any domestic waste.|$|E
25|$|The Houtman Abrolhos (often informally {{called the}} Abrolhos Islands) is {{a chain of}} 122 islands, and {{associated}} coral reefs, in the Indian Ocean off {{the west coast of}} Australia. Nominally located at , it lies about eighty kilometres (50mi) west of Geraldton, Western Australia. It is the southernmost true coral reef in the Indian Ocean, and one of the highest latitude reef systems in the world. It is one of the world's most important seabird breeding sites, and is the centre of Western Australia's largest single-species fishery, the western rock lobster fishery. It has a small <b>seasonal</b> <b>population</b> of fishermen, and a limited number of tourists are permitted for day trips, but most of the land area is off limits as conservation habitat. It is well known as the site of numerous shipwrecks, the most famous being the Dutch ships Batavia, which was wrecked in 1629, and Zeewijk, wrecked in 1727.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of sympatric speciation (the evolution of reproductive isolation between codistributed populations) in generating biodiversity is highly controversial. Whereas potential examples of sympatric speciation exist for plants, insects, and fishes, most theoretical models {{suggest that it}} requires conditions that are probably not common in nature, and only two possible cases have been described for tetrapods. One mechanism by which it could occur is through allochronic isolation-separation of populations by breeding time. Oceanodroma castro (the Madeiran or band-rumped storm-petrel) is a small seabird that nests on tropical and subtropical islands throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In at least five archipelagos, different individuals breed on the same islands in different seasons. We compared variation in five micro-satellite loci and the mitochondrial control region among 562 O. castro from throughout the species' range. We found that sympatric <b>seasonal</b> <b>populations</b> differ genetically within all five archipelagos and have ceased to exchange genes in two. Population and gene trees all indicate that <b>seasonal</b> <b>populations</b> within four of the archipelagos are {{more closely related to}} each other than to populations from the same season from other archipelagos; divergence of the fifth sympatric pair is too ancient for reliable inference. Thus, <b>seasonal</b> <b>populations</b> appear to have arisen sympatrically at least four times. This is the first evidence for sympatric speciation by allochrony in a tetrapod, and adds to growing indications that population differentiation and speciation can occur without geographic barriers to gene flow...|$|R

Edo's chōnin were well aware of this fact. In winter, women were asked to leave for their parents' residences in the suburbs of Edo and return only after the fire season had passed, resulting in a <b>seasonal</b> <b>population</b> fluctuation.

50|$|The {{existence}} of a separate species was first hinted at by the discovery of two distinct breeding seasons of Oceanodroma storm-petrels in the Azores. Both populations were initially thought to be of band-rumped storm petrels; however, one population breeds during the cool season, and the other during the hot season. A closer study of these two breeding populations found differences in their morphology and moult. Examination of the mtDNA found that the two populations were indeed genetically isolated, and the hot-season-breeding population was elevated to full species rank, Oceanodroma monteiroi, Monteiro's storm petrel. The species is named for biologist Dr Luis Monteiro, {{who was the first}} to notice morphological and acoustic differences between the two <b>seasonal</b> <b>populations</b> from the Azores.|$|R
