50|$|Typically, <b>sharkskin</b> <b>fabric</b> is {{made with}} the use of acetate or as a blend of the two, and its two-toned woven {{appearance}} is achieved by basketweaving, thereby creating a pattern in which the colored threads run diagonal to the white fibers.

5000|$|Artificial {{sharkskin}} variants {{used for}} suiting {{first appeared in}} the 1950s and rapidly garnered world-wide appeal in artificial sharkskin (costing much less than its [...] "natural" [...] counterpart: which most consumers were not aware existed, so far out of their price range it remained), attaining broad popularity in the early 1960s and the disco era of the late 70s, followed by brief fashion resurgences in the mid-1980s, mid-1990s and late 2000s: its variations often contain some wool percentage blend. More recently, such artificial <b>sharkskin</b> <b>fabrics</b> have undergone technological improvements and have attained new desirability, even among [...] "fabric purists" [...] who would have conventionally rejected out-of-hand any [...] "artificial sharkskin" [...] substitutes for the real item containing a majority percentage of mohair.|$|R
