5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box {{containing}} a lighter, two cigarettes, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: {{he was trying}} to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's blood, which is in fact cyanide, to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding a puppet, was attacked by a similar pig-masked figure. At gunpoint, Alison calls Lawrence and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the hacksaw bag. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; Lawrence had been with her before he was abducted. Lawrence realizes from Adam's description that Tapp was paying him. Adam finds a photo that he didn't take, of a man <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep. Unfortunately, the clock then strikes six as he realizes this.|$|E

5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|Two centuries later, Dr. Thomas Kruvajan and his assistant, Dr. Andre Gorobec, are {{traveling}} through Moldavia {{en route to}} a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken, requiring immediate repair. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face.|$|E

500|$|Inside {{some of the}} houses, Bathurst writes, {{everyday}} objects {{still remain}} where they were left decades ago; [...] "the bed and the limed matchboard ceiling are intact, untouched even by the damp. The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out {{from the top of}} the mantelpiece." [...] In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas, [...] "was a rank of family photographs, shades in Victorian dress <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> forever into a room now desolate and holed, but which had once held the life of a warm family." ...|$|E
500|$|Sage keeps a [...] boat (called Muriel) in real life, as {{does the}} {{character}} Sally Mullin in Magyk. Other inspirations for the series included Sage's love {{of history and the}} misty landscape of Cornwall, where she lived before starting the series. Another factor {{in the development of the}} series was her love of daydreaming: [...] "Slowly ... lots of thinking, and daydreaming. I am a big fan of daydreaming and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the window. Then keeping all my thoughts and ideas in a dog-eared old envelope for ages." [...] With The Wilton Villager, Sage further expanded her inspiration behind the series.|$|E
500|$|Music writers Covach and Boone {{describe}} the riff as blues-derived, {{which uses a}} minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common blues scale). [...] The song follows a blues chord progression (I–IV–I) during the first eight bars. [...] Brown {{had a difficult time}} writing lyrics that fit the riff. [...] After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist Pete Brown was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> the window. [...] Slowly, he started to write [...] "It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes", which is used in the first verse. [...] Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title. [...] It consists of eight-bar sections using three chords, when the key shifts to the V chord (I = V): ...|$|E

500|$|Vincent Law, in {{a review}} {{published}} in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine Andersonic, considers The Day After Tomorrow an [...] "oddity" [...] and an [...] "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon", commenting that the programme [...] "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to deaden {{the first half of}} the story and limits the room for character development." [...] Although he credits the production for [...] "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that [...] "at times Ed [...] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts." [...] He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are [...] "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a [...] "miniature Spock" [...] who [...] "lurks around the ship either brandishing his slide rule, threatening to calculate something, or <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen {{in the middle of the}} room, where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an aerial shot of Las Vegas, Nevada, showing the Palms Casino Resort and {{continues}} with a shot of a marquee hotel that reads [...] "Britney Spears Live From Miami The Onyx Hotel Tour Las Vegas", {{with a picture of}} Spears holding a leather strap and referencing her Showtime concert special from Miami. Christian author Eva Marie Everson compared the image to [...] "Madonna doing her own impersonation of Marilyn Monroe." [...] Spears and her boyfriend (played by Stephen Dorff) are arriving to the hotel inside a limousine. They sit apart from each other, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> separate windows. Spears wears a Birmingham Barons cap in these scenes. The boyfriend is talking on his cell phone, and when she attempts to touch him, he pushes her away. The entrance is full of fans and paparazzi taking pictures. When they leave the car, fans and paparazzi alike act in an extreme way and fights break in the crowd. While her bodyguards try to protect her, her boyfriend throws magazines at the paparazzi. Stephanie Zacharek of The New York Times compared the shots of the paparazzi with the Jews in the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ. During this scene, she gets hit {{in the head with a}} camera, and unknowingly gets a wound on her head, but keeps walking.|$|E
60|$|From {{the remote}} distance--out toward the south--came the boom and roar of cannon and musket fire--almost incessant still. There was her heart! there her thoughts! with the brave {{men who were}} {{fighting}} for their national existence--with the British troops and with their sufferings--and she stood here, <b>staring</b> straight <b>out</b> before her--dry-eyed and pale and small white hands clasped tightly together.|$|R
60|$|A {{few steps}} {{brought them to}} the shed, which was merely a roof of boughs built over a square space, with some {{branches}} of trees fastened to the sides to keep off the wind. The front was quite open and faced the sea, and as our friends came nearer they observed a little man, with a long pointed beard, sitting motionless on a stool and <b>staring</b> thoughtfully <b>out</b> over the water.|$|R

But, leaning on the breast-high window, and <b>staring</b> in <b>out</b> of the darkness, they find the visitor extremely embarrassing. Especially Mr Venus: who removes his pipe, draws back his head, and stares at the starer, as if it were his own Hindoo baby come to fetch him home.|$|R

2500|$|Esther {{is shown}} {{seated at the}} center of the canvas, arms above her head as she {{arranges}} her blond coiffure. Preparing to offer herself for the king's approval, she holds a pose that is [...] "profoundly erotic in its pictorial treatment". She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky.|$|E
