5000|$|Over {{the last}} forty years or so, a {{change has been}} {{observed}} in Belgium in the relationships between the Judiciary and Parliament. [...] "The dogma of absolute inviolability of the parliamentary assemblies has been breached. The parliamentary assemblies are now accountable not just to the electors but also to the courts.A first breach in the dogma of the inviolability of the assemblies was opened up by the Le Ski judgement of 27 May 1971, in which the Court of Cassation upheld the supremacy of the norm of self-executing international law.In 1980, Article 142 of the Constitution (former Article 107ter) established a Court of Arbitration in Belgium, nowadays the Constitutional Court, charged with hearing actions for annulment of laws. It would hand down its first judgement on 5 April 1985. (...) A second breach was opened in the dogma of inviolability of the assemblies in Belgium by the Constitutional Court, in its judgement no. 31/96 of 15 May 1996. The Council of State, the highest administrative Court in Belgium, had till then always declared that it had no jurisdiction to hear annulment applications against the administrative acts by the Houses of Parliament. The Constitutional Court, declaring that the absence of any possibility to apply for the annulment of such acts was contrary to the constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination, opened up a new avenue for judicial review of Parliament’s acts: the laws of 25 May 1999 and of 15 May 2007, adopted {{in the wake of the}} Court’s judgement, extended the jurisdiction of the Supreme Administrative Court to the acts and Rules of Procedure of the legislative assemblies or their organs with regard to public procurement and personnel (...) Finally, concerning the decisions taken by the assemblies with regard to MPs or political groups, the civil courts have not hesitated to sanction them when <b>subjective</b> <b>rights</b> were at stake. MPs [...] "enjoy the protection of their <b>subjective</b> <b>rights</b> by the law courts. This principle applies both for rights deriving from the law in the broad sense and for rights which have a regulatory basis" [...] (Civ. Brussels, 21 April 1997).".|$|E

50|$|Spinoza's {{political}} philosophy is scattered in three books, the Theologico-political Treatise, the Ethics and the Political treatise. A {{first look at}} its main principles could bring the uninformed reader {{to believe that it}} is the same as Hobbes's. Yet both theories differ in their conclusions. Spinoza's {{political philosophy}} is also a philosophy of the conatus, the individual tendency to exist, which cannot be brought to extinction even in the most powerful Leviathan, even in the worst of authoritarian regimes. Every individual, in Spinoza's opinion, has a natural right. This right includes everything that he desires and he is able to obtain. As a result, my own natural right is the equivalent of my individual strength or power. Hence, in Spinoza's political philosophy <b>subjective</b> <b>rights</b> (e.g. human rights) do not exist by nature, they are an institution of society, they only exist in the civil state. Moreover, according to Spinoza the notions of right and wrong have no meaning before society, since in the natural state there are no common norms, only individual desires (desires which can bring some people to dominate other weaker people).|$|E
50|$|These affirmations {{have some}} {{political}} implications. Here, individual rights exist only because we, as individuals, {{benefit from the}} power of our entire group. Members' rights are guaranteed by {{the strength of their}} political group (=State or imperium). Individual or <b>subjective</b> <b>rights</b> do not exist outside of a state, out of an organised society. But that doesn't mean that the government should have absolute power over us. To understand that well, {{we have to remember that}} according to Spinoza the government or society (there is no difference between them) are nothing else and do not exist without the individual conatuses of the individuals that are gathered in social entities. Individuals hold a part of their natural right in the civil state. They cannot restrain themselves from judging about the state of things as they wish, and any action that would go against this tendency can induce social unrest. It follows that the state must restrain itself from any action that could jeopardise its own integrity, as condemning determinate opinions can. In a broader perspective, a state that relies on fearsome and inhuman ways to preserve its power cannot survive for long, since those ways impede the development of its own strength, and reinforce the tendency of the multitudo, the masses, to unrest or to disobedience: obedience is necessary to preserve social order and peace.|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of medieval {{political}} philosophy the tendency has been {{to pay attention to}} thinkers who appear to have contributed to the birth of the modem. While the value in coming to understand how modem political thought developed is undeniable, this tendency is accompanied by an implicit, perhaps unintentional, devaluation of {{the study of}} that which did not contribute as obviously to modernity. In the history of the idea of the natural right scholars have distinguished between the objective and the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> characterizing the <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> as what {{lies at the heart of}} the classically modem and liberal. One could get the impression that the good political philosophers, having hit upon the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> dispensed with talk of the old-fashioned objective right just as people abandoned gaslight when Edison 2 ̆ 7 s light bulb went on the market. But this is not what happened; not only did objective rights discourse continue into the modem period, but it was not necessarily the idiom solely of religious and political conservatives. Some late medieval philosophers, notably Marsilius of Padua, even came up with progressive and unorthodox political visions while adhering to the objective right. I will show that at least one late medieval political theory founded on the objective right, that of John Wyclif, can be argued to be as innovative in several important aspects as that of any of the better-known fourteenth-century advocates of the <b>subjective</b> <b>right.</b> To do that, I will divide this paper into three parts. In the first, I will explain the difference between objective and subjective theories of the right, making note of what we can reasonably expect from a fourteenth-century political theory in the way of toleration and briefly introducing John Wyclifs life and works. In the second I will recount Wyclifs view of ius, or the right, as it appears in his political writings, and in the third I will explain how this concept has a bearing on elements in his political thought that are recognizably unorthodox and even tolerant to modem, liberal eyes. Having shown how Wyclif 2 ̆ 7 s objective right plays out in his innovative and reformative political scheme, I hope to have helped to dispel the dogma that the only early rights theories worth studying are those that evolved into ones we use...|$|R

Here, what is decisive is the figure of the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> which both for Molina and modern proponents of this legal concept describes the 'right per se'. According to Molina's definition of ius, the denial of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> or the hindrance of exercising an individual right represents an injustice. The rights granted to a slave in virtue of his being regarded a human being (despite the condition of slavery) serve to protect the slave against unjust acts. Molina does not distinguish the slave as a legal entity as separate from his master insofar as the slave should be protected against injustices committed against him or his property; injustices for which he would be entitled to compensation. Yet, the slave is not able to stake his claim to a particular right because it is not possible for him to take the matter to court. His natural law justified coequal legal status with respect to his master is limited in such a way by the positive legal order (by means of which slavery is generally made possible) that he is to be held legally incompetent as a legal entity with regard to defending and enforcing his 'qua homo'-legal rights.
