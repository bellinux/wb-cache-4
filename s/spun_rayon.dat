40|$|In the {{previous}} reports {{one of the}} authors (N. S.) presented various findings on the “Pre-heating and Quenching” method in resin treatments. It was also elucidated that the new pre-treatment was very effective in bringing about the opening of the interstices of the fibers, into which the resins penetrated and were set in situ. And this was strongly confirmed by examining various data, especially by the Kjeldahl N% after Best-Gordon, which the authors adapted to measure with the sets of controlling samples, consisting of those with the new pre-treatment and those without it. The purpose of the present paper is to show how successfully those <b>spun</b> <b>rayon</b> fabrics have been treated by the new method even on a semi industrial scale, and to afford further information for the elucidation of the real nature of the new pretreatment method...|$|E

50|$|Artificial fibres {{are made}} by {{extruding}} a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet <b>spinning</b> (<b>rayon)</b> uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.|$|R

This solution {{was the first thing}} to bear the name [...] "viscose". The cellulose solution is used to <b>spin</b> the viscose <b>rayon</b> fiber, which may also be called viscose.|$|R

This was due in a large part to the formation of limited liability companies known as Oldham Limiteds. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world. By 1871 Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were over 360 mills, operating night and day;Fox mill was erected in 1908.The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914-1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonys to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Fox Mill, Hollinwood was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. Courtaulds used Fox mill to <b>spin</b> <b>Rayon</b> until 1989 when the market collapsed. It was bought by J.D. Williams a mail-order company.The mill is now demolished and housing is on the site.|$|R
