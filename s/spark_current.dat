Using {{rarefied}} air as the dielectric, it is {{very easy}} to obtain luminous phenomena as brushes, or glow, upon both conducting balls or terminations, whilst the interval is dark, and that, when the action is so momentary that I think we cannot consider currents as effecting discharge across the dark part. Thus if two balls, about an inch in diameter, and 4 or more inches apart, have the air rarefied about them, and are then interposed in the course of discharge, an interrupted or <b>spark</b> <b>current</b> being produced at the machine[A], each termination may be made to show luminous phenomena, whilst more or less of the interval is quite dark. The discharge will pass as suddenly as a retarded spark (295. 334.), i.e. in an interval of time almost inappreciably small, and in such a case, I think it must have passed across the dark part as true disruptive discharge, and not by convection.|$|E
6000|$|... 1462. Muriatic acid gas.--It is very {{difficult}} to obtain the brush in this gas at common pressures. On gradually increasing the distance of the rounded ends, the sparks suddenly ceased when the interval was about an inch, and the discharge, which was still through the gas in the globe, was silent and dark. Occasionally a very short brush could for a few moments be obtained, but it quickly disappeared. Even when the intermitting <b>spark</b> <b>current</b> (1455.) from the machine was used, still I could only with difficulty obtain a brush, and that very short, though I used rods with rounded terminations (about 0.25 of an inch in diameter) which had before given them most freely in air and nitrogen. During the time of this difficulty with the muriatic gas, magnificent brushes were passing off from different parts of the machine into the surrounding air. On rarefying the gas, the formation of the brush was facilitated, but it was generally of a low squat form, very poor in light, and very similar on both the positive and negative surfaces. On rarefying the gas still more, a few large ramifications were obtained of a pale bluish colour, utterly unlike those in nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} temperature of {{a spark plug}} is the actual physical temperature {{at the tip of}} the spark plug within the running engine, normally between 500 and 800 C. This is important because it determines the efficiency of plug self-cleaning and is determined by a number of factors, but primarily the actual temperature within the combustion chamber. There is no direct relationship between the actual {{operating temperature}} of the spark plug and spark voltage. However, the level of torque currently being produced by the engine will strongly influence spark plug operating temperature because the maximal temperature and pressure occur when the engine is operating near peak torque output (torque and rotational speed directly determine the power output). The temperature of the insulator responds to the thermal conditions it is exposed to in the combustion chamber, but not vice versa. If the tip of the spark plug is too hot, it can cause pre-ignition or sometimes detonation/knocking, and damage may occur. If it is too cold, electrically conductive deposits may form on the insulator, causing a loss of spark energy or the actual shorting-out of the <b>spark</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of already published reports on the observation of an anomalous force in a vacuum associated with vacuum sparks in asymmetric capacitors charged with “constant” high voltages. Known experimental details of these experiments are put forward and propulsion performance is compared with the only known propulsion system known to exist in a vacuum associated with sparks: the vacuum arc thruster (VAT). VAT's are known for decades and work on principles of momentum conservation. They vaporize particles from the electrodes themselves through a high <b>spark</b> <b>current</b> in one direction in order to develop a thrust in the opposite direction. However, the known performance trend for these thrusters does not account for the vacuum spark force values published by NASA. Furthermore, they have not observed the electrode erosion usually associated with VAT operation, even after extended testing. Therefore it is possible that a new propulsion mechanism might be at work, but that should be verified and confirmed experimentally in the future in order to resolve the question...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFast {{evacuation}} of avalanche ions in Micromegas makes these detectors capable of withstanding very high rates with {{no loss of}} gain. But this intrinsic high-rate capability is often compromised by sporadic sparking which introduces dead time and is potentially harmful for the readout. Resistive electrode designs, by limiting <b>spark</b> <b>current</b> and keeping voltage drop locally, provide an effective remedy. They are thus quite popular, but there is actually more to them than simply spark attenuation. We propose that the spark probability is also drastically reduced because of charge-up of the resistive electrode surface. The underlying mechanism is a progressive reduction of field (in the region where spark-initiating avalanches develop) by the charges successively incoming onto the surface. We predict that the time constant with which the surface potential is relaxed {{is crucial to the}} success of this quenching mechanism. Small prototypes with a time constant varying over 5 orders of magnitude were built to verify this model. During tests in a high intensity hadron beam, spark quenching was observed for time constants larger than roughly 1 - 10 ns, corresponding to the avalanche timescale in Micromegas. These findings shed light on the basic mechanism of spark quenching in resistive detectors. Of general interest to the gaseous detector community, they also open the way to an optimisation of the resistivity value for best rate capability and full spark suppression...|$|E

40|$|In the mid 1980 s the {{monolithic}} {{nature of}} building energy simulation programs led to proposals {{for development of}} so-called &quot;kernel systems, &quot; i. e., software environments that would make available to developers basic software modules and a supporting framework {{that could be used}} to construct new building simulation software.

25|$|In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal <b>sparked</b> the <b>current</b> {{bottom-up}} {{paradigm in}} ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971). Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed {{and appeared to}} be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962). This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).|$|R

Eight process {{parameters}} namely pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak <b>current,</b> <b>spark</b> gap set voltage, wire feed, wire tension, water pressure, pulse peak voltage and servo feed are varied to study {{their effect on}} surface roughness and wire breakage. The experiments are conducted using one-factor-at-a-time approach. Moreover, a few random experiments are also carried to study the phenomenon of wire breakage precisely. The study revealed that surface roughness is directly affected by the pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak- <b>current,</b> <b>spark</b> gap set voltage and wire tension. Wire feed, Water pressure and pulse peak voltage have negligible effect on the surface roughness. Moreover, wire breakage is predominantly dictated by all the parameters except peak current and pulse peak voltage. An optimum range of input parameters has been bracketed as the final outcome for cutting in terms of surface roughness and to minimize the wire breakage frequency. Titanium and its alloys are considered excellent materials for their applications in aerospace and automobile industries because of their improved mechanical and physical properties like high strength, high strength to weight ratio, high toughness, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.
