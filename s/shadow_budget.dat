40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of fiscal illusion in German municipalities with special focus on the revenues from local public enterprises. These <b>shadow</b> <b>budgets</b> tend to increase the misperception of municipal tax prices and {{seem to have been}} neglected in the literature. Therefore, an aggregated expenditure function has been estimated for all German independent cities applying an “integrated budget” approach, which means that revenues and expenditures of the core budget and the local public enterprises are combined to one single municipal budget. The estimation results suggest that a higher relative share of local public enterprise revenues might increase total per capita spending as well as spending for non-obligatory municipal goods and services. Empirical evidence for other sources of fiscal illusion is mixed but some indications for debt illusion, renter illusion or the flypaper effect could be found. fiscal illusion, municipal enterprises, panel data regression...|$|R
40|$|Outsourcing of {{municipal}} tasks {{from the core}} budget to municipal enterprises tends to distort {{the perception of the}} actual financial position, net assets and results of operations of the German local governments. Excess supply or -demand of/for local public services might be possible consequences of this development. Hence, this article attempts to develop a more comprehensive picture of the municipal budgetary position by a simultaneous analysis of selected indicators. Furthermore, the methodological problems of the calculations are illustrated. If these <b>shadow</b> <b>budgets</b> are taken into account, the total per capita revenues, -investments and -debts will increase by approximately one third to 50 %. However, the share of the municipal employees belonging to the core administration in the total number {{of municipal}} employees is 75 %. Although only about 22 % of the expenditures for certain voluntary municipal tasks have been outsourced, {{there seems to be an}} upward trend. The study also indicates that there are significant differences between Eastern and Western German cities. These include the higher revenues from municipal enterprises, the higher debts per capita and the higher expenditures on culture, sports, leisure services or the promotion of science in Eastern Germany. The results should be interpreted carefully due to some shortcomings of the official statistics. For example, internal cash flows cannot be totally eliminated. Moreover, indirect municipal majority holdings as well as the municipal savings banks are not included in the results. All in all, it remains to be seen whether the initiated reforms concerning the introduction of double-entry accounting into the local government budgeting system will help to achieve the ideal goal of a meaningful “consolidated financial statement” for the “city company”. ...|$|R

40|$|The Commentary {{released}} today its 2011 federal <b>Shadow</b> <b>Budget</b> with a five-step plan {{to end the}} flow of red ink in Ottawa ahead of the government’s five-year timeline. In this paper, the authors show how Ottawa can return to budget surpluses in four years through more ambitious spending restraint and accelerate growth-friendly fiscal reforms. This faster track to budget surplus, say the authors, will position {{the federal government to}} launch new tax and spending initiatives around mid-decade, while protecting Canadians from possible debt-market disruptions arising from sovereign-debt concerns, and putting federal debt back on a downward track before the pressure of population aging on government finances intensifies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} whether some positions in democratic theory should be adjusted or abandoned in view of internationalisation; and if adjusted, how. More specifically it pursues three different aims: to evaluate various attempts to explain levels of democracy as consequences of internationalisation; to investigate whether the taking into account of internationalisation reveals any reason to reconsider what democracy is or means; and to suggest normative interpretations that cohere with the adjustments of conceptual and explanatory democratic theory made {{in the course of}} meeting the other two aims. When empirical methods are used, the scope of the study is restricted to West European parliamentary democracies and their international affairs. More particularly, {{the focus is on the}} making of budget policy in Britain, France, and Sweden after the Second World War, and recent budget policy in the European Union. The aspects of democracy empirically analysed are political autonomy, participation, and deliberation. The material considered includes parliamentary debates, official statistics, economic forecasts, elections manifestos, <b>shadow</b> <b>budgets,</b> general election turnouts, regulations of budget decision-making, and staff numbers in government and parliament budgetary divisions. The study reaches the following conclusions among others. (i) The fact that internationalisation increases the divergence between those who make and those who are affected by decisions is not by itself a democratic problem that calls for political reform. (ii) That international organisations may have authorities delegated to them from democratic states is not sufficient to justify them democratically. Democratisation still needs to be undertaken. (iii) The fear that internationalisation dissolves a social trust necessary for political deliberation within nations seems to be unwarranted. If anything, views argued by others in domestic budgetary debate are taken increasingly serious during internationalisation. (iv) The major difficulty with deliberation seems to be its inability to transcend national boundaries. International deliberation at state level has not evolved in response to internationalisation and it is undeveloped in international institutions. (v) Democratic political autonomy diminishes during internationalisation with regard to income redistribution and policy areas taken over by international organisations, but it seems to increase in public spending. (vi) In the area of budget policy-making there are no signs that governments gain power at the expense of parliaments during internationalisation. (vii) To identify crucial democratic issues in a time of internationalisation and to make room for theoretical virtues like general applicability and normative fruitfulness, democracy may be defined as a kind of politics where as many as possible decide as much as possible...|$|R
40|$|There are controversies {{regarding}} existing {{estimates of}} the size of shadow economy in Poland. Therefore this paper focuses on the measurement of shadow economy in Poland over the period 1995 – 2007. On the basis of monetary methods, an econometric model for currency demand is built. Using estimation results, the size of shadow economy is assessed. According to the estimates shadow economy declined in the period 1995 – 2007 starting from 40 % of GDP in 1995 and reaching about 10 % of GDP in 2007. The paper also analyses relations between <b>shadow</b> economy, state <b>budget</b> and tax system. A Vector Autoregressive model is estimated and Impulse Reaction Functions are drown, showing that an increase in indirect tax burden enlarges shadow economy.

40|$|Figure 1 : (a) Soft <b>shadow</b> mapping (micro-occluder <b>budget</b> bmo = 12) without {{blending}} {{can lead}} to transition artifacts when varying shadow map levels need to be used across pixels. (b–d) Our scheme enables not only smooth transitions for screen-uniform budgets (b: bmo = 12, c: bmo = 5) but also readily supports local budget variations (d: bmo decreases from 12 in the center to 5 at {{the left and right}} borders as shown in the inset). Recently, several soft shadow mapping algorithms have been in-troduced which extract micro-occluders from a shadow map and backproject them on the light source to approximately determine light visibility. To maintain real-time frame rates, these algorithms often have to resort to coarser levels of a multi-resolution shadow map representation which {{can lead to}} visible quality degradations. In particular, discontinuity artifacts can appear when having to use different shadow map levels across pixels. In this paper, we discuss several aspects of soft shadow quality. First, we motivate and propose a scheme that allows for varying soft shadow quality in screen-space in a visually smooth way and also for its adaptation based on local features like assigned impor-tance. Second, we suggest a generalization of micropatches which yields a better occluder geometry approximation at coarser shadow map levels, thus helping to reduce occluder overestimation. Third, we introduce a new hybrid acceleration structure for pruning the search space of potential micro-occluders that enables employing finer shadow map levels and hence increasing quality. Finally, we address multisampled rendering and suggest a simple scheme for interpolating light visibility that only adds a negligible cost com-pared to single-sample rendering...|$|R
