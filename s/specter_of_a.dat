A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

In March 1863, the federal draft law was changed so that male citizens between 20 and 35 and unmarried citizens to age 45 were subject to conscription. Those who could afford to hire a substitute or pay $300 were exempt. Antiwar newspaper editors attacked the law, and many immigrants and their descendants resented being drafted in place of people who could buy their way out. Democratic Party leaders raised the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deluge of freed southern blacks competing with the white working class, then dominated by ethnic Irish and immigrants.

As a result, many blacks left Manhattan permanently, moving to Brooklyn or other areas.|$|E

[...] Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a {{commuted}} pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times. [...] After the second rejection on February 4, a plot to further raise tensions began to take shape. [...] Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership's agreement with the proposed nationalist plan. [...] The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. [...] On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym Brutus) to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. [...] He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should [...] "not lose a moment preparing for events." [...] Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. [...] The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival. [...] These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.|$|E

50|$|Embodied {{cognitive}} science {{differs from the}} traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the Homunculus argument, which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation.

Because <b>of</b> the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible.

Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations.

The problem is framed as the replacement of targeted surveillance with mass surveillance programs, and the solutions put forward are predominantly technical and involve the use of encryption – or ‘crypto’ – as a defense mechanism. The counter-surveillance movement is timely and deserves widespread support. However, as this article will argue and illustrate, raising the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Orwellian system <b>of</b> mass surveillance, shifting the discussion to the technical domain, and couching that shift in economic terms undermine a political reading that would attend to the racial, gendered, classed, and colonial aspects of the surveillance programs.
