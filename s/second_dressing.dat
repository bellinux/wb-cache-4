[...] "They both dressed for dinner, and, as I thought, made {{themselves}} very smart; but for such a grand occasion as this they thought a <b>second</b> <b>dressing</b> necessary. How do you do, Mrs Hearn? I hope you are quite well. No rheumatism left, eh?" [...] This the squire said very loud into Mrs Hearn's ear. Mrs Hearn was perhaps a little hard of hearing; but it was very little, and she hated to be thought deaf. She did not, moreover, like to be thought rheumatic. This the squire knew, and therefore his mode of address was not good-natured.|$|E
50|$|The Writing Room (Írószoba) was on {{the first}} floor of the Baroque wing, was {{formerly}} part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers ("Emperor’s Dressing Room"). It was connected to another small room, the <b>second</b> <b>dressing</b> room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above.|$|E
40|$|Background: Pain is a {{major issue}} for {{patients}} with severe burn. High dose intravenous opioids form the mainstay of procedural burns pain management; however {{it was suggested that}} intravenous lidocaine assists with minimising the pain experience. This study aimed to evaluate whether intravenous lidocaine improved analgesic efficacy and decreased opioid consumption during a burn wound care procedure. Methods: A prospective double-blind randomized crossover study compared intravenous lidocaine versus placebo alongside patient controlled analgesia (PCA) in 45 patients with severe burn undergoing wound care procedures (i. e. dressing change debridement) on two consecutive days. Subjects were randomised to either the intervention or control condition on the first dressing day, and received the alternate condition on the <b>second</b> <b>dressing</b> day. During the intervention condition, subjects received lidocaine of 1. 5 mg/kg/body weight followed by two boluses of 0. 5 mg/kg at 5 -min intervals followed by a continuous infusion. During the control condition, 0. 9 % sodium chloride was administered at an equivalent volume, dose and rate to that of lidocaine. Primary end points included pain intensity as measured by verbal rating scale (VRS), time to rescue analgesia, opioid requests and consumption and overall anxiety and level of satisfaction. Results: Changes in the VRS score was significantly lower for lidocaine [difference (95 % CI) = 0. 36 (0. 17 0. 55) ] as compared to placebo. However, there were no significant clinical or statistical differences regarding the effects of lidocaine and placebo on opioid requests and consumption, anxiety or level of satisfaction during the first and <b>second</b> <b>dressing</b> procedures.

40|$|Wounds {{that fail}} to heal quickly are often {{encountered}} by community nursing staff. An important step in assisting these chronic or stalled wounds progress through healing is debridement to remove devitalised tissue, including slough and eschar, that can prevent the wound from healing. A unique wound treatment called HydroTherapy aims to provide an optimal healing environment. The first step of HydroTherapy involves HydroClean plus™, this dressing enables removal of devitalised tissue through autolytic debridement and absorption of wound fluid. Irrigation and cleansing provided by Ringer’s solution from the dressing further removes any necrotic tissue or eschar. Once effective wound bed preparation has been achieved a <b>second</b> <b>dressing,</b> HydroTac™, provides an ongoing hydrated wound environment that enables re-epithelialisation to occur in an unrestricted fashion. This paper presents 3 case studies of slow healing wounds treated with HydroClean plus™ which demonstrates effective wound debridement...|$|E
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was laid out}} in a split-plot design with three replications for each field (Figure  3). All fields were divided into two parts to produce two strips to separate fertilized and non-fertilized parts. Two sets of factors included in this experiment were as follows: with (+F) and without (-F) fertilizer application as the main plot, and different positions as a subplot. The positions were the inlet, middle and outlet for the two fields, referred to as the 1 st inlet, 1 st middle, 1 st outlet for the 1 st field, and the 2 nd inlet, 2 nd middle and 2 nd outlet for the 2 nd field. The applied chemical fertilizers were Nitrogen (N) 50 kg ha- 1 (Ammonium sulfate), Phosphorus (P) 30 kg ha- 1 (Triple superphosphate) and Potassium (K) 20 kg ha- 1 (Muriate of potash) with two split applications according to the local recommendations by extension service. The first dressing was conducted at transplanting using 50 % N, 100 % P and 100 % K of the total amount of fertilized applied. The <b>second</b> <b>dressing</b> contained the remaining 50 % N which was applied at heading stage (60 days after transplanting).|$|E
