5000|$|The {{most common}} {{scanning}} aperture techniques are the knife-edge technique and the scanning-slit profiler. The former chops the beam {{with a knife}} and measures the transmitted power as the blade cuts through the beam. The measured intensity versus knife position yields a curve that is the integrated beam intensity in one direction. By measuring the intensity curve in several directions, the original beam profile can be reconstructed using algorithms developed for x-ray tomography. Tomographic laser beam profilers were originally developed as a measuring instrument by Duma Optronics [...] The measuring instrument is based on high precision multiple knife edges each deployed on a rotating drum and having a different angle with respect to beam orientation. <b>Scanned</b> <b>beam</b> is then reconstructed using tomographic algorithms and provides 2D or 3D high resolution energy distribution plots. Because of the special scanning technique the system automatically zooms in onto the current beam size enabling high resolution measurements of sub micron beams as well as relative large beams of 10 or more millimeters. To obtain measurement of various wavelength different detectors are used to allow laser beam measurements from deep UV to far IR. Unlike other camera based systems this technology also provides accurate power measurement in real timeScanning-slit profilers use a narrow slit instead of a single knife edge. In this case, the intensity is integrated over the slit width. The resulting measurement {{is equivalent to the}} original cross section convolved with the profile of the slit.|$|E

A <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> display suffers from two main problems: the non-uniform power spreading within a single light spot and the non-uniform light spot distribution in trajectory. While most {{work has been done}} to solve these problems from the hardware design perspective, we address these issues by minimizing the difference between input and output images on a software level. We also implemented our algorithm on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to achieve near real-time performance which is required by video display.

40|$|Currently, laser {{perfusion}} imaging (LDPI) {{is undergoing}} a technology shift from <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> perfusion imagers to whole field systems. The latter can be subdivided in laser Doppler methods systems based on high speed CMOS cameras, and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) technologies using slow imaging arrays, mostly CCD-based. In <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems, a collimated laser <b>beam</b> <b>scans</b> the tissue with diffusely back reflected light being captured with a single detector. In whole field systems a large tissue area is illuminated, and the reflected light is imaged onto an array and captured at once. Unlike <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems, both whole field methods enable perfusion imaging at video rate. In this study we experimentally compare the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> LDPI principle with whole field LDPI, using Intralipid phantoms. For the tissue phantoms, the Monte Carlo simulation technique {{will be used as}} a reference. From measurements on Intralipid phantoms compared to Monte Carlo, we conclude that in whole field LDPI the flux image, representing the first order moment of the power spectrum of photocurrent fluctuations is much closer related to real perfusion than for <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems. This difference can be explained in terms of the different behaviour of dynamic speckle patterns generated in both methods, in response to varying tissue optical propertie...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) was {{demonstrated}} in a dilute atomic gas [1], rotating BECs {{have been of}} interest to researchers due to their quantized circulation. We propose a new method of creating controlled vortices in a BEC. Atoms are held in {{the focus of a}} <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> that rapidly <b>scans</b> to produce a time-averaged potential [2]. We have made theoretical calculations to measure the heating caused by a <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> trap and to find the regime where a <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> produces a time-averaged potential. The <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> splits the BEC into four parts then imprints a relative phase on each part such that, when the parts recombine, a vortex forms. We have simulated such a system using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and have demonstrated the laser scanning pattern using a two-dimensional acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The optics for the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> trap have been designed and the experimental trap dimensions are used in our simulations.

40|$|AbstractLaser {{cladding}} using a <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> {{is quite}} a similar process than laser cladding using static optics (e. g. lens or mirror optics). The main difference comes from the manipulation of the laser beam. In laser cladding with scanning optics the laser beam is manipulated with a scanner so that the laser's area of influence can be shaped numerically. This increases cladding process flexibility. Scanning optics enable laser beam modification considerably versatile way than normal static optics can. This is due to possibility of numerical adjustment of scanning amplitude, laser power and scanning frequency. By modifying these parameters clad beads geometry can by modified quite freely. However scanned laser beam in surface modification process creates some restricting factors to the process. Mainly limitations for the process parameter values come from the dual characteristics of the energy input. This paper treats usability of scanning optics in laser cladding process in general level. In this paper is discussed how <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> {{can be used to}} increase the flexibility but also maters that limit the usage of <b>scanned</b> <b>beam</b> in cladding process.

50|$|The first fully {{functional}} low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube, the CPS Emitron, {{was invented}} and {{demonstrated by the}} EMI team {{under the supervision of}} Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for television transmitting systems where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube was obtained. The EMI team kept working on these devices, and Lubszynski discovered in 1936 that a clear image could be produced if the trajectory of the low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> was nearly perpendicular (orthogonal) to the charge storage plate in a neighborhood of it. The resulting device was dubbed the cathode potential stabilized Emitron, or CPS Emitron.

5000|$|The {{original}} iconoscope {{was very}} noisy {{due to the}} secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> swept it across. An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with an electron beam, which velocity and energy were so low in a neighborhood of the plate, that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to photo-emission and capacitance, respectively. These stored charges are then [...] "gently" [...] discharged by a low-velocity electron <b>scanning</b> <b>beam,</b> preventing the emission of secondary electrons. Not all the electrons in the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> may be absorbed in the mosaic, because the stored positive charges are proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The remaining electrons are then deflected back into the anode, captured by a special grid, or deflected back into an electron multiplier.|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for creating linear array antennas that {{conform to the}} natural stacking sequence of the woodpile electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) material. Each element in the linear array consists of a woodpile EBG sectoral horn antenna.

The array element has a typical sectoral horn pattern with a directional beam in one principal plane and a broader beam in the other.

Measured and theoretical results for radiation patterns, impedance bandwidth and gain of a sectoral horn antenna made from alumina are described, and theoretical results for a design made from silicon are presented.
