5|$|Building {{on what is}} now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> street. Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and {{is the only one of}} this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|North of Pentwater, US31 crosses into Mason County {{and passes}} Bass Lake and the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, {{which uses a}} {{reservoir}} next to the freeway to generate electricity. Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and Ludington's business spur runs off to the northwest. US31 curves around {{the east side of}} Ludington, crossing the Pere Marquette River. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US31 turns east to merge with US10. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to Scottville. On the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> town, US31 separates from US10, turning northward to bypass Scottville.|$|E

25|$|Bauld left Hearts in 1962 with 355 goals from 510 {{first team}} appearances. Another future internationalist, Willie Hamilton, joined for the run {{culminating}} in the 1962 Scottish League Cup Final win. Hearts won the trophy for a fourth time with a 1–0 final win over Willie Waddell's fine Kilmarnock <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era. Davidson's goal this time proved decisive. Like in the 1954–55 win Hearts eliminated Celtic in that 1962-63 Scottish League Cup group stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} boundary {{follows a}} combination of lot lines and streets. Its most easily described portion begins at 298 South Pearl Street and follows the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> street north for approximately a quarter-mile (500 m) to {{the north end of}} the parking lot on the east side between Fourth Avenue and Alexander Street. It turns east then south down St. Ann's Place and across Fourth to exclude the parking lot yet include Public Bath No. 2 and St. Ann's/St. John's Church buildings.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} is mostly bounded by streets, making it roughly quadrilateral in shape. At the west, Lenox Road divides {{it from the}} college campus. Nott Street forms the northern boundary, separating the Realty Plot from Ellis Hospital until the rear property lines between houses on Lowell Road and Glenwood Boulevard mark the eastern boundary. After crossing Rugby Road, the line turns west {{to take in the}} houses on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> street, including some on Oxford Place just east of its intersection with Wendell Avenue, then following Oxford back to Lenox.|$|E
25|$|At South Third Street (NY 9G/23B), it {{excludes}} {{a modern}} {{building on the}} southeast corner of the intersection but then includes all the properties on the east side down to a former railroad right-of-way. A northern bulge includes the properties along North Fourth Street to State Street to take in the library, and on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> intersection. At the eastern end the district boundary follows the railroad tracks to North Seventh Street, extends east along Warren Street, at that point part of US 9.|$|E
25|$|Copeland began digging the {{basement}} {{in advance of}} the bond issuance, then continued pouring the foundation, and beginning construction of the brick structure. He utilized bricks from the Francis and Simpson Day brickyard, located {{on the banks of the}} nearby Little Colorado River. While Copeland anticipated that construction would be completed by November, the school was not officially dedicated until December 6, 1930. The following year (1931-32), the school had a principal and seven teachers. By 1940, the community felt the school needed a kitchen and cafeteria, which were added to the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> structure that year.|$|E
50|$|The school's name, Champlin Park, {{comes from}} the {{combination}} of bordering cities Brooklyn Park and Champlin.

DEC has also acquired public fishing easements on a small stretch in Mumford and much of both banks along Oatka Trail in the Town of Le Roy between Mud Creek and the unnamed northern tributary two miles (3.2km) upstream. These allow use of the 33 feet (11 m) adjoining the river by anglers for access to the water. They are subject to regular DEC fishing regulations.|$|E
25|$|Geotechnically, the {{accident}} was investigated by performing both test drilling and strength calculations on site. The investigation into the cause of {{the accident}} had a major impact {{on the development of the}} field of geotechnics in Sweden. The scene of {{the accident was}} cleared in autumn 1918 so that the train line could be reopened by December. This was made possible by shifting the track one metre towards the side of the mountain and by reinforcing the embankment with rocks. At the site of the accident, the speed limit was lowered to 15km/h, with the speed limit on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stretch of track being 30km/h. In modern times, the speed limit has been set at a flat 100km/h.|$|E
25|$|Hungary has {{a respectable}} {{football}} history, having won three Olympic titles, finishing runners-up in the 1938 and 1954 FIFA World Cups, {{and third in}} the 1964 UEFA European Football Championship. Hungary revolutionised the sport in the 1950s, laying the tactical fundamentals of Total Football and dominating international football with the remarkable Golden Team which included legend Ferenc Puskás, top goalscorer of the 20th century, to whom FIFA dedicated its newest award, the Puskás Award. The <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> era has the second all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in the world, with 2166 in 1954, {{and one of the}} longest undefeated runs in football history, remaining unbeaten in 31 games, spanning over four years and including matches such as the Match of the Century.|$|E

25|$|Nine games {{records were}} equalled or bettered {{during the course}} of the five-day competition. In {{addition}} to those marks, Li Ling set an Asian record of 4.65metres in the women's pole vault and Zhang Peimeng broke the Chinese record in the men's 200 metres with his run of 20.47 seconds. Zhang broke both games records in the short sprints. Li Jinzhe ranked fourth in the world that year with his games record of 8.34m in the men's long jump. Zhao Qinggang's record of 83.14 m in the men's javelin throw was over seven metres clear of the rest of the field. The women's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> event was closer, but Li Lingwei's winning mark of 63.06m was a games record and made her eleventh best in the world for 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan {{government}} was initially unconcerned with the Athenians' presence at Pylos, assuming {{that they would}} soon depart. Once it became clear, however, that Demosthenes and his men intended to hold the site, the king Agis, {{who was at the}} head of an army ravaging Attica, turned for home, cutting his invasion short after only 15 days in Athenian territory. Once he reached home, Spartan forces immediately moved towards Pylos, the fleet at Corcyra was ordered to sail there immediately, and a summons was sent out calling allied states around the Peloponnese to send troops. The Spartan fleet managed to slip past the Athenian fleet at Zacynthus, but Demosthenes anticipated its arrival and dispatched two of his triremes to inform the Athenian fleet of Pylos' plight; that fleet set out for Pylos as soon as it received the news. Pylos, meanwhile, had been reinforced by the arrival of a privateer with a cargo of arms, which were distributed to the sailors, and by a Messenian pinnace, which brought 40 more hoplites to defend the peninsula. (Donald Kagan has asserted that these apparently fortuitous arrivals must have been the result of planning by Demosthenes.) To meet the imminent Spartan attack, Demosthenes divided his force, placing most of his men {{at the point where the}} promontory touched the mainland, while he with 60 hoplites and a few archers waited at the point facing out to sea where the Athenian wall was weakest. When the Spartan fleet arrived, the Spartans prepared to blockade the entrance to the harbour by placing hoplites on the island of Sphacteria, which was in the middle of the entrance, and planned to place ships in the gaps on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> island when the Athenian fleet arrived.|$|E
