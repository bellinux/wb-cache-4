40|$|Numerous {{machines}} used {{to execute}} {{public works projects}} produce noise, {{and in the past}} noise measurements were performed assuming project noise is produced by a single sound source. But to perform practical noise prediction, the quantity of noise from each machine must be obtained. The authors analyzed simulated noise in <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> and outdoor construction machinery noise with a straight microphone array installed horizontally to calculate the quantities of noise produced by individual sound sources. Simulated noise in <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> had been analyzed with target accuracy. But, with the outdoor moving sound sources, the total of the analysis values was reduced to between 2. 4 and 4 dB. Approximately- 1 dB is caused by applying the delay and sum, approximately- 1 dB is caused by installing a band pass filter, and the remaining- 0. 4 to- 2 dB is caused mainly by motion of the sound sources. The noise levels of individual sound sources are corrected by the total value measured by a noise meter. And although not the purpose of this research, it was confirmed {{that it is possible to}} analyze the location of a sound source based on the noise, and that the sound can be reproduced by sound source. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{high-frequency}} coupling from {{electromagnetic fields}} to cables is studied and this under (i) plane-wave conditions representing a susceptibility test in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> and (ii) random wave conditions representing {{a more realistic}} environment. Two set-ups are considered. First, a simple wire above an infinite ground plane. Second, a more realistic set-up representing a desktop device with attached cables whose layout is according to EN 55016 - 2 - 3 : 2006 [1].

40|$|Abstract- The {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} the antenna factor is a fundamental requirement for reliable electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) measurements in emissions, immunity and human exposure tests. According to international standards, this would imply calibrating antennas in close-to-ideal test sites (calibration test sites), characterized by very large sizes of the ground plane and of the empty space volume above it (free-space behaviour). On the other hand the greater number of EMC test sites is designed for measurements at 3 meters distance, therefore {{it would be very}} convenient to calibrate antennas in such facilities at the cost of an acceptable loss of accuracy. In this paper, the authors investigate on the suitability of compact (standard compliant for measurements at 3 m) <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>rooms</b> for reliable antenna factor calibrations of EMI antennas. As an example, the calibration of a common broadband biconical antenna in the range 200 MHz- 1 GHz has been considered. A detailed experimental analysis was performed for estimating all the involved uncertainty components. I...|$|R

The recording sessions were carried out in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> recording <b>room.</b> The recordings were done with the Clavinet output and an AKG C- 414 B-ULS condenser microphone (AKG Acoustics GmbH, Vienna, Austria) placed close to the strings, and both were connected to the acquisition sound card. The latter recordings were useful only {{in the analysis of}} the tail of the sound as the mechanical noise generated by the key, its rebound, and the tangent hitting the anvil masked the striking portion of the tone nearly entirely. This was {{due to the fact that}} the Clavinet soundboard is not intended as an amplifying device, but rather as a mechanical support to the instrument.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the {{development}} and experimental realization of an active structural acoustic control (ASAC) system for a curved carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) panel. The research aims at the development of a smart lightweight fuselage structure for future aircrafts with an improved sound transmission loss at frequencies well below 1 kHz. A numerical pre-design is performed in order to define the transducers of the active system and to derive optimal sensor and actuator locations with regard to an acoustically relevant performance metric. The optimization of the type, number and location of the actuators is based on a full system description using numerical models for the disturbance excitation (diffuse sound field), the passive composite structure, the actuators (piezoceramic patch transducers) and sensors (accelerometers) as well as the fluid-structure interaction causing the sound radiation. A simulation of the system in the frequency domain yields a numerical performance prediction for a specific transducer configu-ration. A genetic search algorithm is used for the derivation of optimal positions for the selected actuators. The optimal number of sensors is determined by using the singular values of the cross-power spectral density matrix. All potential sensor positions are spanned by a fine sensor grid. The optimal placement is guided by a combination of the Observability Gramian and the superposed modal amplitudes weighted by their corresponding radiation efficiency. For the experiments, the active CFRP panel is mounted in an acoustic transmission loss test facility with a reverberant sending and a <b>semi-anechoic</b> receiving <b>room.</b> High-order system models are derived by the use of a multiple-reference test and subsequent system identification. Different con-trollers are designed and implemented on a rapid-control-prototyping system. The acoustic per-formance is evaluated by means of sound power measurements in the receiving room...|$|R
40|$|Aeroacoustic {{problems}} pose some {{challenges to}} the conventional techniques normally used to source localization and identification. The main difficulties are that sources are normally distributed, with coherent and incoherent regions, and with simultaneous mono and multipole radiation patterns. Among the most recent ones, the Generalized Inverse Beamforming method has the promise to meet these challenges. In this paper, the potential for identification of compact sources in close vicinity, similar to a distributed source, and the potential to identify a dipole center and orientation, induced by two compact sources, are illustrated in two no-flow tests. Results obtained in <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> are compared to numerical prediction, and the generalized inverse beamforming performance compared to the conventional beamforming results.

40|$|With this study, {{we provide}} a global link between linear and {{non-linear}} acoustic resistance of a perforation {{as a function}} of orifice geometry and Strouhal number. High amplitudes of acoustic pressure induce flow separation {{at the edges of the}} orifices. This is a non-linear mechanism increasing the acoustic resistance of a perforation. Quasi-static models have been used to predict the acoustic resistance in the non-linear regime, yet the linear to non-linear transition has been out of focus so far. We carry out open-end impedance measurements in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> with four different samples. These samples are selected to have different orifice geometries and edge profiles, so that the conclusions would be general.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to predict the sound pressure above a wall facing composed of N parallel rectangular cavities. The diffracted acoustic field is processed by generalizing the Kobayashi Potential (KP) method used for determining the electromagnetic field diffracted by a rectangular cavity set in a thick screen. This model enables the diffracted field to be expressed in modal form. Modal amplitudes are subsequently calculated using matrix equations obtained by enforcing boundary conditions. Solving these equations allows {{the determination of the}} total reflected acoustic field above the wall facing. This model was compared with experimental results obtained in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> for a single cavity, a periodic array of three rectangular cavities and an aperiodic grating of nine rectangular cavities of different size and spacing.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the vibro-acoustic behavior of structures excited by a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) is an expensive task and thus raises the demand for less expensive alternative solu-tions. This contribution focuses on the synthesis of TBL-typical structural vibration {{by means of a}} loudspeaker array placed in front of a panel structure. The derived method can be applied to any flat or curved panel structure (e. g. an aircraft fuselage section). The work is subdivided into three main parts. Firstly, experiments in an aero-acoustic wind tunnel are performed to capture the characteristics of the TBL excitation and the induced vibrations of a rectangular aluminum plate. Secondly, a finite element model of the plate and a statistical excitation model are derived and validated with measurement data. Despite the use of simple simulation models, a high agreement between measurement and simulation is achieved. It is concluded that realistic values for the vibrations of panel structures can be derived. In the third part of this work, the aluminum plate is mounted in the test opening of a transmission loss facility. A loudspeaker array located in the reverberant sending room of the facility is placed in front of the panel and the frequency response functions (FRFs) from the loudspeaker array to the structural vibration of the plate are derived. The structural vibration is measured with a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer placed in the <b>semi-anechoic</b> receiving <b>room</b> of the facility. The filtering of the simulated target values through the inverse FRFs yields the required control signals for the loudspeaker array. Twelve loudspeakers, corresponding to 60 loudspeakers per square meter, are used to synthesize the TBL-induced structural vibration up to 500 Hz. The synthesized structural vibration is consistent with the target values obtained from simulation...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} dealt so far with {{changing}} in speech production for talkers due to different acoustic environments, but mostly have {{been focused on}} the effect of noise or distance from the listeners and not many on the effect of reverberation. Reverberation has an influence on the voice production, supporting talkers as well as increasing speech level towards an audience. In spite of its positive effects, excessive reverberation influences talkers making them use erroneous vocal behaviors, which may be cause of discomfort and a risk for vocal health, {{especially in the case of}} prolonged speech, as for teachers in classrooms. The present work explores the differences in sound pressure level and sound power level of running speech from several speakers, in <b>semi-anechoic</b> and reverberant <b>rooms.</b> Two types of spontaneous speech, a free monologue and the description of a map, have been addressed with a communicative intent to a listener seated at a fixed distance of 6 m.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{design of}} a workspace helps enriching speech and preventing talkers from forcing their voice. Voice disorders may cause absenteeism from work to recover, and many voice professionals such as teachers underestimate risks depending on the improper use of voice. Talkers tend to adjust their vocal output {{on the base of}} the vocal task, the distance to the listener and the sound environment. Given the same room acoustics, distance to the listener and type of speech, face-to-face communication implies interspeaker differences in the sound pressure level (SPL) of the voice signal at a short distance from the mouth, fundamental frequency (F 0) and phonation time percentage (Dt%). The measurement chain and the characteristic of the sample are other causes of variability. This study investigates on changings in SPL, F 0 and Dt% over 19 Italian mother-tongue subjects aging between 22 to 34 yrs, 11 female and 8 male, neither hearing nor visual impaired, producing continuous 5 minute-long speeches in the <b>semi-anechoic</b> and reverberant <b>rooms</b> of INRiM, in Turin (Italy). Talkers spoke freely aiming to transmit information on something they knew well to a listener seated 6 m far. The speech production was monitored through the contemporary use of a calibrated class 1 sound level meter (SLM) and two portable voice monitoring devices (VMD). The SLM, used as a reference measurement device, was placed at a fixed distance from the speaker's mouth. The VMDs, based on two different contact microphones placed at the jugular notch of the speaker, were used to sense the skin vibrations induced by the vocal folds activity. A comparison between the use of different instrumental chains was assessed. Subjective surveys on vocal comfort completed the data acquisition with the aim of finding out correspondences between objective and subjective impression...|$|R

A typical case of an office work station has been modeled and different heights of the table screen have been investigated through simulation. Two simulation methods have been compared: The first one (ICARE software developed at CSTB) uses asymptotic methods and is based on beam tracing including edge diffraction. The second method (MICADO 3 D software developed at CSTB) uses the resolution through the Boundary Element Method where the Green function is optimized by the use of a source image technique. The simulation results show the insertion loss for the table screen and permits to determine the most efficient height for the protection between two work stations.

The experiments were preceded by a numerical simulation predicting resonant vibration patterns. The plate was then suspended by means of thin wires at the nodal lines of a vibration pattern of interest, thus reducing the influence of the suspension to a minimum. Good correspondence was found between the numerical simulations and the experiments.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} a school classroom may have an influence on the cognitive developmental processes in children, {{as well as on}} the voicing demand in teachers. High reverberation times and excessive background noise levels negatively affect speech communication and can be the causes of psychophysical diseases in both students and teachers. Recent studies highlighted the correlation between the occupational voice use and the occurrence of voice pathologies, however there is still a lack in the studies that accounted for all the aspects that are present in the everyday communication situations and that are based on repeated and accurate voice monitorings in-field. The objective of this Ph. D. thesis is to contribute to the identification of tools, procedures and requirements to address all the issues related to healthcare and safety related to the teaching and learning practices in school classrooms. This approach includes to account for every possible cause of health risk among which the work- and stress-related problems appear, negatively affecting the teaching activity and reducing speech intelligibility towards pupils. The first part of the research activity within these three years was oriented to the investigation of the voice use under very different acoustic conditions. Experiments were performed both in laboratory and in-field. In particular, measurements took place in the <b>semi-anechoic</b> and reverberant <b>rooms</b> of the National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM) in Torino and repeatedly in primary school classrooms located in the North of Italy. Within this framework, the calibration procedures for the accurate estimation and measurement of voice parameters were defined for a new portable vocal analyser that was recently developed.

40|$|Capacitive-type {{transduction}} is {{now widely}} used in MEMS microphones. However, its sensitivity decreases with reducing size, due to decreasing air gap capacitance. In the present study, we proposed and developed the Electret Gate of Field Effect Transistor (ElGoFET) transduction based on an electret and FET (field-effect-transistor) as a novel mechanism of MEMS microphone transduction. The ElGoFET transduction has the advantage that the sensitivity {{is dependent on the}} ratio of capacitance components in the transduction structure. Hence, ElGoFET transduction has high sensitivity even with a smaller air gap capacitance, due to a miniaturization of the transducer. A FET with a floating-gate electrode embedded on a membrane was designed and fabricated and an electret was fabricated by ion implantation with Ga+ ions. During the assembly process between the FET and the electret, the operating point of the FET was characterized using the static response of the FET induced by the electric field due to the trapped positive charge at the electret. Additionally, we evaluated the microphone performance of the ElGoFET by measuring the acoustic response in air using a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room.</b> The results confirmed that the proposed transduction mechanism has potential for microphone applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{complex sound}} field in {{performance}} spaces, characterized by multiple sound reflections from various surfaces with different absorptive and diffusive characteristics, {{makes it difficult}} to deduce the effect of the single interior surface on the room impulse response. In order to obtain more knowledge on this topic, laboratory experiments were performed in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room.</b> Three different conditions were studied by monaural and binaural room impulse response measurements. Three types of surfaces with different absorptive and diffusive characteristics (flat surface and two differently absorbing concrete blocks with the same geometrical pattern) were placed on the floor during the experiments.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of two control strategies used for structural acoustic isolation, where {{the emphasis is on}} controlling structural vibration that is responsible for sound radiation. The controllers are required to attenuate the sound pressure that is transmitted trough a plate under structural vibration. The proposed setup consists of a lexan plate clamped on a rigid bafe. The exogenous disturbance that causes the vibration of the plate is provided by a point force driven by a shaker. The control input used to attenuate the sound pressure inside a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> is provided by a exural moment driven by a piezoelectric patch attached to the plate. The rst control strategy is a normalized Filtered-X LMS algorithm that assumes full information of the exogenous disturbance as reference.

As opposed to the feedforward LMS design, the H 2 feedback controller posses no information of the disturbance. The sound pressure is measured by two microphones. The rst microphone, located near the plate, provides the error sensor for both controllers. The second microphone, located far from the plate is used for performance evaluation.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{perforation}} edge profile in micro-perforated plates (MPPs) is investigated and compared with the sharp edge case. MPPs are metal plates with small holes (perforations) that absorb incident sound waves using the Stokes boundary layers developed inside and {{in the vicinity of}} the perforations. The perforation diameter should be optimized so that the Stokes layers cover almost the entire perforation thus maximizing the absorbed sound energy due to viscosity. Hence, designing MPPs is a tuning problem. The existing analytical model for evaluating the transfer impedance of the MPPs is based on the assumption that the edge profiles of the perforations are sharp. In other words, the angle between the plate surface and the inner surface of the perforation is 90 ◦;. This case is not very practical to achieve in mass production of MPPs, since the perforations are formed by drilling and / or punching in manufacturing. To investigate {{the effect of}} the edge profile on the performance of the MPP, we design samples with different edge profiles such as sharp and 45 ◦-chamfers on both edges.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} theory of {{resonances}} of time harmonic fields in resonating cavities, based on the Helmholtz equation, we have presented the principle of operation of the Reverberation Chamber (RC) : a n electrically large cavity where the resonant frequencies are changed with a tunerin order to obtain a uniform maximum electric field, within a time cycle. This type of test facility {{can be used as}} an alternative to the conventional <b>Semi-Anechoic</b> <b>Room</b> (SAR) for testing the immunity of electronic equipment to high intensity radiofrequency fields. But, at the opposite of the deterministic environment present in a SAR, the RC generates electromagnetic waves with a direction of incidence, a polarization and a time of arrival on the Equipment Under Test (EUT) that are varying randomly in time. The presented research had two objectives: the firstis to conceive, design and evaluate the efficiency of innovative and less cumbersome tuning systems and the second is to compare the severity level of RC and SAR for immunity testing by using both facilities available at Royal Military Academy (RMA). The first innovative tuning method (RAIL) we have conceived, designed and assessed in the RC at RMA is a dynamic source-mode tuning based on a translation movement of two broadband antennas on two orthogonal rails. The efficiency analysis shows that it complies with the field uniformity requirement ofthe IEC 61000 - 4 - 21. The second innovative tuning method (STATIC) we have conceived and investigated in the same RC is based on a fixed network of sixteen static antennas where a limited subset of eight antennas is randomly activated by means of fast electronic switches. Tuning is obtained without any movement in the RC. The technological breakthrough is that important testing time reduction can be achievedwhen using the STATIC tuner instead of using conventional mechanical tuners. Using the RAIL tuner, we develop a new method for measuring the radiation efficiency of an antenna in a RC without the need of a reference antenna. In order to perform a severity comparison of the immunity testing to Electric fields between a SAR and a RC, a Canonical Equipment Under Test (CEUT) has been designed, developed and manufactured at the RMA. It is an original realization with no equivalent in the EMC community. An unexpected development of this initiative lies in the fact that it has been accepted as reference material for interlaboratory testing in the field of radiated immunitytesting to RF, according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 3. Moreover, EMC testing laboratories in Germany and Japan have shown interest and have participated inthis campaign. The comparison of radiatedimmunity testing performed both in a SAR and a RC has produced several interesting results. Applied to test RS 103 of the MIL-STD- 461 F, it meansthat with one aspect angle in a SAR, it is recommended to use from 20 to 30 tuner steps, in a RC, in order to achieve equivalence of testing results. For the IEC 61000 - 4 - 3, testing with 4 aspect angles in a SAR willneed from 40 to 60 tuner steps for equivalence. Finally, we have shown experimentally that, in a RC, spatial averages and time averages are equal; this is a characteristic of ergodic processes. This experimental demonstration of ergodicity establishes a scientific breakthrough since, as far as we know, there is no literature about this subject yet. From now on, we can say that the stochastic generation of an electric field in a RC is a stationary process and that various statistical parameters in its volume can be estimatedby measuring the time average in a fixed spatial point.

40|$|In a {{research}} of the World Health Organization (2011) it is shown that environmental noise is number two {{on the list of}} health risks. Environmental noise is linked to certain health conditions ranging from annoyance to heart attacks and is caused by the growing number of noise sources in the urban environment. An important aspect influencing the noise levels in an urban context are the hard, sound reflective, building materials that are mostly used. A recent study from Techen and Krimm (2014 a) indicates that surfaces like this can change the noise levels 3 to 8 decibel. To reduce these increased noise levels this research tries to find an answer to the following question: how can an existing façade be adapted {{in such a way that}} the impact of the noise reflected by it will be reduced? To answer this question a case study location in Delft is chosen: the Herman Gorterhof. At this location most of the direct sound is blocked, so the sound levels are mostly influenced by reflected sound waves. Based on prior research and on on-site measurements it’s concluded that the most important noise source for this location is traffic noise from the nearby road. This source produces the highest levels for the frequencies of 1000 and 2000 Hertz. In order to define potential approaches to reduce reflections which are influencing the sound levels a literature study is conducted. Sound can be reduced when or before it’s reaching the façade by noise barriers, sound absorbing materials or resonating sound absorbers. For the sound absorbing solutions it’s especially important to consider weather effects which might damage the used materials. When it’s impossible to use these reduction methods the impact of the sound reflection can be reduced by influencing the (direction) of the reflected sound. This can for example be done by introducing an angle or by scattering the sound waves. A computer simulation is done to further investigate the impact of sound reflections at the chosen location and to test the potential solutions. To validate this model the found values are compared to the actually measured sound levels. From the simulations it followed that the sound levels improve up to 17, 7 dB(A) when the façade completely consist of a (theoretical) 100 % absorbing material. When looking at more realistic façade solutions to prevent reflections, façades which are reflecting the sound waves upward seem to perform the best. A solution like this has an average improvement of 5 dB(A) which is similar to the impact of the theoretical 100 % absorbing solution. To investigate the best performing façade solutions in more detail scale model measurements are used. For these measurements a simplified 1 : 50 model is made from the chosen location and the possible façade solutions. The measurements are conducted in the small <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>room</b> at the faculty of Applied Physics at the TU Delft. To validate this model the found values are compared to both the values from the on-site measurements as well as the values found using the computer simulations. Besides investigating the sound levels inside the courtyard of the chosen location this scale model is also used to determine the impact of the potential solutions on sound diffraction over nearby buildings, into more quiet areas. From these measurements it followed that the solution which would be reflecting the sound upward did indeed perform the best when just looking at the improvements in the courtyard area. However, when looking at the diffraction it caused over nearby buildings this solution performed the worst. The sound absorbing solution performed the best since this solution only absorbs the sound waves, not (potentially) sending them towards more quiet areas. Based on this results it’s decided to further investigate three potential façade solutions: an absorbing one, a solution which would only reflect the sound upward at the two lowest floors, and the already mentioned sound upward reflecting solution. The reason to add the solution which would only reflect sound upward at the lowest floors was that it performed better than the solution which is just absorbing sound while the impact on the diffracted sound was lower than the more reflecting solution. Based on the conducted measurements and simulations three façade designs are made. The first one is a façade that focusses on applying as much absorption as possible. For this design absorbing materials are selected which are sufficiently impact and weather resistant so they can be applied at the building façade. A porous concrete-like solution is applied at the lowest two floors and the tower which houses the circulation area of the building, while a perforated sound absorber is being used as sound absorbing parapet on the balconies. The second design focusses on reflecting the sound upward and therefore uses mostly hard building materials like glass. At the lowest eight floors a certain angle is introduced in such a way that the sound will be reflected over the nearby buildings, away from the courtyard. To achieve this the balconies need to be extended and closed off with a glass structure. Finally the third design combines the absorbing and the upward reflecting solutions. At the lowest two floors the sound will be reflected upward and at the higher floors the perforated sound absorbing parapet solutions are used to absorb the sound. To determine the impact of the three different façade designs on the sound levels inside the courtyard and on the sound which is being diffracted over the nearby buildings final scale model measurements are conducted. Furthermore the three designs are also rated looking at their architectural impact, complexity, costs and reusability. Using this data the design combining the sound absorption and the sound reflection is selected as the best performing solution, taking the defined context into account. While it improves the sound levels less than the upward reflecting design it only has a minor influence on the diffracted sound. Furthermore this design is still relatively cheap and easily constructed when being compared to the completely reflecting design. It’s expected that this design will on average improve the sound levels inside the investigated courtyard area 5 dB(A) with local improvements up to even 10 dB(A).
