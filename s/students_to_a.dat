25|$|There {{were very}} radical {{attempts}} at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose philosophiæ magister-degree {{being the only}} one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749–1750, but the radical suggestion of binding <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared {{to those of the}} 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the {{university}} made proposals to significantly develop Didsbury, bringing the School of Health, Psychology and Social Care and the Institute of Education onto the Didsbury site, after {{the closure of}} the Elizabeth Gaskell campus. Plans involved the creation of £19 million multi-storey teaching blocks and upgraded buildings, and improved access to facilities such as the library and sports centre. The plans were criticised by local residents, whose main concern was parking, since the plans could lead to 1900 new students on site and 240 new staff. By 2008, plans had changed and it was decided to close the Didsbury campus and move the 2740 <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new facility in Hulme, later named Birley Fields. This new campus, close to the All Saints campus in the city centre, was designed to replace all of {{the university}}'s other Manchester campuses, with funds arising from the land that was sold off. Reactions to the announced closure were mixed; local traders and businesses were worried {{about the impact of the}} loss of students, but many residents supported the move, especially those who had opposed expansion. The Didsbury campus finally closed in August 2014, and the new £140 million Birley Fields campus opened on 2 October 2014, after two years of construction. In total, the university spent £350 million on investing in new facilities at Birley Fields, as well as the All Saints and Cheshire campuses.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Puyi {{married his}} fourth wife, a 15-year-old student named Li Yuqin, {{who was a}} Han Chinese from Changchun, Jilin. She was {{designated}} as Puyi's Concubine Fu (福貴人). In February 1943, school principal Kobayashi and teacher Fujii of the Nan-Ling Girls Academy took ten girl <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> photography studio for portraits. Three weeks later, the school teacher and the principal visited Li Yuqin's home and told her Puyi ordered {{her to go to}} the Manchukuo palace to study. She was first taken directly to Yasunori Yoshioka who thoroughly questioned her. Yoshioka then drove her back to her parents and told them Puyi ordered her to study at the palace. Money was promised to the parents. She was subjected to a medical examination and then taken to Puyi's sister Yunhe and instructed in palace protocol. Two years later when Manchukuo collapsed, Li Yuqin shared a train with Empress Wanrong, who was experiencing opium withdrawal symptoms at the time. They were both arrested by the Soviets and sent to a prison in Changchun. Li Yuqin was released in 1946 and sent back home. She worked in a textile factory while she studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 1955 she began visiting Puyi in prison. After applying to the Chinese authorities for a divorce, the government responded on her next prison visit by showing her to a room with a double bed and ordered her to reconcile with Puyi, and she said the couple obeyed the order. She divorced Puyi in May 1957. She later married a technician, and had two sons. During the Cultural Revolution she became a target for attack by the Red Guards because she used to be Puyi's concubine. She died of liver problems in 2001.|$|E

500|$|In {{the preface}} to The Man-Eating Myth, Arens notes that he was first {{inspired}} to begin a fuller investigation of cannibalism while teaching an introductory course on anthropology at Stony Brook University, New York.

Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater extent than those which he was then lecturing on, and so undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.|$|E
500|$|The Tao Te Ching, {{often called}} simply Laozi after its reputed author, {{describes}} the Dao (or Tao) {{as the source}} and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being {{the root of all}} things. [...] People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). [...] Many act [...] "unnaturally", upsetting the natural balance of the Dao. The Daodejing intends to lead <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "return" [...] to their natural state, in harmony with Dao. Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.|$|E

[...] The college maintains a number of combined degree programs, allowing students to attend graduate or professional school in lieu of senior year.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became {{involved}} increasingly with educational work {{in schools and}} colleges, and in late 1931 accepted a year's appointment for 1932–33 as [...] professor of music at New York University (NYU). In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading [...] "A General Study of the Manifold Nature of Music", which introduced his <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide range of ancient and modern works. On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by Duke Ellington and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired Ellington's music, seeing [...] harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic appointment, and refused all offers of honorary degrees. His New York lectures {{became the basis for}} a series of radio talks which he gave for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934–35; these were later summarised and published [...] as Music: A [...] Commonsense [...] View of All Types. [...] In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen International Music Camp, and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.|$|E
500|$|The {{university}} {{passed a}} statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level; {{for a brief}} period in the early 1900s, this allowed the [...] "steamboat ladies" [...] to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin. The first four women's colleges were established through the efforts of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (AEW). Lady Margaret Hall (1878) was followed by Somerville College in 1879; the first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop. The first two colleges for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886), St Hilda's (1893) and St Anne's College (1952). In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege, however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations. On 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. However, before the 1970s all Oxford colleges were for men or women only, so that the number of women was limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.|$|E
