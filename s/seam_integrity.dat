50|$|The {{requirements}} for double seam examinations are specified in 21 CFR Part 113.60(a)(1). The regulation states that teardown examinations shall {{be performed by}} a trained closure technician at intervals of sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. The teardown examinations shall {{be made on the}} packer's end double seams on at least one can from each seaming head to ensure maintenance of <b>seam</b> <b>integrity.</b> Sufficient frequency is defined in the regulation as intervals not to exceed 4 hours (operational time).|$|E
5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{states that}} the can manufacturer is responsible for providing the can filler with guidelines and specifications for the can seam: [...] "Can seam guidelines (specifications) are provided to the low acid canned food manufacturer by the supplier of the container and end being used. The guidelines detail the measurements, in thousands of an inch, of each attribute of the double seam for both {{the first and second}} seaming operations. They also provide a set-up aim or ideal starting dimensions for the set up of the seamer. The operating limits set the range for good practice." [...] While specifying these guidelines is important, the plant is responsible for the double seam quality: [...] "It is extremely important to understand that seam guidelines by themselves cannot be used for determining the quality of a double seam. The seam guidelines are to be used in setting up the double seams initially and maintaining <b>seam</b> <b>integrity</b> during production. Final acceptability of the double seam should be based on total evaluation of the seam by a qualified person and not on dimensions alone. Good seaming practice requires constant visual examination, frequently scheduled tear-down evaluation, machine maintenance, and immediate correction of unacceptable conditions." [...] The regulation also states that if the double seams do not meet the guidelines, the can filler plant [...] "must know what steps to take to correct the condition".|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{weld seams}} are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal weld seams {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these weld seams. In our research, {{the concept of a}} weld <b>seam</b> <b>integrity</b> indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the weld <b>seam</b> <b>integrity</b> indicator and thus to improved weld seam properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal weld seam is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation of these weld seams through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the weld seam indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to weld seam formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that weld seam formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior weld seams, associated with low values of the weld <b>seam</b> <b>integrity</b> indicator. Through further elaboration of the concepts presented in this work, the weld <b>seam</b> <b>integrity</b> indicator is to be developed, with the future aim of predicting the weld seam performance through finite element simulations.

40|$|Blade design aspects most {{affecting}} producibility {{and means}} of measurement and control of length, scallop, fullness and straightness requirements and tolerances were extensively considered. Alternate designs of the panel seams and edge reinforcing members are believed to offer advantages of <b>seam</b> <b>integrity,</b> producibility, reliability, cost and weight. Approaches to and requirements for highly specialized metalizing methods, processes and equipment were studied and identified. Alternate methods of sail blade fabrication and related special machinery, tooling, fixtures and trade offs were examined. A preferred and recommended approach is also described. Quality control plans, inspection procedures, flow charts and special test equipment associated with the preferred manufacturing method were analyzed and are discussed...|$|E
