5|$|From May until August 1910, {{the forest}} reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's {{resources}} {{as the first}} acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is {{the position of the}} United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed <b>standoffs</b> were avoided narrowly several times.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{little was}} agreed upon and the {{agreement}} was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC's interest {{in the region and}} the first EC Ministerial Conference on Yugoslavia was held in The Hague on 10 July. The ECMM helped calm several <b>standoffs</b> around military barracks in Slovenia and facilitated negotiations between Slovene authorities and the JNA regarding the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening {{the agreement was}} signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement. The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September. By mid-September, the war had escalated as the Croatian National Guard and police blockaded the JNA barracks and the JNA embarked on a campaign against Croatian forces.|$|E

Both teams continued to struggle on offense, until New York linebacker Jacquian Williams stripped the ball from San Francisco wide receiver Kyle Williams after a punt return. The Giants recovered the ball at the 49ers 24-yard line, setting up a 31-yard field goal attempt by Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes. Unlike Cundiff earlier that day, Tynes' kick was successful, giving the Giants a 20–17 victory.|$|E

25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, {{there is no}} {{substitute}} for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four <b>standoffs,</b> which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|E
25|$|During the Drumcree <b>standoffs,</b> loyalist militants {{publicly}} {{supported the}} Orangemen and launched waves of violence across NI in protest at the Orange march being blocked. They smuggled homemade weaponry to Drumcree, apparently unhindered by the Orangemen, and attacked police lines. Members of the UDA/UFF appeared at Drumcree with banners supporting the Orangemen. Portadown Orange Lodge {{said it could}} not stop such people from gathering, but added that it welcomed any support. Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright was frequently seen at Drumcree {{in the company of}} Harold Gracey, head of Portadown Orange Lodge.

25|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear-Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. Trouble flared up again when the mutineers, believing they would be supported by the majority of the crew, again made their refusal to sail to the West Indies known, and began to agitate against the officers. Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the following day and after a period of tensions and <b>standoffs</b> between the officers and the crew, the mutiny collapsed when the marines obeyed orders to arrest the ringleaders.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Asian {{financial}} crisis, however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's movement developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand. Under the 2014 military junta, the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several <b>standoffs</b> between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day lock down of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the lock down the junta stated they will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo several charges as well.|$|E

He led many protests, several of them in Manama, putting him in <b>standoffs</b> with security forces. Rajab was named by Al Jazeera English the [...] "unofficial leader of the 14 February movement" [...] and The Atlantic labelled him [...] "the de-facto leader of Bahrain's resurgent uprising."

500|$|EarthBound {{was listed}} in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, where Christian Donlan {{wrote that the}} game is [...] "name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it's {{actually}} been played". Similarly, Eurogamer Simon Parkin {{described it as a}} [...] "sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti". Donlan called the game [...] "utterly brilliant" [...] and praised its overworld and battle system. Kotaku described aspects of the game's story, such as the [...] "Mr. Saturn coffee break", as [...] "poignant". Jeremy Parish of USgamer called EarthBound [...] "the all-time champion" [...] of self-aware games that [...] "warp ... perceptions and boundaries" [...] and break the fourth wall, citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game. He thought the final scene was [...] "perhaps the most clever and powerful moment in a clever and powerful game". David Sanchez of GameZone wrote that EarthBound [...] "went places no other game would" [...] in the 1990s or even in the present day, including [...] "trolling" [...] the player [...] "before trolling was cool". Author Hiromi Kawakami told Itoi that she had played the game [...] "about 80 times". GamesTM said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on [...] "personal experiences" [...] made it [...] "exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an indie hit". He called this accomplishment [...] "remarkable" [...] and credited Nintendo's commitment to the [...] "voices of creators". IGN's Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final boss fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game <b>standoffs</b> of all time" [...] and noted its emotional impact.

500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through {{a tour de force}} of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game <b>standoffs</b> of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious control freak with no regard for human life", Porky, {{by the end of the}} series' Mother 3.|$|E
