30|$|The {{finite element}} {{software}} is employed {{to calculate the}} stresses of the cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and the slotted flat diaphragm. When the frequency of alternating pressure load applied on them is 10  Hz and {{the magnitude of the}} load is 10  kPa, cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> has its maximum Von-Mises stress which is 0.036  kPa, and the slotted flat diaphragm is 0.249  kPa. That is, the cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is smaller than the slotted flat diaphragm in stress, so the cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> has a high reliability.|$|E
30|$|To {{solve the}} {{disadvantages}} of valve piezoelectric pump, such as valve’s large stress, {{easy to get}} damaged, low reliability of the pump, a cymbal-shaped slotted check valve is proposed to be applied in a piezoelectric pump. Based on the theoretical analysis of cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> {{it can be seen}} that the displacement of the diaphragm (flow rate of the piezoelectric pump) has a correlation with the height of cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this research, the {{structure}} {{design of the}} cymbal-shaped slotted valve is proposed, and working principle of the cymbal-shaped slotted valve piezoelectric pump is analyzed. After theoretically analyzing, the design parameters of the cymbal-shaped slotted valve are achieved. And then, through FEM (Finite Element Method) calculation, the maximum Von-Mises stress on cymbal <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is just 0.036  kPa, which is much smaller than that on the flat one. Finally, {{the performance of the}} cymbal-shaped slotted valve piezoelectric pump is tested to verify the validity of the valve.|$|E
40|$|In this study, MEMS high {{sensitive}} capacitive pressure sensor based on poly-silicon diaphragm {{have been designed}} and analysed by using COMSOL Multiphysics Software. Three sensor designs: clamped, 8 slotted and 4 slotted with and without Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) coating were tested and compared to understand the sensitivity and deflection of the sensors. The pressure sensor was designed to evaluate the pressure in ranges of 0 - 60 mmHg {{which is in the}} range of Intraocular Pressure (IOP) for glaucoma. The capacitive pressure sensor is design using different structures of the diaphragm and it is identified that 4 <b>slotted</b> square <b>diaphragms</b> gives the highest sensitivities amongst the presented design. By coating the <b>diaphragm</b> and adding <b>slots</b> into the <b>diaphragm,</b> the displacement improves while mechanical and capacitance sensitivities increase...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{one or more}} {{pieces of}} metal would be drilled with various sized holes. The stop could then be chosen by sliding the {{diaphragm}} to different positions in the lens <b>slot.</b> Such multi-aperture <b>diaphragms</b> were also {{sometimes referred to as}} Waterhouse stops, due to their operation based on sliding through a slot in the lens barrel.|$|R
30|$|Valve {{piezoelectric}} pumps {{usually have}} larger flow rate {{than that of}} valveless ones. However, the traditional cantilever valve easily induces stress concentration which impacts the reliability of pumps. Therefore, a cymbal-shaped slotted check valve is proposed to be applied in a piezoelectric pump {{in order to reduce}} the stress concentration of the valve and thus improve the reliability of the piezoelectric pump. The structure and working principle of the piezoelectric pump are analyzed; the stress analysis of the cymbal-shaped slotted valve diaphragm is conducted. In addition, finite element software is employed to analyze the difference of the Von-Mises stress between the cymbal-shaped <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and the slotted flat diaphragm. The simulation results show that, the Von-Mises stress of cymbal-shaped <b>slotted</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is smaller than that of the slotted flat one. Furthermore, the cymbal-shaped slotted valve piezoelectric pump is also fabricated, and flow rate experiment is performed. The experimental results indicate that the flow rate of piezoelectric pump working in low frequencies (0  Hz < f <  50  Hz) is larger than that working in high frequencies (200  Hz < f <  2000  Hz). When driven at voltage of 160  V and frequency of 5  Hz, the pump reaches its maximum flow rate of 6.6  g/min. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the cymbal-shaped slotted check valve. This research can effectively solve the problem of stress concentration of valve piezoelectric pumps and is helpful for improving the reliability of them.|$|E
