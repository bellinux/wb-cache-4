40|$|The room {{temperature}} morphology of quench-cooled isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and its development were investigated by scanning transmittance electron microscopy (STEM) and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). STEM dark field images revealed that within an amorphous matrix there exist microcrystalline regions, 160 A in size on the average, having the $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form. Regions of lower crystalline order were also observed which have an $ alpha$-monoclinic crystal form that has a substantially longer b crystallographic axis. DSC studies indicate that during quench-cooling to the glassy state iPP samples attain a low degree of crystalline order to an extent that depends on sample mass. Upon heating from the glassy state, an exothermic transition is observed following the glass transition temperature which corresponds {{to the formation of}} the {{room temperature}} morphology. Cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to monitor morphological changes in the purely crystalline phase of quench-cooled iPP films and <b>spunbonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> during annealing. The spectra were obtained using a pulse sequence that incorporates a delay period with a reduced spin locking field prior to cross polarization. Morphological changes occurring within the purely crystalline phase of iPP were related to observations made by DSC. Upon annealing, the CP/MAS NMR spectrum of the purely crystalline phase of both iPP samples changed by a redistribution in the intensity of the various peaks within a given carbon resonance. This redistribution of intensity was found to reflect the conversion from the $ alpha sb 1 $ to the $ alpha sb 2 $ monoclinic crystal forms. It is shown that the double melting endotherm observed by DSC for the <b>spunbonded</b> <b>fabrics</b> is due to the exothermicity which is associated with this conversion. It is concentrated in the temperature region between 156 and 163 $ sp circ$C. The tensile properties of the <b>spunbonded</b> iPP <b>fabrics</b> and fibers were enhanced by the dispersion of a silica/silicone additive and by changing the resin characteristics. This additive acts as a nucleating agent for iPP under isothermal crystallization conditions. This nucleating ability manifests itself in smaller crystal sizes and higher nucleation densities in the iPP fibers and bond points. The improved tensile properties are attributed to the smaller crystal sizes which form a more homogeneously dispersed crystalline phase in the amorphous phase as well as {{to increase the number of}} load-bearing tie molecules...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on {{all aspects of}} thermally point bonded nonwovens has led to considerable improvements {{in the understanding of}} material requirements for these nonwovens, the changes that occur during bonding and the resultant deterioration of the mechanical properties of the nonwoven materials. This paper addresses how one may use a bicomponent fiber technology to overcome the shortcomings of the thermal bonding and obtain high strength <b>spunbond</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In particular, we present the utility of islands-in-the-sea (I/S) bicomponent fibers for optimizing the strength of thermally bonded fabrics. To examine the role of various bonding temperatures on the fabric performance, pre-consolidated webs were formed and subsequently, thermally bonded. Thus, any influence introduced by potential variations in the structure was minimized. Point-bonded bicomponent samples made up of nylon- 6 (N 6) as the islands and low density polyethylene (PE) as the sea showed great promise with respect to their mechanical properties, suggesting that the use of bicomponent fibers can be beneficial for strength optimization of thermally bonded spunbond nonwovens...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{simulation of}} the production of <b>spunbond</b> nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> is a new and emerging field of research. Visualising the outcome of these simulations, large sets of thin randomly oriented fibres, {{has not yet been}} scientifically covered. We apply a set of visualisation techniques for the analysis of the simulation data using established methods such as surface reconstruction, parallel coordinates, and colour coding of specific physical fibre properties. Furthermore, we propose a model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics to create a virtual preview of the simulated nonwoven fabric. This is a topic that has not been addressed before. Our model for realistic rendering is based solely on the output of the simulation and relies on existing techniques for realistic rendering of fibrous materials. We use modern programmable graphics hardware to ensure interactive frame rates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spunbond,</b> {{nonwoven}} <b>fabrics</b> {{consisting of}} polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which meet food contact requirements, {{may be used}} as pouch materials for products containing food and/or flavor ingredients that are held in the mouth. In these situations ingestion may occur, resulting in exposure to the fabric and po-tentially antimony, a catalyst used in polyethylene terephthalate. To assess potential adverse effects when such a material is in-gested, a 13 week dietary study in Sprague-Dawley CD rats and a Salmonella reverse mutation assay were conducted. Ground fab-ric was dosed at target concentrations of 0. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 5 % in the dietary study. Antimony trioxide in the polyethylene tereph-thalate was used to determine the test material concentration in the diet and was also assessed for bioavailability. Detectable lev-els of antimony were found in 2 / 20 blood samples of control rats, and in 20 / 20 high-dose group rats. No toxicologically relevant treat...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{oil spills}} into aquatic environments can have catastrophic {{environmental}} effects. First responders to oil spills {{along the coast}} of the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States have used <b>spunbond</b> nylon <b>fabric</b> bags and fences to separate spilled oil and oil waste from contaminated water. Low area mass density spunbond nylon is capable of sorbing more than 16 times its mass in low viscosity crude oil and more than 26 times its mass in higher viscosity gear lube oil. Nylon bags separated more than 95 % of gear lube oil contaminate from a 4. 5 % oil-in-water emulsion. Field testing of spunbond nylon fences by oil spill first responders has demonstrated the ability of this material to contain the oily contaminate while allowing water to flow through. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of nylon as an oil filter {{is due to the fact}} that it is both more oleophilic and more hydrophilic than other commonly used oil separation materials. The nylon traps oil droplets within the fabric or on the surface, while water droplets are free to flow through the fabric to the water on the opposite side of the fabric...|$|R
40|$|Separation of {{photocatalyst}} nanoparticles is {{a problem}} impeding widespread application of photocatalytic oxidation. As sedimentation of photocatalyst particles is facilitated by their flocculation, the influence of common constituents of biologically pretreated wastewaters (NaCl, NaHCO 3, and their combination with humic acid sodium salt) on flocculation was tested by the pipet method. Results showed {{that the impact of}} these substances on TiO 2 nanoparticle flocculation is rather complex and strongly affected by pH. When humic acid was present, TiO 2 particles did not show efficient flocculation in the neutral and slightly basic pH range. As an alternative to photocatalyst separation by sedimentation, precoat vacuum filtration with powdered activated carbon (PAC) over low-cost <b>spunbond</b> polypropylene <b>fabrics</b> was tested in the presence of two PAC types in aqueous NaCl and NaHCO 3 solutions as well as in biologically treated greywater and in secondary municipal effluent. PAC concentrations of ≥ 2 [*]g/L were required in order to achieve a retention of nearly 95 % of the TiO 2 nanoparticles on the fabric filter when TiO 2 concentration was 1 [*]g/L. Composition of the aqueous matrix and PAC type had a slight impact on precoat filtration. PAC precoat filtration represents a potential pretreatment for photocatalyst removal by micro- or ultrafiltration...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{simulation}} {{is widely}} used in the industry for the optimisation of production processes. The computational simulation of the production of <b>spunbond</b> nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> is a new and emerging field of research. This thesis covers the development of analysis techniques for several aspects of simulated nonwoven fabrics, i. e. fabrics that are made of randomly oriented fibres. We propose a set of visualisation techniques including colour coding, parallel coordinates, tangent colour mapping, and surface reconstruction {{for the analysis of}} the simulation data. Furthermore, we propose a model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics {{in order to create a}} virtual preview of the simulated nonwoven fabric. This is a topic that has not been addressed before. The rendering model is based based solely on the output of the simulation and relies on existing techniques for realistic rendering of fibrous materials - covering shading, self-shadowing, depth-sorting, and antialiasing. Both aspects, information visualisation and realistic rendering, are required to run at interactive framerates, thus they are accelerated by exploiting modern programmable graphics hardware. As a result, we have achieved major improvements over the previously used visualisation approaches, offering a unified solution for the interactive visualisation and exploration of simulated nonwoven fabrics. We had to apply our model for realistic rendering of nonwoven fabrics to artificial datasets due to restrictions of existing datasets. The results are promising, although our model for realistic rendering of nonwovens still has to prove itself on future simulation results...|$|R
40|$|New {{nonwovens}} {{applications in}} areas such as filtration require a media designed to particular pore size specifications in the 3 to 20 micron range. The purpose of this work was to develop a basis by which to design and construct a fabric with given pore size specifications. While doing so we have provided a validation for two different mathematical models. We have also found that bicomponent <b>spunbonded</b> islands-in-the-sea nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> can be designed very precisely to achieve target pore diameters and porosity. Mathematical models can be used to develop fabric specifications in the standard manufacturing terms of basis weight and fiber diameter. Measured mean flow pore diameters for the test fabrics showed excellent correlation to targeted mean flow pore diameters for both models. The experimental fit to the Bryner model is the better of the two, but requires specification of fabric thickness in addition to basis weight and fiber diameter to achieve actual mean pore diameters that closely match target values. Experimental validation of the influence of fabric thickness on the mean flow pore diameter at constant basis weight and fiber diameter remains open for further investigation. In addition, achieving complete separation of the island and sea polymers along with unbundling of the island fibers remain areas for improvement...|$|R
40|$|Wettable {{nonwoven}} topsheets {{are traditionally}} <b>spunbond</b> polypropylene nonwoven <b>fabrics.</b> The fluid handling performance of hydroentangled greige cotton nonwovens was studied {{to determine their}} suitability for topsheet applications based upon analysis of fluid rewet, strikethrough, and acquisition properties; and the relative contributions of nonwoven cotton’s cellulosic and wax components to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluid transport properties are addressed. It was observed that mechanically cleaned greige cotton nonwovens exhibit certain fluid handling properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % greige cotton and 50 : 50 blends of greige cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets. The surface polarity, swelling, and wettability values obtained from electrokinetic and water contact angle analysis were found to be in agreement with the hydrophobic polypropylene topsheets. Additionally, comfort assessment was undertaken based upon fabric handle profiles using the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System, which is an objective evaluation based on the quantification of fabric buckling deformations. Of the fabrics studied in this work, 50 : 50 greige cotton/polypropylene hydroentangled fabrics were the softest as determined by the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System and exhibited fluid handling properties consistent with the requirements of commercial topsheets...|$|R
30|$|Plasma {{treatments}} are gaining {{popularity in the}} textile industry due to their numerous advantages over conventional wet processing techniques. In this study, nonwoven <b>fabrics</b> <b>spunbond</b> polypropylene, polyester basis weight of 25  g/m 2 and microporous PTFE film were used to develop tri-laminate antiviral surgical gown. The outer layer of spunbond polypropylene was treated with plasma enhanced fluorocarbon. The plasma treated polypropylene was also treated with titanium nano dispersion finish in a single bath pad-dry-cure method. The pore sizes of nonwoven fabrics were characterized using tri-nocular microscope. The titanium nano finished polypropylene was characterized by scanning electron microscope. The tri-laminate surgical gown was developed with outer layer of plasma treated polypropylene, middle layer of PTFE and inner layer of polyester nonwoven. Liquid barrier properties of surgical performance were analyzed by viral penetration, antibacterial, spray impact penetration, hydrostatic resistance, tensile properties and moisture vapour permeability to estimate their suitability for antiviral surgical gown. It is observed that plasma treated gown shows 99.04 % bacterial reduction as compared to untreated, thus providing barrier against microbes. The plasma treatment does not alter the weight and tensile properties of surgical gown. The developed plasma enhanced flurocarbon treated tri-laminate surgical gown offer sufficient liquid barrier properties for level 4 protection as per Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation classification. Moisture vapour transfer rate of plasma treated tri-laminate gown decreased by 21 % in comparison with untreated nonwoven gown.|$|R
40|$|This article gives {{information}} additional to {{the existing}} editions about drying and keeping herbarium between the spunbond sheets, the approach not mentioned in Kew’s «The herbarium handbook». The invention was patented: Patent no. 71212, Russian Federation, priority number 2007137443 of 09. 10. 2007. <b>Spunbond,</b> nonwoven polymeric <b>fabric,</b> allows to introduce technologies which might exclude paper and other moisture absorptive materials from the process of herbarium making. The idea of the new way of drying plants for the herbarium consists in creating thin air linen around the plant in the herbarium press {{with the use of}} spunbond. Thanks to the free air access, plants dry very quickly and stay flat at the same time. The plants are dried in the herbarium press with the use of black spunbond, with the density from 60 grams per square meter to 150 grams per square meter, instead of usual newspapers. In 2009 - 2011 Multi-purpose Herbarium Press was tried out in Central Russia, In the Northern Ural, Northern Africa and France. In all these parts of the world scientists were absolutely satisfied with the results. Spunbond can also be used for keeping the herbarium. It lasts longer and is cheaper than paper. It doesn’t break into small pieces, doesn’t absorb moister from the outside, doesn’t deteriorate because of the sun, and cannot be damaged by insects. The use of spunbond when making herbarium allows to avoid using wood (shelves and cupboards) and paper in the rooms where herbariums are kept, because they are kept on metal shelves. This will help to avoid a big number of pests, which is especially a big problem for tropical herbariums...|$|R
