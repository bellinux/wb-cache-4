5|$|The Upanishad extols Shiva, aloneness and renunciation, {{describes}} the inner state of {{man in his}} personal <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> detached from the world. The text is notable for presenting Shaivism in Vedanta, discussing Atman (Soul, Self) {{and its relation to}} Brahman, and Self-knowledge as the path to kaivalya (liberation).|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> {{is thought}} to have begun at this time. He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal. He {{underwent}} an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. Inwardly, he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E

5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being {{performed}} in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.|$|E

25|$|Similar to yoga, {{learning}} the Tree of Life {{is not so}} much Magick as it is a way to map out one's spiritual universe. As such, the adept may use the Tree to determine a destination for astral travel, to choose which gods to invoke for what purposes, et cetera. It also {{plays an important role in}} modeling the <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey,</b> where the adept begins in Malkuth, which is the every-day material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at Kether, the sphere of Unity with the All.|$|E
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath, {{being an}} introvert, {{was a man}} of few words and had a {{straightforward}} demeanor. He is known to have always shunned publicity and covered himself with anonymity. As such, various religious commentators along with his devotees have found it difficult to classify his <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> into a particular school of Indian philosophical thought. Its widely believed that he must have followed the tenets of trika doctrine of advaita (non-dual) Kashmir Shaivism (in which, the Goddess Bhairavi-Aghoreshwari is enthroned above God Bhairava and is the main ideal of worship) with jnana (knowledge), iccha (will) and kriya (action) having had a dominating influence on him.|$|E

50|$|What these sculptures symbolised to the Olmecs is not clear.

25|$|Todd's <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> was crafted {{as a man}} {{who wanted}} {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E
25|$|Following Darwin's {{marriage}} to Emma in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. Unitarianism emphasised inner feeling which overrode {{the authority of}} religious texts or doctrine, and her beliefs resulted from intensive study and questioning. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works {{as well as those}} of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose Phases of faith described a <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.|$|E
25|$|In Buddhism, Indra {{has been}} a popular deity, {{referred}} by many names and particularly Shakra (Pali: Sakka). He is featured in Buddhism somewhat differently than Hinduism, such as being shown as less war oriented and one paying homage to the Buddha. Indra rules over the much sought Devas realm of rebirth within the Samsara doctrine of Buddhist traditions. However, like the Hindu texts, Indra also is a subject of ridicule and reduced to a figurehead status in Buddhist texts, shown as a god that suffers rebirth and redeath. In the Jainism traditions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, Indra is the king of gods {{and a part of}} Jain rebirth cosmology. He is also the god who appears with his wife Indrani to celebrate the auspicious moments {{in the life of a}} Jain Tirthankara, an iconography that suggests the king and queen of gods reverentially marking the <b>spiritual</b> <b>journey</b> of a Jina.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurrent}} {{and important}} element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic <b>spiritual</b> <b>journeys,</b> or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally {{to the point of}} immortality.

50|$|The spiritual use of {{caffeine}} and nicotine as stimulants {{is well known}} in the Hasidic communities.
