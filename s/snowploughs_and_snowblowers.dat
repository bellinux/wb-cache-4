50|$|In late 2006, {{all three}} sets {{underwent}} modifications at JR East's Kōriyama Works {{to reinforce the}} front end <b>snowploughs</b> <b>and</b> add protection plates to underfloor equipment.|$|R
50|$|These {{sets were}} built {{for use on}} the Kosei Line, due to the heavy amounts of {{snowfall}} in the region. They feature semi automatic doors, <b>snowploughs</b> <b>and</b> improved brakes. Some trains were also transferred to the Sagano Line.|$|R
50|$|Inaugurated in 1994, {{the museum}} {{comprises}} 23 standard gauge locomotives, 10 narrow gauge locomotives, 3 <b>snowploughs</b> <b>and</b> 2 steam cranes. 7 of these locomotives are active, {{and are used}} {{on a variety of}} special trains for enthusiasts and other groups.|$|R
5000|$|Takasu is {{also home}} to one of Honda's [...] "Proving Grounds". Honda tests new {{products}} to see how they stand up to the harsh winter conditions found in central Hokkaido. The other Honda development facility is found in Tochigi Prefecture. Honda not only test cars at the Takasu Proving Grounds, but bikes <b>and</b> <b>snowblowers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On {{the rescue}} train were {{a crew of}} BTF staff—director Kennith Fairbairn, {{cameraman}} Robert Paynter and assistant David Watkin—who had been hurriedly assigned by producer Edgar Anstey to travel to [...] to join the <b>snowplough</b> <b>and</b> a gang of fifty men travelling up the line to free the train.|$|R
25|$|Land Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, <b>snowploughs,</b> <b>and</b> six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.|$|R
50|$|However, an {{avalanche}} knocks Tillie out cold. Eric is woken up by a thunderstorm and {{is worried about}} Tillie and the birthday train. After Tillie regains consciousness, she pulls the train out of the snow using her cowcatcher as a <b>snowplough</b> <b>and</b> down the mountain {{before they reach the}} town, much to Eric's delight and Jill's amazement. The film ends with Tillie, who although very tired from her long and adventurous journey over the mountain, is very proud and happy and tells her best friend Chip that she did what she could.|$|R
50|$|Snow and ice removal also {{decreases}} road slipperiness; <b>snowploughs</b> <b>and</b> snow blowers {{can remove}} the snow {{from the road}} surface while gritters drop road salt and sand, which both melts the snow and ice from the road surface, and provide a rougher surface to grip onto. However, in dry conditions, sand and salt on the road surface can themselves increase road slipperiness and pose a danger to road traffic, and therefore, roads are cleared by street sweepers after roadworks and gritting {{to make sure that}} all the loose material is cleared from the road surface.|$|R
50|$|Tb is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive used by Banverket of Sweden for line service <b>and</b> <b>snowploughing.</b> Ten locomotives were built for Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) in 1969-70 by Nydquist & Holm (NOHAB) for combined freight <b>and</b> <b>snowploughing</b> service, along with 20 smaller Tc locomotives. When Banverket was demerged in 1988 the Tb {{were transferred to}} it.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, DeWitt Carl {{moved his}} service station to New Salem from Albany naming the New Salem Garage, and in 1961 he {{transformed}} {{it into an}} auto dealership dealing exclusively with Saabs. New Salem Garage Inc., even though no longer in New Salem continues to use the name, and remains the seventh oldest Saab dealership in the United States and the oldest continually family-owned and operated Saab dealership in the Northeastern US. In the early 1990s, the New Salem Garage moved four miles east to a Slingerlands address and the location in New Salem (with the same owners and still named the New Salem Garage, just as the car dealership) became a lawn and garden center specializing in Cub Cadet lawn tractors, mowers, <b>and</b> <b>snowblowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tc is a diesel-hydraulic {{locomotive}} used by Banverket of Sweden for line service <b>and</b> <b>snowploughing.</b> Twenty locomotives were built for Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) in 1969-71 by Nydquist & Holm for combined freight <b>and</b> <b>snowploughing</b> service, along with 10 larger Tb locomotives. When Banverket was demerged in 1988 the Tc {{were transferred to}} it. Since 1994 some of the units have {{been taken out of}} service.|$|R
50|$|Gilson Brothers Co. was a Wisconsin-based {{manufacturer}} of {{outdoor power equipment}} and recreational equipment. It operated independently between its inception in 1911 and its acquisition by Lawn-Boy in 1988. The company was probably most well known for its <b>snowblowers</b> <b>and</b> lawn tractors produced from the 1960s through the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The Snogo Snow Blower {{was used}} on the Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park, United States. Manufactured in 1932 by the Klauer Engineering Company of Dubuque, Iowa, the plow was {{actually}} a <b>snowblower</b> <b>and</b> featured advanced features such as an enclosed cab, four wheel drive and roll-up windows. It {{was used in the}} park until 1952.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers <b>and</b> <b>snowblowers,</b> have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|R
50|$|Two {{months after}} the book was published, a similar plane crash {{occurred}} at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow. During the acceleration before take-off, a French private jet collided with a <b>snowplough,</b> causing fire <b>and</b> destruction of the plane. All three crew members and the sole passenger, French businessman Christophe de Margerie, were killed.|$|R
50|$|The line {{operates}} two steam locomotives, No's 16, (SLM No.2871, built 1923) (See photograph above) and 17, (SLM No.3043, built 1925). They {{are painted}} {{in a dark}} green livery, lined red. They also have three electric locomotives, a Stadler built battery operated class Ta2/2 in red livery, which carries the identification VRB 1, and usually to be found shunting at Vitznau, a class He2/3, built in 1930 by SLM / MFO, again in red and numbered 8, which is the Arth <b>snowplough</b> locomotive, <b>and</b> a further class He2/2, in red livery and numbered 18, built by SLM in 1938 and which is usually based at Vitznau.|$|R
40|$|Gender {{differences}} in anthropological characteristics may influence success in adopting skiing skill if different teaching met¬hods are applied. This study aimed {{to determine the}} difference between the level of adopted skiing skill for female and male ski-be¬gin¬ners applying 2 different teaching programs. 126 subjects (30 females; 96 males), average age 23, 3 ± 1, 6 years participated in 7 days ski-school. Within the male and female group ski-teaching was carried out using 2 different methods: combination method [CM], which implies using of <b>snowplough</b> <b>and</b> parallel ski technique, and direct method [DM], where only parallel ski technique is used. Following the learning process, subjects were tested through 7 elements of skiing technique. For female subjects no diffe¬ren¬ce between two teaching models was recorded, while CM appeared to be more efficient for males in elements traversing to the right (p= 0, 03), short turn (p< 0, 05) and parallel turn (p= 0, 01). Through factor analysis 7 main components were extracted, the first being defined as total skiing knowledge [TSK]. TSK was then compared to two programs carried out on males and females. Diffe¬ren¬ce was determined in the level of TSK for male who learned through CM in comparison to the participants who were learning through the DM (p= 0, 01), while no difference in the same variable was determined for female. These findings lead to conclusion that using CM in men achieved better results compared to the DM. For the practice, it means that {{it is not necessary to}} separate ma¬le and female while forming ski groups for beginner skiers, since females will advance the same, regardless of the learning method...|$|R
5000|$|During a 2011 {{episode of}} Top Gear, James May drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a <b>snowplough</b> in Norway <b>and</b> commented: [...] "We {{all know that}} when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril. That's a rule of life." [...] Bovril reappeared in another episode of Top Gear {{in the form of}} Jeremy Clarkson's V8 Food Blender, wherein it was used to make a [...] "Man's V8 Smoothie" [...] {{complete}} with raw beef and a brick.|$|R
50|$|Arc Routing is {{the process}} of {{selecting}} the best path in a network based on the route. Contrary to normal routing problems, which usually involve mapping a route between nodes, arc routing focuses more heavily on the route itself. The goal of many arc routing problems is to produce a route with the minimum amount of dead mileage, while also fully encompassing the edges required. Examples of arc routing applications include garbage collection, road gritting, mail delivery, network maintenance, <b>and</b> <b>snowploughing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Newly manufactured, or {{modified}} war surplus, CMP trucks were used after 1945 in several European armies (e.g., the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Spain) {{and around the}} world (e.g., South Africa, Argentina, Jordan, South Vietnam, Malaya). CMP trucks were adapted after the war for a variety of civilian roles including forestry, grain transport, fire-fighting trucks, <b>and</b> <b>snowploughs.</b> In Malaysia, after the Malayan Emergency, many CMP trucks were converted to log transporters or off-road trucks in construction site with upgraded brake system and powerful engines.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{tips for}} snow removal using snow shovels, <b>snowblowers</b> <b>and</b> powered blades or {{sweepers}} {{are covered in}} this NebGuide. As the temperature drops and the grounds maintenance equipment is stored for the winter, position the snow removal equipment for quick access, and start thinking about snow removal safety. About half the accidents involving snow removal equipment happen to first-time users or those using the equipment {{for the first time}} each winter. Snow removal equipment falls in one of three groups: 1) the snow shovel, 2) the snow thrower or blower, and 3) the powered blade or sweeper...|$|R
5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment keyway {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot keyway in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a circular Woodruff cutter without any reliefs. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and keyway also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, <b>snowblowers</b> <b>and</b> marine propellers.|$|R
50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment <b>snowblowers</b> <b>and</b> grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R
50|$|In small {{two-stroke}} engines, the oil may be pre-mixed {{with the}} gasoline or fuel, {{often in a}} rich gasoline:oil ratio of 25:1, 40:1 or 50:1, and burned in use along with the gasoline. Larger two-stroke engines used in boats and motorcycles may have a more economical oil injection system rather than oil pre-mixed into the gasoline. The oil injection system is not used on small engines used in applications like <b>snowblowers</b> <b>and</b> trolling motors as the oil injection system is too expensive for small engines and would take up too much room on the equipment. The oil properties will {{vary according to the}} individual needs of these devices. Non-smoking two-stroke oils are composed of esters or polyglycols. Environmental legislation for leisure marine applications, especially in Europe, encouraged the use of ester-based two cycle oil.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century local trades and skills died out, the pub closed its doors, the joiner shut shop, the cobbler stopped making and {{repairing}} boots, the farrier shod the last horse and the smithy shut down the forge. Spinkie Den (see below) became overgrown and the only remaining shop closed in 1980. Machines were replacing people on farms and in other trades; paid manpower, so needed in March 1947 after one of the worst blizzards of the century to clear the roads out of the village, was replaced by <b>snowploughs.</b> Jobs disappeared <b>and</b> many people found work beyond the parish as cars replaced carts and the train. By 2001, despite some 1970s and 80s house building, there were only 410 in the village population and the school and church were the only public buildings.|$|R
50|$|Severe snow storms hit Angus in February 1947, and a {{passenger}} train was snowed in at Dronley cutting {{for over a}} week. Severe rationing still existed at the time, the roads were blocked, and the coal from the stranded engine was stolen, so that more had to be sent for to get the engine started again. There were also problems at Auchterhouse station, where snow drifts blocked the line under the road bridge. It {{would have been a}} massive task to dig out the drift, so a pair of large locomotives was sent from Newtyle, with a large snowplough attached. Although the engines managed to get some distance, the drivers soon realised they would need to get up speed before tackling the drifts. The engines <b>and</b> <b>snowplough</b> reversed back along the line and then charged. The force caused by the displaced snow as the engines passed through the station was so great that there was hardly a pane of glass left in the signal box or station buildings, and all the doors were smashed. It took over a week to repair the damage.|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) randomly heated and stirred by supernovae (SNe), with gravity, differential rotation and other {{parameters of the}} solar neighbourhood. Here we describe in detail both numerical and physical aspects of the model, including injection of thermal and kinetic energy by SN explosions, radiative cooling, photoelectric heating and various transport processes. With a three-dimensional domain extending 1 × 1 [*]kpc 2 horizontally and 2 [*]kpc vertically (symmetric about the galactic mid-plane), the model routinely spans gas number densities 10 − 5 – 102 [*]cm− 3, temperatures 10 – 108 [*]K and local velocities up to 103 [*]km[*]s− 1 (with Mach number up to 25). The working numerical resolution of 4 pc has been selected via simulations of a single expanding SN remnant, where we closely reproduce, at this resolution, analytical solutions for the adiabatic <b>and</b> <b>snowplough</b> regimes. The feedback of the halo on the disc cannot be captured in our model where the domain only extends to the height of 1 [*]kpc above the mid-plane. We argue that to reliably model the disc–halo connections would require extending the domain horizontally as well as vertically due to the increasing horizontal scale of the gas flows with height. ...|$|R
50|$|The Major range {{continued}} into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets {{that the company was}} forced to make. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog <b>and</b> <b>snowplough</b> (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of 'Esso' (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154). A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976. The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in 'Esso' livery (1157) or 'Gulf' livery (1160), and later in February 1982 in the livery of 'Guinness' (1169). A new Car Transporter (1159) was issued in November 1976 using the new Ford Transcontinental cab, and two more construction site orientated vehicles were issued, the JCB Crawler Loader (1110) in June 1976 and the Volvo BM Concrete Mixer (1156) in January 1977. The Dolphinarium (1164) was issued in April 1980 and featured the Berliet cab and a flatbed trailer which carried a large plastic water tank. Once the tank was filled a plunger attached to a jet nozzle within the tank could be pumped forcing two model dolphins attached to a plastic guide to jump {{out of the water and}} through the air.|$|R
