5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a <b>solar</b> <b>tower</b> or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

The company did not complete the project. They have plans for a similar plant in Arizona, and most recently (December 2013) in Texas, {{but there is no}} sign of 'breaking ground' in any of Enviromission's proposals.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{innovation}} {{has been}} the use of transpired collectors {{in place of the}} traditional glazing covers. Transpired collectors have efficiencies in the 60% to 80% range or three times the 25% efficiency measured with the greenhouse collectors. The large solar collector field can now be reduced to half or less making solar updraft towers much more cost effective. A patent has been granted on a <b>solar</b> <b>tower</b> system using transpired collectors.|$|E

The time history analyses are conducted in the finite element computer modeling program SAP 2000 using 30 historical ground motion records of varying frequency content.

Though at {{that time it was}} not yet technically possible to measure the gravitational redshift, important developments in solar and plasma physics were started here and the architect, Erich Mendelsohn, created with this peculiarly expressionistic tower a unique scientific building.|$|E
25|$|When a high-energy (TeV) gamma photon or cosmic ray {{interacts with}} the Earth's atmosphere, it may produce an electron-positron pair with {{enormous}} velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is {{used to determine the}} direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT), by experiments such as VERITAS, H.E.S.S., MAGIC. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment HAWC, the Pierre Auger Observatory and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large neutrino detectors, such as the Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and IceCube. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as STACEE, a former <b>solar</b> <b>tower</b> refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in New Mexico.|$|E
