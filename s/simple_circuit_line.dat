40|$|Classically in the {{transmission}} line matrix (TLM) method, the non-existence of a simple and straightforward circuital description of Maxwell equations has only been associated with three-dimensional (3 D) nodes describing general phenomena. On the contrary, except for some specific works available in the literature, a direct and <b>simple</b> transmission <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> is usually employed for describing the full node. This single circuit allows derivation of the scattering matrix and other quantities for nodes in two-dimensional (2 D) situations by simply using transmission and reflection coefficients for this circuit. The non-existence of such a simple circuital representation also for general 2 D and even for one-dimensional (1 D) TLM nodes is considered in this paper. As with the 3 D cases, the use of coupled transmission <b>line</b> <b>circuits</b> is required in general 2 D and 1 D cases, instead. Therefore, except for some particular situations, the classical transmission and reflection coefficients of a single transmission <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> are not valid for obtaining the scattering matrix or other quantities associated with these 2 D nodes...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{connecting}} line segments to form the boundary of a simple polygon [...] - a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit.</b> However, not every set of segments can be so connected. We present an O(n log n) -time algorithm to determine whether a set of segments, constrained so that each segment has at least one endpoint on the boundary of the convex hull of the segments, admits a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit.</b> Furthermore, this technique {{can also be used to}} compute a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> of minimum perimeter, or a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> that bounds the minimum area, with no increase in computational complexity. 1 Introduction It is always possible to construct a simple polygon passing through every point of a planar point set, and this task can be accomplished in Θ(n log n) time [12]. However, for a set of line segments, it is not always possible to obtain a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> passing through every line segment. An example is shown in Fig. 1. If we can find a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> that passes through every segment of a set of line [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Etectroless {{copper plating}} has been {{proposed}} as a method for producing <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in printed <b>circuit</b> boards (PCB) (1). Fabrication of PCB's by electroless plating offers an important advantage over existing fabrication methods that employ partial or full etching of a blanket copper layer to define the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> Because isotropic hemical etching processes areused to pattern PCB <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in current fabrication methods, the sidewalls of the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> are eroded as the desired thickness of copper {{is removed from the}} PCB substrate (1). Electroless deposition on the other hand is a totally additive process, so it is possible to form fine-pitch, high-aspect-ratio <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> with nearly rectangular cross sections. Electroless copper plating cannot be initiated on PCB sub-strates (typically glass fiber/epoxy composites) without first de-positing a catalyst onto the substrate surface. In a commo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the effects of electromagnetic transients generated by lightning on power distribution lines, considering the influence of tower footing resistance variation. Both types of lightning stroke, direct and induced, are considered. The model of a 20 kV three-phase overhead power distribution line is performed considering a <b>simple</b> <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> with triangle canopy and 50 / 8 mm 2 Ol-Al conductors. The model of the power distribution line is done considering a Multistory tower model. New concepts regarding lightning assessment through Electromagnetic Transients program and Finite Element Method are implemented. The simulations are performed based on a time domain analysis, considering the lightning stroke as an electromagnetic perturbation within frequency range of 10 - 100 kHz. A contribution to value creation is the design of the Multistory tower model, used for electromagnetic transients analysis for medium voltage power distribution lines. Excepting previous research, current study was done by considering the variation of tower footing resistance of the tower, between 4 - 35 ohms. The novelty of the study is {{the analysis of the}} dependency determined by the variation of tower footing resistance on the lightning surge propagation through power distribution networks and subsequent consumers...|$|R
40|$|As {{far back}} as Euclid's ruler and compass constructions, {{computation}} and geometry have been domains for the exploration and development of fundamental mathematical concepts and ideas. The invention of computers has spurred new research in computation, and now {{with a variety of}} applications couched in the fundamentals of Euclidean geometry, the study of geometric algorithms has again become a popular mathematical pursuit. In this thesis, the computational aspects of a fundamental problem in Euclidean geometry is examined. Given a set of line segments in the Euclidean plane, one is asked to connect all the segments to form a <b>simple</b> closed <b>circuit.</b> It is shown that for some sets of line segments it is impossible to perform this task. The problem of deciding whether a set of line segments admits a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> is proved to be NP-complete. A restriction of the class of permissible input allows a polynomial time solution to the <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> decision problem. It is also shown that a polynomial solution can be realized by restricting the class of <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> in the output. All the polynomial time decision algorithms exhibited deliver a <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> if one exists. Furthermore, in all cases the <b>simple</b> <b>circuit</b> obtained can be optimized with respect to area or perimeter...|$|R
