5|$|Diego López de Salcedo sailed from Santo Domingo {{with two}} ships, {{carrying}} {{a large number}} of soldiers, as well as provisions and clothing he intended to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colonists. Contrary winds delayed López de Salcedo off Jamaica for a month; he eventually disembarked in Trujillo on 26 October 1526, after a lengthy standoff with Saavedra that almost came to violence. At last Saavedra was convinced that López de Salcedo had been authorised directly by the crown, and allowed him to come ashore.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|E

5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nova {{decided to}} launch a British reprint of the American {{magazine}} Science Fiction Adventures, under the same title. The British Science Fiction Adventures lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. New Worlds, Nova's flagship title, and Science Fantasy were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though a switch from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for Science Fantasy. In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and {{in preparation for the}} change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, New Writings in SF, for publisher Dennis Dobson. Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from Michael Moorcock, published in the April 1964 New Worlds, asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher-paying U.S. magazines.|$|E

5|$|She {{was built}} by the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London as a speculative project, possibly to <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confederate Navy. The ship was laid down in 1863 and launched on 20 August 1864. Prussia instead purchased the ship on 20 August 1864, and commissioned her on 22 April 1865 as SMS Arminius. Delivery was delayed by the British government; the British were sympathetic to Denmark, which was then engaged in a war with Prussia and Austria. The British therefore prevented the ship from being delivered until after the war was concluded. The cost of the ship, which amounted to some 1,887,000gold marks, was paid in part by public donations. Arminius served as a harbor defense ship for six years, through 1871. Along with the ironclad ram , Arminius was the first armored warship acquired by the Prussian Navy.|$|E
5|$|With Tychus {{acting as}} the middleman, the Raiders embark {{on a series of}} {{missions}} to find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Along the way, they meet with Gabriel Tosh, a rogue Dominion psychic assassin known as a Spectre, and Ariel Hanson, a researcher on the Zerg and leader of a small farming colony. The Raiders perform missions to help Tosh procure the raw materials to train new Spectres as well as to aid Hanson as she attempts to secure her colonists who are caught between the Zerg infesting their planets and the Protoss attempting to eradicate the infestation. Horner also arranges a series of missions to undermine Mengsk, recovering intelligence information about his war crimes and broadcasting them across the Dominion. Finally, Zeratul sneaks aboard the Hyperion to deliver a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out Humanity and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, in Wings of Liberty, Kerrigan and the Zerg {{suddenly}} vanish {{from the}} Koprulu Sector, allowing the Protoss {{to once again}} take on a passive role in the galaxy. Meanwhile, Raynor forms a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor liberates the local population from Dominion control and also discovers a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. The Zerg suddenly reappear and overrun Mar Sara, forcing Raynor to arrange an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion. The Raiders embark {{on a series of}} missions to undermine Mengsk, stop frequent Zerg infestations on Terran worlds, gather psychic individuals for military assets, and find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Soon after, Zeratul delivers a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out the Terrans and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond. After collecting more artifact pieces, the Raiders forge an alliance with Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son, who is their secret benefactor from Moebius Foundation. After recovering the final artifact piece, Valerian and Raynor work together to invade the Zerg world of Char and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg at the cost of much of the Dominion fleet. An agent of Arcturus makes an attempt on Kerrigan's life, and Raynor defends her and takes her in for medical examination.|$|E
