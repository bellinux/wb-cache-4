5|$|As a freshman, Cabral was {{the second}} slowest runner on the soccer team. He tried out for track {{to work on his}} speed. At first he ran the 400 meters in 68 seconds. By the end of the spring, he broke 10 minutes in the 2 mile and was {{considering}} joining the cross country team instead of participating in his usual fall sport, soccer. In the summer of 2005, the cross country coach <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of encouragement.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{script for}} a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought {{the only person who}} could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E
5|$|In southeastern Asia, the durian {{has been}} {{cultivated}} for centuries {{at the village}} level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century. In My Tropic Isle, Australian author and naturalist Edmund James Banfield tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|Following Beauchamp's failed attempt, Cooke {{decided to}} lure Sharp {{to her house}} and kill him herself. Beauchamp wanted {{to take action to}} defend her honor, but she was {{determined}} to act for herself. He began teaching her to shoot a gun. Learning that Sharp was in Bowling Green, Cooke <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter condemning Beauchamp's attempt on his life and asking to see him again. Sharp suspected a trap, but replied that he would meet her at the planned time. Hoping to kill Sharp before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap. Beauchamp decided to finish his legal studies in Bowling Green and wait for Sharp to return there.|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Hansen was {{assigned}} to the Pirates-affiliated Hollywood Stars, an Open-classification minor league team based in Los Angeles. He appeared in three games, accumulating a 1.35 ERA on the mound and one hit in three at-bats at the plate. In one of those contests, he and Red Munger combined to hold the rival Los Angeles Angels to a 1–0 shutout. After being voted outstanding player of the week for his short tenure, Hansen voluntarily retired himself a second time after Pittsburgh Pirates president Branch Rickey refused to pay him $750 ($ today) that he was owed. The Pirates <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> contract to play for the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans, along with a paycheck, but he did not report, opting to remain retired.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had <b>sent</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E
5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and songs {{about him that}} became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.|$|E
5000|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th US president, was {{the first}} person to receive an honorary World Passport, and the second person after Garry Davis to be given one. Garry Davis <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> honorary World Passport in 1954 ...|$|R

50|$|Before 449 Aetius {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} with the Huns, allowing some of them to settle in Pannonia, along the Sava River; he also sent to Attila, the king of the Huns, a man called Constantius as a secretary. In 449, Attila was angry for an alleged theft of a golden plate, and Aetius <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> embassy under Romulus to calm him; Attila <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> as <b>a</b> present a dwarf, Zerco, whom Aetius gave back to his original owner, Aspar.|$|R
5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to open them officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Christmas card each year.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, {{known for}} his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world, and the animals who {{inhabited}} it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially {{in the name of}} progress. Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas together.|$|E
5|$|Richards' {{addiction}} to heroin delayed {{his arrival in}} Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> telegram asking him where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found {{in possession of a}} burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams of heroin in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.|$|E
6000|$|But one of {{them who}} was rather good-natured <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> old trunk with the message, 'Pack up!" [...] That was all very well, but {{he had nothing to}} pack up, so he got into the trunk himself.|$|R
5000|$|Guimard did {{not forget}} his debt to Horta; when the {{building}} was done, Guimard <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> album of the designs of the building with the inscription, “to an eminent master and friend, Victor Horta, affectionate homage from an admirer.” ...|$|R
60|$|Gambouge {{caught at}} the notion, and hurried off a courier to Rome ventre à terre. His Holiness {{agreed to the}} request of the petition, and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> absolution, written out with his own fist, and all in due form.|$|R
5|$|The {{constitution}} did {{not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
5|$|Zieten met his old teacher, Batthyány, {{during the}} First Silesian War and {{defeated}} {{him at the}} Battle of Rothschloss. The chivalrous Austrian <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> complimentary letter a few days later, and General Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, {{who had been in}} command at Rothschloss, reported upon his conduct so favorably that Frederick marked him for future high command. Within a year he was colonel and proprietor of the newly-formed Hussar Regiment, the Zieten Hussars, the second Hussar Regiment. In the Moravian foray of the following year, Zieten and his hussars penetrated almost to Vienna, and in the retreat to Silesia he was constantly employed with the rearguard.|$|E
5000|$|The Senate inquiry convened on 19 June 2009.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Cardells fell {{out with a}} friend of theirs, Raymond Howard, who went on to {{propagate}} the Coven of Atho. Howard later took Cardell to court, claiming that he had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> effigy, pierced by a needle and a mirror.|$|R
5|$|After marrying, Segrè {{sought a}} stable job and became {{professor}} of physics {{and director of the}} Physics Institute at the University of Palermo. He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians Michele Cipolla and Michele De Franchis, the mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the botanist Luigi Montemartini. In 1936 he paid a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he met Edwin McMillan, Donald Cooksey, Franz Kurie, Philip Abelson and Robert Oppenheimer. Segrè was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory's cyclotron. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes. In February 1937, Lawrence <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Segrè enlisted Perrier's help to subject the strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis, {{and they were able to}} prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element. In 1947 they named it technetium, as it was the first artificially synthesized chemical element.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Stephen Tomašević's expectations, Bobovac fell within days. The King {{had already}} {{realized}} that {{he had no choice but}} to take refuge in the neighbouring Croatia or Dalmatia. Angelović tirelessly pursued him, and caught up with him in Ključ. The Ottoman army was reportedly about to pass the city's fortress, not suspecting that the King was hiding within its walls, when a local man revealed his whereabouts in return for money. A four-day-long siege of the fortress ensued. Eager to capture him, Angelović had his messengers solemnly promise the King that he would be done no harm if he surrendered, and <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> document guaranteeing him freedom. With food supplies and ammunition running short, Stephen decided to surrender himself and his garrison to Angelović. Angelović, in turn, brought him, his uncle Radivoj and 13-year-old cousin Tvrtko before Mehmed in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> pallium in 736. He {{may have been}} {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E
50|$|In July 2004, Iles {{suffered}} a brain injury, which <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> into <b>a</b> three-day coma.|$|R
50|$|Francis died on 31 July 1924 in Territet (near Montreux, Switzerland). Though she {{had never}} met him, his niece-in-law Edwina Mountbatten had {{continuously}} <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> allowance during her lifetime, and continued to do so with his widow, sending Anna money until Edwina's own death in 1960.|$|R
60|$|Stranger still, he had victualled {{the house}} as if for a siege, for Begbie, the chief grocer of Wigtown, told me himself in a rapture of delight and amazement that the general had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> order for {{hundreds}} of dozens of every imaginable potted meat and vegetable.|$|R
