5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, remarking that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} outside of the television series in the novel Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is doing on the meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} meteor rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E
25|$|Chambers was {{relatively}} unknown prior to Behind the Green Door; however, the film {{made her a}} star. Green Door, along with Deep Throat, released the same year, and The Devil in Miss Jones, ushered in what {{is commonly known as}} the porno chic era. Critics have since debated whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> having orgasms in her scenes or just acting. She stated in one early interview that they were real, but denied it in an interview many years later.|$|E

25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
25|$|Despite his prosperity, Svarocis {{was unhappy}} {{in his life}} and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and took aim at a boar, but a deer came through the {{clearing}} and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer and she turned into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu.|$|E
500|$|It was cool. It was {{a really}} nice session, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> lovely. [...] And I guess as the song ('Hold Tight') came out, her fans seem to respond it really well, so yeah, awesome! And she's a legend, and it's an awesome {{opportunity}} to work with someone like Madonna who's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I've wanted to work with and that I look up to. She's the queen!.|$|E
50|$|Irene flaunts {{the ribbon}} Meleagro {{has given her}} to Aminta, pretending that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> in love with Meleagro. Aminta protests against her cruelty. Atalanta gives Aminta an arrow which she asks him to present to Meleagro without {{mentioning}} her name. Meleagro knows <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{in love with him}} and is quite cheerful, but Atalanta feels that her duty will prevent her from ever confessing her love for him.|$|R

500|$|We {{did three}} or four songs in {{three or four}} days. The way we was doing it, I had [...] down there along with me. We had the whole room set up with candles, some nice wine a very good vibe. It was {{completely}} stripped down, like 'Mariah Carey Unplugged'. She stripped herself down to her talent. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.|$|E
500|$|As most of {{the main}} cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein {{instructed}} them to attend {{all of the major}} events that take place within the film, including a wedding and a circumcision. Yaron commented, [...] " [...] it was so intense and [...] was crying and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> in it and I felt like she was my sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and to feel a part of it actually." ...|$|E
500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford. She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel very good about myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E

6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> not affectation. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> more {{gentle and}} quiet than you are; you don't think it so in your Mamma, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> like her." ...|$|R
500|$|Lovato says, [...] "I {{had a lot}} {{of respect}} for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> amazing and wasn't trying to be sexy or {{anything}} like that." [...] About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, [...] "I just thought she was a great role model. She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything like that. I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented." [...] Lovato's The Neon Lights Tour was [...] "inspired by Beyoncé." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going to}} produce her passport, and the audience would just have to take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Kat Dennings plays Norah Silverberg, {{the teenage}} {{daughter}} of a wealthy record producer who shares Nick's passion for music. Dennings was the second actor to be cast (Cera having been first), Sollett saying that [...] "her being liberated from [...] liberated the film in many ways, and certainly her character from cliché." [...] Dennings felt that she related to Norah {{more than any other}} she had played before and [...] "wanted to make sure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fleshed out". Her favorite day of shooting was with a group of drag queens at a gay cabaret, but she said that filming Norah's first orgasm was [...] "really uncomfortable... Really, really." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conscientious}} and literal Low {{was beginning}} to doubt if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> practical. How otherwise could she trifle with such a situation? ...|$|R
25|$|Keeping Miley's secret {{involves}} a two sided effort. As Hannah, she must keep her fans unaware that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a normal kid, and as Miley, she must keep her friends unaware that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Hannah Montana. In interviews, Miley Cyrus {{spoke of the}} implausibility {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny. The show however, remains workable primarily based on suspension of disbelief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly's? Oh, yes; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> steady-going. That <b>is</b> {{just what}} you will find her. This is a charming room, sister; thank you very much." ...|$|R
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> dead." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Bell and Menzel {{had to do}} a lot of {{recordings}} and re-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. [...] "We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that," [...] said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> proud that Anna [...] "came out like she did that [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> But <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{very romantic}} about some things; {{and when it}} comes to a matter of that kind, girls are about all alike, don't you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Lucy Rogers, she'll {{be missing}} {{tomorrow}} morning," [...] said Beth {{when she had}} told her cousins of the encounter in the corridor.|$|R

500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Channel V Australia, he recalled {{that the two of}} them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed, [...] "on an organisational level", thus accelerating the process. Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E
500|$|On 1 February 1800 at 07:00, Truxton's crew spotted what {{appeared}} to be a 54-gun frigate flying British colors two leagues off the Basse-Terre roadstead. In an effort to communicate with the mysterious frigate, Constellation flew British colors. Pitot had sighted the American ship by 07:45. [...] Thinking the vessel chasing him was a superior 55-gun warship, he sought to avoid conflict, and continued to sail with the wind rather than head north as he had originally intended. In an effort to increase her speed, the French frigate's crew put out studding sails to catch more wind. The behavior of Pitot's frigate signaled to Truxton that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a French warship, so he ordered Constellation cleared for action and gave chase. By 08:00 he struck the British colors and raised the American flag. As he closed with La Vengeance he shouted through a speaking trumpet for the French vessel to surrender.|$|E
