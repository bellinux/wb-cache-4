25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|Depression Quest {{was first}} {{released}} online as {{a web browser}} game on February 14, 2013. Quinn also submitted the game through Steam's Greenlight program and consequently received disparaging comments and hate mail, causing her to withdraw the game from the service. After receiving positive feedback from players who had played the game and receiving an invitation to Indiecade, she tried Greenlight again. She received further harassment, but felt that she could deal with the stress. [...] "I thought, honestly, I could take the hate if it meant the game could reach somebody who would get <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> feel less alone," [...] Quinn stated.|$|E
500|$|Christina Pickles {{had also}} been {{considered}} for the part, and Berman stated {{that she was the}} second choice for the role. Muldaur was offered a main cast credit, but declined in favor of a [...] "special guest appearance" [...] credit, and went into the role expecting only to be in the show for a single season. Muldaur left after season two, with McFadden returning as Crusher for season three. Muldaur said that [...] "People have tried to create some kind of <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but she played one part and I played a totally different part... {{it would not have been}} good to have continued very much longer, even though everyone was really lovely".|$|E

500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

That's because, he said, [...] "I’ve gotten so many calls and letters from people saying they really got <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> something that helped them." [...] On January 10, 2008, Quiet Strength reached 1,000,000 copies in print.

2500|$|Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell {{scored the}} Xbox version 5 out of 10, calling the game [...] "one {{of the most}} painfully average platform/slasher games in recent history." [...] He criticized the game for [...] "some hideously ropey graphics, {{repetitive}} level design, dodgy pacing and far too many find-the-key routines." [...] He concluded [...] "The Hobbit is a common-or-garden 3D platform/slasher in the same form as , {{wrapped up in a}} five year-old's bedtime story version {{of one of the most}} popular fantasy books ever written. It's ten hours of a fairly easy going platform slashing with well-spaced save points, and young gamers might get <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but for the majority it just is not good enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{should be}} no excuse given for the {{establishment}} of a belief that a functional nervous disability constitutes a right to compensation. [...] This is hard saying. [...] It may seem cruel that those whose sufferings are real, whose illness has been brought on by enemy action and very likely in the course of patriotic service, should be treated with such apparent callousness. [...] But there can be no doubt that in an overwhelming proportion of cases, these patients succumb to 'shock' because they get <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] To give them this reward is not ultimately a benefit to them because it encourages the weaker tendencies in their character. [...] The nation cannot call on its citizens for courage and sacrifice and, at the same time, state by implication that an unconscious cowardice or an unconscious dishonesty will be rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 January 2011, it was {{announced}} that Essex had been cast in the role of Eddie, the father of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). It was stated that Eddie's other children would arrive after him, and his [...] "fractured" [...] relationship with Michael would be explored. Of his role, Essex said, [...] "Being an East-Ender myself, I'm really excited to be joining the Square. Eddie Moon is a great character and I can't wait to get to grips with the role and work with such a fantastic cast. I'm really pleased that I've been able to make filming work around my tour dates this time." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said that Essex would [...] "bring warmth and charisma to the role of Eddie Moon" [...] and added that Eddie and the return of Michael will bring [...] "a new generation of the Moon family to Walford." [...] Essex had been cast as Jack Edwards six years previously, but withdrew from the role due to a clash with his touring schedule. He revealed [...] "he character [...] wasn't as interesting as this one. I think we would've made <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but there's much more texture and weight to this." [...] On 27 February 2011, Essex told Elaine Paige on Sunday that he would start filming as Eddie in April and that the character and his storylines were being brainstormed. He revealed that his initial contract would end in August 2011 and although he could stay on longer, he said there are other acting and touring projects [...] "pulling me out of EastEnders, but emotionally, I'm here." [...] He later revealed that Eddie would remain on screen until October. He hoped that he could return and become a regular returning character, joking that he would be an [...] "occasional Mooner", but later he ruled out a return to the show. He said that joining the cast was [...] "daunting" [...] and a [...] "great adventure" [...] that was [...] "taking over [...] life", and because he was writing a film score {{at the same time as}} filming for EastEnders, it was [...] "tricky" [...] and he found it difficult to adjust.|$|E

5000|$|While {{propaganda}} cannot create <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nothing, <b>it</b> {{does have}} the ability to build on the foundation already established. More importantly even though it does not create new material and is confined to what already exists, it is not necessarily powerless. [...] "It can attack from the rear, war own slowly, provide new centers of interest, which cause the neglect of previously acquired positions; it can divert a prejudice; or it can elicit an action contrary to an opinion held by the individual without his being clearly aware of it." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Mormon scripture, [...] "the {{elements}} are eternal". This means, according to Smith, that the {{elements are}} co-existent with God, and [...] "they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had not beginning, and {{can have no}} end." [...] This principle was elaborated on by Brigham Young, who said, [...] "God never made <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nothing; <b>it</b> {{is not in the}} economy or law of which the worlds were, are, or will exist." [...] Thus, Mormons deny ex nihilo creation and instead believe that God created or [...] "organized" [...] the universe <b>out</b> <b>of</b> pre-existing elements.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the episode}} aired, Larry David {{found himself in}} the middle of a big media frenzy {{surrounding}} the now-popular show.

Just by trying to be as funny, you’re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show’s really about something.

Seeing how glad the children were {{to get a new}} story, Miss Celia was moved to send a box of books--old and new--to the town library, which was but scantily supplied, as country libraries are apt to be. This donation produced a good effect; for other people hunted up all the volumes they could spare for the same purpose, and the dusty shelves in the little room behind the post-office filled up amazingly. Coming in vacation time they were hailed with delight, and ancient books of travel, as well as modern tales, were feasted upon by happy young folks, with plenty of time to enjoy them in peace.|$|R
