40|$|Purpose: Chemotherapies {{for breast}} cancer {{generally}} have strong cellular cytotoxicity and severe side effects. Thus, significant emphasis {{has been placed on}} combinations of naturally occurring chemopreventive agents. <b>Silibinin</b> is a major bioactive flavonolignan extracted from milk thistle with chemopreventive activity in various organs including the skin, prostate, and breast. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of <b>silibinin</b> in breast cancer has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of <b>silibinin</b> in MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells and determined whether <b>silibinin</b> enhances ultraviolet (UV) B-induced apoptosis. Methods: The effects of <b>silibinin</b> on MCF- 7 cell viability were determined using the MTT assay. The effect of <b>silibinin</b> on PARP cleavage, as the hallmark of apoptotic cell death, and p 53 protein expression in MCF- 7 cells was analyzed using Western blot. The effect of <b>silibinin</b> on UVB-induced apoptosis in MCF- 7 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: A dose- and time-dependent reduction in viability was observed in MCF- 7 cells treated with <b>silibinin.</b> <b>Silibinin</b> strongly induced apoptotic cell death in MCF- 7 cells, and induction of apoptosis was associated with increased p 53 expression. Moreover, <b>silibinin</b> enhanced UVBinduced apoptosis in MCF- 7 cells. Conclusion: <b>Silibinin</b> induced a loss of cell viability and apoptotic cell death in MCF- 7 cells. Furthermore, the combination of <b>silibinin</b> and UVB resulted in an additive effect on apoptosis in MCF- 7 cells.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>silibinin</b> on cell proliferation in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -treated human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs). The effect of <b>silibinin</b> on cell proliferation in PDGF-treated HTFs was determined by examining the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and performing WST- 1 assays. Cell cycle progression was evaluated using flow cytometry. The related cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were also analyzed using western blot. A modified rat trabeculectomy model was established to evaluate the effect of <b>silibinin</b> on cell proliferation in vivo. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the effect of <b>silibinin</b> on the expression of PDGF receptor and on the downstream signaling pathways regulated by PDGF receptor. PDGF elevated the expression of PCNA in HTFs, and this elevation was inhibited by <b>silibinin.</b> The inhibitory effect of <b>silibinin</b> on cell proliferation was also confirmed via WST- 1 assay. PDGF-stimulated cell cycle in HTFs was delayed by <b>silibinin,</b> and the related cyclin D 1 and CDK 4 were also suppressed by <b>silibinin.</b> In the rat model of trabeculectomy, <b>silibinin</b> reduced the expression of PCNA at the site of blebs in vivo. The effects of <b>silibinin</b> on PDGF-stimulated HTFs were mediated via the downregulation of PDGF receptor-regulated signaling pathways, such as ERKs and STATs, which may be partially caused by the downregulation of N-glycosylation of PDGF receptor beta (PDGFRβ).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>silibinin</b> on intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression, we used ARPE- 19 cells as a model in which tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interferon (IFN-γ) enhanced ICAM- 1 expression. This upregulation was inhibited by <b>silibinin.</b> In an adherence assay using ARPE- 19 and THP- 1 cells, <b>silibinin</b> inhibited the cell adhesion function of ICAM- 1. The inhibitory effects of <b>silibinin</b> on ICAM- 1 expression were mediated via the blockage of nuclear translocation of p 65 proteins in TNF-α and phosphorylation of STAT 1 in IFN-γ-stimulated cells. In addition, <b>silibinin</b> altered the degree of N-linked glycosylation posttranslationally in ARPE- 19 cells by significantly enhancing MGAT 3 gene expression. <b>Silibinin</b> can increase the O-GlcNAc levels of glycoproteins in ARPE- 19 cells.

The aim {{of this study was to}} test the principal isomers contained in silymarin preparations for their ability to inhibit HCV enzymatic functions and replication in different models. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS 3 / 4 A protease enzyme assays. Their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1 b replicon model and the JFH 1 infectious HCV model in cell culture was also studied. RESULTS: <b>Silibinin</b> A, <b>silibinin</b> B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms and Legalon SIL, a commercially available intravenous preparation of <b>silibinin,</b> inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function, with inhibitory concentrations 50 % of the order of 75 - 100 microM. <b>Silibinin</b> A and <b>silibinin</b> B also inhibited HCV genotype 1 b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2 a strain JFH 1 replication in cell culture.

40|$|Poster Session 25 : {{abstract}} no. 1591 Esophageal {{cancer is}} the eighth most common cancer worldwide and the sixth {{most common cause of}} cancer-related death. The prognosis for advanced esophageal cancer is very poor due to the limitations of surgery and emergence of chemoresistance. Identification of non-toxic, naturally occurring anticancer agents which may be used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs may help improve patient survival. <b>Silibinin,</b> a flavonoid isolated from the milk thistle, Silybum marianum, had been shown to have anticancer effects on several types of cancer cells. However, its effect on esophageal cancer has not been reported. Furthermore, although <b>silibinin</b> is known to downregulate the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer cells, {{little is known about the}} upstream signaling events targeted by <b>silibinin.</b> In this study, we investigated the effects of <b>silibinin,</b> alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs, on human esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) cells in vitro and on ESCC tumor xenografts in nude mice, and explored novel signaling pathways targeted by <b>silibinin.</b> We found that <b>silibinin</b> inhibited cell proliferation, colony-formation, and anchorage-independent growth of ESCC cells. The effects were attributed to silibinin-induced G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Wound healing assay and invasion chamber assay showed that <b>silibinin</b> had suppressive effect on the migration and invasion ability of esophageal cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed that <b>silibinin</b> increased the expression of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and decreased the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, mTOR and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC). The anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of <b>silibinin</b> on ESCC cells were abolished by treatment with the AMPK inhibitor, compound C. In addition, <b>silibinin</b> increased the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to the traditional chemotherapeutic drugs 5 -fluorouracil and cisplatin in vitro. In vivo, orally administered <b>silibinin</b> significantly inhibited the growth of ESCC tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and exerted synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs. In summary, our data demonstrate that <b>silibinin</b> has suppressive effects on ESCC cells, and that these effects may be mediated through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. <b>Silibinin</b> may be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of esophageal cancer. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 102 nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR 2011), Orlando, FL., 2 - 6 April 2011.
