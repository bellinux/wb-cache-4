40|$|Abstract — A well-functioning <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> {{is the key}} to the {{economic}} performance of the contemporary developing countries. India is no exception, where <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> grows at a faster rate. What is, however, critical is the capacity of the <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> to create new jobs. This study investigates the employment intensity of <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> growth in India and examines the role of fundamental macroeconomic factors in determining the same. The results indicate that over the years, while output growth rate in <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> has increased, employment growth rate has decelerated significantly leading to considerable fall in employment elasticity. Coupled with this, there is predominance of low productive and unskilled labour based activities in <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Regression results based on the time-series data from 1960 - 61 to 2004 - 05 further indicate that investment friendly environment, better public expenditure management, effective labour policies and proper structural transformation are the key to achieve higher employment elasticity in <b>service</b> <b>sector.</b> Keywords- growth; employment; structural change; <b>service</b> <b>sector</b> I...|$|R

Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly {{in the past two}} decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the <b>services</b> <b>sector,</b> tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian.

5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its <b>services</b> <b>sector</b> (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable.
