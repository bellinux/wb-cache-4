5000|$|Coenzyme A is {{available}} from various chemical suppliers as the free acid and or lithium or sodium salts.

[...] The lithium and sodium salts of CoA are more stable, with negligible degradation noted over several months at various temperatures [...] Aqueous solutions of coenzyme A are unstable above pH 8, with 31% of activity lost after 24 hours at 25˚C and pH 8. CoA <b>stock</b> <b>solutions</b> are relatively stable when frozen at pH 2-6. The major route of CoA activity loss is likely the air oxidation of CoA to CoA disulfides.
