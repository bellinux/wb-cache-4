40|$|In this thesis, {{the concept}} of an {{intelligent}} system for the design and planning of electric power systems is developed. Such a system serves to preserve the vast body of power system design knowledge by identifying, structuring and consolidating it into one easily accessible source. The intelligent system can then be used to support experienced power system planners or for training purposes. The main planning and design activities considered include the design of a complete power system or of specific subsystems such as a substation or a transmission corridor. The principal features and main components of this general intelligent system, called PSIDE, are delineated. A general methodology and a design tool were then devised for modelling and using this kind of knowledge. The object-oriented strategy was found to be the most suitable due its powerful capabilities to naturally represent the structure and behaviour of power systems. Thus, PSIDE is based on object-oriented knowledge models for design tasks such as point-to-point transmission design, insulation coordination as well as protection system and <b>substation</b> <b>design.</b> In order to validate the proposed concepts as well as the object-oriented paradigm adopted for their realization, a <b>substation</b> <b>design</b> module (SIDE) was fully developed and tested...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the unavailability for OKG {{will be affected}} by the planned replacement of the 400 kV substation at Simpevarp. The evaluation has been based on calculation of unavailability due to both faults and maintenance, fault and maintenance frequencies and estimated costs for the different <b>substation</b> <b>designs.</b> Four different variations of two-breaker arrangement designs have been simulated and been compared to simulations of the existing substation. To perform the calculations a program has been developed in java that simulates the different <b>substation</b> <b>designs.</b> The fault probabilities used in this study has primarily been taken from fault statistics for the Swedish grid but has also been compared to the assumptions used in other substation reliability studies. The results of this thesis show that the unavailability is likely to be higher for the proposed twobreaker arrangement design without separate disconnectors compared to the existing substation. When the two-breaker arrangement simulation instead included separate disconnectors the unavailability was found to be lower for the two-breaker arrangement design compared to the existing substation. The study also showed that the two-breaker arrangement designs had considerably lower fault frequencies compared to the existing substation. The thesis found that the unavailability that will be caused by maintenance can be significant and are likely to be higher than the unavailability caused by faults. The amount of unavailability caused by maintenance was, however, found to be uncertain because a large part of it can be performed during planned outage. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} two-breaker arrangement design with and without disconnectors had similar expected present value of costs if the maintenance costs were excluded. This indicates that the best substation option from an economic point of view is determined by the maintenance costs...|$|R

The situation was confused by the fact that within the Brisbane metropolitan area there were fourteen separate local authorities and numerous suppliers. Between 1904 and 1925 a number of rationalisations helped reduce this complexity and with the establishment in 1925 of the Brisbane City Council a single public authority was created which could plan for the provision of electrical services throughout the entire city.
