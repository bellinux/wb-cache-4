5|$|The Command Module Columbia was {{displayed}} at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall {{in front of the}} Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|... the old <b>suit</b> names <b>were</b> {{attributed}} to the new <b>suits</b> - this <b>is</b> the reason why Portuguese names for suits don't match the suit drawings. In Portuguese, the Hearts <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Copas ("cups"), the Spades <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Espadas ("swords"), the Diamonds <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Ouros ("gold coins"), and the Clubs <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Paus ("clubs" [...] or [...] "sticks").|$|R
5000|$|Five Beetleborgs <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> re-used in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode Forever Red as {{remnants}} of the Machine Empire who would plan to reactivate Serpentera. Shadowborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for General Venjix, Ladyborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Tezzla, Green Hunter Borg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Gerrok, Dragonborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Steelon with the dragonfly wings on the head not being seen, and Automon has the head of Fireborg and the body of Lightningborg.|$|R
50|$|Belyudra: Initially {{assumed to}} be CGI, an actual <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> made. The <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> moving one by one to the head, torso, right arm and left arm. After {{creating}} a three-dimensional mould, the <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> fully materialised through 3D printing.|$|R
25|$|Good {{tailoring}} {{anywhere in}} the world is characterised by strongly tapered sides and minimal shoulder, whereas often rack <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> padded to reduce labour. More casual <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> characterised by less construction and tailoring, much like the sack suit is a loose American style.|$|E
25|$|Between 15,000 and 19,000 {{malpractice}} <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{brought against}} doctors each year.|$|E
25|$|Dry <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped}} with an inflation valve {{and at least one}} exhaust valve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to be worn over a liquid cooling garment. The inner fabric of the <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> gray nylon canvas. The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> insulated with waffle-textured foil. The outer layer was an off-white satin-weave fabric with orange trim.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Suits</b> — There <b>are</b> two suits: big {{and small}} (...) {{differentiated}} by both colours and their characters/patterns. The big <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> red and the small <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> black.|$|R

25|$|Dry <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is {{frequently}} immersed in cold water. These <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly used in}} the spring and autumn with moderate water temperatures, but Neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water. These provide greater thermal protection {{in the event of a}} leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types of suits is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A neoprene bottom also is less likely to allow trapped air to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the water}} {{temperature}} (between 4°C and 0°C in fresh water, approximately -1.9°C for normal salinity sea water), exposure <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> mandatory.|$|E
50|$|Each hand, one <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> trump; trump {{cards are}} higher than non-trump. The order of cards for the trump <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> the same as euchre: J of the trump suit (right bauer)-J of the other suit of the same color (left bauer)-A-K-Q-10-etc. The order of cards for non-trump <b>suits</b> <b>is</b> A-K-Q-(J)-10-etc.|$|R
5000|$|An {{environmental}} <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> a [...] {{designed specifically}} for a particular environment, usually one otherwise hostile to humans. An environment <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> typically a one-piece garment, and many types also feature a helmet or other covering for the head. Where the surrounding environment is especially dangerous the <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> completely sealed.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the Toho <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{in really}} bad shape. The Gargantuas <b>suits</b> appear to <b>be</b> rotting (especially Gaira), {{despite the fact}} that both <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> repainted. They are also wearing new masks (with wigs).|$|R
25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which {{in the case of}} neoprene <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.|$|E
25|$|Membrane or Shell dry <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{usually a}} trilaminate or coated textile construction. The {{material}} is thin {{and not a}} very good insulator, so the insulation is provided by the air trapped in the undersuit.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{provided}} with a flap which can be closed over {{the outside of the}} zipper to protect it from being damaged by contact with the diver's equipment or the environment. these flaps may be held in place by velcro or a non-watertight outer zipper.|$|E
25|$|Hokuto's Ultraman <b>Suit</b> <b>is</b> called Ver.A, which materializes by {{pounding}} his prosthetic fists together. This <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> {{an analogous}} of Ultraman Ace from his titular series.|$|R

5000|$|Due {{to being}} made with using wet-suits and latices, the <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{incapable}} of sustaining {{long periods of}} time. What happened {{to each of the}} <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Ambient {{pressure}} <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> a form {{of exposure}} protection protecting the wearer from the cold. They also provide some defence from abrasive and sharp objects as well as potentially harmful underwater life. They do not protect divers from {{the pressure of the}} surrounding water or resulting barotrauma and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Dry <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} used {{where the water}} temperature is below 15°C (60°F), and for extended immersion in water above 15°C (60°F), where discomfort would be experienced by a wet suit user. They are also used with integral boots, and gloves and sealed to the helmet for personal protection when working in and around hazardous liquids.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} sensorimotor problems astronauts will face during a {{stay on the}} Moon and Mars are likely to occur when walking around in their space suits. The <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> big and bulky and change the body's center of gravity. This along with the uneven terrain and limited field of view makes locomotion challenging.|$|E
50|$|Zoot <b>Suit</b> <b>is</b> a play {{written by}} Luis Valdez, {{featuring}} incidental music by Daniel Valdez and Lalo Guerrero. Zoot <b>Suit</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} Sleepy Lagoon murder trial and the Zoot Suit Riots. Debuting in 1979, Zoot <b>Suit</b> <b>was</b> the first Chicano play on Broadway. In 1981, Luis Valdez also directed a filmed version of the play, combining stage and film techniques.|$|R
50|$|In French-language decks, the <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Deniers ("silver coins"). The picture {{cards are}} Valet (Page), Chevalier (Horseman or Knight), Reine (Queen), and Roi (King). This <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> later changed to Diamonds.|$|R
25|$|The {{atmospheric}} diving <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> a small one-man submersible of anthropomorphic {{form with}} elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Although atmospheric <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{developed during the}} Victorian era, none of these <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> able to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure.|$|R
25|$|Hot water <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> used in {{cold water}} {{commercial}} surface supplied diving. A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary {{the warmth of the}} suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.|$|E
25|$|The BCD is {{more robust}} than a dry suit. Dry <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> not {{designed}} to be buoyancy compensators and more prone to failure than BCDs, they have multiple points of failure and can completely flood when a seal tears or a zip breaks or leaks. Wrist and neck seals can vent accidentally; annoying if wearing a BCD, possibly fatal without.|$|E
25|$|Within each suit, {{the stable}} sort {{preserves}} the ordering by rank {{that was already}} done. This idea can be extended to any number of keys, and is leveraged by radix sort. The same effect can be achieved with an unstable sort by using a lexicographic key comparison, which, e.g., compares first by suit, and then compares by rank if the <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> the same.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pairing of}} <b>suits</b> <b>is</b> a vestigial remnant of Ganjifa, a game where half the <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> in reverse order, the lower cards beating the higher. In Ganjifa, {{progressive}} <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "strong" [...] while inverted <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "weak". In Latin decks, the traditional division {{is between the}} long suits of swords and clubs and the round suits of cups and coins. This pairing {{can be seen in}} Ombre and Tarot card games. German and Swiss suits lack pairing but French suits maintained them and this {{can be seen in the}} game of Spoil Five.|$|R
50|$|As {{most of the}} {{designer}} suits, a pencil <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> also embellished with beads, mirror work, zardozi or zari work. Simple and plain variants of the <b>suit</b> <b>are</b> also available for daily wear.|$|R
50|$|Chinese jade burial <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{believed}} to be myths for many years until two were discovered in 1968; it is now believed that most jade burial <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> removed long ago by grave robbers.|$|R
