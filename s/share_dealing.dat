500|$|The {{demand for}} cheap cotton goods {{from this area}} {{prompted}} the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment {{was followed by the}} construction of 12 new cotton mills from 1870 and 1900. In the post-war economic boom of 1919–20, investors did not have the time to build new mills and so were prepared to pay vastly inflated sums for shares in existing companies.

Because of this highly profitable <b>share</b> <b>dealing,</b> it was reported in the national press that Shaw and Crompton had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. The number of cotton mills in the township peaked at 36 in 1920.|$|E
