40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep-related brady-arrhytmia syndrome is a cardiac rhythm disorder characterised by asystoles lasting several seconds during REM sleep in otherwise healthy individuals. In contrast to arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea, REM sleep-related <b>sinus</b> <b>arrests</b> and atrioventricular (AV) blocks are {{not associated with}} episodes of apnea or hypopnea. In literature, only few cases have been published, suggesting that the prevalence of this nighttime rhythm disorder is very rare. In this paper, we report two new cases of REM sleep-related <b>sinus</b> <b>arrests</b> and one case of REM sleep-related total AV block. To explore the underlying mechanism, an analysis of heart rate variability was performed. In a matched control population, we observed a significant lower low-to-high frequency (LF/HF) ratio in slow wave sleep as compared to REM sleep (2. 04 +/- 1. 2 vs 4. 55 +/- 1. 82, respectively [Mann-Whitney U test p < 0. 01]), demonstrating a global increase in sympathetic activity during REM. When using the same technique in two of three patients with REM-related arrhythmias, the shift to an increased LF/HF ratio from slow wave sleep to REM sleep tended to be lower. This may reflect an increased vagal activity (HF component) during REM sleep in these subjects. We, therefore, hypothesise that, in our patients with REM sleep-related arrhythmias, the overall dominance of sympathetic activity during REM is present but {{to a lesser extent}} and temporarily switches into vagal dominance when the bursts of REMs occur. As it was still unclear whether these REM sleep-related asystoles needed to be paced, we compared our treatment and these of previously reported cases with the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for implantation of cardiac pacemakers. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Sinus node electrograms were {{obtained}} in two patients with unexplained syncope and the cardioinhibitory {{form of the}} hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome. Direct recordings of sinus node potentials {{were obtained}} using a transvenous electrode catheter. Sinus node function was normal in both patients during standard electrophysiologic evaluation. Carotid sinus massage was performed in both patients and the sinus node electrogram was continuously recorded. After the onset of carotid sinus massage, prolongation of sinoatrial time, slowing of sinus rate of depolarization, sinoatrial exit block and finally <b>sinus</b> node <b>arrest</b> were recorded. After termination of carotid sinus massage, sinus node potentials did not precede the first atrial impulse; subsequent beats showed markedly prolonged sinoatrial times as well as changes in the P wave on the surface electrocardiogram. Sinus rate and sinoatrial time returned to control values gradually, as did the P wave configuration. Intravenous atropine (1. 0 mg) abolished the abnormal response to carotid sinus massage. It is concluded that the application of carotid sinus massage in patients with the hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome produces profound changes in sinoatrial conduction including sinoatrial exit block, as well as shifts in primary pacemaker site and <b>sinus</b> node <b>arrest.</b> These alterations in conduction and automaticity are reversible with atropine and may be secondary to denervation sensitivity to acetylcholine...|$|R

5000|$|Sinoatrial arrest (also {{known as}} <b>sinus</b> <b>arrest</b> or sinus pause) {{is a medical}} {{condition}} wherein the sinoatrial node of the heart transiently ceases to generate the electrical impulses that normally stimulate the myocardial tissues to contract and thus the heart to beat. It is defined as lasting from 2.0 seconds to several minutes. Since the heart contains multiple pacemakers, this interruption of the cardiac cycle generally lasts {{only a few seconds}} before another part of the heart, such as the atrio-ventricular junction or the ventricles, begins pacing and restores the heart action. This condition can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a brief period of irregular length with no electrical activity before either the sinoatrial node resumes normal pacing, or another pacemaker begins pacing. If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm. If no other pacemaker begins pacing during an episode of <b>sinus</b> <b>arrest</b> it becomes a cardiac arrest. This condition is sometimes confused with sinoatrial block, a condition in which the pacing impulse is generated, but fails to conduct through the myocardium. Differential diagnosis of the two conditions is possible by examining the exact length of the interruption of cardiac activity.If the next available pacemaker takes over, it is in the following order: ...|$|E
50|$|A slow rhythm (less than 60 beats/min), is {{labelled}} bradycardia. This may {{be caused}} by a slowed signal from the sinus node (sinus bradycardia), a pause in the normal activity of the sinus node (<b>sinus</b> <b>arrest),</b> or by blocking of the electrical impulse on its way from the atria to the ventricles (AV block or heart block). Heart block comes in varying degrees and severity. It {{may be caused}} by reversible poisoning of the AV node (with drugs that impair conduction) or by irreversible damage to the node. Bradycardias may also be present in the normally functioning heart of endurance athletes or other well-conditioned persons. Bradycardia may also occur in some types of seizures.|$|E
50|$|An AV {{junctional}} escape is {{a delayed}} heartbeat originating from an ectopic focus {{somewhere in the}} AV junction. It occurs when the rate of depolarization of the SA node falls below {{the rate of the}} AV node. This dysrhythmia also may occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block. This is a protective mechanism for the heart, to compensate for an SA node that is no longer handling the pacemaking activity, and is {{one of a series of}} backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so. This would present with a longer PR interval. A junctional escape complex is a normal response that may result from excessive vagal tone on the SA node. Pathological causes include sinus bradycardia, <b>sinus</b> <b>arrest,</b> sinus exit block, or AV block.|$|E

Forty nine patients were treated for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and 31 for supra-ventricular arrhythmias. The mean (range six days to 51 months), permitting a total of 100 patient years of observation. Adverse reactions were observed in 69 patients. Severe side effects were encountered in 13 : four patients developed interstitial pneumonitis, four patients developed incessant ventricular tachycardia, three patients taking amiodarone and digoxin sustained <b>sinus</b> node <b>arrest</b> with depression of escape foci, one patient developed hepatitis, and one patient developed hypercalcaemia with renal failure.

40|$|Organ-scale {{arrhythmogenic}} {{consequences of}} source-sink mismatch caused by impaired excitability remain unknown, hindering {{the understanding of}} pathophysiology in disease states like Brugada syndrome and ischemia. We sought to determine whether sodium current (INa) reduction in the structurally normal heart unmasks a regionally heterogeneous substrate for the induction of sustained arrhythmia by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). We conducted simulations in rabbit ventricular computer models with 930 unique combinations of PVC location (10 sites) and coupling interval (250 - 400 ms), INa reduction (30 or 40 % of normal levels), and post-PVC <b>sinus</b> rhythm (<b>arrested</b> or persistent). Geometric characteristics and source-sink mismatch were quantitatively analyzed by calculating ventricular wall thickness and a newly formulated 3 D safety factor (SF), respectively. Reducing INa to 30 % of its normal level created a substrate for sustained arrhythmia induction by establishing large regions of critical source-sink mismatch (SF 95 % smaller. Likewise, when post-PVC sinus activations were persistent instead of arrested, no ectopic excitations initiated sustained reentry because sinus activation breakthroughs engulfed the excitable gap. Our new SF formulation can quantify ectopic wavefront propagation robustness in geometrically complex 3 D tissue with impaired excitability. This novel methodology was applied to show that INa reduction precipitates source-sink mismatch, creating a potent substrate for sustained arrhythmia induction by PVCs originating near regions of ventricular wall expansion, such as the RV outflow tract...|$|R
5000|$|A {{ventricular}} bradycardia, {{also known}} as ventricular escape rhythm or idioventricular rhythm, is a heart rate of less than 50 BPM. This is a safety mechanism when a lack of electrical impulse or stimuli from the atrium occurs. Impulses originating within or below the bundle of His in the atrioventricular node will produce a wide QRS complex with heart rates between 20 and 40 BPM. Those above the bundle of His, {{also known as}} junctional, will typically range between 40 and 60 BPM with a narrow QRS complex. In a third-degree heart block, about 61% {{take place at the}} bundle branch-Purkinje system, 21% at the AV node, and 15% at the bundle of His.

40|$|Sinus node {{dysfunction}} or sick sinus syndrome (SSS) includes {{clinical conditions}} such as symptomatic sinus bradycardia, <b>sinus</b> pauses or <b>arrest,</b> <b>sinus</b> node exit block, atrial tachycardias and chronotropic incompetence. Even though SSS incidence increases in an exponential-like manner with age, it can occur at all ages, including in the newborn. The mean age of patients with the syndrome is 68 years, with both genders being affected in approximately equal proportion. This condition occurs in 1 of every 600 cardiac patients over 65. Degenerative fibrosis of the tissues of the node has been suggested to be a common cause of SSS. Although it is still disputed. SSS is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation and flutter, tachy-bradycardia syndrome. Tachy-bradycardia syndrome is defined as sinus bradycardia coupled with atrial flutter/fibrillation or reciprocal atrial tachycardia. This syndrome is common in young patients following a surgical treatment of a congenital heart disease. Patients with chronic or persistent atrial flutter/fibrillation show high rates of cardiovascular disorders and mortality while sinus bradycardia is thought as an independent risk factor of atrial flutter/fibrillation. There are certain restrictions to medical treatment: long-term administration of the same medication (sotalol, amiodarone) for atrial flutter/fibrillation can cause symptomatic bradycardia while administration of other medication (a class 1 drug) {{increases the likelihood of}} ventricular arrythmias or evident bradycardia that enhances the risk of sudden cardiac death. Following atrial fibrillation ablation patients saw a significant improvement in the sinus node function, or saw a better sinus node function disrupted due to remodelling that takes place during atrial fibrillation. The surgical methods applications proved most efficient in non-medicational treatment of atrial fibrillation. In the late 1980 s American surgeon J. L. Cox developed a so-called Maze procedure. This is what it is about. The mechanism of atrial fibrillation is regarded as macro-reentry, i. e. there are several circuits for reentrant excitation (base of the pulmonary vein, mitral and tricuspid valves, other holes, particularly the auricle, etc.). The operation involves electrical isolation (cuts and criotherapy) of these areas and transition of three internodal paths into one. The operation was shown to be efficient in long-term maintenance of the sinus rhythm in permanent atrial fibrillation...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study molluscan tissue regeneration, as exemplified by wound healing of the mantle edge in Arion hortensis, and to attempt an analysis of blastema formation. As a necessary preliminary the structure of the mantle edge was investigated. It consists of a glandular epithelial fold within which is a zone of connective tissue composed of a dorsal pigmented region, a median vascular region through which ramifies a lattice-work of smooth muscle fibres, and a ventral region containing a mat of muscle fibres. The structural and metabolic changes following wounding by excision were studied and where possible related. Immediately after wounding the undamaged muscle fibres adjacent to the wound contract and the meshes of the lattice close, thus temporarily constricting the blood <b>sinuses</b> and <b>arresting</b> bleeding. Wound closure is achieved initially by blood-cell agglutination and finally by coverage of the injured surface by the epithelial cells. Damaged tissue is removed from the wound by histolysis and phagocytosis. A blastema then forms at the injured surface; its cells grow, divide, and differentiate replacing the excised tissue. Differentiation begins in those regions adjacent to the uninjured tissue and extends into the rest of the blastema. Changes in the distribution of acid and alkaline phosphatase, ribonucleic acid, glycogen, and sulphydryl and disulphide groups were noted. The method of blastema formation was analysed by the following techniques: carmine marking of epithelial cells, tissue culture of isolated blastemata, and colchicine treatment of wounded animals. It was shown that both immigrant and indigenous cells contribute to the blastema, the majority of the blastema cells being immigrant. Epithelial and connective tissue components of the regenerate arise from immigrant cells while muscle tissue develops from indigenous material. <p...|$|R

Previously, we have shown that metastatic tumor cells entering the liver trigger a proinflammatory response involving Kupffer cell-mediated release of tumor necrosis factor-α and the up-regulation of vascular endothelial cell adhesion receptors, such as E-selectin. Here, we analyzed spatio-temporal aspects of the ensuing tumor-endothelial cell interaction using human colorectal carcinoma CX- 1 and murine carcinoma H- 59 cells and a combination of immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional reconstruction. E-selectin expression was evident mainly on sinusoidal vessels by 6 and 10 hours, respectively, following H- 59 and CX- 1 inoculation, and this corresponded to a stabilization {{of the number of}} tumor cells within the <b>sinuses.</b> Tumor cells <b>arrested</b> in E-selectin+ vessels and appeared to flatten and traverse the vessel lining, away from sites of intense E-selectin staining.
