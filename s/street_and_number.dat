2500|$|The Prime Minister's Office, {{for which}} the terms Downing <b>Street</b> <b>and</b> <b>Number</b> 10 are synonymous, lies within the 10 Downing Street {{building}} and {{is part of the}} Cabinet Office. It is staffed by a mix of career Civil Servants and Special Advisers. The highest ranking Civil Servant position is the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, [...] Peter Hill; the most senior Special Adviser post is the Downing Street Chief of Staff, [...] held by Gavin Barwell. Though Number 10 is formally part of the Cabinet Office, it reports directly to the Cabinet Secretary, who is [...] Sir Jeremy Heywood.|$|E

5000|$|Additional {{confusion}} can be {{encountered in}} Mesa in its urban core, with east-west <b>numbered</b> avenues <b>and</b> drives counting down from 11th Avenue north towards Main <b>Street),</b> <b>and</b> <b>numbered</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> places counting down from 11th Place south towards Main Street. [...] Then, {{in the eastern}} part of the city, north-south <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> places count up from 22nd St east of Gilbert Rd, to 112th Street on the Apache Junction border. [...] Also, numerous trailer parks inside the city limits run their own contradictory variations of the numbered street system.|$|R
6000|$|So the {{man took}} {{a piece of}} paper and wrote upon the top of it the words [...] "prefecture of police," [...] saying, as he wrote it, that every coachman knew where that was.

60|$|So Rollo and Charles {{got into}} the {{carriage}} again.

60|$|Every living {{creature}} {{that could be}} used as food was slain and eaten.

60|$|The {{old woman}} herself {{did nothing to}} attract public notice till they were midway between Seventh and Eighth avenues. She mumbled {{something}} {{from time to time}} which the colored girl interpreted to the rest as her continued wish to go home. She was now clearer about her <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number.</b> The girl, as if after question of her own generous spirit, said she did not see how she could go with her; she was expected at home herself.|$|E
60|$|And {{so it was}} settled, {{after much}} further argument, {{that they were all}} to sup at Mr. Merrill's house, Cynthia stoutly {{maintaining}} that she would not desert them. And then Mr. Merrill, having several times repeated the <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number,</b> went, back to his office. There was much mysterious whispering between Ephraim and Jethro in the hotel parlor after dinner, while Cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine, and then Ephraim proposed going out to see the sights.|$|E

6000|$|The [...] "suspect" [...] halted readily {{and tilted}} back his hat, exposing, in {{the flicker of}} the {{electric}} lights, an emotionless, smooth countenance with a rather long nose and steady dark eyes. Thrusting his gloved hand into a side pocket of his overcoat, he drew out a card {{and handed it to}} the policeman. Holding it to catch the uncertain light, the officer read the name [...] "Charles Spencer James, M. D." [...] The <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> of the address were of a neighborhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even curiosity. The policeman's downward glance at the article carried in the doctor's hand--a handsome medicine case of black leather, with small silver mountings--further endorsed the guarantee of the card.|$|E
60|$|Even this hospitable person, however, {{was left}} behind at last, and Clennam pursued his way, unmolested. There was a {{tranquil}} air in the town after the turbulence of the Channel and the beach, and its dulness in that comparison was agreeable. He met new groups of his countrymen, who had all a straggling air of having at one time overblown themselves, like certain uncomfortable kinds of flowers, and of being now mere weeds. They had all an air, too, of lounging out a limited round, day after day, which strongly {{reminded him of the}} Marshalsea. But, taking no further note of them than was sufficient to give birth to the reflection, he sought out a certain <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> which he kept in his mind.|$|E

[...] Then he handed to her a paper on which he had written {{the name of the}} <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> at which he was now living.

6000|$|Decidedly, {{we should}} answer, to begin with, not [...] "Mr. Smythe Johnes" [...] {{if you wish}} to keep the finest bloom on your {{friendship}} with any man who knows the world.

After our revolt in essentials from the English in the eighteenth century, we are now conforming more and more in the twentieth to their usages in non-essentials, and the English always write Smythe Johnes, Esq., or Dr. Smythe Johnes or the like, unless Mr. Smythe Johnes is in trade or below it. They, indeed, sometimes carry their scruple so far that they will address him as Mr. Smythe Johnes at his place of business, and Smythe Johnes, Esq., at his private residence.|$|E
6000|$|Some one now {{came into}} the smoking-room, where we were sitting, and no more was said on this subject.

When the time comes to go, he's goin' to slip off quietly, leavin' that jar behind him, thinkin' then I'll be obliged to take it, there bein' nobody to give it back to.

I've got the <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> of his business place in Honolulu from his sister,--askin' about it in an offhand way, as if it didn't mean anything,--an' if that jar is left for me, I'll pack it in a box, money and all, and I'll express it to Mr. Dusante; and when he gets to Honolulu he'll find it there, and then he'll know that two can play at that sort of game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{art of the}} raconteur," [...] {{observed}} the Philosopher, [...] "consists in avoiding the unessential. I {{have a friend who}} never yet to my knowledge reached the end of a story. It is intensely unimportant whether the name of the man who said the thing or did the deed be Brown or Jones or Robinson. But she will worry herself into a fever trying to recollect. 'Dear, dear me!' she will leave off to exclaim; 'I know his name so well. How stupid of me!' She will tell you why she ought to recollect his name, how she always has recollected his name till this precise moment. She will appeal to half the people in the room to help her. It is hopeless to try and induce her to proceed, the idea has taken possession of her mind. After a world of unnecessary trouble she recollects that it was Tomkins, and is delighted; only to be plunged again into despair on discovery that she has forgotten his address. This makes her so ashamed of herself she declines to continue, and full of self- reproach she retires to her own room. Later she re-enters, beaming, with the <b>street</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> pat. But by that time she has forgotten the anecdote." ...|$|E
