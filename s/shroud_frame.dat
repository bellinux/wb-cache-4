40|$|A {{cylindrical}} test-bed {{has been}} designed and modeled {{to aid in the}} study and control of interior acoustics in aircraft. The test-bed accounts for local as well as global structural-acoustic dynamics encountered in typical aircraft. The design is based on several existing aircraft and models used to study aircraft dynamics. The test-bed incorporates the basic geometry and materials common to a majority of aircraft, including an aluminum skin <b>shrouding</b> a <b>framed</b> structure composed of ribs and stringers. The design is approximately a one-third scale representation with a cylindrical geometry measuring 0. 91 m diameter and 1. 98 m long. The test-bed has been modeled using finite element methods and Rayleigh-Ritz assumed modes analysis. The models were used to refine the design of the test-bed as well as to model the coupled strucmral-acoustic dynamics. The models predict that the test-bed will have a modal structure commensurate with experimental identifications on existing aircraft...|$|R
