5000|$|Historically, {{deep sea}} diving helmets {{ranged from the}} no bolt to two bolt to four bolt helmets; helmets with six, eight, or 12 bolts; and Two-Three, Twelve-Four, and Twelve-Six bolt helmets. Bolts being the method of {{securing}} the helmet to the diving suit. The helmet could also be secured to the breastplate (corselet) by bolts {{as in the case}} of US twelve-four helmets (12 bolts to the suit, four bolts seal helmet to corselet). The no bolt helmet used a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>clamp</b> to secure the helmet to corselet over the suit. Swedish helmets were distinctive for using a neck ring instead of a corselet, a pioneer of modern diving equipment but hugely cumbersome and uncomfortable for the diver. This equipment is commonly referred to as [...] "heavy gear." ...|$|E

Yield of undistorted LiF crystals is almost 100 percent, even when cleaved section is only 1 / 32 inch thick. Machine contains spring-activated hammer that limits penetration of blade and controls shock that cleaves crystal. Fixture with <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>clamps</b> precisely locates and holds crystal, restraining it in ideal position for cleaving. Crystal then splays apart...|$|R
40|$|A {{machine is}} {{disclosed}} for cleaving hard crystals. A typical example {{of which is}} lithium fluoride, with prcision and uniformity and includes vertical axis positioning control means for an adjustable spring tension guided hammer mechanism employed to strike an anvil. A crystal cleaving shock wave transmitted to a cleaving blade is generated having an angulated cleaving edge in contact with {{one corner of the}} crystal. Connection between the anvil and the blade is by means of a pair of vertical shafts held in substantially friction free engagement by two pairs of adjustable linear bearings. An underlying crystal holding fixture with horizontal position control means includes a zero reference stop face for the crystal and opposing <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>clamping</b> and vertical positioning elements which are precisely guided...|$|R

An extra <b>spring-loaded</b> circular <b>clamp</b> is often used around the large-diameter o-rings {{to prevent them from}} rolling off from the centering ring during mounting.|$|R

The tool comprises rigid and compliant pads attached to a <b>spring-loaded</b> <b>clamp.</b> The pads are shaped {{to conform to the}} specimen surface to which the gauge is to be bonded. The shape of the pads permits the tool to align itself to the specimen and to maintain alignment of the gauge to the specimen during the bond curing process. A simplified method of attaching a strain gauge is provided by use of the tool...|$|E

30|$|The materials, methods, {{and designs}} used for {{packaging}} vary widely {{depending on the}} device and application. For example, silicon microcantilevers are loaded into AFMs using <b>clamps,</b> <b>spring-loaded</b> clips, or adhesive gels, but other devices require custom-designed packages for electrical connections, thermal interfaces, microfluidic manifolds, or vacuum packaging to maintain the resonator at low pressure[16]. The dissipation due to all components associated with the supporting frame and package is collectively called boundary damping. There are three main mechanisms of boundary damping: (i) support losses or anchor losses due to the radiation of elastic waves (or stress waves) from the resonator into the supporting frame[20 – 35]; (ii) microsliding at the interfaces between the resonator and supporting frame, and between the supporting frame and package[61]; and (iii) viscoelasticity in the gels and adhesives used to bond the supporting frame to the package[9]. (The term clamping loss is frequently encountered in the literature. Depending upon the context, it can refer either to stress-wave radiation or to microsliding).|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and optimisation of automated fabric preforming processes {{is critical for}} the adoption of composite materials for low cost, high volume applications. This thesis presents {{the development of a}} numerical material model to simulate the forming of 2 D fabric plies into complex 3 D shapes. The material model has been used to evaluate the feasibility of using matched-tool forming and double diaphragm forming, to manufacture low cost fabric preforms suitable for liquid moulding processes. The research has focused on two main aspects: (I) fabric characterisation and modelling and (II) process simulation and optimisation. The forming behaviour of woven fabrics and non-crimp fabrics (NCF) has been investigated to understand the deformation mechanisms and the cause of defects, in order to seek feasible solutions for defect reduction. A non-orthogonal constitutive relation has been developed to capture the nonlinear material behaviour, which was implemented in an explicit finite element model and used to refine the forming process. Results from the material model indicate that pillar stitched NCFs are not as compliant as woven fabrics of the same areal mass. The likelihood of defects is therefore higher for the NCF and the shear behaviour is axisymmetric due to the influence of the stitch yarn. The NCF material exhibits two types of wrinkling during matched tool forming; out-of-plane wrinkling at the ply level (macro-scale wrinkling) induced by excessive shear, and in-plane wrinkling at the bundle level (meso-scale wrinkling) caused by fibre compression. Stitch rupture can also occur at high shear angles, which can lead to further localised wrinkling. Fabric bridging is the dominant defect in large curvature regions when using double diaphragm forming (DDF), and wrinkling was found to be generally lower than in matched-tool forming. The model has been used to successfully identify the cause of all of these defects in NCF preforms manufactured by DDF, and has been used to optimise preform geometry and process parameters to mitigate these problems. Darts were added to preforms to alleviate fabric bridging and improve surface conformity, using the tensile stress in the yarns to identify suitable positions and orientations, minimising the effect on the mechanical performance of the component. An optimisation methodology has been developed for placing local inter-ply stitches on multi-ply preforms, by coupling the FE analysis with a genetic algorithm. The stitches enable multiple plies to be joined together to aid robotic handling and the optimisation routine ensures that the placement of the stitches does not adversely affect the formability of the preform. Results indicate that whilst the inter-ply stitches affect the shear distribution at a global level, the formability of a multi-ply preform can be improved compared to the unstitched counterpart by optimising the pattern of through-thickness stitches. A two-step optimisation method was also developed to optimise the boundary conditions for a matched tool forming scenario. <b>Spring-loaded</b> <b>clamps</b> were used to provide in-plane tension in the fabric plies during forming, rather than using a blank holder to induce tension through friction, providing an opportunity to reduce preform size and therefore waste. The optimisation algorithm was used to determine the location and size of the clamps around the blank perimeter and the stiffness of the attached springs. It was shown that this method can effectively homogenise the global shear angle distribution, reducing the peak shear angle compared to using a segmented blank holder...|$|R
