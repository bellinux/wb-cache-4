5|$|The {{sinking of}} the {{hospital}} ship AHSCentaur on 14May1943 with heavy loss of life led the Advisory War Council to <b>seek</b> <b>information</b> from the RAN and RAAF on the actions being taken to protect shipping. While the RAN acknowledged that the Bathurst-class corvettes that made up most of its escort force were too slow, it argued that the losses suffered by escorted convoys were no worse than those {{in other parts of}} the world. Despite the Navy's assurances, Australia's anti-submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between the RAN, RAAF and the United States Navy. The Australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to British and United States ASW doctrine by fully implementing the tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of the war.|$|E

This has produced a variety of names, frequently drawn from volunteers' favourite books, movies, musical groups, family and friends, historical figures and geographical locations. Animal Planet sometimes renamed the meerkats for narration, arguing that researchers' names [...] were too limited, often relating to spices and food condiments. Because of these changes, fans of the series who <b>seek</b> <b>information</b> on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project website sometimes have trouble locating particular animals.

The national NGO “Vstrecha” [...] (HIV-prevention group for gay men) reported about those practices in Brest and Gomel. Police officers refuse to register cases of brutality committed against sexual minorities and do not conduct investigations that would seek criminal responsibility from the perpetrators of crimes motivated by homophobic prejudice. Lambda Belarus reported many cases of brutality against lesbians and gays and passive behaviour of police in all regions of the country. Police have conducted unprovoked actions in bars frequented by homosexuals. AILGBT-Belarus, “Vstrecha”, Lambda Belarus and lesbian group “YANA” reported about those practices in Gomel and Minsk.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters viewed Goetz as a {{hero for}} {{standing}} up to his attackers and defending himself {{in an environment where}} the police were increasingly viewed as ineffective in combating crime. The Guardian Angels, a volunteer patrol group of mostly black and Hispanic teenagers, collected thousands of dollars from subway riders toward a legal defense fund for Goetz. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a civil rights organization, supported Goetz. Its director, Roy Innis, a member of the National Rifle Association's governing board, offered to raise defense money, saying Goetz was [...] "the avenger for all of us," [...] and calling for a volunteer force of armed civilians to patrol the streets. The prior criminal convictions of three of the four men (and the published accounts of such) prevented them from gaining much sympathy from many people. A special hotline set up by police to <b>seek</b> <b>information</b> was swamped by calls supporting the shooter and calling him a hero. Harvard Professor of Government James Q. Wilson explained the broad sentiment by saying, [...] "It may simply indicate that there are no more liberals on the crime and law-and-order issue in New York City, because they've all been mugged." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court in 1999.

When the case was settled, Hussein Ibish, director of communications for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), claimed that the ADL had gathered data [...] "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations". ADL national director Abraham Foxman called the ADC's claims [...] "absolutely untrue", saying that, [...] "if it were true, they would have won their case", and noted that no court found the ADL guilty of any wrongdoing. The ADL released a statement saying that the settlement [...] "explicitly recognizes ADL's right to gather information in any lawful and constitutionally protected manner, which we have always done and will continue to do". John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt claim that the organization, rather than defending Jews from bigotry, was targeting individuals critical of Israel or of U.S. support for Israel.|$|E

2500|$|The 2013–2017 Manual of the Church of the Nazarene {{states that}} [...] "he Church of the Nazarene, from its inception, has been {{committed}} to higher education. The church provides the college/university with students, administrative and faculty leadership, and financial and spiritual support... The church college/university, while not a local congregation, {{is an integral part}} of the church; it is an expression of the church." [...] A portion of each local church and district budget is allocated for Nazarene higher education, which subsidizes the cost of each educational zone or nation's respective institution. Globally the denomination contributed US$$23,904,271 in 2010 (a decrease of US$1,865,713 from 2009) to Nazarene educational institutions. Hence, in the United States and Canada, there is one Nazarene liberal arts college per Region. The regional colleges are Canada Region for Ambrose University College in Calgary, Alberta, Eastern USA Region for Eastern Nazarene College (ENC) in Quincy, Massachusetts, North Central USA Region for MidAmerica Nazarene University (MNU) in Olathe, Kansas, East Central USA Region for Mount Vernon Nazarene University (MVNU) in Mount Vernon, Ohio, Northwest USA Region for Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) in Nampa, Idaho, Central USA Region for Olivet Nazarene University (ONU) in Bourbonnais, Illinois, Southwest USA Region for Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU) in San Diego, California, South Central USA Region for Southern Nazarene University (SNU) in Bethany, Oklahoma, Southeast USA Region for Trevecca Nazarene University (TNU) in Nashville, Tennessee. Accompanying that logic of institutional support, there is a gentlemen's agreement between the Nazarene liberal arts colleges in the United States to not actively recruit outside their respective educational zone, requiring that a Nazarene prospective college student must first <b>seek</b> <b>information</b> from any [...] "Off-Region" [...] institution on an individual basis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the relationship between information processing style and <b>information</b> <b>seeking,</b> and its moderation by anxiety and information utility. Information about Salmonella, a potentially commonplace disease, was presented to 2960 adults. Two types of information processing were examined: preferences for analytical or heuristic processing, and preferences for immediate or delayed processing. <b>Information</b> <b>seeking</b> was captured by measuring the number of additional pieces of information sought by participants. Preferences for analytical information processing were associated positively and directly with <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> Heuristic <b>information</b> processing was associated negatively and directly with <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> The positive relationship between preferences for delayed decision making and <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> was moderated by anxiety and by information utility. Anxiety reduced the tendency to <b>seek</b> additional <b>information.</b> Information utility increased the likelihood of <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> The findings indicate that low levels of anxiety could prompt <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> However, <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> occurred even when information was perceived as useful and sufficient, suggesting that it can be a form of procrastination rather than a useful contribution to effective decision making...|$|R
