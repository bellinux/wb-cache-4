40|$|For the {{measurement}} of beam induced losses in the RF and microwaverange arising from the surface resistance of the LHC liner a dedicatedtechnique has been developed. A sample of the liner with a typicallength of about one meter is converted into a <b>shielded</b> <b>pair</b> coaxialresonator. The <b>shielded</b> <b>pair</b> approach using two parallel innerconductors, is required as both the conductivity of these two innerconductors and the conductivity of the inner liner surface change asa function of a DC magnetic field and temperature in a cryostat. These two conductors are operated in the odd and even mode, returning two Qvalues for each resonance. There are several degrees of freedom forthe diameter and lateral spacing of these two conductors. Taking into account end effects and different sources of mechanical positioning errors, parameters for an optimum geometry are discussed and the corresponding measurement errors on the surface resistance areestimated...|$|E

40|$|An {{estimate}} of the resistive losses in the LHC beam screen is given from cold surface resistance measurements using the <b>shielded</b> <b>pair</b> technique, with particular emphasis {{on the effect of}} a high magnetic field. Two different copper coating methods, namely electro-deposition and co-lamination, have been evaluated. Experimental data are compared with theories including the anomalous skin effect and the magneto-resistance effect. It is shown whether the theory underestimates or not the losses depends strongly on the RRR value, on the magnetic field and on the surface characteristics. In the pessimistic case and for nominal machine parameters, the estimated beam-induced resistive wall heating can be as large as 260 mW/m for two circulating beams...|$|E
40|$|The <b>shielded</b> <b>pair</b> {{resonator}} {{technique is}} {{used to measure the}} surface resistance of the copper coated LHC beam screen both at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature with a strong magnetic field up to several Teslas, like in the LHC superconducting magnets. From its concept, the RF-based measurements principle appears to be straight forward, but it turns out in practice to be very sensitive to a large number of parameters which are being described in the present report. Some practical hints are proposed to overcome these technical hitches and optimize the geometry as well. An estimate of the thermal load of the LHC beam screen is given, standing in the range 200 - 250 mW/m for two circulating beams...|$|E
