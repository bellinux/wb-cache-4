The concerted action on <b>subsoil</b> compaction in the EU and an almost identical concerted action on <b>subsoil</b> compaction in central and eastern Europe are briefly introduced. This special issue presents a selection of papers of the concluding workshop of the concerted action on <b>subsoil</b> compaction in the EU.

There was only one boat advertised for that section--a Grand Tower packet. Still, one boat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable rack-heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for personal property, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her that she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are places in New England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty dollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good--the new crop of wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places.

Then some techniques for modeling the reinforced embankment on soft <b>subsoil</b> are presented, namely, modeling the soil/reinforcement interaction behavior, embankment construction process and hydraulic conductivity variation during consolidation process of soft <b>subsoil.</b> It is demonstrated that these factors are important on simulating the behavior of the reinforced embankment on soft <b>subsoil.</b> Finally, two case histories of the reinforced embankment on soft <b>subsoil</b> are presented.

Roots were sampled at 3 times to determine the timing and extent of root growth into the compact <b>subsoil.</b> The compact treatment had a distinct layer of high strength soil at 0 · 17 - 0 · 35 m, maximum soil strength of 3 · 1 MPa at 0 · 27 m. In the loosened treatment, deep ripping reduced the maximum <b>subsoil</b> strength to 1 · 9 MPa at 0 · 35 m. The roots of both crops penetrated the compact <b>subsoil</b> approximately half-way through the vegetative growth phase of the shoots. Root growth was restricted by the compact <b>subsoil,</b> with root length densities 60 - 75 % lower than in the loosened <b>subsoil.</b> As a result, only 6 - 13 % of the total root system was present in the compact <b>subsoil.</b> The reduced root length in the <b>subsoil</b> was compensated for by increased root growth in the topsoil, for the broccoli crop only.

60|$|Addison {{wrote his}} papers as gaily {{as if he}} was going out for a holiday. When Steele’s Tatler first began his prattle, Addison, then in Ireland, caught at his friend’s notion, poured in paper after paper, and contributed the stores of his mind, the sweet fruits of his reading, the {{delightful}} gleanings of his daily observation, with a wonderful profusion, and as it seemed an almost endless fecundity. He was six-and-thirty years old: full and ripe. He had not worked crop after crop from his brain, manuring hastily, <b>subsoiling</b> indifferently, cutting and sowing and cutting again, like other luckless cultivators of letters. He had not done much as yet; a few Latin poems—graceful prolusions; a polite book of travels; a dissertation on medals, not very deep; four acts of a tragedy, a great classical exercise; and the Campaign, a large prize poem that won an enormous prize. But with his friend’s discovery of the Tatler, Addison’s calling was found, and the most delightful talker in the world began to speak. He does not go very deep: let gentlemen of a profound genius, critics accustomed to the plunge of the bathos, console themselves by thinking that he couldn’t go very deep. There are no traces of suffering in his writing. He was so good, so honest, so healthy, so cheerfully selfish, if I must use the word. There is no deep sentiment. I doubt, until after his marriage, perhaps, whether he ever lost his night’s rest or his day’s tranquillity about any woman in his life:(91) whereas poor Dick Steele had capacity enough to melt, and to languish, and to sigh, and to cry his honest old eyes out, for a dozen. His writings do not show insight into or reverence for the love of women, which I take to be, one the consequence of the other. He walks about the world watching their pretty humours, fashions, follies, flirtations, rivalries; and noting them with the most charming archness. He sees them in public, in the theatre, or the assembly, or the puppet-show; or at the toy-shop higgling for gloves and lace; or at the auction, battling together over a blue porcelain dragon, or a darling monster in japan; or at church, eyeing the width of their rivals’ hoops, or the breadth of their laces, as they sweep down the aisles. Or he looks out of his window at the “Garter” in St. James’s Street, at Ardelia’s coach, as she blazes to the Drawing-room with her coronet and six footmen; and remembering that her father was a Turkey merchant in the City, calculates how many sponges went to purchase her ear-ring, and how many drums of figs to build her coach-box; or he demurely watches behind a tree in Spring Garden as Saccharissa (whom he knows under her mask) trips out of her chair to the alley where Sir Fopling is waiting. He sees only the public life of women. Addison {{was one of the most}} resolute club-men of his day. He passed many hours daily in those haunts. Besides drinking, which, alas! is past praying for; you must know it, he owned, too, ladies that he indulged in that odious practice of smoking. Poor fellow! He was a man’s man, remember. The only woman he did know, he didn’t write about. I take it there would not have been much humour in that story.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{subsistence}} farming in Southern Africa, the Ransome Victory plough has the further disadvantage of contributing to soil degradation.

Furthermore, the repeated ploughing at the same depth has caused the formation of hardpans due to {{the weight of the}} landside pushing down on the underlying soil.

40|$|Productivity {{of grain}} crops grown under dryland {{conditions}} in north-eastern Australia depends on {{efficient use of}} rainfall and available soil moisture accumulated in the period preceding sowing. However, adverse <b>subsoil</b> conditions including high salinity, sodicity, nutrient imbalances, acidity, alkalinity, and high concentrations of chloride (Cl) and sodium (Na) in many soils of the region restrict ability of crop roots to access this stored water and nutrients. Planning for sustainable cropping systems requires identification of the most limiting constraint and understanding its interaction with other biophysical factors. We found that the primary effect of complex and variable combinations of <b>subsoil</b> constraints was to increase the crop lower limit (CLL), thereby reducing plant available water. Among chemical <b>subsoil</b> constraints, <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentration was a more effective indicator of reduced water extraction and reduced grain yields than either salinity or sodicity (ESP). Yield penalty due to high <b>subsoil</b> Cl was seasonally variable, with more in-crop rainfall (ICR) resulting in less negative impact. A conceptual model to determine realistic yield potential {{in the presence of}} <b>subsoil</b> Cl was developed from a significant positive linear relationship between CLL and <b>subsoil</b> Cl: Since grid sampling of soil to identify distribution of <b>subsoil</b> Cl, both spatially across landscape and within soil profile, is time-consuming and expensive, we found that electromagnetic induction, coupled with yield mapping and remote sensing of vegetation offers potential to rapidly identify possible <b>subsoil</b> Cl at paddock or farm scale. Plant species and cultivars were evaluated for their adaptations to <b>subsoil</b> Cl. Among winter crops, barley and triticale, followed by bread wheat, were more tolerant of high <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentrations than durum wheat. Chickpea and field pea showed a large decrease in yield with increasing <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentrations and were most sensitive of the crops tested. Cultivars of different winter crops showed minor differences in sensitivity to increasing <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentrations. Water extraction potential of oilseed crops was less affected than cereals with increasing levels of <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentrations. Among summer crops, water extraction potential of millet, mungbean, and sesame appears to be more sensitive to <b>subsoil</b> Cl than that of sorghum and maize; however, the differences were significant only to 0. 7 m. Among pasture legumes, lucerne was more tolerant to high <b>subsoil</b> Cl concentrations than the others studied. Surface applied gypsum significantly improved wheat grain yield on soils with ESP > 6 in surface soil (0 – 0. 10 m). Subsurface applied gypsum at 0. 20 – 0. 30 m depth did not affect grain yield {{in the first year of}} application; however, there was a significant increase in grain yield in following years.

Annual <b>subsoiling</b> resulted in reduced bulk density compared to biennial <b>subsoiling,</b> triennial <b>subsoiling,</b> or no <b>subsoiling.</b> Reductions in draft force were also found for annual <b>subsoiling.</b> However, cotton yield results {{over a two-year period}} from tillage three-years previous, two-years previous, and one year previous found no differences...|$|E
40|$|In {{arable farming}} systems, the term ‘subsoil’ {{refers to the}} soil beneath the tilled or {{formerly}} tilled soil horizon whereas the latter one is denoted as ‘topsoil’. To date, most agronomic and plant nutrition studies have widely neglected <b>subsoil</b> processes involved in nutrient acquisition by crop roots. Based on our current knowledge it can be assumed that <b>subsoil</b> properties such as comparatively high bulk density, low air permeability, and poverty of organic matter, nutrients and microbial biomass are obviously adverse for nutrient acquisition, and sometimes <b>subsoils</b> provide as little as less than 10 % of annual nutrient uptake in fertilised arable fields. Nevertheless, there is also strong evidence indicating that <b>subsoil</b> can contribute to {{more than two-thirds of}} the plant nutrition of N, P and K, especially when the topsoil is dry or nutrient-depleted. Based on the existing literature, nutrient acquisition from arable <b>subsoils</b> may be conceptualised into three major process components: (I) mobilisation from the <b>subsoil,</b> (II) translocation to the shoot and long-term accumulation in the Ap horizon and (III) re-allocation to the <b>subsoil.</b> The quantitative estimation of nutrient acquisition from the <b>subsoil</b> requires the linking of field experiments with mathematical modelling approaches on different spatial scales including Process Based Models for the field scale and FunctionaleStructural Plant Models for the plant scale. Possibilities to modify <b>subsoil</b> properties by means of agronomic management are limited, but ‘subsoiling’ e i. e. deep mechanical loosening e as well as the promotion of biopore formation are two potential strategies for increasing access to <b>subsoil</b> resources for crop roots in arable soils. The quantitative role of biopores in the nutrient acquisition from the <b>subsoil</b> is still unclear, and more research is needed to determine the bioaccessibility of nutrients in <b>subsoil</b> horizons...|$|R

40|$|<b>Subsoil</b> {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. Wheel loads are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of <b>subsoil</b> compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no <b>subsoil</b> compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with wheel loads lower than the carrying capacity of the <b>subsoil</b> is allowed. This implies that <b>subsoil</b> stress caused by wheel load should not exceed {{the strength of the}} <b>subsoil.</b> Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the <b>subsoil.</b> One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for wheel loads and inflation pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable wheel loads and subsequent uneconomical solutions or <b>subsoil</b> compaction. Adequate drainage of soils is a prerequisite for reduced <b>subsoil</b> compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on adjusting wheel loads to the carrying capacity of the <b>subsoils.</b> ...|$|R
