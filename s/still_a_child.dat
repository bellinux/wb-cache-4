5|$|Nikolai Ge {{was born}} in Voronezh City, to a Russian noble family of French origin. His {{grandfather}} emigrated to Russia in the 18th century. His parents {{died when he was}} <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> so Nikolai was raised by his serf nurse. He graduated from the First Kiev Gymnasium and studied at the physics-mathematics department of Kiev University and Saint Petersburg University.|$|E
5|$|Teuruarii IV, born Epatiana a Teuruarii (c. 1879 – 1933), was {{the last}} King of Rurutu, an island within the larger Austral Islands archipelago, who ruled from around 1886 until the {{annexation}} of the island to France in 1900. Proclaimed king upon his father's abdication while <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> his mother ruled as regent. During this regency the Church of Moerari was consecrated and {{the death penalty was}} abolished.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{colors of}} the club (when it was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>children</b> {{football}} institution) had been inspired on Buenos Aires' football club Vélez Sarsfield, the white and blue shirt. Likewise, the rugby jersey design was primarily taken from {{a picture of a}} French team of Perpignan. This jersey was worn for 32 years until it was replaced by its current design made by architects Tosi and Cano.|$|R
5|$|Bjaðmunjo Mýrjartaksdóttir (also {{known in}} Old Norse as Bjaðmynja; and in Gaelic as Ben Muman, Bé Binn, Blathmuine, and Bláthmín; fl. 1102/1103) was a {{daughter}} of a Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. In 1102 whilst <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> {{she was married to}} Sigurðr, son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway. At this time, Magnús appears to have been in the process of setting up his son as king over the Earldom of Orkney, the Kingdom of the Isles, and the Kingdom of Dublin. The marriage itself temporarily bound Muirchertach and Magnús together as allies before the latter's death the following year. Sigurðr thereupon repudiated Bjaðmunjo, and left for Scandinavia, where he proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his brothers.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, {{who attempted to}} establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, {{such as the use}} of Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{was born}} in Panama City, into a {{relatively}} poor mestizo, or mixed-race, family with Native American, African, and Spanish heritage. Noriega's mother has been variously described as a cook or a laundress, while his father, Ricaurte Noriega, was an accountant. Neither had a lengthy presence in his life: his mother died of tuberculosis when he was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Noriega was brought up by a godmother in a one-room apartment in the slum area of Terraplén. Authors and journalists have suggested that Noriega {{was in fact the}} illegitimate son of his father and his father's domestic worker, whose family name was Moreno.|$|E

5|$|Tsarina Alexandra chose Maria to {{accompany}} Tsar Nicholas II and herself to Yekaterinburg {{when the family}} was briefly separated in April 1918. Maria had grown from a child to a woman {{during the years of}} captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady in waiting, and the Tsarina felt she could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sviatoslav's family life. It is {{possible}} {{that he was not}} the only (or the eldest) son of his parents. The Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945 mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga. The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by Vasily Tatishchev. He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility. George Vernadsky was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency. Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the eldest son of Igor. At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions. Her influence, however, did not extend to his religious observance.|$|E
5|$|When {{eight years}} old, Modi {{discovered}} the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, {{popularly known as}} Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. Engaged while <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage {{at the same time}} he graduated from high school. The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967.|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his {{teachers}} in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al-Maʿarri was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his Risālat al-ghufrān. Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, Al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Peggy Rockman {{had three}} older sisters, {{all of whom}} married Jampu Jakamarra, to whom Peggy herself would also later be married. Her family first settled {{alongside}} white Australians — a couple mining gold in the Tanami Desert — when she was aged between six and eight. While <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> herself, she worked caring for the mining family's children, during which time she became a proficient English speaker. After the mine was abandoned, Peggy Rockman's family returned to a nomadic existence in the region, before settling for a time at a pastoral station called Gordon Downs. Around 1952, the family {{was taken by the}} government's Native Affairs Branch to a new settlement called Lajamanu, in the central desert west of Tennant Creek, Northern Territory. There, Peggy Rockman was required to work full-time in the settlement's kitchens, being paid with meals, and occasionally also with rations. At the settlement, she had three children with Jampu Jakamarra.|$|E
5|$|The Hundred Years' War in the 14th and 15thcenturies {{was fought}} between {{the kings of}} England and France over the {{succession}} to the French throne. The war ended in 1453 when the English were finally ejected from France, {{but in the early}} 15thcentury the English under King HenryV made significant territorial gains. The Treaty of Troyes in 1420 made HenryV the heir apparent to the French throne but when the French king, CharlesVI, and HenryV died in the space of two months in 1422 the issue of succession was again uncertain. The English supported HenryV's son, HenryVI who was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> while the French supported recognised CharlesVII, the Dauphin of France. Between 1427 and 1450 Château de Chinon was the residence of Charles, when Touraine was virtually the only territory left to him in France, the rest being occupied by the Burgundians or the English.|$|E

50|$|Halil (1347-1362). When <b>still</b> only <b>a</b> <b>child</b> he was {{captured}} by Genoese pirates for ransom. The Byzantine emperor and his future father-in-law John V Palaeologus was instrumental in his eventual release. Halil married Irene, who was a daughter of John V Palaeologus and Helena Kantakouzene.|$|R
5|$|Elgar began {{composing}} when <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> and all {{his life}} he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which {{he and his brother}} played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.|$|E
5|$|Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma {{was born}} at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. The unusual name Zita was given her after a popular Italian Saint {{who had lived in}} Tuscany in the 13th century. She was the third {{daughter}} and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Zita's father had lost his throne {{as a result of the}} movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young). Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita's mother. The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert's 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore (a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio) and his castle in Schwarzau in lower Austria. It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria moving to Pianore in the Winter and returning in the Summer. To move between them, they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings.|$|E
