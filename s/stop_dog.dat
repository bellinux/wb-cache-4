The whole system applies incomplete gear mechanism to save transmission space, {{and the design}} of <b>stop</b> <b>dog</b> mechanism can not only realize operating mode conversion under any condition, but aslo freely design force transfer characteristic and angle transfer characteristic of vehicle steering system, thus it is a renovation in steering system of engineering vehicles...|$|E

25|$|Dog types {{today are}} {{recognized}} {{in the names of}} Group or Section categories of dog breed registries. But dog types have not disappeared. Types of feral dogs are being discovered and registered as breeds, as with the New Guinea Singing Dog and Carolina Dog. Types re-emerge from mixes of breeds, like the Longdogs from Lurchers and Greyhounds. Named types of dogs that are not dog breeds are still being used where function or use is more important than appearance, especially for herding or hunting, as with the herding dog types of New Zealand that are described by their exact function (Heading <b>Dog,</b> Huntaway, <b>Stopping</b> <b>Dog,</b> etc. - functional terms, not necessarily breed names).|$|R

5000|$|The {{card punch}} had a maximum rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the card punch, the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic card punch mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe <b>stopping</b> <b>dog</b> clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The card punch had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R

50|$|Individual {{variations}} in temperament, pain sensitivity and susceptibility to startle of dogs, means that shock settings {{must be carefully}} adjusted to produce a shock that is perceived by the dog as only just aversive enough to <b>stop</b> the <b>dog</b> engaging in the unwanted behaviour. Normally salient stimuli, such as noises, commands and even shocks, may {{have no effect on}} a dog that is highly aroused and focused on an activity such as hunting.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the stray}} dogs in Bucharest are seen {{crossing}} the large streets at pedestrian crosswalks. The dogs have probably noticed that when humans cross streets at such markings, cars tend to <b>stop.</b> The <b>dogs</b> have accustomed {{themselves to the}} flow of pedestrian and automobile traffic; they sit patiently with {{the people at the}} curb when they are stopped for a red light, and then cross with them as if a daily routine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Frona cried, <b>stopping</b> the <b>dogs</b> {{and coming}} up to her. [...] "You are hurt? Can I help you?" [...] she queried, though the {{stranger}} shook her head. [...] "But you mustn't sit there. It is nearly seventy below, and you'll freeze in a few minutes. Your cheeks are bitten already." [...] She rubbed the afflicted parts vigorously with a mitten of snow, and then looked down on the warm returning glow.|$|R
5000|$|... "Freezing" [...] is {{when the}} <b>dog</b> <b>stops</b> {{abruptly}} and remains completely still, often looking {{out of the corner}} of his eye. This behavior is believed to have something to do with hunting behavior - when the prey is running, the dog attacks. Once the prey <b>stops,</b> the <b>dog</b> will <b>stop</b> too. We can often see this when dogs are chasing cats. This behavior, however, is used in several different situations. When you get angry and aggressive and appear threatening, the dog will often freeze and not move in order to help you calm down. Other times the dog may walk slowly, freeze, and then move slowly again. Very often a <b>dog</b> will <b>stop</b> and remain still when someone is approaching. Should a dog be in a conflict situation with a human or dog and is unable to escape, freezing may be one attempt to calm the other dog or person.|$|R
