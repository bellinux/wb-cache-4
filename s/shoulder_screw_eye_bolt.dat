50|$|Wire eye lags (also called <b>screw</b> thread <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>eye</b> <b>screws,</b> or turned/bent <b>eye</b> lags) have a {{wood screw}} thread {{for use in}} wood or lag anchors. Like wire <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> wire <b>eye</b> lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|R
6000|$|They {{made their}} camp {{for two nights}} with these {{friendly}} people. They are as dull and stupid in most {{things as they are}} artful at fishing. But they are, beyond even the Munza-mulgars, mischievous mimics. Even the little ones would come mincing and peeping with wisps of moss and grass stuck on their faces for eyebrows and whiskers, their long tails cocked over their <b>shoulders,</b> their <b>eyes</b> <b>screwed</b> up, in imitation of the Men of the Mountains. Lank old Thimble laughed himself hoarse at these children. At night they beat little wood drums of different notes round their fires, making a sort of wearisome harmony. They also play at many sports--"Fish in the Ring," [...] "A tail, a tail, a tail!" [...] and [...] "Here sups Sullilulli." [...] But I will not describe them, for they are just such games as are played all the world over by Oomgar and Mulgar alike. They are all, however, young and old, hale and paralysed, incorrigible thieves and gluttons, and rarely comb themselves.|$|R
50|$|Machinery <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are fully}} {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. <b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> without a shoulder {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> one <b>screwed</b> into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to be <b>screwed</b> in or out simultaneously, without twisting the <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> or attached cables.|$|R
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are a <b>screw</b> with a loop {{on one end}} and threads on {{the other}} end. <b>Screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are {{commonly}} used to attach cables to objects, for instance attaching a string {{to the back of}} a painting to allow the painting to hang from a nail on a wall. Long-shanked <b>screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are termed 'vine eyes' and are used to attach support wires to wooden fence posts when growing soft fruit or grape vines, the plants then being tied to the wires.|$|R
5000|$|A cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{typically}} {{used as a}} structural tie down [...] in building construction where the <b>eye</b> of the <b>bolt</b> must be fastened {{to a point that}} cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> made by bending a rod or wire into a loop {{are only}} {{suitable}} for light duty applications, as heavy loads {{can cause the}} eye to open. For high loads, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with forged or welded loops should be chosen, as they can withstand loads up to the tensile strength of the material {{of which they are}} made.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are made}} with {{different}} degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The SL range, {{usually with}} moulded heads and held {{together}} with either string or <b>screw</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rock monsters have a flip top head, {{revealing}} the crystal stored inside. Keyring variants of rock monsters sent with monthly Lego magazine subscriptions have a fixed metal <b>screw</b> <b>eye</b> {{through the top}} of the head, and do not open. The <b>screw</b> <b>eye</b> can not be removed. It rotates, but does not withdraw from the plastic. Although there is a method of removing the metal screw.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} of several trigger {{mechanisms}} is two <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> and a peg through both <b>bolts.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the frame, locking above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|R
50|$|Today, cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are now {{typically}} made by welding a cranked and {{threaded rod}} to a {{heavy gauge steel}} washer.|$|R
50|$|The SS range, {{similar to}} the LS range but with wooden toggle feet and <b>screw</b> <b>eyes</b> holding the body together.|$|R
50|$|Heavy forged <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with a {{continuous}} eye may be forged with an integral shoulder, allowing their use for heavy off-axis loads.|$|R
5000|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{used to be}} made by bending an [...] "eye" [...] {{into the}} end of a rod that was {{threaded}} at the other end.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{can also}} be used to tie the top plate of a house frame {{directly}} to house supports, using rod couplers and steel extension rods.|$|R
5000|$|She {{designed}} {{a necklace of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, meant to represent [...] "strength without a fist"; she gave {{the first of these}} to Arlene Raven and Judy Chicago when they started the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1972. Since then she has given them to other women with whom she shares a vision of the creation of women's culture. Members of the Feminist Studio Workshop of 1978-79 also made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. The feminist art group Sisters of Jam (Mikaela & Moa Krestesen) turned the necklace into a mobile monument; they see the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> [...] "as a symbol for the work already done but also as an encouragement for the work that is not yet completed." [...] Sisters of Jam also did the installation [...] "Hello Sheila", which features an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, at the Survival Kit Festival in Umeå in 2014.|$|R

5000|$|Espalier {{plants on}} solid walls are usually {{installed}} six to twelve {{inches from the}} base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and pest control. [...] Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material. [...] Masonry walls are ideal for placing U-bolts, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> or <b>eye</b> <b>screws,</b> anchored with either plastic plugs or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints. [...] Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard line-throwing gun. Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>screwed</b> into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} {{installed}} into masonry and so versions that {{form their own}} anchor bolt are commonly available. Most of these screw into some form of shield anchor. Some lightweight forms are not screwed, but rely on just the pull on the ring itself to expand the anchor.|$|R
5000|$|A ring <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with {{a captive}} ring passing through it. The loose ring is articulated, {{such that it}} can rotate {{in at least one}} axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum {{obstruction}} when [...] "flat".|$|R
60|$|There {{was a knock}} and a ring at the door, timid, as befitted a clergyman; and the servant-girl {{showed in}} Mr Evans. He was a thin and short young man, red faced, with a long nose and weak eyes, looking underfed and cold, keeping his <b>shoulders</b> <b>screwed</b> up in a {{perpetual}} shiver. He was an earnest, God-fearing man, spending much money in charities, and waging constant war against the encroachments of the Scarlet Woman.|$|R

Is later revived and given enhanced speed. Magura highly resembles Neo Ranga and its revived form {{is similar to}} Neo Ranga's original form of Ranga.|$|R
50|$|A cabin hook is a {{hooked bar}} that engages into a staple. The bar is usually {{attached}} permanently to a ring or staple that is fixed with screws or nails to woodwork or a {{wall at the}} same level as the <b>eye</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>screw</b> is usually screwed into the adjacent wall or onto the door itself. Used to hold a cupboard, door or gate open or shut.|$|R

Powers include {{creating}} {{cold weather}} by redirecting snow, burrowing, reflective ice armor, green <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> an ice cannon on the back, a circular saw in each shoulder, freezing breath, and flight by head and limb retraction {{to execute a}} spin attack. Dr. Jango refers to snow re-director as the Super Freezer.|$|R
50|$|Stress positions: Prisoners {{are forced}} to stand, handcuffed and with their feet {{shackled}} to an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight {{to be placed on}} just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.|$|R
