40|$|The {{problem of}} Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> {{is defined as}} an {{optimization}} problem over the space of all possible network structures. For low-dimensional data, optimal <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> approaches exist. For high-dimensional data, <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> remains a significant challenge. Most commonly, approaches to high-dimensional <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> employ a reduced search space and apply hill climbing methods to find high-scoring network structures. But even the reduced search space contains many local optima so that local search methods are unable to find near-optimal network structures. Instead of focusing on search space reduction, {{as most of the}} previous work in this area, we propose to replace the greedy search schemes with more effective search methods. We show that for high-dimensional data the proposed search method finds significantly better structures than other leading approaches to <b>structure</b> <b>learning.</b> ...|$|R

In Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> for {{incomplete}} data set, {{a common problem}} is too many attributes causing low efficiency and high computation complexity.

The single cell {{nature of the}} data ensures a very large dataset size, providing a statistically robust dataset for <b>structure</b> <b>learning.</b> Moreover, the approach is easily scaled to many conditions in high throughput. However, the technology suffers from a dimensionality constraint: at the cutting edge, only about 12 protein species can be measured per cell, far from sufficient for most signaling pathways. Because the <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm (in practice) requires that all variables be measured together simultaneously, this restricts <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> {{to the number of}} variables that constitute the flow cytometer’s upper dimensionality limit. To address this problem, we present here an algorithm that enables <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> for sparsely distributed data, allowing <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> beyond the measurement technology’s upper dimensionality limit for simultaneously measurable variables. The algorithm assesses pairwise (or n-wise) dependencies, constructs “Markov neighborhoods ” for each variable based on these dependencies, measures each variable in the context of its neighborhood, and performs <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> using a constrained search...|$|R

40|$|This {{theoretical}} {{paper is}} concerned with the <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> limit for Gaussian Markov random fields from i. i. d. samples. The com-mon strategy is applying the Fano method to a family of restricted ensembles. The effi-ciency of this method, however, depends cru-cially on selected restricted ensembles. To break through this limitation, we analyze the whole graph ensemble from a group theoret-ical viewpoint. The key ingredient of our ap-proach is the invariance of orthogonal group actions on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then establish the connection of the learning limit and eigenvalues of con-centration matrices, which further leads to a sharper <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> limit. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> problem via inheren-t symmetries of the whole ensemble.

40|$|Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> is the {{notoriously}} difficult problem of discovering a Bayesian network that optimally represents a given set of training data. In this paper we study the computational worst-case complexity of exact Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> under graph theoretic {{restrictions on the}} (directed) super-structure. The super-structure is an undirected graph that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks. We introduce the directed super-structure as a natural generalization of its undirected counterpart. Our results apply to several variants of score-based Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> where the score of a network decomposes into local scores of its nodes. Results: We show that exact Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> {{can be carried out}} in non-uniform polynomial time if the super-structure has bounded treewidth, and in linear time if in addition the super-structure has bounded maximum degree. Furthermore, we show that if the directed super-structure is acyclic, then exact Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> can be carried out in quadratic time. We complement these positive results with a number of hardness results. We show that both restrictions (treewidth and degree) are essential and cannot be dropped without loosing uniform polynomial time tractability (subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption). Similarly, exact Bayesian network <b>structure</b> <b>learning</b> remains NP-hard for "almost acyclic" directed super-structures. Furthermore, we show that the restrictions remain essential if we do not search for a globally optimal network but aim to improve a given network by means of at most k arc additions, arc deletions, or arc reversals (k-neighborhood local search) ...|$|R
