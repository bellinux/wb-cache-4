The principal takeaway of the first section is that Title II as enacted left most of these issues unanswered. By contrast, the FDICâ€™s new <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> strategy, which is introduced in the second section, can be seen as addressing nearly all of them. The third and fourth sections point out some of the limitations of <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry,</b> first by highlighting potential pitfalls and distortions and then by explaining that <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> does not end the too-big-to-fail problem and would not reduce worrisome concentration in the financial services industry. The final section turns to bankruptcy, which remains the strategy of choice for resolving even systemically important financial institutions and considers how a single-entry-style strategy could be used in bankruptcy. Indeed, the strategy harkens back to the original procedure used to reorganize American railroads well over a century ago...|$|R

The redesign process includes the establishment of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> for referrals. The context is one of high demand for the services with referrals from a broad range of sources. These sub-acute ambulatory care services require specialised areas of expertise for effective service delivery and optimal client outcomes. Government and organisational requirements of optimising efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of all services and clinicians, have been drivers for change in the existing processes. This paper describes and evaluates the previously existing system.

The <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> is a place where people in need of long term care visit, have their needs assessed, and obtain information about different long term care service options. The supporters argue that by implementing the <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> system, it is possible to reduce the total long term care cost by directing many potential institutional care recipients to better-fitted home and community based care. This paper is about a system dynamics model built for a government agency that is about to propose the policy to key decision makers.

This study examined agency process and client-perceived health in a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry</b> case managed program in a community health centre. The participatory evaluative model involved a dossier review, interviews with workers, and a description of client functioning using the SF- 12 (TM). Examination of files (N = 100) revealed that objectives were not being obtained: client involvement was low, services were late, and files were poorly completed. Only 14 (9 %) of clients were referred for the SF- 12 (TM); further investigation revealed systemic difficulties such as lost clients (N = 4). Worker interviews (N = 12) explained that heavy caseloads result in reactive services, poor completion of case management functions, and service implications for clients. Strengths included the multi-disciplinary approach and <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of <b>entry.</b> Recommendations include a cost benefit analysis, an outcome measure, a caseload standard and a quality assurance model that assures accountability and monitoring...|$|R
