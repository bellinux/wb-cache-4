Also, the regulations make a distinction between new and existing tanks. Effective December 6, 1995, standards for controlling volatile organic air emissions will apply to non-exempt HazW tanks. HazW tanks will have to be equipped with a cover or floating roof, or be designed to operate as a closed system, to be in compliance with the air emission control requirements. This information brief describes those tanks that are subject to the <b>Subpart</b> <b>J</b> requirements, and will also discuss secondary containment, inspection, restrictions on waste storage, release response, and closure requirements associated with regulated HazW tanks...|$|E

The TRA- 604 laboratory components addressed in this closure plan were deferred from the TRA- 630 Catch Tank System closure plan due to ongoing laboratory operations in the areas requiring closure actions. The TRA- 604 laboratory components include the TRA- 604 laboratory warm wastewater drain piping, undersink drains, subheaders, and the east TRA- 604 laboratory drain header. Potentially contaminated surfaces located beneath the TRA- 604 laboratory warm wastewater drain piping and beneath the island sinks located in Laboratories 126 and 128 (located in TRA- 661) are also addressed in this closure plan. The TRA- 604 laboratory components will be closed in accordance with the interim status requirements of the Hazardous Waste Management Act/Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as implemented by the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act 58. 01. 05. 009 and 40 Code of Federal Regulations 265, <b>Subparts</b> G and <b>J.</b> This closure plan presents the closure performance standards and the methods for achieving those standards...|$|R

S., depending on the product and its proper application. Over the last few years alternative oil spill response methods have been gaining in acceptance and use in the field among first responders, industry, state and federal agencies, Congress, and the entire oil spill response community. EPA sets policy and guidance for the proper use and authority to use these products. Manufactueres and vendors of these products have become more aware of this acceptance evidenced by the frequency that EPA is contacted to provide information on the listing process and EPA policy regarding their use. The number of applications to add new products to the <b>Subpart</b> <b>J</b> Product Schedule have increased over the last year. <b>Subpart</b> <b>J</b> is very prescriptive and specific in directing mandacturers to perform the proper test within the proper protocols, yet many applications are rejected or need modification due to errors in testing procedures or data reporting. This paper will address the data needed to list a product under each categoq and will clanfy issues related to the Product Schedule. It will also address the policies that EPA uses to enforce the <b>Subpart</b> <b>J</b> regulation. The author has managed the Product Schedule for over three years and his experience an...|$|E

40|$|The Analytical Services Organization (ASO), Union Valley Sample Preparation Facility (UVSPF), {{provides}} analytical {{testing in}} support of the Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Operations (ORO), and associated sites. Samples generated on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) are routinely received at the WSPF for analytical evaluatiotiidentification. Many of these samples are polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) regulated from a source or being sent to the facility to determine PCB content. PCB laboratory wastes in solid and liquid form are generated during the evaluation of these materials, requiring the WSPF staff to maintain formal storage areas for staging the materials prior to off-site shipment for disposal. The purpose of this report is to fulfill the requirements set forth in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 761. 180 (a), <b>Subpart</b> <b>J,</b> which requires owners or operators of a facility using or storing PCBS to prepare an annual inventory document by July 1 of the current year which covers the previous calendar year. This report provides documentation of the inventory of PCB materials/wastes that were generated, stored for dispos~ and shipped off site for disposal for the period January 1, 1997, to January 1, 1998.

Especially there is JAR-FCL 1 (2) <b>Subpart</b> <b>J</b> described and there are introduced Learning Objectives, that „represent an indication of the depth and scope of knowledge“ [3] required by the JAA Pilot Li-censes. Also in the beginning there is the brief summary of such requirements for the Air Law and Regulations. In the middle part, actually I’m making the comparison of these requirements. Concretely I’m pointing out the differences between JAR-FCL 1 Amendment 2 and JAR-FCL 1 Amendment 7 (including Learning Objectives). There are compared both content and structuring stand points, primarily fo-cusing on the basic topics, secondarily on the more detailed parts. Finally, on the basis of comparison there are reviewed realized differences and also there is the new Air Law and Regulations course syllabus introduced. Original wording of the historic and today‘s knowledge requirements defined by JAR-FCL 1 Amendment 2 and JAR-FCL 1 Amendment 7 (along with the Learning Objectives) are placed in the CD appendix. In the printed appendix, there is the new course syllabus inserted...|$|E

The rule provides some flexibility by allowing each state to set its own procedures and policies to comply with the rule and by allowing states to seek solutions which are commensurate with the severity of the potential impacts and require the most aggressive planning for 2 ̆ 2 Significant Projects. 2 ̆ 2 This report provides a synthesis of what is currently being done by STAs across the country to plan, manage, operate, and evaluate work zone safety and mobility. The research to develop this synthesis was broken into three distinct steps. The first step was to review the literature regarding work zone safety and mobility strategies. The second was to conduct interviews with staff members at 30 STAs. The last step was to conduct more detailed case studies of three STAs. The authors found that only California and Ohio (there may be more states than this, but these were the two discovered) had really thought about work zone impacts throughout the life-cycle of project development and project delivery and had documented the roles and interactions between different offices. Most agencies interviewed lacked objective performance data, although many described processes where they have experts review and evaluate work zones on a periodic or continuous basis...|$|E
