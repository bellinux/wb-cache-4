(Annonaceae), {{commonly}} known as <b>Soursop,</b> <b>Guanàbana</b> or Graviola, is a small, upright evergreen tree of 5 - 6 m, with large, glossy, dark green leaves, which produces an edible fruit well known for its health properties. Although it is native of America, Annona muricata become established in many tropical countries of the world. The plant {{has been used in}} traditional medicine for many diseases, especially against infections and cancer. Effectively, it has been used in African herbal medicine systems for its sedative and antispasmodic properties, and also as hypotensive, insecticide, vermifuge, and for coughs, fevers, pain and skin diseases. Several chemical compounds have been isolated from the plant Annona muricata, and phytochemical investigations revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, coumarins, flavonoids, terpenoids. Among these compounds, researchers evidenced isoquinoline alkaloid annonaines, and acetogenins as the main active principles from Annona muricata. The aim of this research was to investigate the antioxidant capacity and antifungal activity in vitro of ethanolic extracts obtained from leaf, stem and root of Annona muricata. The antioxidant capacity has been evaluated using assays based on different mechanisms: the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay, based on HAT reaction, and DPPH radical scavenging capacity assay, based on SET reaction. We also determined the Total Flavonoid Content (TFC) and the Total Phenolic Content (TPC) for each extract. Furthermore, the antifungal activity was studied by evaluated the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration) in different strains of Candida...|$|E

5000|$|The large, edible, pulpy {{fruits of}} some members {{typically}} called anona by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking {{people of the}} family's Neotropical range, include species of Annona: custard apple (A. reticulata), cherimoya (A. cherimola), soursop/guanábana/graviola (A. muricata), sweetsop (A. squamosa), ilama (A. diversifolia), soncoya (A. purpurea), atemoya (a cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa); and biriba (Rollinia deliciosa, which may require reclassification under Annona.). The names of many of those fruits are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, consumption of the neotropical annonaceous plant Annona muricata (<b>soursop,</b> graviola, <b>guanabana)</b> has been strongly associated as a causal agent in [...] "atypical Parkinsonism". The causative agent, annonacin, is present {{in many of the}} Annonaceae. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines.|$|R
50|$|Helados La Fresita is an {{ice cream}} pop and paleta {{manufacturer}} in Medellín, Colombia. The frozen treats are sold by vendors around the city and in surrounding areas. The logo {{is marked by a}} strawberry caricature. The company's motto is: An ice cream with all the fruit (Un helado con toda la fruta!). Flavors include green mango, arequipe with raisins and coconut, coconut, lulo, peanut, <b>guanabana</b> (<b>soursop),</b> blackberry, strawberry, milk with raisins, and chocolate. The company also makes chocolate covered ice cream cones and ice cream sandwiches of various flavors, as well as fruit flavored ice pops (paletas de fruta), ice cream cups, and bulk ice cream boxes. The company was established in 1986.|$|R
50|$|From {{the diet}} of the Taíno people come many {{tropical}} roots and tubers like yautía (taro) and especially Yuca (cassava), from which thin cracker-like casabe bread is made. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a slightly hot habanero pepper, recao/culantro (spiny leaf), achiote (annatto), peppers, ají caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (tropical pumpkins), and <b>guanabanas</b> (<b>soursops)</b> are all Taíno foods. The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maize/corn, but maize {{was not as}} dominant in their cooking {{as it was for}} the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of maize, leaving more safeguarded plants like conucos (hills of yuca grown together).|$|R
40|$|Annona muricata is {{a member}} of the Annonaceae family and is a fruit tree with a long history of {{traditional}} use. A. muricata, also known as <b>soursop,</b> graviola and <b>guanabana,</b> is an evergreen plant that is mostly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The fruits of A. muricata are extensively used to prepare syrups, candies, beverages, ice creams and shakes. A wide array of ethnomedicinal activities is contributed to different parts of A. muricata, and indigenous communities in Africa and South America extensively use this plant in their folk medicine. Numerous investigations have substantiated these activities, including anticancer, anticonvulsant, anti-arthritic, antiparasitic, antimalarial, hepatoprotective and antidiabetic activities. Phytochemical studies reveal that annonaceous acetogenins are the major constituents of A. muricata. More than 100 annonaceous acetogenins have been isolated from leaves, barks, seeds, roots and fruits of A. muricata. In view of the immense studies on A. muricata, this review strives to unite available information regarding its phytochemistry, traditional uses and biological activities...|$|R
50|$|From {{the diet}} of the Taíno (culturally related with the Maya and Carib peoples of Central America and the Caribbean) and Arawak people come many {{tropical}} roots and tubers (collectively called viandas) like malanga (Xanthosoma) and especially Yuca (cassava), from which thin cracker-like casabe bread is made. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a slightly hot habanero pepper, recao/culantro (spiny leaf coriander), sarsaparilla, pimienta (allspice), achiote (annatto), peppers, ají caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (West Indian pumpkin), and <b>guanabanas</b> (<b>soursops)</b> are all Taíno foods. The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maíz (corn/maize), but maíz {{was not as}} dominant in their cooking {{as it was for}} the peoples on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of maíz, allowing more safeguarded plants like yuca conucos (hills of yuca grown together) to flourish. Maíz when used was frequently made into cornmeal and then into guanime, cornmeal mixed with mashed yautía and yuca and wrapped in corn husk or large leaves.|$|R
