5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Beijing won its bid to {{host the}} 2008 Olympics on 13 July 2001. The first new venues to begin {{construction}} were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Beijing Shooting Range Hall, and the Laoshan Velodrome, where major work commenced in December 2003. By May 2007, construction had begun {{at all of the}} Beijing venues for the games. Approximately RMB¥13 billion (US$1.9 billion) was <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> build and renovate the venues.|$|E

50|$|Production {{costs for}} the film are not known. However, The New York Times said in 1936 that Universal usually paid $3,000 to $17,000 for a good character, gave its stars $1,000 to $5,000 per week, <b>spent</b> six <b>to</b> eight weeks {{shooting}} each serial, and <b>spent</b> $165,000 <b>to</b> $250,000 per serial.|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Dartmouth {{president}} Ernest Martin Hopkins successfully lobbied the Board of Trustees {{to construct}} an independent facility for the school. $200,000 were <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer's only facility for nearly 70years. In 2004, construction began on the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006. At the cost of nearly $21million, the new center adds both classroom and research space to the Thayer School.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} National Airport Station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were {{highly critical of the}} government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide a direct connection to I-176; the overhead interchange lights at the new exit were a nuisance to nearby residents. An interchange was also proposed in 1990 with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey, but a study in 1993 determined {{that it would not}} improve traffic flow on area roads. The turnpike commission celebrated the highway's 50th anniversary in 1990. $300,000 was <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> promote the turnpike through various means including a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and rights-of-way in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspaper}} articles and commentators have incorrectly {{claimed that the}} project ran significantly over the contract cost. As of {{the launch of the}} first submarine, the project cost had increased from A$3.892 billion in 1986 dollars to A$4.989 billion in 1993 dollars, which corresponded to the rate of inflation during that period. By 2006, A$5.071 billion had been <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> build the submarines (excluding the fast track program); after taking inflation into account, the project had run less than A$40 million over contract.|$|E

She underwent a temporary repair at Deptford between September 1813 and June 1814; and was subsequently fitted for sea there between August and October 1814.|$|R
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been <b>spent.</b> <b>To</b> harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson {{released}} $11million {{in additional}} aid and other assistance to Florida, with $10million to be earmarked to Head Start facilities that need repair or new supplies, another $1million {{was provided to}} the DeSoto Memorial Hospital in Arcadia and Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee, and $200,000 would be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> provide services to senior citizens. Across Florida, 114 food service operations and eight comfort stations were set up. FEMA opened four disaster recovery centers.|$|E

5|$|After two {{costly and}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to seize the}} fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, {{on the last day}} of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.|$|E
5|$|Antonov {{subsequently}} {{converted the}} static-test prototype into a flying prototype {{equipped with a}} modified flight-control system. The second airframe was rolled out in December 1996 in Kiev, before making its first flight on 24 April 1997 from Svyatoshino Airfield, during which the aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes; according to Jane's, however, the aircraft had taken off from Gostomel for a 26-minute flight. By this time, more than US$2.5 billion had been spent on the programme, with a further $200 million to be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> prepare the aircraft for production, which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20–25 aircraft produced annually. The Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces reportedly had long-term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft, respectively. The second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 January 2001 in a crash landing after take-off.|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> make the first experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted {{the evolution of a}} multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida. They were using Yak-11 piston-engined fighters, MiG-15 and MiG-17 jet fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engined bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 twin-engined transports and Mil Mi-4 transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. All the air crew were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars were <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a. The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was also concerned about the money <b>spent</b> <b>to</b> buy Gleason's former home.|$|E
