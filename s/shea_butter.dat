The presence of linoleic acid {{could be useful}} in cosmetic industry to decrease trans-epidermal water loss and to eliminate scaly lesions common in patients with essential fatty acids deficiency (Aburjai and Natsheh 2003). A natural musk fragrance identified as exaltolide was also detected in a relatively interesting amount (1.51 and 0.68  % for beige and yellow <b>shea</b> <b>butters,</b> respectively). All these characteristics would exalt their beneficial utilization in household for body care and their exploitation in cosmetic/pharmaceutical industry (body cream, soap and fragrances/perfumes). The studied samples could easily be involved in cosmetics like cocoa and jojoba fats, without preliminary treatment like deodorization, neutralization and synthetic fragrance (essence) additioning. They present fats would then constitute a valuable cheap, available and accessible material for the cosmetic/pharmaceutical industry.|$|R

Above all, the different aptitudes and fields of exploitation of the beige and yellow optimized <b>shea</b> <b>butters</b> have been underlined.|$|R
2500|$|In general use, {{the term}} [...] "butter" [...] {{refers to the}} spread dairy product when {{unqualified}} by other descriptors. The word commonly is used to describe puréed vegetable or seed and nut products such as peanut butter and almond butter. It is often applied to spread fruit products such as apple butter. Fats such as cocoa butter and <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> that remain solid at room temperature are also known as [...] "butters". In addition to the act of applying butter being called [...] "to butter", non-dairy items that have a dairy butter consistency may use [...] "butter" [...] to call that consistency to mind, including food items such as maple butter and witch's butter and nonfood items such as baby bottom butter, hyena butter, and rock butter.|$|E
2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or <b>shea</b> <b>butter,</b> is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> ( [...] , , or [...] ) is a fat {{extracted}} from the nut of the African shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa). It is usually yellow in color when raw, with Unrefined, refined, and Ultra-Refined <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> being ivory or white in color. [...] <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is a triglyceride (fat) derived mainly from stearic acid and oleic acid. It is widely used in cosmetics as a moisturizer, salve or lotion. <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is edible and is used in food preparation in Africa. Occasionally, the chocolate industry uses <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> mixed with other oils {{as a substitute for}} cocoa butter, although the taste is noticeably different.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> {{is derived}} from the kernel of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa). <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is known for its {{cosmetic}} properties as a moisturizer and emollient.|$|E
50|$|The {{proportions}} of stearic and oleic acids in the shea kernels and butter differ across the distribution {{range of the}} species. Ugandan <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> has consistently high oleic acid content, and is liquid at warm ambient temperatures. It fractionizes into liquid and solid phases, and {{is the source of}} liquid shea oil. The fatty acid proportion of West African <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> is much more variable than Ugandan <b>shea</b> <b>butter,</b> with an oleic content of 37 to 55%. Variability can be high even locally, and a tree that produces hard butter can grow with one that produces soft butter. Nuts are gathered from a wide area for local production, so <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> consistency is determined by the average fatty acid profile of the population. Within West Africa, <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> from the Mossi Plateau region of Burkina Faso has a higher average stearic acid content, and so is usually harder than <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> from other West African regions.|$|E
30|$|The present {{optimized}} <b>shea</b> <b>butters</b> acid, {{moisture and}} peroxide values were very weak; {{this could be}} the consequence of the optimized method improvement by deleting the step of shea oil heating {{at the end of its}} preparation. Moreover, they were microbiological germs and heavy metal free. These characteristics would suggest them apt to exportation and industrial exploitation. In addition, they contained nutritional elements like essential fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids), minerals (calcium, iron, copper, magnesium, sodium, potassium and zinc), vitamins (A and E) and carotene, which would present them as available, cheap and accessible nutritive edible fats. Such butters could then be exploited not only in households, but also in food industry, mainly edible oils factories and also in pastries/bakeries because of their high unsaponifiable matter. This latest compounds added to the presence of UV-filter molecules, vitamin E, minerals (zinc, magnesium and copper) and linoleic acid, would present them as useful raw material for cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. However, it should be appropriate to conserve them in hygienic conditions in order to preserve such interesting virtues. The optimized <b>shea</b> <b>butters</b> could then be considered as a response to the needs in valuable BIO-products for usual consumers for industrials. They might constitute for industrials a cheaper valuable, available and accessible raw material. Hence, adopting optimized method would guaranty the trading/exportation/industrial exploitation of this fat which is considered as the main source of money for women in shea producing area, and consequently increase monetary currency for shea producing countries.|$|R

50|$|The {{quality of}} <b>shea</b> nuts and <b>butter,</b> {{both of which}} are also {{exported}} in large quantities from Burkina Faso, are basically dependent upon post harvest processing; in this process parboiling of shea nuts is carried out {{at the beginning of the}} season as it the eliminates germination and helps in faster drying. Better quality is obtained by sun-drying of the shea nut since smoking the nuts over a fire contaminates it with hydrocarbons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is {{composed}} of five principal fatty acids: palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidic (see Table below). About 85 to 90% of the fatty acid composition is stearic and oleic acids. The relative proportion of these two fatty acids affects <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> consistency. The stearic acid gives it a solid consistency, while the oleic acid influences how soft or hard the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> is, depending on ambient temperature.|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of the conditions of direct sun exposure of the kernels from Butyrospermum parkii (shea) on the quality of the butter and to define the best conditions of drying. The influence of the thickness of kernels and of time was determined, according to the central composite experimental design, in comparison with the extraction yield, the acid and peroxide values, the melting properties and the composition of unsaponifiable matter of butter. The maximum butter yield is obtained with kernels content 10 to 15 % of residual water. The cutting up of kernels makes easier the vaporizing of water but, also increases acidity and reduces contents of unsaponifiable, triterpenic alcohols and sterols successive in an increase of interface between enzymes and molecules. While, a long exposure is favourable to the appearance of peroxides which destabilize not stable compounds with high melting point. So, an exposure during 5 - 8 days of kernels cut up in slices with more than 12 mm of thickness represents the best conditions of drying...|$|R

40|$|In {{the view}} to find {{sustainable}} methods to prevent termite attacks to wooden objects and structural timbers, this study represents a preliminary {{step in the}} evaluation of some natural substances considered as effective by some African popular traditions. Dark shea cake, obtained from the kernels of Vitellaria paradoxa (Sapotaceae), is the phase just before the extraction of <b>shea</b> (= karitè) <b>butter.</b> In some West African regions, by-products from this extraction are traditionally believed to protect houses from termites. To verify if this practice has scientific basis, shea cake was used in experiments with both subterranean and drywood termites, respectively Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rossi) (Rhinotermitidae) and Kalotermes flavicollis (Fabricius) (Kalotermitidae). As shea nuts are extremely rich in polyphenols, the trials included a comparison with tannins from chestnut (Castanea sativa). Short-term experiments to evaluate repellency and feeding deterrence of the two compounds were performed. Results showed differences in the behavior of the two termites species and that shea cake is significantly more repellent than chestnut tannins, especially for K. flavicollis. No feeding deterrence activity was detected for either substance for either termite species. Further investigation is currently being performed to better clarify how these compounds affect termite biology...|$|R
40|$|Termites (Isoptera) {{are among}} the worse insect pests for wooden {{structures}} and their presence may represent a serious threat for cultural heritage, especially in those areas where climate and environmental conditions are favourable to these insects. The Old Continent is increasingly jeopardized by the obnoxious assaults of these insects, due to the high density of housing, to the haphazard urbanization and globalization, to the novel ecological patterns in use in the bio-masonry and to the antique remnant of mansions and sacred architecture. Presently, sustainable management of termite pests includes the use of preventative measures (eg. application of repellents/antifeedants) {{and the use of}} baits with slow-acting termiticides. The nuts of Butyrospermum parkii (Sapotaceae), tree native to West-Central Africa, are used to produce <b>shea</b> (karité) <b>butter,</b> welcome in the manufacture of cosmetics and food stuff. Aborigens believe that the residue from shea-butter extraction is capable to protect their houses from termites, which are extremely abundant in these regions (1). To verify if these popular beliefs have scientific basis, experiments were performed with European subterranean and drywood termites, respectively Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rhinotermitidae) and Kalotermes flavicollis (Kalotermitidae). Therefore an hydroglyceric extract of shea nut shells (the only pericarp) and an acqueous extract of shea cake (obtained from de-husked ground kernels, and thus phase oil-free) were used in short-term choice-tests and in long-term force-feeding trials, in order to assess the feeding deterrence or stimulation [...] The results show that for both termite species shea cake extract is a feeding deterrent, thus confirming its potential as a wood preservative. However, most interestingly, the extract from shea nut shells elicited a very strong feeding stimulant effect, which looks extremely promising to increase the attractiveness -and therefore efficiency- of the baits. Further analytical investigations (to determine the total rate of terpenoids and polyphenols) on both extracts are in progress in order to identify the active components responsible for the observed effects. 1) J.
