30|$|The vehicle {{passage on}} {{irregular}} road pavement surfaces generates the oscillation {{of the vehicle}} mass, with a consequent increase of the load applied on the pavement. The load which a vehicle axle transfers on the pavement surface is not constant in time and space, but is variable in function of several factors such as: vehicle mass, <b>speed,</b> <b>suspension</b> type, road surface irregularities, etc. It {{is clear that the}} produced dynamic force is responsible for the generation of vibrations in road pavement. These vibrations are diffused through the foundation ground, and then to adjacent buildings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{assessment of the}} power that is available for harvest-ing in the vehicle suspension system and the tradeoff among energy harvesting, ride com-fort, and road handing with analysis, simulations, and experiments. The excitation from road irregularity is modeled as a stationary random process with road roughness suggested in the ISO standard. The concept of system H 2 norm is used to obtain the mean value of power generation and the root mean square values of vehicle body acceleration (ride qual-ity) and dynamic tire-ground contact force (road handling). For a quarter car model, an analytical solution of the mean power is obtained. The influence of road roughness, vehicle <b>speed,</b> <b>suspension</b> stiffness, shock absorber damping, tire stiffness, and the wheel and chasses masses to the vehicle performances and harvestable power are studied. Experi-ments are carried out to verify the theoretical analysis. The results suggest that road rough-ness, tire stiffness, and vehicle driving speed have great influence on the harvesting power potential, where the suspension stiffness, absorber damping, and vehicle masses are insen-sitive. At 60 mph on good and average roads, 100 – 400 W average power {{is available in the}} suspensions of a middle-sized vehicle. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4007562]...|$|E
40|$|The {{important}} {{role played by}} the processing on the transparency of ceramic materials is often underestimated. In the literature a high level of transparency has been reported by many authors that for years focused their research on the development of polycrystalline YAG for laser applications,but the description of the experimental process is seldom thoroughly described. A detailed description of the powder treatment and shaping and of other important information that are necessary to reproduce the described results, is often missing. In order to be transparent a ceramic material must exhibit a very low concentration of defects such as secondary or grain boundary phases and residual pores. In order to fulfill this requirement specific experimental conditions must be combined together. Powders need to be nanometric or at least sub-micrometric and extremely pure. On the other hand, nanometric powders aggregate easily and the poor packing that may derived can lead to residual porosity. In addition, very fine powders are difficult to handle and tend to absorb water on the surface. Finally, the powder manipulation (weighting operations, solvent removal, spray drying, shaping, etc), easily introduces impurities. In case of transparent materials all these features must be controlled because they lead to the formation of defects that works as light scattering sources thus decreasing the transparency. This work describes the results obtained with YAG based ceramics under different experimental conditions of powder treatment and shaping. Commercial powders are used for the reactive sintering in a clean atmosphere and under high vacuum of YAG materials doped with Nd, Yb or Er. These dopants have been selected as the more appropriate for high power lasers. The powder treatment (ball milling duration and <b>speed,</b> <b>suspension</b> concentration, solvent/powder ratio, type and amount of dispersant) the solvent removal technique (spray drying conditions, rotavapor temperature, etc.) are described in detail as well as the conditions adopted during shaping. The influence of the powder process on the powder packing during shaping by pressing is also reported. Finally, the influence of the pre-sintering and sintering cycles is also described...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the ceramic process for the {{production}} of optical grade transparent materials to be used as laser hosts. In order to be transparent a ceramic material must exhibit a very low concentration of defects. Defects are mainly represented by secondary or grain boundary phases and by residual pores. The strict control of the stoichiometry is mandatory to avoid the formation of secondary phases, whereas residual pores need to be below 150 ppm. In order to fulfill these requirements specific experimental conditions must be combined together. In addition powders need to be nanometric or at least sub-micrometric and extremely pure. On the other hand, nanometric powders aggregate easily and this leads to a poor, not homogeneous packing during shaping by pressing and to the formation of residual pores during sintering. Very fine powders are also difficult to handle and tend to absorb water on the surface. Finally, the powder manipulation (weighting operations, solvent removal, spray drying, shaping, etc), easily introduces impurities. All these features must be fully controlled {{in order to avoid the}} formation of defects that work as scattering sources thus decreasing the transparency of the material. The important role played by the processing on the transparency of ceramic materials is often underestimated. In the literature a high level of transparency has been reported by many authors but the description of the experimental process, in particular of the powder treatment and shaping, is seldom extensively described and important information that are necessary to reproduce the described results are often missing. The main goal of the present study therefore is to give additional information on the way the experimental features affect the microstructural evolution of YAG-based ceramics and thus the final properties, in particular transparency. Commercial powders are used to prepare YAG materials doped with Nd or Yb by reactive sintering under high vacuum. These dopants have been selected as the more appropriate for high energy and high peak power lasers. As far as it concerns the powder treatment, the thesis {{focuses on the}} influence of the solvent removal technique (rotavapor versus spray drying of suspensions in ethanol), the ball milling duration and <b>speed,</b> <b>suspension</b> concentration, solvent ratio, type and amount of dispersant. The influence of the powder type and process on the powder packing as well as the pressure conditions during shaping by pressing are also described. Finally calcination, sintering under high vacuum and in clean atmosphere, and post sintering cycles are studied and related to the final microstructure analyzed by SEM-EDS and HR-TEM, and to the optical and laser properties. ...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} a railway track deteriorates depends on the {{response}} of the track under different static and repeated dynamic forces. These wheel/rail forces lead to imperfections in the rail surface and deviation in track geometry alignment. The wheel/rail forces are dependent upon the quality of maintenance of the characteristics of both train and track. If train components such as wheelsets and suspensions are maintained to a high standard, less dynamic forces are generated at the wheel/rail interface and less damage is caused over time. Therefore, the amount and cost of maintenance of track are reduced. However, there is little known about how the characteristics of train components affect time-dependent track degradation. Track degradation through deviation of track from its ideal position has the most effect on maintenance costs. Therefore, the present research aims to investigate this track degradation and improve understanding of the effects of train characteristics (such as train mass and <b>speed,</b> <b>suspension</b> stiffness and damping) on railway tracks. The research is conducted by looking into the relationship between wheel/rail forces and track degradation on one hand and between wheel/rail forces and train characteristics on the other hand, with the objective of assisting in managing vehicle/track interaction in order to minimise track degradation. This aim is achieved by investigating the above two relationships to attain the desired relationship between track degradation and train characteristics. The research focuses on wheel/rail vertical forces (both amplitudes and frequencies), vertical track alignment (longitudinal vertical profile), and rail head defects. The study started by collecting wheel/rail vertical forces data in addition to data on vertical track degradation under sustained traffic loads on a heavy haul railway section of track in Central Queensland. Also, five years of degradation and maintenance history data were collected on three other test sections of railway track under variety of traffic conditions and loads in Central Queensland. There were four main analyses of this data employed to probe the study. The first analysis was performed by examining the track degradation history data. The standard deviation method was used in this first analysis to acquire the rate of deterioration in terms of its relationship to track profile (roughness). The second analysis was accomplished by correlating the vertical wheel/rail forces to both vertical track profile and rail roughness using signal processing principles and a function know as coherence. The third analysis was carried out by using the computer simulation software NUCARS to obtain the link between wheel/rail forces and the deterioration of the vertical track profile. The fourth analysis was achieved by combining the results obtained from the above three analyses to acquire the rate of track deterioration in terms of its relationship to varying train characteristics. The first analysis mentioned above quantified the relationship between the level of roughness of the track and {{rate at which}} that roughness deteriorated. An important outcome of this relationship {{is that there is a}} threshold of roughness below which track deterioration is minimal. The track maintenance planners can now use that threshold for cost effective targeting of tamping activities. The correlation study between track roughness and wheel/rail forces using the coherence function found, surprisingly, that the overall deterioration of the track roughness, in the absence of frequencies of forces above 30 Hz, is due to the so-called quasi-static lower frequency oscillations of dynamic forces. This conclusion together with the relationship between vehicle characteristics and track forces, established in the analyses above, has significant implications for the design of wagon bogies and for charges track owners might levy on trains using their tracks. This research is part of a larger Rail CRC project 11 / 4 called 'Enhancing the Optimisation of Maintenance/Renewal' being carried out in the School of Urban Development in Queensland University of Technology...|$|E
