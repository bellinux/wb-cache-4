40|$|Abstract: This paper {{concerns}} <b>segmented</b> multivariate <b>regression</b> models, models {{which have}} different linear forms in different subdomains of {{the domain of}} an in-dependent variable. Without knowing that number and their boundaries, we first estimate the number of these subdomains using a modified Schwarz criterion. The estimated number of regions proves to be weakly consistent under fairly general conditions. We then estimate the subdomain boundaries (“thresholds”) and the regression coefficients within subdomains by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals. We show that the threshold estimates converge (at rates, 1 /n and n− 1 / 2, respectively at the model’s threshold points of discontinuity and continuity) and that the regression coefficients {{as well as the}} residual variances are asymptotically normal. The basic condition on the error distribution required for the veracity of our asymptotic results is satisfied by any distribution with zero mean and a mo-ment generating function (having bounded second derivative around zero). As an illustration, a <b>segmented</b> bivariate <b>regression</b> model is fitted to real data and the relevance of the asymptotic results is examined via simulations.

40|$|Background: In {{the present}} day {{practice}} of Anesthesiology, bupivacaine is {{the most commonly used}} drug for spinal anesthesia. To improve the quality of analgesia and prolong the duration of its action, many adjuvants have been tried. Intrathecal opioids have been found to fulfil both these objectives. This study was done to evaluate the effects of adding sufentanil to bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia. Methods: 100 ASA grade I/II patients aged between 20 and ndash; 60 years undergoing elective lower abdominal, urologic, lower limb surgeries were selected and divided into two groups of 50 each. Group A received 2. 5 ml of heavy Bupivacaine, whereas the second group B received 2. 5 ml of heavy Bupivacaine with 5 and micro;g Sufentanil. Parameters - Onset and duration of sensory block and motor block, time for two dermatomal <b>segments</b> <b>regression,</b> duration of analgesia, vitals and side effects were assessed. Results: There was no variation in onset of sensory blockade and motor blockade. The time to achieve peak sensory level was 3 minutes earlier in group B. The time for two <b>segment</b> <b>regression</b> and the time to full sensory and motor recovery were prolonged in Group B. Duration of complete and effective analgesia prolonged by 40 - 60 minutes and the time for first request of analgesic postoperatively was delayed by 70 - 80 minutes in group B. The quality of analgesia was better in group B. Pruritus was the common side effect in group B. Conclusions: Sufentanil potentiates bupivacaine spinal anesthesia by increasing the duration and improving the quality of analgesia with minimal side effects.

Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate and compare quality of spinal anaesthesia with isobaric 0. 5 % and 0. 75 % intrathecal ropivacaine in patients undergoing lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries. Methods: 100 patients between 18 and 60 years, of either gender belonging to ASA class I or II, posted for elective lower abdominal and lower limb surgeries, planned under spinal anaesthesia using ropivacaine. Patients were grouped as group A: 3 ml (15 mg) of 0. 5 % plain ropivacaine and Group B: 3 ml (22. 5 mg) of 0. 75 % plain ropivacaine. Parameters observed were onset and duration of sensory and motor block, maximum sensory level achieved degree of motor blockade, two <b>segment</b> <b>regression,</b> and haemodynamic changes. Results: No significant differences were noted in Mean time for onset and time to achieve maximum level of sensory and motor blockade in both groups. Maximal dermatomal level was T 10 in group A and T 8 in group B which was statistically significant. Also, 96 % patients had grade III motor blockade in group B as compared to 80 % in group A which was statistically significant. Significant differences were noted in Time for two <b>segment</b> <b>regression</b> (92. 56 +/- 11. 846 minutes in group A and 137. 3 +/- 13. 06 min in group B), the duration of sensory blockade (184. 5 +/- 18. 385 min in group A and 238. 8 +/- 19. 260 min in group B) and duration of motor blockade (120. 3 +/- 15. 59 min in group A and 178. 8 +/- 16. 053 min in group B).

These estimators circumvent the explicit pre-estimation of the unknown regression function, a task which is particularly challenging for such signals. We provide explicit expressions for their mean squared errors when the signal function is piecewise constant (<b>segment</b> <b>regression)</b> and the errors are Gaussian. Based on this we derive biased-optimized estimates which do {{not depend on the}} particular (unknown) autocovariance structure. Notably, for positively correlated errors, that part of the variance of our estimators which depends on the signal is minimal as well. Further, we provide sufficient conditions for √(n) -consistency; this result is extended to piecewise Holder regression with non-Gaussian errors. We combine our biased-optimized autocovariance estimates with a projection-based approach and derive covariance matrix estimates, a method which is of independent interest.
