25|$|The {{monocoque}} fuselage {{is composed}} of composite materials and is equipped with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> on either side along with a rear clamshell door; an atypical feature of the fuselage {{is the presence of}} a series of floor-mounted windows between the pilots seats for additional vertical visibility. Some of the composite materials used have been produced using out of autoclave composite manufacturing from suppliers such as TenCate and Gurit. According to Marenco, inspiration for the fuselage's design was drawn from the automotive industry. It has been stated that the firm has sought to introduce the cabin volume of medium-sized twin-engine helicopters to the single-engine market.|$|E
2500|$|While earlier [...] "short-body" [...] Hueys were a success, the Army {{wanted a}} version that could carry more troops. [...] Bell's {{solution}} was to stretch the HU-1B fuselage by [...] and use the extra space to fit four seats next to the transmission, facing out. Seating capacity increased to 15, including crew. [...] The enlarged cabin could also accommodate six stretchers and a medic, two more than the earlier models. [...] In place of the earlier model's <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> with a single window, larger doors were fitted which had two windows, plus a small hinged panel with an optional window, providing enhanced access to the cabin. The doors and hinged panels were quickly removable, allowing the Huey to be flown in a [...] "doors off" [...] configuration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Kangoo Trekka was spartan, and the rear bench seat could be folded forward to provide a [...] loading area, to which <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> provided better access.|$|E
50|$|New swing-out <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> were {{introduced}} {{to go with the}} standard <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> The doors were a 60/40 split. Last year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options.|$|R
50|$|A remote {{controlled}} power <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> was announced for 1993, {{but failed to}} actually make it into production.|$|R
5000|$|... issue 108, The model {{shows the}} version 1972 with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> {{while in the}} movie - the bus from 1971 with a {{conventional}} door.|$|R
50|$|Sharing few {{components}} {{with the}} much larger Transit, the Transit Connect {{was based on the}} front-wheel drive C170 platform shared with the international Ford Focus, then common with the first generation North American Ford Focus. Rather than adapting an existing bodystyle into a van, the Transit Connect was designed with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
50|$|The cab {{arrangement}} was made especially convenient for the crew. The double roof {{was lined with}} teak while side louvre ventilators with roller slides were fitted. The cab front and sides had ventilating doors. Sliding louvres in the cab sides provided adequate weather protection while the lookout had hinged adjustable glass windscreens. The cab was completely enclosed with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and the crew had upholstered hinged seats with armrests.|$|E
50|$|In December 1972, a five-door van (L50VF, with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors)</b> was added. Three months later, the {{dropside}} L51 went on sale. In November 1973 the Carry {{underwent a}} minor facelift, receiving a new grille and modified front bumper. The interior was also updated, {{with a new}} dashboard and finally hanging gas and clutch pedals. The fifth generation Carry led Suzuki to great market success, with Suzuki selling more kei trucks than all others during 1973 and 1974.|$|E
50|$|A remote {{controlled}} power <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> was announced for 1993, {{but did not}} make it to production until very late in the 1993 Model year.|$|R

50|$|Released in June 1999. This model also {{adopted the}} SK {{platform}} {{which is based}} on previous generation SS/SE model. Like the previous generation, the Bongo Brawny was larger in all key dimensions. Available both normal (middle) 2400mm wheel base and long 2600mm. The Brawny retained many of the parts of the previous generation, such as the <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> and looks rather similar to the previous generation model. The E-series label continued to be used in export markets, although they were now fewer than before. The Bongo Brawny was discontinued in August 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The new Huey was {{designated}} UH-1D by the US Army {{and as the}} Model 205 by Bell. The enlarged cabin could also accommodate six stretchers, double that of the earlier models, making the [...] "Delta" [...] a good MEDEVAC aircraft. In place of the earlier model's <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> with a single window, larger doors were fitted which had two windows, plus a small [...] "hinged panel" [...] with an optional window, providing access to the cabin. The doors and hinged panels were quickly removable and the Huey could be flown in that configuration.|$|E
50|$|After only a {{few months}} in the market, Honda added a panel van range to the lineup in March 1968, simply a pickup with a {{permanently}} covered bed. These were available in four various configurations (with or without <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> as well as a version with a canvas roof) at a slightly higher price. Due to worse aerodynamics and slightly higher weight, top speed for the panel vans was only 95 km/h, with a max of 90 km/h for the open top version. In 1969, a better equipped DeLuxe version was added to the range.|$|E
50|$|The payload {{capacity}} is 750 kg. It {{also has a}} second <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> as an option and features asymmetric rear doors that can open to 90 or to 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Dodge first {{pioneered the}} extended-rear 15-passenger van favored by school and church groups and {{dominated}} this market until overtaken by Ford in the 1990s. It offered a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> {{as well as}} a unique side-swinging tail door with a full-width window.|$|R
50|$|Predecessors {{include the}} 1936 Stout Scarab, which {{featured}} a removable table and second row seats that turn 180 degrees {{to face the}} rear. The DKW Schnellaster, manufactured from 1949 to 1962 {{was one of the}} first vehicles to feature the characteristics of modern minivans. In 1950, the Volkswagen Type 2 adapted a bus-shaped body to the compact Volkswagen Beetle. When Volkswagen introduced a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> on their van in 1968, it then had the promient features that would later come to define a minivan: compact length, three rows of forward-facing seats, station wagon-style top-hinged tailgate/liftgate, <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> passenger car base. Fiat built a similar vehicle, the 1956 Multipla based on the Fiat 600 with the same rear engine, cab forward layout.|$|R
5000|$|In {{model year}} 2002, the MPV {{received}} Mazda's AJ 3.0 L V6, a 5-speed automatic transmission producing [...] and 200 lbft Nm of torque, a new grille featuring a single chrome {{bar at the}} top, power <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> (not available on the Australian market), revised suspension settings, and 17-inch alloy wheels. In the Japanese and other markets, the 2.0 and 2.5-liter four-cylinders were replaced by the new 2.3 L L3-VE direct injection (DISI) inline four, as first seen in the all-new Mazda6. In Europe a , 2.0-liter [...] "MZR" [...] common-rail turbodiesel engine was also available.|$|E
50|$|The CitiVan, was {{a limited}} {{production}} extended-wheelbase {{version of the}} third model variant of the CitiCar. Produced and sold from 1977 (by Sebring-Vanguard) to 1979 (by Commuter Vehicles, Inc.), basically unchanged. It is rumored that only 11 of these smaller Vans were built and sold as the CitiVan but an unknown more were built and sold in 1979 as the first year Comuta-Van. The main design differences between the 1979 Comuta-Van and the later Postal Comuta-Van is that the much smaller 1979 Comuta-Van has swing out side doors and a hatch back window. The much larger Postal Comuta-Van has <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> and a swing out rear entrance door.|$|E

50|$|The family {{includes}} all-metal wagon GAZ-2752 and minibuses GAZ-2217 and GAZ-22171 ("Barguzine"), {{as well as}} {{flatbed truck}} (chassis cab) GAZ-2310. The basic model is GAZ-2752 van with a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> and rear hinged (useful volume of 6.86 m ³ 3-seater and 3.7m ³ in 7-seater cargo-"Combi").|$|R
5000|$|The Pilot was {{available}} in capacities from 2.2 to 2.6 tonnes in a [...] load area. Power came from a 1.9 litre Peugeot diesel engine driving the rear wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. Access to the load area is from either the rear or a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The F20 had a {{full load}} of 4.3 tons, a 4-cylinder diesel engine of [...] and [...] at 3200 rpm; Then the {{displacement}} was brought to [...] The F20 had a payload of 2000 kg. The F20 was offered as a paneled van with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> another with <b>side</b> <b>doors</b> on each <b>side,</b> and a final version without any <b>side</b> <b>door.</b> A chassis-bare version was also offered to bodybuilders for further declinations.|$|R
50|$|Early UH-1B/UH-1C Gunships had the XM-3 Subsystem using paired 24 round {{rectangular}} launchers mounted {{near the}} back edge of the <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> These pods were ground reloadable and were semi-permanent aircraft parts. The mounting point {{had been used to}} mount booms for 3 SS-11 Launchers on each side for anti-tank missions. The co-pilot had a roof mounted sight and control box to fire these. Later UH-1C and D aircraft had a mount on each side to carry a 7 round pod coupled with paired M-60D machine guns. Some carried M-134 Miniguns with 3000 rounds per gun instead, though these aircraft were normally used by Air Cavalry units, not the Aerial Rocket Artillery (ARA) units.|$|E
50|$|Another CitiCar variant {{was called}} the Postal Comuta-Van. These were all right-hand-drive vehicles, {{initially}} built as a government contract with the USPS by Commuter Vehicles, Inc.. To make a Comuta-Van to meet government standards, the overall length was increased to 142 in, {{as well as a}} 12 HP motor, 72v battery pack, and 3-speed transmission, among other additions. The Postal version was only equipped with one 'right hand' drivers seat. However, some were sold to the public with an additional passenger seat and much more room for storage behind the seats. It was the only model with a front hood access and <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> The white Van pictured to the right is the larger Postal Comuta-Van.|$|E
50|$|The Prairie {{resembled a}} tall station wagon / estate with the {{addition}} of <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors.</b> It was available with five seats, though seven were available. It was developed from the Nissan Sunny platform, while using the powertrain from the Nissan Stanza. It was a companion model to the more traditional cabover Nissan Vanette, offering buyers a choice of appearance and flexibility. The concept was inspired by the Lancia Megagamma show car from Giorgetto Giugiaro and ItalDesign, shown in 1979, and offered Japanese buyers a spacious, flexible passenger/cargo arrangement that complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations and used small displacement engines that offered Japanese buyers options with regards to annual road tax obligations.|$|E
25|$|Early bay-window tent. When Volkswagen transitioned to the bay-window or breadloaf {{model with}} large, single curved {{windshield}} and <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> the Westfalia camper was modified {{to include an}} angled poptop. This design provided space for a large child's cot overhead, and on later models, the poptop was further enlarged to fit a full bed large enough for two adults.|$|R
50|$|Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes' bussauna, is {{a custom}} {{converted}} Nissan Civilian minibus. Its interior features a conventional sauna {{for up to}} 8 people, and is equipped with amenities such as a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> exterior awning, fridge and sink. Holmes has also installed an accompanying home base spa zone including showers and changerooms beside the bus parking spot at Hootsuite’s headquarters.|$|R
50|$|The first generation, {{designed}} by Toyota designer Tokuo Fukuichi and Calty designer David Doyle in 1987 (patent filed 24 December 1987), was introduced on 27 January 1990, {{had only one}} <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door</b> for the rear passengers. It featured a unique mid-engined platform, where the inline four cylinder gasoline-powered engine was installed almost flat (at a 75-degree angle), beneath the front seats.|$|R
5000|$|In the van version as Transit Courier {{there is}} a {{standard}} partition and a load volume of [...] with a maximum payload of 660 kg standard. The cargo area of the Transit Courier has a load length of 1.62 m, which can be extended to 2.59 m, allowing for the transport of a standard euro-pallet. Two <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> six lashing eyes and mounting points in the body for the installation of shelves or installation systems offer many variations for commercial use. To increase cargo space, the vehicle is fitted with a folding passenger seat and an optional grid-partition between the cockpit and cargo area. Optionally, LED lighting is available for the cargo area.|$|E
5000|$|The Nissan Forum is {{a concept}} vehicle based on the E51 Nissan Elgrand, {{developed}} by Nissan Design America. It features trackless <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>doors,</b> hidden sunshades in SkyView moonroof panels, LED lights front and rear, soft-edged side outside mirrors, wide six-spoke alloy wheels and low-profile tires, a wide rear hatch, dual exhaust outlets, dual climate controls, Bluetooth wireless technology and mood lighting under {{the upper and lower}} console areas. It also has a console-mounted microwave, vertical wave pattern carpeting, [...] "Turntable" [...] seating, a Bose media system, and Around View Monitor. The design of the Forum would be later used on the R42H Nissan Quest, the North American counterpart of the succeeding E52 Elgrand.|$|E

50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a driver's <b>side</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a driver's <b>side</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a driver's <b>side</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the best}} known in about 1:43 scale are the Renault Floride, Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spyder, Caravana Notin, Citroën DS 19, Leyland Atlantean Bus, Mercedes-Benz 1113 truck, Mercedes-Benz 190, Mercedes-Benz 200, Mini Morris Cooper, Peugeot 204, Peugeot 304, Renault R16, Volvo P1800, 1907 Rolls Royce, Volkswagen Beetle, Volkswagen Combi, and a 1960s style camper trailer. There was also a smaller line in about 1:60 scale - one was a Volkswagen {{transporter}} panel van with a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} version offers five {{seats and}} has a luggage capacity of 800 L, with a maximum load length of 1.16 m. It features one <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>door,</b> and as an option it can be ordered with <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> on both <b>sides.</b> The rear bench seat can be split asymmetrically and {{it can also be}} tipped forward against the front seats, which creates a carrying capacity of 3000 L and a load length of 1.57 m.|$|R
