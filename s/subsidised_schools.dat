50|$|The {{provision}} of libraries by municipal councils in Queensland {{is a relatively}} new phenomenon, with most libraries currently operating having been established since the late 1940s. Previously, Schools of Arts and privately owned Reading Rooms provided books for loan by subscription. Schools of Arts or Mechanics Institutes were established in Britain in the early 1800s with the declared intention of assisting self-improvement and promoting moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, classes and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no public libraries and books were expensive, so that providing access to them for a moderate subscription was an important educational and recreational service. Local councils had sometimes <b>subsidised</b> <b>Schools</b> of Arts and were granted authority in the Local Government Act 1878 to establish and operate libraries, although this was very uncommon until the twentieth century. Kurilpa Library was the first publicly funded municipal library in Queensland and South Brisbane Library opened soon afterwards. However, local councils did not become seriously involved in the construction of libraries in Queensland until after the Libraries Act 1943 was passed which provided {{for the establishment of a}} State Library Board and the improvement of library services throughout the state.|$|E

Using the first approach, we estimate {{the effectiveness of}} a sample of Chilean schools after controlling by a baseline at the student level. In order to avoid the endogeneity of such a baseline with respect to the school effect, we use a longitudinal data set (SIMCE 2004 and SIMCE 2006) from which a natural pseudo-experiment is defined {{in such a way that}} the baseline is by design uncorrelated with the school effect. Thereafter, we investigate possible relationships between parental school choice (as declared in public standardized surveys) and the schools classified by their effectiveness. The main conclusions of this paper are, on the one hand, that there is not remarkable difference between municipal (public) and <b>subsidised</b> <b>schools</b> in terms of their effectiveness analyzed under value-added; and, on the other hand, that there is no relation between parental school choice preferences and school effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|During the 1920 s and 1930 s, white {{settlers}} in Southern Rhodesia (Colonial Zimbabwe) achieved responsible government {{and sought to}} claim {{the region as a}} settlers' territory but faced a crisis with their own children and youth. Despite <b>subsidised</b> <b>schools</b> and easily available bursaries, too many white boys grew to adulthood without useful education or skills, and with disruptive expectations and demands. These youth faced immediate unemployment and appeared unlikely to be able ever to qualify as civilised breadwinning patriarchs for future generations. Rhodesia's white elite ironically responded to this problem by invoking models of socially controlled education initially developed to train and contain groups of people expected to be inferior: white girls, whose practical education prepared them for subordinate social roles, and African boys and men, whose schools sought to channel individual ambition into a defined, appropriate form of education that emphasized rural life and community values. Educational initiatives, though, proved incapable of making the racial and communal logic of segregation viable. In this case study of white crisis and administrative policy response it is possible to trace some of the logical and practical problems with the social planning initiatives {{of one of the most}} segregationist regimes anywhere...|$|E

40|$|MM - P&DMIn {{the last}} decade there has been {{universal}} concern on school effectiveness. Studies on school effectiveness indicate that various authors use different definitions {{and it is difficult}} to settle on a single definition for the concept. Furthermore the factors that contributes to good learning, a notion that is closely associated with that of school effectiveness may leave the reader wondering whether for example learners from poor backgrounds will have more difficulty learning than those from more affluent homes. This question is relevant for a country such as South Africa in which the socio-economic status of citizens is highly skewed. Central to this quest, is to find a common instrument to measure the effectiveness of schools. This is not easy when considering the various factors that influence learning and teaching. The focus of this study was therefore to identify an indicator that makes one type of school more effective than another. The comparison in study is between public and independent schools, using the indicator of the Senior Certificate Examination for 2002 to 2006 and assessing, on this basis, whether it is public or independent schools that delivers more effective schooling. To operationalise this research objective, the study used a sample of all public and independent schools that wrote the Senior Certificate Examination for 2002 to 2006. The researcher considered two types of independent schools (independent and independent subsidised) and public schools in the disaggregation of the data for this study. Independent <b>subsidised</b> <b>schools</b> are partly funded by the government while independent schools receive no funds from the government and rely on school fees. Only quantitative data analysis was used. Regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between matriculation pass rates, school fees and learner-to-educator ratio. The effect of type of school on learner performance in the matriculation examination was also investigated using regression analysis. A simple statement deeming one type of school more effective than another is simple when using the average pass rates for the Senior Certificate Examination. When comparing the average pass rates the public sector 10 schools consistently performed better than those in the independent schooling sector. However on closer statistical investigation of the data over the five years the researcher discovered that the average pass rates of the schools were not normally distributed. There are schools in the public, independent and independent subsidised sector that performed very well and those that performed very poorly. A series of statistical tests such as the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson’s Chi-square tests were thus performed. The top 5 per cent of schools were removed from the analysis as schools producing 96 to 100 per cent pass rates were all considered in the rank of ‘acceptably good performance’. This resulted in the data being more normally distributed and allowed for further analyses of the pass rates. Other analyses include a comparison of the endorsement rates in both sectors and Mathematics and Physical Science results for the three types of schools...|$|E

A study, commissioned by AGIOn (the Flemish agency that <b>subsidises</b> <b>school</b> buildings), investigated the impact of educational spaces on their users and set out to identify empirical evidence supporting the importance of school infrastructure on the well-being of students in secondary schools. Research in the field of well-being among Flemish students in secondary schools has shown that age is an important predictor of well-being (Engels et al., 2004 a). The feeling of well-being decreases during secondary education and the lowest scores occur in the 9 th and 10 th grade, i. e. students aged 14 and 15, which is why our research team chose to study this age group. We were motivated by the thought that if our findings support the hypothesis that school infrastructure matters, small adjustments could lead to important advantages for the well-being of these vulnerable students. 1 A pre-fabricated building, used as a classroom Rights reserved; © University of Antwer...|$|R
