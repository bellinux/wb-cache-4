50|$|Slabs are {{the feed}} {{material}} for hot strip mills or plate mills and blooms are rolled to billets in a <b>billet</b> <b>mill</b> or large sections in a structural mill. The output from a strip mill is coiled and, subsequently, used as the feed for a cold rolling mill or used directly by fabricators. Billets, for re-rolling, are subsequently rolled in either a merchant, bar or rod mill. Merchant or bar mills produce a variety of shaped products such as angles, channels, beams, rounds (long or coiled) and hexagons.|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{approach to}} the modelling of transient heat flow in rolled steel during air-cooling in <b>billet</b> <b>mills</b> is presented. The mathematical development starting with the relevant differential equations and their modelling using the Hills’ integral profile method give polynomial functions which characterize the transient heat flow in the workpiece and establishes an optimal control law for static cooling conditions. An experimental validation test enabled the final model to be obtained {{as a function of}} the rolling speed and shows that a good functional correspondence exists between the model and the data reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a workable, cost-effective proposal for eliminating the thermal distortions observed during production of rolled steel bars in <b>billet</b> <b>mills.</b> Manipulation of the temperature distributions in the workpiece {{to produce the}} desired shape of the final product was achieved through control of the heat supplied to a thermal housing designed for installation on the cooling bed to enhance homogenization of the heat flow across {{the dimensions of the}} product as it cools down from the final rolling temperature of about 900 °C. The control system matches the changes in the operation of the rolls by introducing the concept of residence time the effect of which was the ultimate homogenization of the product temperature and elimination of the internal stresses...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} approach {{is presented to}} investigate the deformation characteristics of billets in a continuous <b>billet</b> <b>mill</b> using power driven horizontal stands and idle vertical stands. The analysis is validated by comparison to the experimental results in a previously published work. The analytical results have shown that, apart from the problems of slip and buckling of billet, there are some shortcomings involved in this method. Compared to conventional rolling with all driven stands, the roll load for idle vertical stands and the rolling torque for horizontal stands are almost doubled. The billet is severely stressed within the roll-bite of idle vertical stands and the overall rolling power has increased by one third of that for conventional rolling. These shortcomings impair the feasibility of industrial application of idle vertical stand rolling method...|$|R
40|$|There the experimentally-theoretical {{approach}} {{to the prediction of}} wear non-uniformity of deforming tool conformably to the rolling conditions of high strips has been developed. The new data about the character and about the degree of influence of process factors on the surface quality of blanks in the low-plastic sulphyrous steels have been obtained. The effective production process of blanks in the low-plastic sulphyrous steels, which provides the high quality of their surface, has been developed. The production reserves at the rolling stage of ingots by the rougher and by the <b>billet</b> <b>mill</b> have been determined. The introduction subject is the production process of blanks in the sulphurous marks of steels.

The casting process (electromagnetic intensity and casting speed) shows outstanding effects on the microstructures and flow stress behavior of the billets.

50|$|SCOB was amalgamated with IISCO on 1 January 1953. In {{the early}} fifties Tata Iron & Steel Company and IISCO {{were the only}} {{companies}} having integrated steel plants in India. It was estimated by a Technical Mission of the World Bank that steel demand in India would touch 6 million tonnes by 1960. Eugene Black, president of the World Bank, visited India {{in connection with the}} study of the Technical Mission. He also visited Burnpur. The rising demand for steel paved the way for expansion of IISCO. The foreign exchange component of the expansion programme was met with a loan from the World Bank. The expansion programmes were completed in 1956. Two coke oven batteries, two new blast furnaces, each with a capacity of 1,200 tonnes per day, additional open hearth furnaces (taking the total to seven), Morgan continuous <b>billet</b> <b>mill</b> and a continuous bar and rod mill were added along with many auxiliary facilities. The plant capacity was raised to 1 million tonnes of crude steel per annum.|$|R
50|$|With the Carnegie-Illinois {{working at}} full {{capacity}} producing bar plates, the American Steel and Tin Plate Company and the American Steel and Wire Company, quick {{to realize the}} advantages of being near the source of bar plate output, in 1900 established themselves {{in close proximity to}} the Carnegie, and converted the Carnegie products into sheet steel, tin plate, and wire, respectively. These firms were added milestones to the progress of Farrell.Since the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company, the Carnegie, and the American Steel and Wire Company were now the mainstays if industry in Farrell, we should note some of the high points of their history. The original furnaces produced the first pig iron on December 9, 1901. Six years later, on June 9, 1907, seven open hearth furnaces were added, and nine years later, on March 21, 1916, three more were added. The first rolling mills began their operations on May 10, 1901, and the first open hearth was made on April 30, 1901. The original bar and <b>billet</b> <b>mill</b> was replaced by the present mill in March, 1918.|$|R
50|$|This was a corn mill, latterly {{converted}} {{to generate electricity}} c.1900. The waterwheel {{was replaced by a}} turbine made by Messrs Drake & Fletcher of Maidstone. During the Second World War, Italian Prisoners of War were <b>billeted</b> in the <b>mill</b> building. The building survives today, converted into a house.|$|R

50|$|The First to {{have set}} up a rolling mill not only on the railways, but {{probably}} in the country in 1870. It had 3 mills, steam driven Power hammer, fish plate machine, <b>billet</b> shears, the <b>mill</b> was driven by steam from boilers placed {{on the top of the}} furnaces and heated by gas from the furnaces. It produced about 400 tons of rounds, channels, angles and fishplates per month.|$|R
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{assembled in}} camp at Caernarfon, joining the newly raised 7th and 9th Battalions of the Loyals which (together with 12th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers) constituted No 15 Infantry Training Group. In October 1940 the 15th ITG became 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a home defence formation. Training was {{hampered by the}} shortage of rifles and equipment, and the tented camp became uninhabitable during winter gales. In January 1941 the 8th Battalion relocated to <b>billets</b> in disused <b>mills</b> at Biddulph, with B Company at Huyton.|$|R
50|$|The 8th Battalion {{was formed}} on 4 July 1940 at Ashton-under-Lyne, with the {{majority}} of the recruits coming from Liverpool and the cadre of experienced non-commissioned officers and men from the Manchester Regiment's Machine Gun Training Centre at Ladysmith Barracks, Ashton-under-Lyne. It also served in 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), and went into <b>billets</b> in disused <b>mills</b> at Biddulph and Huyton during the winter of 1940-41. Like the 7th Loyals, the 8th Battalion was also transferred to the Royal Artillery, becoming the 93rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, on 15 November 1941. In January 1942 it joined the 42nd Support Group in 42nd Armoured Division (converted from the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division). When the 42nd Armoured was broken up in October 1943 the regiment served in Home Forces, joining 80th AA Brigade to train for an assault role on D-Day. Like the 92nd LAA Regiment, the 93rd LAA Regiment served with the British Second Army in the North West Europe Campaign from 1944 to 1945.|$|R
