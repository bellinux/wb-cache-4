A group parameter is a component of a coordinate vector representing an arbitrary element of the Lie algebra with respect to some basis. A basis, then, is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> being a basis of the Lie algebra in the usual vector space sense.|$|E
25|$|Monoids may {{be given}} a presentation, much {{in the same way}} that groups can be {{specified}} by means of a group presentation. One does this by specifying a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> Σ, and a set of relations on the free monoid Σ∗. One does this by extending (finite) binary relations on Σ∗ to monoid congruences, and then constructing the quotient monoid, as above.|$|E

40|$|The thesis investigates {{problem in}} finite {{geometry}} with methods from algebraic combinatorics. The {{results of the}} thesis are as follows. We improve the best known upper bound on EKR <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> <b>of</b> H(2 d- 1, q 2), d odd, to approximately q(d- 1) 2 + 1. We classify the largest (d-t) -intersecting EKR <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> for t leq to c sqrt d and give non-trivial upper bounds for all such sets. We give a new bound on constant distance codes in H(2 d- 1, q 2). We classify cross-intersecting EKR <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> for all finite classical polar spaces except H(2 d- 1, q 2). In the latter case, a non-trivial upper bound is proven.

25|$|As already mentioned, {{the methods}} and formalisms of {{universal}} algebra are an important tool for many order theoretic considerations. Beside formalizing orders in terms of algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities, one can also establish other connections to algebra. An example is given by the correspondence between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings. Other issues {{are concerned with the}} existence of free constructions, such as free lattices based on a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators.</b> Furthermore, closure operators are important in the study of universal algebra.|$|E
25|$|Further {{examples}} of non-positively curved 2-dimensional complexes of {{groups have been}} constructed by Swiatkowski based on actions simply transitive on oriented edges and inducing a 3-fold symmetry on each triangle; in this case too the complex of groups is obtained from the regular action on the second barycentric subdivision. The simplest example, discovered earlier with Ballmann, starts from a finite group H with a symmetric <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> S, not containing the identity, such that the corresponding Cayley graph has girth at least 6. The associated group is generated by H and an involution τ subject to (τg)3 = 1 for each g in S.|$|E
25|$|A Cayley graph is a graph defined {{from a pair}} (G,S) where G is a {{group and}} S is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In {{the case of a}} finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an {{infinite}} cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called circulant graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive graphs whose symmetry group includes a transitive cyclic group.|$|E

25|$|Example 6. Periodic {{sequence}} with {{period a}} power of two. This is a proper subalgebra of Example 5 (a proper subalgebra equals the intersection of itself with its algebra). These {{can be understood as}} the finitary operations, with the first period of such a sequence giving the truth table of the operation it represents. For example, the truth table of x0 in the table of binary operations, namely 2f10, has period 2 (and so can be recognized as using only the first variable) even though 12 of the binary operations have period 4. When the period is 2n the operation only depends on the first n variables, the sense in which the operation is finitary. This example is also a countably infinite atomless Boolean algebra. Hence Example 5 is isomorphic to a proper subalgebra of itself! Example 6, and hence Example 5, constitutes the free Boolean algebra on countably many generators, meaning the Boolean algebra of all finitary operations on a countably infinite <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> or variables.|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} abstract algebra known as combinatorial group theory, the word problem for a finitely generated group G is the algorithmic problem of deciding whether two words in the generators represent the same element.

2500|$|The idea of {{this first}} proof is roughly as follows. Consider the ring {{generated}} by pairs (X, V) where V is a smooth vector bundle on the compact smooth oriented manifold X, with relations that [...] the sum and product of the ring on these generators are given by disjoint union and product of manifolds (with the obvious operations on the vector bundles), and any boundary of a manifold with vector bundle is 0. This {{is similar to the}} cobordism ring of oriented manifolds, except that the manifolds also have a vector bundle. The topological and analytical indices are both reinterpreted as functions from this ring to the integers. Then one checks that these two functions [...] are in fact both ring homomorphisms. In order to prove they are the same, it is then only necessary to check they are the same on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators</b> of this ring. Thom's cobordism theory gives a set of generators; for example, complex vector spaces with the trivial bundle together with certain bundles over even dimensional spheres. So the index theorem can be proved by checking it on these particularly simple cases.|$|E
2500|$|While no {{worst-case}} polynomial-time algorithms {{are known}} for the general Graph Automorphism problem, finding the automorphism group (and printing out an irredundant <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>generators)</b> for many large graphs arising in applications is rather easy.

However, BLISS and NAUTY can also produce Canonical Labeling, whereas SAUCY is currently optimized for solving Graph Automorphism. An important observation is that for a graph on n vertices, the automorphism group can be specified {{by no more than}} n-1 generators, and the above software packages are guaranteed to satisfy this bound as a side-effect of their algorithms (minimal sets of generators are harder to find and are not particularly useful in practice). It also appears that the total support (i.e., the number of vertices moved) of all generators is limited by a linear function of n, which is important in runtime analysis of these algorithms. However, this has not been established for a fact, as of March 2012.|$|E
