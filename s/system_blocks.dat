50|$|XFS {{makes use}} of lazy {{evaluation}} techniques for file allocation. When a file is written to the buffer cache, rather than allocating extents for the data, XFS simply reserves the appropriate number of file <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> for the data held in memory. The actual block allocation occurs only when the data is finally flushed to disk. This improves the chance that the file will be written in a contiguous group of blocks, reducing fragmentation problems and increasing performance.|$|E
50|$|Some {{professional}} {{two-factor authentication}} solutions also {{ensure that there}} is always a valid passcode available for users.

And if the new code is not entered within a specified time limit, the system automatically replaces it. This ensures that no old, already used codes are left on mobile devices. For added security, it is possible to specify how many incorrect entries are permitted before the <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> access.|$|E

50|$|A nervous {{breakdown}} {{is very similar}} to a panic attack. Stress is a major cause in both cases and they are both temporary. During a {{nervous breakdown}}, a person's emotional state of being shifts from an ability to cope with life stresses to a state of being totally overwhelmed to a point that normal functioning is disrupted. Excessive worry, nervousness, fear, anxiety are symptomatic. These states of being are accompanied by a variety of uncomfortable feelings often summarized as bad or sad. If these feelings become so intense they are perceived as life-threatening, the defense <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> awareness. These mechanisms while protective can also be limiting to successful living. Overwhelming stress, therefore, is causative. Whether that stress is self-created or external requires different approaches and has different implications to the individual.|$|E

50|$|A {{relatively}} recent technique is delayed allocation in XFS, HFS+ and ZFS; the same technique is also called allocate-on-flush in reiser4 and ext4. When the file system is being written to, file <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> are reserved, but {{the locations of}} specific files are not laid down yet. Later, when the file system is forced to flush changes {{as a result of}} memory pressure or a transaction commit, the allocator will have much better knowledge of the files' characteristics. Most file systems with this approach try to flush files in a single directory contiguously. Assuming that multiple reads from a single directory are common, locality of reference is improved. Reiser4 also orders the layout of files according to the directory hash table, so that when files are being accessed in the natural file system order (as dictated by readdir), they are always read sequentially.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second year}} {{begins with the}} Tools for Diagnosis and Therapy course, which gives {{students}} {{a basic understanding of}} the various machines and technologies available to aid physical diagnosis (i.e., CT scanners, MRI, etc.). The second year curriculum is divided into organ <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> that are 3-8 weeks in length. As in first year, these blocks offer a highly integrated curriculum; each block covers the physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of that organ system. Each semester ends with a capstone [...] "Clinical Cases" [...] course, which allows students to fully exercise their knowledge of diagnosis and therapy. Students also participate in Humanities & Social Science Seminars that meet once a week for half the year. Clinical exposure expands through the continuation of the Introduction to Clinical Medicine small groups and an additional three Community Weeks. Lastly, students receive training in the conduction and critical reading of medical research through the Clinical Epidemiology course. At the end of second year, students take the USMLE Step 1 Exam.|$|E

Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) {{at the beginning of}} a system appends it to the previous <b>system.</b> <b>Blocks</b> can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.|$|E
50|$|A hall {{church with}} three naves that retains a design {{close to the}} original, {{it was the last}} such church built in Transylvania, and was {{constructed}} between 1486 and 1524 on the site of an earlier Romanesque church. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary and built in Late Gothic style with Renaissance touches, the structure was constrained by the hilly landscape. The choir is 18 m in length, with a rib-vaulted ceiling, while the three naves of equal height also have rib vaulting. A defensive level above the choir has parapets and a battlement. A second, wooden, level was demolished in 1803. The polyptych altarpiece has 28 panels executed between 1482 and 1513 by a painter likely trained at Vienna and Nuremberg. In the center, there is a sculpted group: a crucifix with Jesus Christ hanging, Mary standing and Mary Magdalene embracing the cross. The upper side panels show visions of Ezekiel and Augustus. The stone pulpit, which shows scenes carved in relief, dates to 1523. The richly decorated intarsia door of the sacristy has a complex lock, displayed at the 1889 Paris World's Fair. Its central <b>system</b> <b>blocks</b> the door in thirteen points, ensuring the safety of the valuables kept in the sacristy.|$|E
