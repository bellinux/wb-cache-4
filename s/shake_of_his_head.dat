60|$|That gentleman, with a {{very serious}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> subscribed the article.|$|E
60|$|And that {{astonished}} mariner, with {{a helpless}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> gave it up.|$|E
60|$|The provost {{answered}} with another sagacious <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{that would have}} done honour to Lord Burleigh in the CRITIC.|$|E
60|$|He was {{not reading}} now, but {{walking up and}} down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> glanced anxiously towards the door.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George was at {{this time}} just writing the address on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letter. He did not say any thing, but Rollo {{observed}} a very slight and almost imperceptible <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|In his drowsy chuckling, and the <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he put <b>his</b> {{hands into}} his {{waistcoat}} pockets. In one of them he found a bit of holly (left there, probably last night), which he now took out, and looked at.|$|R
6000|$|The Arab {{repeated}} the <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{but after a}} moments' thought said, [...] "I know littil Engleesh; speak, where comes you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Macklin {{tried to}} remove him once before," [...] {{returned}} Allen, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "That boy beats all for shrewdness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{suppose you}} don't {{find that the}} Redskins have come this way," [...] rejoined Tolly, after a {{doubtful}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "what then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose it might! By the Lord, you may suppose so. By George!' said Mr. Bounderby, with sundry menacing {{nods and}} <b>shakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'It {{might have been}} twice twenty. There's no knowing {{what it would have}} been, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the fellows' being disturbed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't take none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> talk," [...] grumbled Bob Sanderson, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grizzled <b>head.</b> [...] "I reckon what he {{said about}} gettin' you into trouble is all nonsense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it's {{the same}} Jane as ever," [...] he responded, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grizzled <b>head.</b> [...] "Do you know, I sort o' hoped she'd reformed, and I'd {{be glad to}} see her again. They tell me she's got money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{foolish to}} carry it loose. Any one could take it from you," [...] said the cabin boy, with a knowing <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They couldn't {{have seen}} the firelight," [...] {{returned}} Dick, with a sorry <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "It beats all where they went to, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I'd {{been with}} you," [...] remarked my uncle, with a {{vigorous}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "I'd a-smashed in his figurehead, keelhaul me if I wouldn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{many will}} never get it there in any event," [...] {{declared}} the Major, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grizzled <b>head.</b> [...] "More than half the rascals that John helps go to the dogs entirely, and hang us up for all they've borrowed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there would}} be the sea devils waitin' for us," [...] added Cap'n Bill with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bald <b>head.</b> [...] "They'd drive us back inter the tunnel like they did the first time, Trot. It won't do, mate, it won't do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're too {{milk and}} watery with our friend, you are indeed,' remonstrated Silas, with a disapproving <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wooden <b>head.</b> Then at once you confess {{yourself}} desirous {{to come to}} terms, do you Boffin? Before you answer, keep this hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't {{be so bad}} {{the first}} few days--or nights," [...] said Andy. [...] "But after that----" [...] He {{finished}} with a grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe it will sink us," [...] said another, with {{a serious}} <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Then they muttered among themselves, and cast ugly glances at Andy and Chet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{was getting}} dangerous," [...] {{returned}} Andy, with a serious <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> as he tied his handkerchief over his burned neck. [...] "Hark! what is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She got across, {{and then}} set the boat loose," [...] said August. [...] "That's the Indian of her. If she went up on the cliffs to the Navajos maybe we'll find her. If {{she went into the}} Painted Desert--" [...] a grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shaggy <b>head</b> {{completed}} <b>his</b> sentence.|$|R
6000|$|Donald {{knew too}} well from {{experience}} {{that it was not}} safe to attempt arguing the question, but he gave a peculiarly defiant <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged <b>head,</b> which said as plainly as words that the time was coming when [...] "poonishment" [...] would cease to secure even obedience--at least in his case! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} got on the Brooklyn," [...] said Dan, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> curly <b>head.</b> [...] "She's going to lick the Spaniards out of their boots, see if she ain't!" [...] And his earnestness made Walter laugh. Dan was but eleven, yet he read the {{newspapers}} as closely as do many grown folks.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were lucky}} to be between the rocks, Phil," [...] said Dave, with a grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Otherwise, if that tree had come down on us----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{got to be}} done," [...] went on Parsons, with a grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "unless we {{all want}} to be murdered and robbed in our beds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't {{find any}} trace of the villain?" [...] queried Randolph Rover, with a sad <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Too bad! Too bad! And it was your father's watch, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|TWISDEN, {{behind his}} table, motionless, taps his teeth with the [...] {{eyeglasses}} in his narrow, well-kept hand. After a long <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> [...] <b>head</b> and a shrug <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rather high shoulders he snips, {{goes to the}} [...] window and opens it. Then crossing to the door, Left Back, he [...] throws it open and says ...|$|R
60|$|Jack {{clenched his}} fist and sprang at the man as a bull-terrier might leap on a mastiff. Almost {{in the act of}} {{striking}} he changed his mind, and, instead of delivering one of those scientific blows with which he had {{on more than one occasion}} in his past history terminated a fight at its very commencement, he seized Ladoc by the throat, tripped up his heels, and hurled him to the ground with such force, that he lay quite still for at least half a minute! Leaving him there to the care of O'Donel, who had returned, Jack went up to his bedroom, shut the door, thrust his hands into his pockets, and began to pace the floor rapidly, and to shake <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Gradually <b>his</b> pace became slower, and the <b>shaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> more sedate. Presently he soliloquised in an undertone.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Sire then <b>shook</b> the honours <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> [...] And from <b>his</b> brows damps <b>of</b> {{oblivion}} shed [...] Full on the filial dulness--long {{he stood}} [...] Repelling from his breast the raging God." ...|$|R
60|$|With this courteous speech it {{extended}} a card toward the Scarecrow, who accepted it, {{turned it over}} and over, and handed it with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to Tip.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll have to land again, lads," [...] {{put in the}} captain, with a grave <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "This wind {{is growing}} worse. We don't want to be swamped." ...|$|E
6000|$|He only, at this, like a {{buffeting}} swimmer, gave a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and repeated}} his question. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} tell me I must marry such a woman?" ...|$|E
60|$|The seaman's {{appetite}} {{was indeed}} so sharp {{that he did}} not vouchsafe a reply. The prisoners in the dark corner seemed much in the same condition, but their anxiety to begin did not prevent their shutting their eyes for a few seconds and obviously asking a blessing on their meal. Hockins observed the act, and there passed over his soul another wave of self-condemnation, which was indicated by a deprecatory <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rugged <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that," [...] {{protested the}} Wizard, with a <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bald <b>head.</b> [...] "The one bit of magic I robbed them of--which was the Word of Transformation--is so simple, yet so powerful, that neither Glinda nor I can equal it. It isn't all in the word, you know, it's the way the word is pronounced. So if the two strange magicians have other magic of the same sort, they might prove very {{dangerous}} to us, if we liberated them." ...|$|R
60|$|The old sailor made {{no further}} remonstrance, but {{summoning}} {{the two young}} men who generally accompanied them, he busied himself in carrying down the oars, and making preparations to launch the little boat which was to carry them to where the yacht was moored about a hundred yards out, with many quiet disapproving <b>shakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as he did so. They were soon in, and launched through the waves, which were breaking with a long, heavy, menacing roar. It was not rough yet, but even in the quarter of an hour which had elapsed between their arrival at the village, and reaching the side of the yacht, the aspect of the weather had changed much; the gusts of wind came more frequently, and with far greater force, whitening the surface of the water, and tearing off the tops of the waves in sheets of spray. The dull heavy clouds overhead were beginning to break up suddenly, as if stirred by some mighty force within themselves, great openings and rents seemed torn asunder in the dark curtain, and then as suddenly closed up again; but through these momentary openings, the scud could be seen flying rapidly past in the higher regions of the air.|$|R
