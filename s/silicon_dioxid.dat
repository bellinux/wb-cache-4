40|$|The {{background}} {{energy content}} of a linear cw CPM rhodamine 6 G-DODCI femtosecond dye laser is determined by time- resolved measurement of the Rayleigh scattered signal in a colloidal <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxid</b> suspension with an ungated inverse time- correlated single photon counting system. A constant background intensity signal is observed outside the temporal region of the instrument response function of the detection system. Assuming the same background intensity level within the temporal region of the instrument response function, an average background intensity level of approximately 2. 5 × 10 - 8 of the peak pulse intensity, and a background energy {{content of a}}pproximately 2 × 10 - 3 of the pulse energy are found...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{construction}} of the membrane microsensors with interdigital transducers (IDT) to the ultrasonic wave Lamba-type (FPW- flexural plate waves) generation was presented. The conditions of the wave propagation were also described. The possibilities of the fabrication of multilayer membranes on the silicon base using the microelectronics technologies were shown. The distribution of the internal tensions and strains in the membrane was analysed for the different boundary conditions. The calculations were carried out {{by means of the}} finite element’s method (ANSYS programme). The membrane vibrations in which the waves propagate were analysed. Key-Words:- mircosensors, ultrasonic waves, Lamba plate waves, silicon membrane, interdigital transducers 1 The sensor construction and the conditions of Lamba wave propagation The sensor membrane with the ultrasonic wave Lambatype consists of several layers which have different thickness. For the membrane that is made in silicon wafer, the basic layer (which determines the elasticity properties of the whole membrane) is monocrystalline silicon layer or the silicon nitride or <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxid...</b>|$|E

No mobile ions were detected by capacitance-voltage measurements on MOS structures stressed at 150 ~ Values of the ionic transport number, the ratio of ionic current to total current, were ob-tained {{as a function of}} temperature, oxygen part ia l pressure, and substrate doping by comparing the open circuit voltages measured for the cells with theoretical values calculated from the free energy of formation. On the basis of the exper imental results and a theoretical model, it is proposed that the species pr imar i ly responsible for ionc conduction at e levated temperatures i a native defect, specifically, a doubly charged oxygen interstitial.
