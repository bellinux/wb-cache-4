Packets of {{information}} {{arrive at the}} system as a compound Poisson process, and are transmitted only during individual periodic intervals.

This nonstationary distribution is used to determine the complete system behavior, including the delay distributions, the blocking probability, and the density of the system size at arrival instants.

40|$|One of {{important}} transmission technologies in the broadband ISDN is the synchronous transmission technology based on SDH, a key concept of SONET/SDH is the pointer-based {{access to the}} encapsulated payloads in theSONET/SDH signal. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and the Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) are hierarchies used in Europe/South-America and NorthAmerica/Japan, respectively.

SONET and SDH are based on transmission at rates that are integer multiples of 51. 840 Mbps. SONET basic frame structure is called synchronous transport signal level one (STS-l). SDH basic modular signal is called synchronous transport module level one (STM-I).

40|$|The {{combination}} of shared bandwidth and rejection rate parameters, {{together with the}} quality of service predicted by neural networks in a novel strategy for connection admission control and call routing. The Broadband Integrated Service Digital Network (B-ISDN), which uses the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technique based on fixed length packets called cells, requires complex flow control mechanisms to support narrow and broadband services. Since the communications networks based on <b>synchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> provide a quality of service independent of the load, the flow control mechanisms only need to reject the new connections when no resources are available. On the other hand, in packet based data networks, since the quality of service is load dependent, the flow control acts on the packet stream to guarantee a minimum quality of service. The B-ISDN requires a connection establishment phase within which the user and the network negotiate the quality of service of the connections which support the call, with some parameters being established on a probability basis, due to the competitive nature of the network. This implies that the control mechanisms must cover a wide variety of complex functions and the traditiona...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (DTDM) is a {{flexible}} network transport technique calmhie of handling both continuous and bursty traffic effectively. By employing three different multiplexing ar- chitectures in the network, DTDM permits graceful {{evolution of the}} existing circuit switching network into {{a flexible}} broadband packet communication network supporting integrated voice, data, and video traffic. The first multiplexing stage uses a packet assembler to multiplex different broadband services into a common DTDM-format serial bit stream. The second multiplexing stage uses a statistical packet mul- tiplexer to concentrate network traffic for more efficient use of trans- mission facilities. A novel architecture for a multiple-input multiple- output statistical packet multiplexer was designed so that the total traffic load of the multiplexer ran be evenly distributed among the output lines and the service priority of each input line can be rearranged dynamically. The third multiplexing stage uSes a <b>synchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiplexer for high-speed point-to-point transparent transmission.
