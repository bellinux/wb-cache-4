500|$|On 21 January 1960, the Settle rail crash, {{which cost}} {{the lives of}} five passengers, was caused when the piston rod, {{cross-head}} and connecting rod of No. 70052 came loose and damaged the opposite line as a freight train was approaching. The locomotive of the freight train was derailed towards 70052's train and tore out the sides of three passenger coaches.

2500|$|The [...]380 ACP {{cartridge}} {{was derived}} from Browning's earlier [...]38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The [...]380 ACP {{was designed to be}} truly rimless, with headspace on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a [...]380. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the recoil energy of the round, due to the round's relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a [...] "tilting" [...] barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the blowback system is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass (weight) to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power the round, the heavier the <b>slide</b> <b>assembly</b> has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon (alternatively, a very stiff spring will work, but will make operating the slide very difficult). Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, but the required weight of slide and strength of spring makes this an unattractive option. Although the low power of the [...]380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have also been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in [...]380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback operated [...]380 ACP weapons. There have also been some relatively diminutive (blowback-operated) submachine guns, such as the Ingram MAC-11 and the Czech vz. 83.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation was}} carried out to understand the aggregation of nanoscale graphene with two typical assembly pathways of stacking <b>assembly</b> and <b>sliding</b> <b>assembly</b> in water. The interfacial-organized monolayer water film (MWF) hindering the aggregation of nanographene in both stacking and <b>sliding</b> <b>assembly</b> pathways was reported for the first time. By means of potential mean forces (PMFs) calculation, no energy barrier was observed during the <b>sliding</b> <b>assembly</b> of two graphene nanosheets, while the PMF profiles could be impacted by the contact forms of nanographene and the MWF within the interplate of two graphene nanosheets. To explore the potential physical basis of the hindering-role of self-organized interfacial water, the dynamical and structural properties {{as well as the}} status of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) for interfacial water were investigated. We found that the compact, ordered structure and abundant H-bonds of the MWF could be taken as the fundamental aspects of the hindering-role of interfacial water for the hydrophobic assembly of nanographene. These findings are displaying a potential to further understand the hydrophobic assembly which mostly dominate the behaviors of nanomaterials, proteins etc. in aqueous solutions.

5000|$|Prior to {{the early}} 20th century, all shotgun barrels were forged by heating narrow strips of iron and steel and shaping them around a mandrel.

These types of barrels earned a reputation for weakness and were never meant to be used with modern smokeless powder, or any kind of moderately powerful explosive. Because of the resemblance to Damascus steel, higher-end barrels were made by Belgian and British gun makers. These barrels are proof marked and meant to be used with light pressure loads.

40|$|Contacting {{surfaces}} of opposing teeth produce friction that, when altered, changes the contact force direction and/or magnitude. As friction can {{be influenced by}} several factors, including lubrication and the contacting materials, {{the aim of this}} study was to measure the occlusal load alterations experienced by teeth with the introduction of different salivas and dental restorative materials.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} hydraulically operated squeeze pins to reduce porosity formation in cast aluminium bearing caps. Two complete sets are cast in an eight-cavity die with a 2000 t cold chamber high pressure die casting machine. The initial die configuration used a <b>sliding</b> core <b>assembly</b> with stationary pins to core a through hole in a thick section of the front cam caps. This configuration resulted in high post machining scrap rates, primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the <b>sliding</b> core <b>assembly</b> with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate. The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover. Density measurements and visual inspection confirmed the substantial improvement in porosity levels in the critical region of the castings. <br /...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSurgical {{treatment}} of early-onset scoliosis has greatly developed in recent years. Early-onset scoliosis covers {{a variety of}} etiologies (idiopathic, neurologic, dystrophic, malformative, etc.) with onset {{before the age of}} 5 years. Progression and severity threaten respiratory development and may result in respiratory failure in adulthood. Many surgical techniques have been developed in recent years, aiming to protect spinal and thoracic development. Material and methodsPresent techniques are based on one of two main principles. The first consists in posterior distraction of the spine in its concavity (single growing rod, or vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib [VEPTR]), or on either side (dual rod); this requires iterative surgery, for lengthening, unless motorized using energy provided by a magnetic system. The second option is to use spinal growth force to lengthen the assembly; these techniques (Luque Trolley, Shilla), using a <b>sliding</b> <b>assembly,</b> are known as growth guidance. ResultsThese techniques are effective in controlling early scoliotic deformity, and to some extent restore spinal growth. However, they show a high rate of complications: infection, rod breakage, spinal fixation pull out and, above all, progressive spinal stiffness, reducing long-term efficacy. Respiratory gain is harder to assess, as thoracic expansion does not systematically improve respiratory function, particularly due to impaired compliance of the thoracic cage...|$|R
