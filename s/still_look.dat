According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

Loeb said that Daredevil would begin filming in July 2014, and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month. It filmed under the working title Bluff, on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program. Production concluded on December 21, 2014. Other filming locations in New York City included: the Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Bushwick neighborhoods in Brooklyn; Abe Lebewohl Park in the East Village; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in Flushing, Queens; the New York State Supreme Court Building, with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; Brooklyn Borough Hall; the Rockefeller Center rooftop gardens; Brooklyn College for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.|$|E

So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I <b>still</b> <b>look</b> forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party.

25|$|The Great Hall is sited on the castle's {{southern}} side, {{where some}} of the more visible remains still stand. This was a large room used for dining and receiving visitors. Its much enlarged windows <b>still</b> <b>look</b> south across the valley and an arched gateway leads from the west end of the room to what was once the Kitchens {{in the basement of the}} adjacent apsidal ('D' shaped) tower. This tower, called the Welsh Tower, is a typical feature of Welsh castles of the period. It would have protruded from the castle wall into the defensive ditch and provided archers with a clear view of any attackers attempting to approach the southern wall. The tower had perhaps three storeys with living quarters on the upper floors. In the south western corner was a Postern gate. This was an additional exit from the castle, designed to be used in times of siege to allow the garrison to 'sally' out and attack their besiegers. Fragments of the arch remain as well as the slot for the door's drawbar.|$|E

25|$|Presiding {{over most}} of the {{prohibition}} period with all of the required changes in personnel, vessels and rapidly changing technology, Billard managed to keep the service focused on its missions and <b>still</b> <b>look</b> out for the welfare of its men. He was noted for an interest in education of the personnel, their morale and welfare. His insight into changing technology to complete a diverse set of missions was met with improvements in cutter design, increasing use of radios, and gave Coast Guard aviation a practical start. He insisted on absolute integrity for his officers and men so that the service's reputation would not be harmed during the prohibition era. His establishment of the Coast Guard Academy in New London helped put officer education on a solid footing. As Commandant, Billard moved the Academy from Fort Trumbull to its current location in 1932 and expanded the curriculum to four years. Earlier as Superintendent in 1920, Billard had established the school's motto, Scientiae Cedit Mare (The Sea Yields to Knowledge). Billard Hall is an Academy athletics facility that was named for him and completed in 1932 which is used for wrestling competition and also includes fitness facilities and weight training equipment.|$|E
500|$|Doom 3 {{received}} a favorable reception from critics, with the PC {{version of the}} game holding an 87 percent score and an 88 percent score at the review compilation sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. Much praise {{was given to the}} quality of Doom 3s graphics and presentation; GameSpot described the game's environments as [...] "convincingly lifelike, densely atmospheric, and surprisingly expansive", while PC Gamer UK described the graphics and non-player character modeling and animation as simply [...] "flawless", stating that Doom 3 signalled the return of the Doom franchise to the forefront of the computer and video game industry, eleven years after the release of the original Doom. IGN's Dan Adams noted that the game's presentation comprised a remarkably high proportion of the game, stating that [...] "without the atmosphere, Doom 3 is a plain shooter that hearkens back to those of the '90s." [...] In addition, several reviewers praised id Software for making the game <b>still</b> <b>look</b> surprisingly good even on lower graphics levels.|$|E

[...] The C5 was described as [...] "the baby of the family". The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to [...] in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, [...] "it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too." [...] The design is strikingly similar to the modern Renault Twizy electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that [...] "you could put the C10 into production today and it would <b>still</b> <b>look</b> contemporary." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{writing on}} her {{personality}} in [...] "Alice on the Stage" [...] (April 1887), Carroll described her as [...] "loving and gentle", [...] "courteous to all", [...] "trustful", and [...] "wildly curious, {{and with the}} eager enjoyment of Life that comes only in the happy hours of childhood, when all is new and fair, and when Sin and Sorrow are but names — empty words signifying nothing!" [...] Commentators characterise her as [...] "innocent", [...] "imaginative", introspective, generally well-mannered, critical of authority figures, and clever. Others see less positive traits in Alice, writing that she frequently shows unkindness in her conversations with the animals in Wonderland, takes violent action against the character Bill the Lizard by kicking him into the air, and reflects her social upbringing in her lack of sensitivity and impolite replies. According to Donald Rackin, [...] "In spite of her class- and time-bound prejudices, her frightened fretting and childish, abject tears, her priggishness and self-assured ignorance, her sometimes blatant hypocrisy, her general powerlessness and confusion, and her rather cowardly readiness to abandon her struggles {{at the ends of}} the two adventures— many readers <b>still</b> <b>look</b> up to Alice as a mythic embodiment of control, perseverance, bravery, and mature good sense." ...|$|E
500|$|A genius {{scientist}} who has mutant abilities {{similar to those}} of the great apes. He attempts to cure himself of what he believes to be physically debilitating aspects of his mutation only to be transformed into a frightening-looking blue-furred apeman with leonine attributes. Despite his new appearance, he is kind and caring at heart. Broadway actor Benjamin Walker was previously cast as Beast, but eventually turned down the role to star in the Broadway musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson. Hoult was chosen for being [...] "gentle with a capability of being fierce", and admitted to being both an X-Men fan and enthusiastic on both returning to the action genre after 2010's Clash of the Titans and working with the film's cast. The actor had to use makeup that took four hours to apply when Hank becomes the Beast, which include a mask, contact lenses, a furry muscle suit and fake teeth. As Vaughn wanted Beast to look more feral than the version Kelsey Grammer played in , the redesign went through various tests, which tried to make Beast not resemble any particular animal but <b>still</b> <b>look</b> like Hoult, as well as with a furry body, which makeup artist Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics likened to [...] "something akin to a wolf's pelt on his face, his arms-everywhere". The suits employed actual dyed fur from fox pelts.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8 out of 10, praising [...] "well-needed" [...] {{development}} of Fitz and Simmons, the skydiving scene (despite {{what he calls}} [...] "the less than stellar FX"), {{and the fact that}} Coulson could not save Diaz, while criticizing the amount of MCU connections, stating that the series is [...] "Still too tied to prior Marvel movie MacGuffins." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B', saying [...] "Despite my problems with the series, I <b>still</b> <b>look</b> forward to watching S.H.I.E.L.D. every week. It does a good job capturing the thrill of the big screen on a TV budget ... the dialogue is breezy, and the cast becomes more appealing with each new episode. There’s plenty of room for this show to grow, but I’m not ready to write it off yet." [...] Alan Sepinwall at HitFix called [...] "FZZT" [...] "the first installment of S.H.I.E.L.D. to suggest the creative team was aware of what's not working, even if they couldn't solve every problem in a single installment", feeling that the episode made several positive steps forward in terms of character development. Will Salmon gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5 for SFX, praising the performances of Henstridge and Gregg, but calling the episode clichéd, and concluding that [...] "by fleshing out the characters, it does feel like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is now more than just a flashy brand extension." ...|$|E

Other filming locations in New York City used included: the East Village's Horseshoe Bar for Luke's Bar; the 33rd Street PATH station and a PATH train; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica's apartment (with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage); Douglaston, Queens for Jessica's childhood home; the Angel Orensanz Center for Jessica and Luke's fight in [...] "AKA Take a Bloody Number"; Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower and Pier 88 for locations in [...] "AKA Smile"; the Meatpacking District; Nolita; near the 39th Street entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel; Tribeca; Bryant Park; Union Square; Gramercy; Greenpoint, Brooklyn near the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant; Long Island City, including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed growing facility, with exteriors shots taken from near Calvary Cemetery; the Queensboro Bridge on the Queens side; the Manhattan Bridge; the Brooklyn Navy Yard; Bethesda Terrace and Fountain in Central Park; and Industry City.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Tidus and Yuna {{was listed as}} one of the video-game [...] "great loves" [...] by GameSpot, which called it [...] "one of the best (and ultimately saddest) examples" [...] of mature romance in games and cited its progression through the story {{as one of the}} game's best elements. GamesRadar found the relationship realistic, noting that they still try to reunite despite their sacrifices. Kotaku's Mike Fahey wrote that the popularity of Tidus and Yuna's relationship and his fading away at the game's end forced Square to make a sequel so they could meet again. Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander, calling Tidus a [...] "forgettable hero", nevertheless praised his and Yuna's relationship. In 2001, Tidus and Yuna won Game Informer Best Couple of the Year award. Their kiss was ranked the second-best in video games by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist. Kotaku called the scene one of gaming's most romantic, and IGN listed Tidus and Luna as one of gaming's greatest couples. Yuna's English voice actress, Hedy Burress, said that Tidus' interaction with Yuna gave her a humanized, [...] "womanly aspect". The 1UP.com staff described Tidus as the [...] "good kind of jock" [...] because of his support for the game's other protagonists, but his anger and growth kept him from being a [...] "stereotypical boy scout". According to Eurogamer's Tom Brawell, Tidus and the other characters [...] "make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other Final Fantasy games". NowGamer and Digital Spy found the remastered game lacking in emotion, but Destructoid said that its models <b>still</b> <b>look</b> good in comparison to newer role-playing games released.|$|E

At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would <b>still</b> <b>look</b> at me as a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes.
