5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E

5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E

The results showed as follows:(1) The contribution and the trend of the grain production increased by science and technology progress was defined by the minus data of the adjacent 10 years moving average yield, of which the main driving force was the scientific and technological progress;(2) As the index of yield of short, medium and long-term stability, the compared relation probability was defined respectively by the annual yield of 5 years moving average yield, 10 years moving average yield and 20 years moving average yield. The stability scale of nation was <b>stabler</b> <b>than</b> the scale of province, and the scale of province was <b>stabler</b> <b>than</b> the scale of district, and the scale of district was <b>stabler</b> <b>than</b> the scale of county.

(3) To China, the more developed area, the earlier to accelerate grain production increased by science and technology progress. The yield of developed areas was also undergoing the stage of increasing-declining-recovering, and the reason of declining was the high yield farmland was occupied in early economic growth period, or large high yield farmland used for the vegetables and fruits.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of fermium {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E
