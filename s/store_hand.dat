40|$|Aircraft {{boarding}} {{is always}} on the critical path of the turnaround. Efficient boarding procedures have to consider both operational constraints and the individual passenger behaviour. In contrast to the handling processes of fuelling, catering and cleaning, the boarding process is mainly driven by the passenger and not by airport or airline employees. Models for evaluating boarding sequences mainly depend more on assumptions concerning the individual passenger processes in the aircraft than on reliable field measurements. This paper provides a set of operational data including classification of boarding times, passenger arrival times, time to <b>store</b> <b>hand</b> luggage, and passenger interactions as a fundamental basis for the calibration of boarding simulation models. In this paper, a microscopic approach is used to model the passenger behaviour, where the passenger movement is defined as a one-dimensional, stochastic, and time/space discrete transition process. This model is used to compare measurements from field trials of boarding procedures with simulation results...|$|E

500|$|During {{its service}} in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos {{was part of the}} border patrol detachment. In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the [...] "Kaštela" [...] {{tactical}} group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small outboard motor boat loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote control plane parts in a hobby <b>store.</b> <b>Handed</b> over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members.
