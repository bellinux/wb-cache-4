The fruit body is up to [...] wide and [...] tall, fan-shaped with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown hyphae (microscopic filaments) that form small, distinct patches towards the margin, but combine to form a continuous felt-like fine-haired area, or tomentum, over the center of the cap. The color of the upper cap surface is orange-brown to violet, but fades to a lighter brown with age. The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged. The lower spore-bearing surface—the hymenium—is wrinkled, often with folds and pits, and violet to brown in color. The <b>solid</b> <b>stem,</b> which is continuous with the cap, is [...] wide, [...] tall, and covered with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base.

50|$|Trap strips are {{crops that}} are grown on fields with the {{intention}} of using them to attract insects and not have insects infest the other crops that are being grown. The insects can then be dealt with much more easily than if they were to have been spread throughout an entire field. Trap strips are very useful for dealing with the wheat stem sawfly. The sawflies will go only as far as they need to in order to plant their eggs.

5000|$|The {{swelling}} of the stems was assumed to {{have been influenced by}} the presence of gall insects, most notably of the genus Odynerus. The female wasp produces a small hole on the inflated portion of the Desert Trumpet, packs the cavity with larvae and lays her eggs upon them, providing a food source, and a protected environment for the offspring. Irritation caused by this process was said to have enlarged the cavity over time. Recently, research performed by a world authority on the genus Eriogonum, Dr. J. L. Reveal of the University of Maryland, College Park, revealed the swollen stem of Eriogonum inflatum is due to high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> and seems to be related to gas regulation.|$|E

50|$|The {{wild carrot}} is a herbaceous, {{somewhat}} variable biennial plant that grows between 30 and 60 cm tall, and is roughly hairy, with a stiff, <b>solid</b> <b>stem.</b> The leaves are tripinnate, finely divided and lacy, and overall triangular in shape. The leaves are bristly and alternate in a pinnate pattern that separates into thin segments. The flowers {{are small and}} dull white, clustered in flat, dense umbels. The umbels are terminal and approximately 3 - 4 in wide. They may be pink in bud and may have a reddish or purple flower in {{the centre of the}} umbel. The lower bracts are three-forked or pinnate, which distinguishes the plant from other white-flowered umbellifers. As the seeds develop, the umbel curls up at the edges, becomes more congested, and develops a concave surface. The fruits are oval and flattened, with short styles and hooked spines. The fruit is small, dry and bumpy with protective hairs surrounding it. The fruit of Daucus carota has 2 mericarp, or bicarpellate. The endosperm of the fruit grows before the embryo. The dried umbels detach from the plant, becoming tumbleweeds. The function of the tiny red flower, coloured by anthocyanin, is to attract insects. Wild carrot blooms in summer and fall. It thrives best in sun to partial shade. Daucus carota is commonly found along roadsides and in unused fields.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnatomical and {{chemical}} characteristics of stems affect lodging in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. Traits associated with lodging resistance, such as plant height, stem strength, culm wall thickness, pith diameter, and stem diameter, were extensively investigated in earlier studies. However, the <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> trait was rarely considered. In this study, we measured {{a range of}} anatomical {{and chemical}} characteristics on solid and hollow stemmed wheat cultivars. Significant correlations were detected between resistance to lodging and several anatomical features, including width of mechanical tissue, weight of low internodes, and width of stem walls. Morphological features that gave the best indication of improved lodging resistance were increased stem width, width of mechanical tissue layer, and stem density. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that 99 % {{of the variation in}} lodging resistance could be explained by the width of the mechanical tissue layer, suggesting that solid stemmed wheat has several anatomical features for increasing resistance to lodging.

40|$|Host plant {{resistance}} {{in the form of}} wheat with the stem lumen filled with pith has been the main strategy to manage the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) - a major pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America. Recently a new source of resistance has been made available combining a single dominant solid pith gene from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) with spring bread wheat cultivars. Our study had two objectives: (i) assess levels of C. cinctus damage and larval C. cinctus mortality in wheat with the novel solid germplasm, conventional solid-stems and susceptible cultivars; and (ii) determine plant genotype effects on populations of C. cinctus parasitoid Bracon cephi (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The study was conducted in plots near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada from 2003 – 2005. The novel solid-stemmed hexaploid G 9608 B 1 -L 12 J 11 BF 02, solid-stemmed AC Eatonia and hollow-stemmed durum AC Navigator reduced the infestation level and girdling damage by C. cinctus. Another synthetic hexaploid B 9973 B 03 &AC 4 AW, hollow-stemmed AC Cadillac, McKenzie and AC Barrie were more susceptible to C. cinctus damage. Larval parasitism by B. cephi increased along with C. cinctus infestation levels. Stem solidness itself, regardless of source, had no direct negative effect on B. cephi but due to lower infestation and survival of C. cinctus in <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> genotypes, the overall population of parasitoids was reduced. When planting monocultures of effective <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> wheat, strategies to conserve populations of parasitoids should be considered for long term sustainable management of C. cinctus...|$|E

40|$|Numerous assays {{exist that}} measure the {{function}} of stem cells. In this article, we review in detail the history and future of existing stem cell assays. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are historically the most well studied, but new developments in stem cell research, including the claim of stem cell plasticity, have caused controversies related to technical issues, {{as well as to}} semantics. Stem cell research requires proper definitions, and utilization of stem cell assays, especially since research on non-HSCs that lack <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> cell assays, is rapidly evolving. These emerging fields may benefit from what has been learned from HSC assays: most important, that the true potential of stem cells can only be assessed retrospectively. This also relates to new developments in HSC research, when limiting numbers of in vitro–manipulated stem cells are transplanted. The most conflicting results arise when cells express stem cell characteristics in one assay but not in another. Should we adjust our definition of a stem cell? If so, when do we decide a claim of stem cell activity to be justified? We therefore recommend using multiple stem cell assays, preferably at least one in vivo assay. These assays should measure functionality of the putative stem cell population...|$|E

40|$|The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is {{a serious}} insect pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in the {{northern}} central Great Plains. The sawfly has been a pest of wheat in Montana, North Dakota, and Canada since the early 20 th century. It was first detected in Nebraska winter wheat in the early 1990 s, in Scotts Bluff County. The sawfly has since spread throughout the Nebraska Panhandle region and become a pest of serious concern. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the sawfly in Nebraska, investigations on the emergence, dispersal, and sampling of the sawfly were conducted. Observations on the emergence and dispersal of the adult sawfly were made in 2014 and 2015 in three winter wheat fields in the Nebraska Panhandle by using emergence cages, sticky traps, and sweep net sampling. Adult sawflies begin emerging in mid-May and are no longer found by the end of June. Adult sawfly densities decreased the farther into the wheat that was sampled. This edge effect was observed for both sexes of the sawfly, but it is more apparent with male sawflies. The adult sawfly has an aggregated distribution when described by Taylor’s Power Law. By using Taylor’s Power Law, the number of sweep net samples required to maintain a desired precision level was determined. When sampling at early wheat heading, five, 20 -sweep sweep net samples are needed to maintain a 20 % precision level. These sampling data were correlated to larval infestation rates and used to develop a sampling plan that predicts larval infestation rates based upon stem density and the number of adults sampled. Sampling adults gives wheat growers ample time to take management action, such as swathing, during the current growing season. It also allows time for growers to change their wheat variety to a more resistant, <b>solid</b> <b>stem</b> wheat variety, for the next growing season. Advisors: Jeffery D. Bradshaw and Gary L.
