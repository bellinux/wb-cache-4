The TRTT will enroll 228 individuals at an allocation ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 to: (1) directive counseling and sound therapy using conventional sound generators; (2) directive counseling and placebo sound generators; or (3) standard of care as administered in the military. Study centers include a Study Chair′s Office, a Data Coordinating Center, and six Military Clinical Centers with treatment and data collection standardized across all clinics. The primary outcome is change in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score assessed longitudinally at 3, 6, 12, and 18 -month follow-up visits. Secondary outcomes include: Change in TQ sub-scales, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Functional Index, and TRT interview visual analog scale; audiometric and psychoacoustic measures; and change in quality of life. The TRTT will evaluate TRT efficacy by comparing TRT (directive counseling and conventional <b>sound</b> <b>generators)</b> with standard of care; directive counseling by comparing directive counseling plus placebo <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> versus standard of care; and sound therapy by comparing conventional versus placebo <b>sound</b> <b>generators.</b> We hypothesize that full TRT will be more efficacious than standard of care, directive counseling and placebo <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> more efficacious than standard of care, and conventional more efficacious than placebo <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> in habituating the tinnitus awareness, annoyance, and impact on the study participant′s life...|$|R
25|$|Polyphony: In {{digital music}} terminology, {{polyphony}} {{refers to the}} maximum number of notes that can be produced by the <b>sound</b> <b>generator</b> at once. Polyphony allows significantly smoother and more natural transitions between notes. Inexpensive toy electronic keyboards designed for children can usually only has five to ten notes at a time. Many low priced keyboards can perform 24 or 32 notes at a time. More advanced keyboards can perform over 48 notes at a time with 64 or 128 notes being common. Digital pianos, has more complex polyphonic system and could perform by up to 256 notes.|$|E

2500|$|Velocity {{sensitivity}} (also {{found under}} the keyword touch sensitivity in some manuals): While {{the least expensive}} keyboards are simply [...] "on-off" [...] switches, mid-range and higher-range instruments simulate the process of sound generation in chordophones (string instruments) which {{are sensitive to the}} speed (or [...] "hardness") of a key press. Mid-range instruments may only have two or three levels of sensitivity (e.g., soft-medium-loud). More expensive models may have a broader range of sensitivity. For implementation, two sensors are installed for each key: the first sensor detects when a key is beginning to be pressed and the other triggers when the key is pressed completely. On some higher-end electronic keyboards or digital pianos, a third sensor is installed. This third sensor allows the player to strike a key and still sound a note even when the key has not yet come to its full resting position, allowing for faster (and more accurate) playing of repeated notes. The time between the two (or three) signals allows a keyboard to determine the velocity with which the key was struck. As the key weight is constant this velocity can be considered as the strength of the press. Based on this value the <b>sound</b> <b>generator</b> produces a correspondingly loud or soft sound. The least sophisticated types of touch sensitivity cause the keyboard to change the volume of the instrument voice. The most sophisticated, expensive types will trigger both a change in volume and a change in timbre, which simulates the way that very hard strikes of a piano or electric piano cause a difference in tone—as well as an increase in volume. Some sophisticated touch-sensitivity systems accomplish this by having several samples of an acoustic instrument note per key (e.g., a soft strike, a mid-level strike, and a hard strike). Alternatively, a similar effect can be accomplished using synthesis-modelling of the ADSR envelope or digital modelling (e.g., for the hard strike, the keyboard would add the timbres associated with a hard strike—in the case of a Fender Rhodes voice, this would be a biting, [...] "bark" [...] sound).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{difficulty}} {{in choosing the}} appropriate therapy for chronic tinnitus relates to the variable impact {{on the quality of}} life of affected patients and, thus, requires individualization of treatment. ObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of using <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> with individual adjustments to relieve tinnitus in patients unresponsive to previous treatments. MethodsA prospective study of 10 patients with chronic tinnitus who were unresponsive to previous drug treatments, five males and five females, with ages ranging from 41 to 78 years. Bilateral <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> (Reach 62 or Mind 9 models) were used daily for at least 6 h during 18 months. The patients were evaluated at the beginning, after 1 month and at each 3 months until 18 months through acuphenometry, minimum masking level, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, visual analog scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> were adjusted at each visit. ResultsThere was a reduction of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory in nine patients using a protocol with a customized approach, independent of psychoacoustic characteristics of tinnitus. The best response to treatment occurred in those with whistle-type tinnitus. A correlation among the adjustments and tinnitus loudness and minimum masking level was found. Only one patient, who had indication of depression by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, did not respond to sound therapy. ConclusionThere was improvement in quality of life (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory), with good response to sound therapy using customized settings in patients who did not respond to previous treatments for tinnitus...|$|R
40|$|The {{songbird}} vocal organ, the syrinx, {{is composed}} of two <b>sound</b> <b>generators,</b> which are independently controlled by sets of two extrinsic and four intrinsic muscles. These muscles rank among the fastest vertebrate muscles, but the molecular and morphological foundations of this rapid physiological performance are unknown. Here we show that the four intrinsic muscles in the syrinx of male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are composed of fast oxidative and superfast fibres. Dorsal and ventral tracheobronchialis muscles contain slightly more superfast fibres relative {{to the number of}} fast oxidative fibres than dorsal and ventral syringealis muscles. This morphological difference is not reflected in the highest, burst-like activation rate of the two muscle groups during song as assessed with electromyographic recordings. No difference in fibre type ratio was found between the corresponding muscles of the left and right <b>sound</b> <b>generators.</b> Airflow and electromyographic measurements during song indicate that maximal activation rate and speed of airflow regulation do not differ between the two sound sources. Whereas the potential for high-speed muscular control exists on both sides, the two <b>sound</b> <b>generators</b> are used differentially for modulation of acoustic parameters. These results show that large numbers of superfast fibre types are present in intrinsic syringeal muscles of a songbird, providing further confirmation of rapid contraction kinetics. However, syringeal muscles are composed of two fibre types which raises questions about the neuromuscular control of this heterogeneous muscle architecture...|$|R
