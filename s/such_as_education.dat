The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>education.</b> This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>education</b> and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>education</b> and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Grand Forks is not {{dominated}} by any one industry or sector.

The state and federal governments are two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its military personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>education</b> not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
