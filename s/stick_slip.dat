40|$|AbstractThis work {{investigates the}} {{entrainment}} and synchronisation in <b>stick</b> – <b>slip</b> oscillators. A spring – mass {{placed on a}} uniformly moving belt {{in the presence of}} friction is taken as the model and a cubic Stirbeck friction curve is considered. The entrainment of the oscillator is studied both in its <b>stick</b> – <b>slip</b> phase and pure slip phase. It is seen that entrainment in <b>stick</b> – <b>slip</b> phase is realized by gradually eliminating the stick phase; the entrained oscillator undergoes pure slip oscillations. But in pure slip phase, external force introduces a stick phase which gradually disappears on total entrainment. It is also shown that entrainment in both phases is accompanied by a decrease in oscillator amplitude. It is further shown that the critical force needed for entrainment is higher in the <b>stick</b> – <b>slip</b> phase than in the pure slip one. In coupled <b>stick</b> – <b>slip</b> oscillators, detuning is considered in belt velocities and here too mutual synchronisation is accompanied by decrease in amplitude...|$|R

50|$|There is {{controversy}} {{over how the}} overthrust movement occurred and the affect this movement had on the surrounding geology. More specifically, attempting {{to determine if the}} thrust movement was continuous or if movement was subject to a more stick-slip style of movement remains inconclusive. However, the anomalously high vitrinite reflectance values obtained from the Lewis thrust at Marias Pass, the McConnell thrust at Mt. Yamnuska, the Coleman fault at Wintering Creek and several others indicate temperatures of 350-650 °C were generated during thrusting. Furthermore, these high vitrinite reflectance values were restricted to extremely narrow sections adjacent to and within the fault zones. This is indicative that the high temperatures were fairly short lived. Thus, the high temperatures are interpreted {{to be the result of}} frictional heating during <b>stick</b> <b>slip</b> faulting. Evidence for the local high temperatures within the fault zone indicate that local areas of frictional stress must have existed, with the possibility of this occurring due to ramps in the fault plane where drainage of high pore pressures may have occurred. Moreover, samples from the hanging wall collected in close proximity to the fault plane show no evidence for heating during progressive burial of sediments. This absence of evidence for heating during faulting is indicative of low frictional stress and therefore, low rates of slip. This shows solid agreement with the evolution of the Canadian Rocky mountain foreland thrust and fold belt, including the Lewis thrust sheet which has been interpreted to have developed and commenced movement in pulses.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing a {{high speed}} camera, we study the peeling {{dynamics}} of an adhesive tape under a constant load {{with a special}} focus on the so-called stick-slip regime of the peeling. It {{is the first time}} that the very fast motion of the peeling point is imaged. The speed of the camera, up to $ 16000 $ fps, allows us to observe and quantify the details of the peeling point motion during the <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> phases: <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> velocities, durations and amplitudes. First, in contrast with previous observations, the stick-slip regime appears to be only transient in the force controlled peeling. Additionally, we discover that the <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> phases have similar durations and that at high mean peeling velocity, the slip phase actually lasts longer than the stick phase. Depending on the mean peeling velocity, we also observe that the velocity change between <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> phase ranges from a rather sudden to a smooth transition. These new observations can help to discriminate between the various assumptions used in theoretical models for describing the complex peeling of an adhesive tape. The present imaging technique opens the door for an extensive study of the velocity controlled stick-slip peeling of an adhesive tape that will allow to understand the statistical complexity of the stick-slip in a stationary case...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the development of simple micromanipulators, having high resolution and several degrees-of-freedom, dedicated to the manipulation of miniature objects, the manipulation of biological specimens or to the assembly of microsystems. The actuators for these micromanipulators must have a submicronic resolution over displacements of a few centimeters at a speed of several millimeters per second. They must also be compact and rigid in order ease their integration and to have a high rejection of the external perturbations (vibrations, temperature changes, etc.). <b>Stick</b> and <b>slip</b> actuators studied in this work fulfil very well these requirements. Their main features are: a resolution better than 5 nm over strokes of a few centimeters at a speed of several millimeters per second (2 - 5 mm/s); a high rigidity (6. 5 N/μm) giving an excellent rejection of external perturbations; an extreme simplicity obtained by the combination of the guiding and actuating functions and by using an innovative concept of monolithic flexible structures. This report presents all the stages of our research work: the state of the art: originally, <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> actuators have been developed for the scanning probe microscopy (STM or AFM). We have adapted this concept to our purposes. Several innovative solutions allow us to simplify and improve significantly these actuators; the modeling: it allows us to understand in details the behavior of <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> actuators and to optimize them; the study of scaling down: it demonstrates that <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> actuators can be miniaturized. New applications in the field of microsystems are therefore promising; the experiment: the characterization of a one-degree-of-freedom actuator demonstrates its performances and validates our modeling; the-implementation-and-tests-of-severa 1 micro-mani. pulators-actuated-by-stick and slip confirm the pertinence of our approach; The results of this thesis will help engineers to design and implement efficient micromanipulators using <b>stick</b> and <b>slip</b> actuators...|$|R

30|$|Here, we {{point out}} that the {{previous}} studies assumed the “aging” type of state evolution law only. Since the aging law well represents time-dependent frictional healing (Dieterich and Kilgore 1994), recent studies revealed that another “slip” type of state evolution law better fit both velocity-step experiments and slide-hold-slide experiments (Bhattacharya et al. 2017). Thus, we should also investigate cases of the slip law. Nucleation processes of <b>stick</b> <b>slips</b> on the “aging law” fault and “slip law” faults are quantitatively different even without fault interaction (e.g., Ampuero and Rubin 2008; Rubin 2008; Mitsui and Hirahara 2011).

By applying heterogeneous normal stress using three actuators of which forces could be independently controlled, two asperiti-es with different strengths were formed on a fault plane. Under a certain normal stress distribution, single asperity failure and double asperity failure occurred alternately. The single asperity failure refers to a <b>stick</b> <b>slip</b> event in which a weaker asperity ruptures alone, without triggering the rupture of a stronger as-perity. The double asperity failure is an event in which a rupture of a weak as-perity triggers the rupture of a strong asperity, resulting in {{a failure of the}} whole fault.
