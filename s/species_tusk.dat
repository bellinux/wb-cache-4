50|$|The Mercury Islands tusked wētā, Motuweta isolata, {{also known}} as the Middle Island tusked wētā, is a large flightless insect in the family Anostostomatidae, {{discovered}} in 1970 living on a single small island in New Zealand. Distinguished by the enormous tusks with which males fight, it was saved from extinction by a captive breeding programme and translocation.

40|$|International audienceStable {{isotopes}} (δC and δN) {{were used}} to examine the origin of organic matter for the most representative demersal species of the SW Icelandic fishery, accounting for over 70 % of landings of those species in the North Atlantic. Samples were collected during a 2 -week period in early September 2004 from landings and directly during fishing cruises. Stable isotopes showed that particulate organic matter and sedimentary organic matter were {{at the base of the}} food web and appeared to fill two different compartments: the pelagic and the benthic. The pelagic realm was composed of only capelin and sandeel; krill and redfish occupied an intermediate position between pelagic and benthic realms; while anglerfish, haddock, cod and ling resulted as the true demersal <b>species</b> while <b>tusk,</b> rays and plaice were strongly linked to the benthic habitat...|$|R
5000|$|Ivory is by {{no means}} just {{obtained}} from elephants; any animal tooth or tusk used as a material for carving may be termed [...] "ivory", though the species is usually added, and a great number of different <b>species</b> with <b>tusks</b> or large teeth have been used.Teeth have three elements: the outer dental enamel, then the main body of dentine, and the inner root of osteo-dentine. For the purposes of carving the last two are in most animals both usable, but the harder enamel may be too hard to carve, and require removal by grinding first. This is the case with hippopotamus for example, whose tooth enamel (on the largest teeth) is about as hard as jade. Elephant ivory, as well as coming in the largest pieces, is relatively soft and even, and an ideal material for carving. The species of animal from which ivory comes can usually be determined by examination under ultra-violet light, where different types show different colours.|$|R
50|$|Tusks are elongated, {{continuously}} growing front teeth, usually but {{not always}} in pairs, that protrude well beyond the mouth of certain mammal species. They are most commonly canines, as with warthogs, pig, and walruses, or, {{in the case of}} elephants, elongated incisors. In most <b>tusked</b> <b>species</b> both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger. Tusks are generally curved, though the narwhal's sole tusk is straight and has a helical structure. In the elephant, the tusks were originally second incisors. Continuous growth is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth. In earlier times elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90 kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45 kg).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. — With 14 species {{currently}} recognized, the {{beaked whale}} genus Mesoplodon (family Ziphiidae) {{is the most}} speciose in the order Cetacea. Beaked whales are widely distributed but are rarely seen at sea due to their oceanic distribution, deep-diving capacity, and apparent low abundance. Morphological differentiation among Mesoplodon species is relatively limited, {{with the exception of}} tooth form in adult males. Based on scarring patterns, males appear to use their tusk-like teeth as weapons in aggressive encounters with other males. Females are effectively toothless. We used sequences from seven nuclear introns (3348 base pairs) to construct a robust and highly resolved phylogeny, which was then used as a framework to test predictions from four hypotheses seeking to explain patterns of Mesoplodon tusk morphology and/or the processes that have driven the diversification of this genus: (1) linear progression of tusk form; (2) allopatric specia-tion through isolation in adjacent deep-sea canyons; (3) sympatric speciation through sexual selection on tusks; and (4) selection for species-recognition cues. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian reconstructions confirmed the monophyly of the genus and revealed that what were considered ancestral and derived tusk forms have in fact arisen independently on sev-eral occasions, contrary to predictions from the linear-progression hypothesis. Further, none of the three well-supported species clades was confined to a single ocean basin, as might have been expected from the deep-sea canyon-isolation or sexual-selection hypotheses, and some <b>species</b> with similar <b>tusks</b> have overlapping distributions, contrary to prediction...|$|R
40|$|Permian {{tetrapod}} fossils {{were discovered}} in the Tanzanian Ruhuhu Formation in 1963, but they have received far less attention than the tetrapods of the overlying Usili (formerly Kawinga) Formation. Here, we describe two dicynodonts collected in the Ruhuhu Formation in 2008. Abajudon kaayai, gen. et sp. nov., is represented by a partial skull and mandible and is characterized by autapomorphic upper teeth that are triangular in cross-section, have procurved tips, and bear a deep groove on the mesial surface. Although it shows similarities to taxa such as Endothiodon and Chelydontops, the exact relationships between A. kaayai and other dicynodonts are uncertain. The second specimen also consists of a partial skull and mandible. We refer it to cf. Endothiodontia based on the medial placement of the long maxillary tooth rows, the presence of depressions on the palatine pad, a long posterior dentary sulcus, and similarities of the mandibular dentition. Tetrapods occur in three fossiliferous horizons in the Ruhuhu Formation. The likely Middle Permian lower horizon includes dinocephalians, temnospondyls, and the dicynodonts described here. The middle horizon includes a new, <b>tusked</b> <b>species</b> of Endothiodon {{and at least one}} other dicynodont. The upper horizon appears to sample an assemblage {{similar to that of the}} Usili Formation and therefore may be of Late Permian age. The discovery of Middle Permian fossils in Tanzania and Zambia provides the opportunity to test whether southern Gondwana was characterized by a cosmopolitan tetrapod fauna for an extended period of time before the biogeographic restructuring caused by the end-Permian mass extinction...|$|R
40|$|The {{stocks of}} ling Molva molva L., blue ling Molva dipterygia (Pennant, 1784) and tusk Brosme brosme L. {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic support {{significant}} coastal and offshore bank and slope fisheries in several countries. In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the <b>species,</b> ling and <b>tusk,</b> in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of ling and tusk otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only. In order to achieve precise and stable age determination, {{there is a need for}} inter-calibrations of readings by different readers, and repeated reading by the same reader...|$|R
