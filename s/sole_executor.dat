25|$|Cecily's {{life after}} the death of her first husband in 1501, was marked by an acrimonious dispute with her son and heir, Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. This was over Cecily's right to remain <b>sole</b> <b>executor</b> of her late husband's estate and to control her own inheritance, both of which Thomas {{challenged}} following her second marriage to Henry Stafford; a man many years her junior. Their quarrel required the intervention of King Henry VII and the royal council.|$|E

The will mentions his namesake nephew William Levett, second son of his brother Sir Richard Levett. The <b>sole</b> <b>executor</b> of Levett's estate was Dr. Henry Levett of the London Charterhouse, fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and son of Dean Levett's uncle, courtier William Levett Esq. of Swindon and Savernake, Wiltshire.

50|$|In 1660 a {{peace treaty}} between France and Spain was consummated by the {{marriage}} of Maria Theresa with Louis XIV, and the ceremony {{took place on the}} Island of Pheasants, a small swampy island in the Bidassoa. Velázquez was charged with the decoration of the Spanish pavilion and with the entire scenic display. He attracted much attention from the nobility of his bearing and the splendor of his costume. On June 26 he returned to Madrid, and on July 31 he was stricken with fever. Feeling his end approaching, he signed his will, appointing as his <b>sole</b> <b>executors</b> his wife and his firm friend named Fuensalida, keeper of the royal records. He died on August 6, 1660. He was buried in the Fuensalida vault of the church of San Juan Bautista, and within eight days his wife Juana was buried beside him. Unfortunately, this church was destroyed by the French in 1811, so his place of interment is now unknown. There was much difficulty in adjusting the tangled accounts outstanding between Velázquez and the treasury, and it was not until 1666, after the death of King Philip, that they were finally settled.|$|R

He was the <b>sole</b> <b>executor.</b> Her funeral was {{arranged}} by Adams and only he and Annie Sharpe, the guest house owner, were present. She received £200 in Clara's will. Adams tipped the vicar a guinea after the ceremony. Clara {{was one of}} the two bodies exhumed during the police investigation on 21 December 1956. Francis Camps concluded that she had had bronchopneumonia possibly brought about by high drug doses – not a heart problem as Adams had said on the death certificate. According to prescription records, Adams had not prescribed anything to treat the bronchopneumonia.|$|E
500|$|As <b>sole</b> <b>executor</b> of Fanny's will, Kent {{ordered a}} coffin, but fearful of being prosecuted should {{the nature of}} their {{relationship}} become known, asked that it remain nameless. [...] On registering the burial he was, however, forced to give a name, and he gave her his own. [...] Fanny's family was notified and her sister Ann Lynes, who lived nearby at Pall Mall, attended the funeral at St John's. [...] When Ann learned of the terms of Fanny's will, which left her brothers and sisters half a crown each and Kent the rest, she tried but failed to block it in Doctors' Commons. [...] The bulk of Kent's inheritance was Fanny's £150 share of her dead brother Thomas's estate. [...] This also included some land owned by Thomas, sold by the executor of his estate, John Lynes, and Kent received Fanny's share of that too (almost £95). [...] Her family resented this. [...] Legal problems with Lynes's sale meant that each of Thomas's beneficiaries had to pay £45 in compensation to the purchaser, but Kent refused, claiming that he had already spent the money in settling Fanny's debts. [...] In response to this, in October 1761 John Lynes began proceedings against Kent in the Court of Chancery. [...] Meanwhile, Kent became a stockbroker and remarried in 1761.|$|E

2500|$|The esteem of {{his contemporaries}} for Hilliard is testified to by John Donne, who in a poem called The Storm (1597) praises the work of this artist. [...] He died on about 3 January 1619 and was buried on 7 January 1619 in the church of St Martins-in-the-Fields, Westminster, leaving in his will twenty shillings to the poor of the parish, thirty between his two sisters, some goods to his maidservant, {{and all the rest}} of his effects to his son, Lawrence Hilliard, his <b>sole</b> <b>executor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|James Burbage's {{wife and}} her son Richard Burbage, then only about nineteen, came into the yard and beat Robert Miles with a broomstaff. Richard Burbage, after [...] "scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose", {{threatened}} to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with [...] "great and horrible oaths". They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, {{and for the next}} two or three years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died of plague in late April 1593. In her will dated 8 April she made Robert Miles her <b>sole</b> <b>executor</b> and left him the care of her daughter Katherine (insisting, however, that Katherine was John Brayne's daughter), and all her property, including her half interest in the Theatre, and Miles thereby inherited the litigation in which he had already been active as her financial backer. Miles filed a bill of reviver near the end of the year and continued the suit in Chancery until 28 May 1595, when the court finally adjudged that he should attempt to collect on the bonds in the common law courts, which he appears not to have attempted.|$|E
2500|$|She {{married a}} second time in 1503 on her Feast Day of 22 November, Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire; however, this {{marriage}} did not produce any children. As the marriage had required a papal dispensation and the King's licence, Stafford paid Henry VII the sum of £2,000 for the necessary permission to marry Cecily, who at 43 years old was 19 years older than her spouse. Her son Thomas, the 2nd Marquess of Dorset vehemently disapproved of the match, as it is alleged he feared she would use her inheritance to [...] "endow her new husband at his own expense". His fears did have some foundation as Cecily gave Stafford a life estate in holdings valued at [...] £1,000 per year and even vowed to leave him the remainder of her capital should Thomas happen to predecease her. This provoked Thomas to challenge Cecily's right to continue as his father's <b>sole</b> <b>executor,</b> [...] resulting in an acrimonious dispute that necessitated the intervention of King Henry VII and his council to stop it from escalating even further. The settlement the King decreed allowed Cecily to manage her late husband's estate until she had paid off his debts, but prevented her from claiming her dowry until she had transferred the remainder of her son's inheritance to him. King Henry's arbitrary decision also severely limited her control over her own inheritance: she was required to bequeath all of it to Thomas upon her death; until then, Cecily was permitted to grant lands worth up to 1,000 marks per annum for {{a certain number of}} years. Historian Barbara Jean Harris stated that the Crown's oppressive decree greatly restricted Cecily's personal rights as an heiress in favour of those of her eldest son and the tradition of primogeniture. Nearly two decades later, she and her son quarrelled again; on this occasion it was about their mutual duties towards Thomas's seven surviving siblings. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey arbitrated on behalf of King Henry VIII and ordered both Cecily and Thomas to contribute to the dowries of her four living daughters: the ladies Dorothy, Mary, Elizabeth, and Cecily. She was also forced to create individual annuities drawn from her own funds for her three younger sons. In 1527 she gave her daughter Elizabeth an additional dowry of £1000 although her marriage to the Earl of Kildare had gone against the wishes of both Cecily and her first husband. She added the following explanation for the gift of money despite having had earlier misgivings: [...] "Forasmuch as the said marriage is honourable and I and all her friends have cause to be content with the same".|$|E

25|$|The judge {{agreed with}} DC's {{argument}} that the 1992 agreement with Jean Peavy, the <b>sole</b> heir and <b>executor</b> to Shuster's estate, barred her and all other heirs from pursuing termination. The judge also ruled that the 1992 agreement superseded all prior agreements between Shuster and DC Comics, and as a post-1978 grant it {{is not subject to}} termination under § 304(d) of US copyright law. The judge also ruled that the transfer of rights to Pacific Pictures was illegal because it had been made before the effective date of termination of October 26, 2013.|$|R

Dmitri noted that Vera Nabokov [...] "failed {{to carry out this}} task, her procrastination due, 'to age, weakness and immeasurable love.'" [...] They placed it in a Swiss bank vault, where it remained until its eventual publication. In 1991 Vera died, leaving Dmitri Nabokov as the <b>sole</b> literary <b>executor.</b> Dmitri wavered on whether to destroy the manuscript.

5000|$|In 1539 Dormer married Katherine (née Dallam), {{and he and}} {{his wife}} resided for a time at The Key, a {{property}} which her former husband, Richard Collier (d.1533), had purchased in 1520. It was said to have been [...] "an extensive holding {{on the south side of}} Cheapside, almost opposite Mercers' Hall, in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane". Collier had directed in his will that if his two children died without issue, his property called The Sun was to be sold to establish a free school in Horsham, Sussex, where he had been born, and The Key was to be granted to the Mercers' Company to enable them to pay a schoolmaster and maintain the school. Collier's children had both died by 1540, and the Mercers [...] "had to persuade the widow and <b>sole</b> surviving <b>executor,</b> Katherine, now married to Sir Michael Dormer, to establish the school". In August 1540 Dormer paid £8 6s 8d for [...] "a house and garden near Horsham church", which remained the home of The College of Richard Collyer until 1893. Almost 300 years after Dormer's purchase, as a result of a lawsuit in 1810, it was found that, as the school property had been conveyed to Dormer by a deed dated 10 August 1540, the school was therefore now the property of Dormer's heir at law, but that [...] "it was impracticable at such a distance of time to ascertain who was such heir at law".|$|R
