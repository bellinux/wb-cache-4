50|$|One King Down was an Albany, NY, based {{metallic}} hardcore {{band that}} played crunchy, danceable metalcore {{heavily influenced by}} such scene contemporaries as Snapcase and Earth Crisis. The group formed in the mid-'90s, centered on the brotherly team of bassist Bill Scoville and guitarist Mike Scoville, along with guitarist Matt Wood and drummer Derrick Van Wie. With their original singer, they crafted a CD EP for Trainwreck Records, but it was with energetic frontman Rob Fusco, and Equal Vision Records (for whom Bill worked {{for a number of}} years), that One King Down really made their mark on the international hardcore punk scene. The diminutive Fusco's growl and lyrical espousing of the vegan straight-edge lifestyle (not all of the band's members were vegans, or even vegetarians, but they were all drug-free) garnered them attention from all over the U.S. and Europe. Coupled with the band's stop-and-go rhythms and dancefloor-moving heavy groove, Fusco's vocals were put to tape for the Bloodlust Revenge EP, released by Equal Vision in 1997 and still regarded by most fans as the band's finest recorded hour. The group toured with Erie, PA's Brothers Keeper and other bands, selling several thousand copies of the record at shows and through major independent distribution channels. They also released a split EP with Spirit of Youth through Europe's Good Life Recordings. Internal friction caused the ousting of Fusco shortly before the band was to embark on a national tour <b>supporting</b> <b>Earth</b> Crisis and Madball, to be followed by another trek with Hatebreed. One King Down scrambled to find a replacement, inviting then Burn It Down vocalist Ryan Downey to fill in for them. This union only lasted for two shows before the singer-less One King Down returned home to regroup. Eventually, they teamed up with Syracuse native Jon Peters, who lent his vocals to the band's debut full-length album, 1998's God Loves, Man Kills. After subsequent touring, Peters left the band and they split up for a short time. Mike Scoville auditioned for the Foo Fighters, but the job ultimately went to someone else. One King Down re-formed and Fusco was eventually invited to rejoin. They played a few shows before Van Wie left the group, with Wood switching to drum duties as the Albany band pared down to a four-piece. One King Down released the Gravity Wins Again EP in 2000, a collection of newly penned songs together with older, previously recorded tracks. In 2001, after skipping an appearance at Syracuse, NY's Hellfest, it appeared that the band was done once and for all.|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} in the front region of a hypersonic vehicle nose can be extremely high, for example, reaching approximately 11 000 K at a Mach number of 36 (Apollo reentry) due to the bow shock wave. In this case, accurate prediction of temperature behind the shock wave is {{necessary in order to}} precisely estimate the wall heat flux. A better prediction of wall heat flux leads to smaller safety coefficient for thermal shield of space reentry vehicle; therefore, the size of thermal shield decreases and the payload could increase. However, the accurate prediction of temperature behind the bow shock wave implies the use of a precise chemical model whose partial differential equations are added to Navier-Stokes equations. This second order partial differential system is very difficult to be numerically integrated.

40|$|Low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf- (COTS-) based science {{cameras are}} {{intended}} for lab use only and are not suitable for flight deployment as they are difficult to ruggedize and repackage into instruments. Also, COTS implementation may not be suitable since mission science objectives are tied to specific measurement requirements, and often require performance beyond that required by the commercial market. Custom camera development for each application is cost prohibitive for the International Space Station (ISS) or midrange science payloads due to nonrecurring expenses (~$ 2, 000 K) for ground-up camera electronics design. While each new science mission has a different suite of requirements for camera performance (detector noise, speed of image acquisition, charge-coupled device (CCD) size, operation temperature, packaging, etc.), the analog-to-digital conversion, power supply, and communications can be standardized to accommodate many different applications.

40|$|In 1996, Matra Marconi Space (now Astrium) {{has started}} {{the design of}} Leostar, a family of small {{platforms}} capable of <b>supporting</b> <b>Earth</b> observation, science and communication missions for a large range of Low Earth Orbits. This internal initiative has been triggered by the Faster/Better/Cheaper (FBC) tendency appearing among institutional customers and obvious on the export market. Hence, Astrium strategy was to provide standard qualified platforms relying upon a generic core avionics, as well as customized elements {{to be used for}} specific applications. To achieve these FBC goals, Astrium implemented innovative design and validation incremental methods, coupled with the maximum use of off-the-shelf equipment. The validation of the Leostar generic core avionics is now terminated and turned out successful w. r. t the FBC approach. Indeed, significant cost and time reduction could be observed not to the detriment of performance since the family now includes the Leostar 500 -XO bus dedicated to very demanding high resolution observation missions. For a recent export program awarded end 99, Astrium is relying upon the Leostar concept to answer the needs of an Earth observation mission while coping with the challenging schedule requirement of delivery of satellite to final Customer in 30 months. Moreover, thanks to this Leostar heritage, Astrium has started to study for the French Space Agency (CNES) the new generation of agile bus which will support PLEIADES, the Spot follow-on program. This paper gives a brief overview of the Leostar family and its current and planned applications, describes the lessons learnt throughout the validation phase, and discusses how adequate aspects of the Leostar development approach have been applied to an interplanetary mission such as Mars Express...|$|E
40|$|Related to the raise of the {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} the Earth heritage, geomorphosites receive increasing attention from the scientific community. Assessment methods, classification and conservation strategies have been developed to safeguard the geomorphological heritage for present and future generations. On the other hand, Earth heritage offers opportunities to develop educational and recreational programs as well as tourism projects. Various interpretive supports and local development projects have been engendered in the past few years to promote geoheritage. ¦Be it for the assessment, conservation or promotion of geomorphosites, maps are valuable from many standpoints. They can provide fundamental data for detailed geomorphosite description, serve as visual communication tools helping to guide the selection process in defining protection priority or <b>supporting</b> <b>Earth</b> heritage promotion and interpretàtion. ¦This study reviews the main achievements and the objectives yet to be accomplished in the field of geomorphosite mapping and proposes a general framework for the mapping of geomorphosites that takes into account the different aims and publics. The main focus is on mapping geomorphosites for non-specialists in the field of Earth heritage promotion (Geotourism). In this context, maps are often employed to show itineraries or points of interest. Like a scheme or a diagram, a map can also be used as a method for visualising geoscientific information. This function is particularly important since some processes, which contributed to the formation of a geomorphosite or a geomorphological landscape are no longer or not always clearly visible in the landscape. In this case, maps become interpretive media that serve popularisation purposes. ¦Mapping for non-specialists holds the challenging task to ensure the information transfer between the cartographer and the user. We therefore focus on both the implementation of the map by the cartographer (which information? which visualisation?) and the interpretation of the map by the user (effectiveness of the knowledge transfer). The research is based on empirical studies carried out in the Maderan valley (Canton of Uri) and in classes of the Cantons of Uri and Tessin that aim to gain knowledge about the familiarity and interests of non- specialists for geoheritage as well as about their map reading skills. The final objective is to formulate methodological proposals for geomorphosite mapping for interpretive purpose...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{are widely}} seen as {{substitutes}} for fossil fuels to offset the imminent decline of oil production and to mitigate the emergent increase in GHG emissions. This view is, however, based on too simple an analysis, focusing on only one piece in the whole mosaic of the complex biofuel techno-system, and such partial approaches may easily lead to ideological bias based on political preference. This study defines the whole biofuel techno-system at three scales, i. e., the foreground production (A), the background industrial network (B, including A), and the <b>supporting</b> <b>Earth</b> biosphere (C, including B). The thermodynamic concepts of energy, exergy and emergy measure various flows at these three scales, viz. primary resources, energy and materials products, and labor and services. Our approach resolves the confusion about scale and metric: direct energy demand and direct exergy demand apply at scale A; cumulative energy demand and cumulative exergy demand apply at scale B; and energy is applied at scale C, where it is named emergy, while exergy also can be applied at scale C. This last option was not examined in the present study. The environmental performance of the system was assessed using a number of sustainability indicators, including resource consumption, input renewability, physical benefit, and system efficiency, using ethanol from corn stover in the US as a technology case. Results were compared with available literature values for typical biofuel alternatives. We also investigated the influence of methodological choices on the outcomes, based on contribution analysis, {{as well as the}} sensitivity of the outcomes to emergy intensity. The results indicate that the techno-system is not only supported by commercial energy and materials products, but also substantially by solar radiation and the labor and services invested. The bioethanol techno-system contributes to the overall supply of energy/exergy resources, although in a less efficient way than the process by which the Earth system produces fossil fuels. Our results show that bioethanol cannot be simply regarded as a renewable energy resource. Furthermore, the method chosen for the thermodynamic analysis results in different outcomes in terms of ranking the contributions by various flows. Consequently, energy analysis, exergy analysis, and emergy analysis jointly provide comprehensive indications of the energy-related sustainability of the biofuel techno-system. This thermodynamic analysis can provide theoretical support for decision making on sustainability issues...|$|E
