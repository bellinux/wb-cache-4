25|$|The Mark VII, {{launched}} in 1996, {{was the final}} version of the original two-door Mini. For this model twin point injection with front-mounted radiator was introduced, along with a full-width dashboard and driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Corolla 2.0D Saloon has {{the same}} engine as the Corolla 2.0D. The model is only {{available}} with a 5-speed manual. The 2.0D Saloon comes equipped with alloy rims, side skirts, optitron speedometer, wooden inserts in the interior and a single driver <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> Optional extra on the model is the sunroof.|$|E
25|$|The W124 also {{featured}} a driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> (optional in Europe, later {{standard in the}} USA), height-adjustable seat belts with electronic-mechanical pre-tensioneers (standard) for both front passengers, rear seat belts which automatically adapted {{to the size of}} the passengers (standard), pedals that were moved inversely in a frontal impact (away from the drivers feet and in the direction of the bulkhead separating the cabin from the engine) and door arm rests with deformable elements designed to reduce abdominal injury risk resulting from a side impact.|$|E
50|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> commonly used today: the <b>side</b> torso <b>airbag</b> and the <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbag.</b>|$|R
50|$|For safety ABS, Vehicle Stability Control, {{front and}} rear head <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags,</b> and front seat-mounted torso <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> were optional. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the Camry Good overall in their frontal offset crash test. In their side impact test a Good overall rating was given to models {{equipped}} with <b>side</b> <b>airbags,</b> while models without <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> were given a Poor overall rating.|$|R
50|$|IIHS tests give early Trailblazers a Marginal {{overall rating}} in the frontal offset test while 2005-2009 models get an Acceptable rating. For 2008 models <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags</b> became standard. The Trailblazer gets a Marginal overall side impact rating - tested with {{optional}} <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> present. Torso type <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> were unavailable.|$|R
25|$|This {{generation}} Imperial was a 6-passenger sedan {{offered in}} either velour or Mark Cross leather. Power equipment came standard, as did automatic climate controlled air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> and its distinct landau vinyl roof. The Imperial featured hidden headlamps behind retractable metal covers {{similar to those}} found on the LeBaron coupe/convertible and New Yorker/Fifth Avenue. The Imperial was available with a choice of several Infinity sound systems, all with a cassette player. Other major options included fully electronic digital instrument cluster with information center, electronically controlled air suspension system, and remote keyless entry with security alarm. Dealer-installed integrated Chrysler cellular phones and six-disc CD changers were also available.|$|E
25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced dual stage frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New engine management systems with drive-by-wire throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like the previous generation, it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E

5000|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{gives the}} Charger an overall Good score in frontal crash tests. [...] In side impacts Charger models {{equipped}} with optional <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> {{are given a}} Marginal score overall, and models without <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> are given the lowest overall Poor score.|$|R
500|$|The 1993 VR Commodore {{represented}} a major facelift {{of the second}} generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80percent of car was new {{in comparison to the}} preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular wheel arches and the [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60-E automatic transmission. Along with a driver's airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden's strong focus on safety {{can be seen in the}} Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a [...] "worse than average" [...] level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a [...] "better than average" [...] level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes.|$|E

50|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{gives the}} 2001-2006 Sebring an Acceptable overall rating in frontal crash tests. In the side impact test, a Poor overall rating {{was given to}} models without <b>side</b> <b>airbags.</b> The IIHS did not test the Sebring with <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> since Chrysler {{declined}} another test.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, the {{wrap-around}} {{instrument panel}} was substantially revised and optionally {{available for the}} first time (and seldom ordered) was a driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> system with an exclusive steering wheel design. 1974 was the final year for the Max Trac traction control option. New options for 1974 included radial tires and a [...] "low fuel" [...] warning light came on when the gas tank was down to only four gallons. A new distinctive [...] "Landau" [...] option was available on the Limited coupe that included the now-popular rear side opera windows and rear-quarter vinyl roof.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, a driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was added, {{along with}} {{standard}} ABS on all models, standard power windows, and [...] {{more in the}} base engine due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder head. The Limited coupe was deleted; only the Custom and Gran Sport (GS) coupes remained. Dual airbags were new for 1995 along with a new interior. In 1996, the larger 3.8L V6 engine gained [...] Although 1996 was {{the last year of}} this model, production of the 1996 model continued into 1997 as the replacement model was late.|$|E
2500|$|The 2.5L I4 was {{replaced}} with a new 115hp 2.2L for 1993. For 1994, the slow-selling coupe model was dropped (603 sold in 1993, or 0.5 percent of overall Century sales), and all models received a standard driver's <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> Also in 1994, the 160hp 3.3L Buick V6 {{was replaced}} with a 3.1L V6 with the same power rating, and power on the 2.2L I4 was up to [...] {{with the introduction of}} MFI. Midway through the 1994 model year, a round speedometer replaced the wide rectangular one, but the car still carried on with the original 1982-style dash.|$|E

2500|$|... 1994: The first facelift: Front {{grill and}} {{headlamps}} were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available. [...] A major redesign to the dash added a passenger <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> {{and made it}} less cluttered and more modern. [...] A new model was introduced, the Luxury Sport Sedan (LSS). [...] Engineers fitted bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), floor shifter and a center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) into the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. [...] Higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for {{the front and rear}} suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling.|$|E
2500|$|The LaCrosse {{received}} a Good overall {{score in the}} Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal impact crash test and a Marginal overall rating in the side impact test. Injury measurements for the side-impact crash test include a Poor mark for the driver's torso and a Marginal score for the driver's pelvis and leg.
