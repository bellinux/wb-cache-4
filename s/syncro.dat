50|$|<b>Syncros</b> is a {{brand of}} bicycle components, with an {{emphasis}} on off-road bicycle parts. Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, <b>Syncros</b> had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts. In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S. based bicycle company GT. Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts. Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the <b>Syncros</b> brand name, and used the <b>Syncros</b> label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation. Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the <b>Syncros</b> brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham. However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name.|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, <b>Syncros</b> was {{purchased}} by SCOTT Sports.|$|R
50|$|<b>Syncros</b> was {{purchased}} in 2003 from Pacific by Tom Ritchey, who re-established the brand with Marshall Cant, former Product Manager at Rocky Mountain Bicycles, {{in the position}} of Brand Manager. Under the guidance of Tom Ritchey, <b>Syncros</b> has returned to its roots as a leading designer and manufacturer of high end mountain bike components. The original micro adjust 2 bolt seatpost is still manufactured but is the only original product still in the line up.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, at the Tokyo Motor Show, Volkswagen debuted {{their first}} sports car concept, {{a bright yellow}} W12 <b>Syncro</b> (also known as the W12 <b>Syncro</b> Coupé) with a 5.6-litre W12 engine {{producing}} [...] with <b>Syncro</b> four-wheel drive. It, and the W12 concepts after it, were all designed by the Italdesign firm in Italy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, {{the first}} Golfs with {{four-wheel-drive}} (Golf <b>Syncro)</b> {{went on sale}} with the same <b>Syncro</b> four-wheel-drive system being employed on the supercharged G60 models, exclusively released on the continent in 1989 with [...] and anti-lock brakes (ABS).|$|E

5000|$|With Scott Sports {{taking more}} {{prominence}} as a naming sponsor, non-drivetrain components from Shimano subsidiary PRO such as seatposts and handlebars {{were replaced by}} Scott subsidiary <b>Syncros.</b> Also for 2017, Italian clothing brand Giordana replaces all apparel previously supplied from Swedish company Craft.|$|R
50|$|The {{drive train}} was changed in this model, {{including}} bigger CVs and more <b>syncros</b> in the manual gearboxes. The differential housings were widened to fall inline {{with the new}} body shape, but centers remained the same (H233 and H260). Some petrol wagons received a coil version of the H260 differential.|$|R
2500|$|The E-BCNR33 (R33) was {{developed}} in 1995 as a successor to the R32 model. The engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It used the same turbochargers and the same specification for the manual gearbox, although the <b>syncros</b> were stronger. The engine corrected the R32's weak oil pump drive collar, which tended to fail in higher power applications, by using a wider collar. The base model R33 GT-R weighs [...]|$|R

50|$|The 2002 {{model was}} named the Euro-Rx. This model came with a few slight {{modifications}} from the 2000/2001 model. These included factory rear privacy glass, a titanium gear knob, optional Red-checker interior (original gold-checker) and bronze coloured alloy wheels. The high-stop spoiler also became standard on all models. Honda also addressed two common issues that had become apparent. The ECU was upgraded {{to resolve the issue}} of cold-starts causing hesitation on acceleration and the gearbox <b>syncros</b> were upgraded to a higher quality alloy to lengthen their lifespan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} product {{that came from}} Fat City Cycles was without doubt the cult Yo Eddy. The Yo as it is often {{referred}} to {{is one of the most}} iconic and collectable mountain bikes of the early 90's. The famous Team Violet 1991 and 1992 versions with matching rigid [...] "Yo Eddy" [...] forks are often the most desirable and are often built with Ringle, Grafton, Bullseye, <b>Syncros</b> and RockShox parts. Owning a Yo is the pinnacle for most vintage mountain bike collectors and the value of these bikes in recent years has seen a significant rise.|$|R
50|$|The MT75 {{has five}} speeds and reverse. This {{was the first}} Ford {{production}} gearbox to have a synchromesh on reverse (so reverse can be selected whilst in slight forward motion).The internal gear assembly in order {{from front to back}} as installed on the mainshaft is as follows: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Reverse with 5th gear situated at the rear towards the output (propshaft flange), all gears are of a helical cut with the exception of reverse which is straight cut. Refined over time with slight improvement made to the synchro's phasing out single part synchromesh's on 1st & 2nd gear in favour of three part <b>syncro's.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{was also}} a version called Golf Country (7.735 cars), co-manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria, {{designed}} for medium off-road driving. It had more suspension travel, <b>Syncro</b> four-wheel drive, improved ground clearance of 21 cm, bullbars at front and rear (generally over a single headlight grille), a skid plate for protecting the engine area, sub-frame to protect the rear <b>Syncro</b> differential and propshaft and a spare wheel mounted externally on a swing-away triangular frame on the back.|$|E

5000|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} system {{used in the}} Passat Variant <b>Syncro</b> shared the {{mechanics}} of the Audi 80 quattro rather than the Volkswagen Golf <b>Syncro.</b> When first shown, at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show, the car was meant to be called the [...] "Passat Tetra". The Syncro's bottomplate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank, and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly). Unlike the related Audi 80 quattro which used a reversed front wheel setup, the rear-axle was an adapted Volkswagen Transporter unit so as to retain a flat loading floor. Only the more popular estate was deemed worthy of reengineering, so as to not offer direct competition with the sedan-only Audi 80 quattro. <b>Syncro</b> was also available in the North American market, only with the five-cylinder engine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Syncro</b> was {{designed}} as an advanced cross country glider for experienced pilots. The models are each named for their approximate wing area in square metres.|$|E
50|$|Datel {{also made}} {{numerous}} unique copy devices for various systems that proved extremely popular. Devices {{such as the}} <b>Syncro</b> Express {{as well as the}} Action Replay exerted a heavy toll on the fledgeling video games industry. It has been said that Datel in part was responsible for the demise of the home computer games market. Hundreds of thousands of <b>Syncro</b> Express units, each copying 10 to 100 games, may have had an impact. The 1988 Act Copyright law of the United Kingdom was designed to halt the casual copying of games in this way.|$|E
50|$|On March 31, 1988 {{production}} ended (although <b>Syncro</b> models {{continued in}} production until June) with 3,345,248 built in Germany. World production totals amount {{to at least}} 4.5 million units.|$|E

50|$|<b>Syncro</b> {{models were}} {{manufactured}} in limited numbers from 1985 through 1992, with the four-wheel drive system added by Steyr-Daimler-Puch Works in Graz, Austria, {{with a short}} wheelbase and 48/52 front/rear weight distribution.|$|E

5000|$|The T4 {{was also}} {{available}} {{with a permanent}} 4WD system that uses a Viscous coupling unit as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear axle. These models are called [...] "syncro" [...] and were available with the 2.4D, 2.5Tdi and 2.5 petrol engines on all body types and both wheelbases. Some <b>syncro</b> models also have a mechanically locking rear differential. Since the rear differential precludes {{the placement of the}} spare wheel in the usual place under the body, <b>syncro</b> vans either store it inside the body or on an external, hinged bracket.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Volkswagen T2/3 - also known as the (T3/Vanagon/Transporter/T25) in 1979, the motorhomes received a permanent overhead area with a bed for two people. Called Karmann Gipsy, 741 were made between 1980 and 1992. This number excludes 30 or more Type 3 <b>Syncro</b> models made between 1986 and 1989, and 7 <b>Syncro</b> 16" [...] models made between 1991 and 1992. In addition 113 Cheetah T2/3's were manufactured between 1986 and 1990 to make a total 891 Volkswagen T3 Karmann Coachbuilt Motorhomes - all produced in Karmann Rheine factory and not at Osnabruck as commonly believed.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{previous}} generation, the B2 Passat was mainly sold with four-cylinder {{petrol and diesel}} engines. Unlike its predecessor, however, top-of the line versions received five-cylinder Audi or VW engines of 1.9-2.2 litres. The 5-cylinder version was sold in the US as the Quantum GL-5. In addition to four- and five-speed manuals and three-speed automatic gearboxes, the Passat/Santana was also available with the VW concern's interesting 4+E transmission. This, also called the [...] "Formel E" [...] had a particularly high top gear, which combined with a freewheeling mechanism, provided better gas mileage. An automatic stop/start was also available in some markets. The four-wheel-drive system used in the Passat Variant <b>Syncro</b> shared {{the mechanics of the}} Audi 80 and not the Volkswagen Golf <b>Syncro.</b> The Syncro's bottom plate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly). Only the more popular estate was reengineered. <b>Syncro</b> was also available in the North American market, only with the five-cylinder engine.|$|E
50|$|The Fly Synthesis <b>Syncro</b> is an Italian {{ultralight}} and light-sport aircraft, {{designed and}} produced by Fly Synthesis, introduced at the Aero show held in Friedrichshafen in 2009. The aircraft is supplied {{as a complete}} ready-to-fly-aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Carl {{was also}} {{responsible}} for developing many photographic techniques and equipment. Among these was his participation {{in the development of}} the early phases of the <b>syncro</b> flash, which undoubtedly opened many new avenues to the photographer.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1986, Volkswagen {{presented}} the first Golf with four-wheel drive. This Golf <b>Syncro</b> was {{available as a}} five-door with the 1.8 engine only ( [...] , later [...] ). Its 4WD system had been developed in collaboration with Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria, and featured a viscous coupling and flexible partition of torque between front and rear axle - up to 48% to the rear. Due to its high price (in 1986, a <b>Syncro</b> cost about 30% more than an equivalent front wheel drive model) the model remained rare; from 1986 to 1989, for instance, just 26,000 Syncros were built. Fewer than 1,000 were sold on the UK market.|$|E
