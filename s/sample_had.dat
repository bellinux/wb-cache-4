A BBC audience research report commissioned after Quatermass II had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> watched at least five episodes of the production.|$|E

40|$|A {{descriptive}} study with a quantitative approach {{was found to}} be appropriate to assess the knowledge and practice of menstrual hygiene. The study was conducted in three nursing colleges in Kanchipuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. A convenience sampling technique was used to select 102 samples. The research tool consisted of a structured interview schedule to assess the demographic profile of the samples and structured questionnaires to assess the knowledge and practice of menstrual hygiene. The study findings revealed that only 3 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>have</b> adequate knowledge on menstrual hygiene (> 75 % score), 27 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>have</b> moderately adequate knowledge (51 - 75 % score) and 70 % have inadequate knowledge on menstrual hygiene (< 50 % score).

25|$|The test on Landis's stage 17 A <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> been {{performed}} by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD). LNDD is {{a division of the}} Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and is accredited by WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency. In early August, Landis was found guilty of doping and was disqualified. Second place rider Óscar Pereiro became the race's official winner. The decision of whether to strip Landis of his title was made by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Under UCI rules, the determination of whether a cyclist violated any rules must be made by the cyclist's national federation, in this case USA Cycling, which transferred the case to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).|$|E
25|$|The {{test that}} Moran was {{referring}} to was actually invented in 1836 by a Scottish chemist named James Marsh, {{who worked at the}} Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. Called upon to help solve a murder nearby, he tried to detect arsenic using the old methods. While he was successful, the <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> decomposed and did not convince the jury of the defendant's guilt. Frustrated at this turn of events, Marsh developed a glass apparatus not only to detect minute traces of arsenic, but also to measure its quantity. The sample is mixed with arsenic-free zinc and sulphuric acid, any arsenic present causing the production of arsine gas and hydrogen. The gas is then led through a tube where it is heated strongly, decomposing into hydrogen and arsenic vapor. When the arsenic vapor impinges on a cold surface, a mirror-like deposit of arsenic forms.|$|E
25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At {{the end of the}} 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol, and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period. Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy {{has been}} {{associated}} with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more sexual offences. For child molesters, psychopathy was associated with more offences. A study on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers, in which 84.2% of the <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that 82.4% of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) compared to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence. Despite this, it is reported that offenders with psychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual offenders) are about 2.5 {{times more likely to be}} granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders.|$|E
25|$|Employee {{turnover}} rate {{is a significant}} problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, {{turnover rate}} among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to {{a substantial number of}} employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee turnover rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the <b>sample</b> <b>had</b> achieved sales figures above the average. This is a significant increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.|$|E

He based this conclusion partly on personal communication with Hammersmith, however, noting that Bell et al. did not explain their procedures for verifying their findings well in Sexual Preference and its statistical appendix. He also suspected that they had relied on dubious information from heterosexuals about the sexual orientation of their siblings, and considered their review of evidence on the possible biological basis of homosexuality inadequate.|$|E
500|$|Arular {{was to be}} {{released}} in September 2004, but was delayed. M.I.A.'s record label stated that the delay was caused by problems obtaining permission to use an unspecified sample.
