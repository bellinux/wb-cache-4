40|$|Abstract—Estimation of {{distribution}} algorithms sample new solutions (offspring) from a probability model which characterizes {{the distribution of}} promising solutions in the search space at each generation. The location information of solutions found <b>so</b> <b>far</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> the actual positions of these solutions in the search space) is not directly used for generating offspring in most existing estimation {{of distribution}} algorithms. This paper introduces a new operator, called guided mutation. Guided mutation generates offspring through combination of global statistical information and the location information of solutions found <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) for the maximum clique problem is proposed in this paper. Besides guided mutation, EA/G adopts a strategy for searching different search areas in different search phases. Marchiori’s heuristic is applied to each new solution to produce a maximal clique in EA/G. Experimental results show that EA/G outperforms the heuristic genetic algorithm of Marchiori (the best evolutionary algorithm reported <b>so</b> <b>far)</b> and a MIMIC algorithm on DIMACS benchmark graphs.
