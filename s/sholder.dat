5000|$|The Kinzemba is an {{openwork}} tunic made of raffia fiber. The Kinzembe {{is unique}} among Central African ceremonial garments {{for having a}} traceable chronology that spans several hundred years and {{for the fact that}} it can be linked with a specific historical figure. Ne Vunde was a Kongo ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1608, shortly after arriving in Rome. He is represented wearing a Kinzembe in a memorial bust commissioned by the Pope after Ne Vunde's death. In 1688 in Angola, Capuchin priest Girolamo Merolla recorded the following description of a Kinzembe: [...] "The gentry have a kind of straw garment on their <b>sholders,</b> which reaches down to their wastes, curiously wrought, wit their arms coming out at two slits, and ends in two tassels which hang down on the right side.

40|$|<b>Sholders</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in the measured semilogarithmic current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of high-efficiency passivated emitter and rear locally diffused silicon (Si) solar cells. An improved understanding is giben of the mechanism proposed to cause these nonideal I-V curves. It is shown that this mechanism {{is due to the}} electrostatic behavior of free carriers at the Si/SiO 2 interface of oxidised Si devices in which the Si adjacent to the oxide is depleted (or in some cases, inverted) at equilibrium, and results in saturation of the surface recombination rate. Two-dimensional numerical computer simulations are used to investigate this mechanism and its effect on cell performance. In addition, the simu;ations provide a means to estimating the etent do which lateral conduction in the rear surface channel also contributes ot the observed recombination saturation in these cells. It is shiown that ohmic limitation of lateral conduction occurs, however, the lateral current flows are negligible in comparison to the recombination currents due to the former mechanism...|$|R

Although Hooke was not of particularly short stature, he was of slight build and had been afflicted from his youth with a severe kyphosis. However, at this time Hooke and Newton were on good terms and had exchanged many letters in tones of mutual regard. Only later, when Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas regarding optics, was Newton so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.|$|R
