50|$|The flange {{nuts are}} {{sometimes}} {{provided with a}} <b>swivel</b> <b>flange</b> which helps in creating a more stable structure without affecting finished product like a serrated flange nut. <b>Swivel</b> <b>flange</b> nuts are mostly used in joining wood and plastic. Sometimes both faces of the nut are serrated, permitting either side to lock.|$|E
40|$|Finite element and {{photoelastic}} {{methods of}} stress analysis have been wed {{to study the}} effects of pressure loading on the behaviour of <b>swivel</b> ring <b>flanges.</b> The use of recesses on the back faces of flanges, to control the load position, were investigated. The effect of the friction conditions between the flange and ring were also considered. It was found that the inclusion of a recess can significantly reduce the highest stresses, which occur in the flange/hub fillet radius. The friction conditions between the flange and ring were also found to {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses. ...|$|R
30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], <b>swivel</b> ring <b>flange,</b> external hydraulic tieback connector [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline ends [7] and adapter sleeve for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus connector, quick flange morgrip pipeline connector and hydraulic smart flange connector. The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|R
