2500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the association's 100th anniversary in 2010, the memorial underwent significant repair. The GNWMMA Board of Directors approved a significant expenditure of funds to make these changes. The Main Assembly Hall was renamed the Grand Masonic Hall, and restored to its original condition. The [...] "Grand Masonic Hall" [...] was also enclosed with glass and doors, permitting it {{to be used as}} a conference center. Air conditioning was installed throughout the building, elevators reaching to the first floor added, the roof over the second and third floors repaired, the memorial made even more handicap-accessible, the main front granite steps removed and reset, and a <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>surveillance</b> system installed. The hallways around the Grand Masonic Hall on the first floor were repainted, new lighting installed, and a new photo exhibit ("The Golden Age of Masonic Architecture") placed on the walls. The room containing the historic replica of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 meeting room was also renovated and updated, to better display the Washingtoniana in the room. A new exhibit, [...] "The Form and Function of American Freemasonry," [...] was added to the first floor to help explain what Freemasonry is and what its symbols represent.

[...] He works as head valet for the first season, but is officially recruited by Ed Deline to the security department to help during Danny's military absence. He stays on as security personnel despite being paid less than {{his job as a}} valet. [...] He is cured of his claustrophobia at the end of season one. Originally, in the pilot episode, Mike has a wife and daughter; this plot line is seemingly abandoned thereafter. Mike and Nessa become close in season two, until Nessa leaves to be with her dad and sister, without saying goodbye. In Season 5, when Danny accepts the job as President of Operations for the Casino, Mike is promoted to head of <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Mike and Piper are married in the series cliffhanger. Whenever approaching a beautiful girl, he first uses breath spray. He is Danny's best friend. Some discrepancy exists over whether Mike is a local or not. The initial season, he is stated to be a local who moved back as evidenced in [...] "Decks and Violence" [...] through his conversations.

In 2005, D.C. architect Arthur Cotton Moore harshly condemned the building for creating a dead space {{in the heart of}} the nation's capital. [...] "It creates a void along Pennsylvania Avenue. Given its elephantine size and harshness, it creates a black hole. Its concrete wall, with no windows or life to it, is an urban sin. People should be strolling down America's main street. Nobody strolls in front of the FBI Building." [...] The following year, Gerard Moeller and Christopher Weeks wrote in the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. that the FBI building was the [...] "swaggering bully of the neighborhood...ungainly, ill-mannered..." [...] They also blamed the structure's poor design for undermining the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue: [...] "the impenetrable base, the shadowy courtyard, and looming upper stories bespeak <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The prototype for the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan devised under the direction of Nathanial Owings, it helped to ensure that the full plan would never be realized." [...] Five years later, in 2011, Washington City Paper reporter Lydia DePillis noted that the building has [...] "long been maligned as downtown D.C.'s ugliest edifice". Architecture for Dummies author Deborah K. Dietsch said in April 2012 that it was [...] "disastrous", [...] "insensitive", and [...] "hostile", and that it and the James V. Forrestal Building topped the list of the city's ugliest buildings. A list compiled by Trippy.com and Reuters declared the J.

He is portrayed as a loving husband and father, as well as a father figure to his employees, especially Danny. [...] Nevertheless, he is a tough man and does not hesitate to use violence to get what he wants. [...] As the former director of counterintelligence for the CIA, his past has come back to haunt him on several occasions, most recently during his daughter's wedding in [...] "Father of the Bride Redux". During season three, Ed is briefly in retirement until the Maloofs try to hire him for their potential casino in Macau. [...] Eventually, Ed returns to his position when Casey Manning buys the casino. [...] Ed leaves the casino after becoming wanted by the Las Vegas police for killing Mary Connell's father, and goes into hiding. [...] Ed returns to work for the CIA and is stationed in Paris. He makes the point of not being called Mr. Ed, Edward, or Eddie (the only exceptions to this are for his mother, who calls him Edward, and his wife, who calls him Eddie). James Caan's earlier [...] "tough guy" [...] roles are sometimes referenced, for example, when Ed is in a Montecito commercial, the director says he needs to be more like Sonny Corleone in The Godfather. [...] However, in response, Ed says he [...] "never saw" [...] the movie, and indicates no interest in doing so. Another reference (to Caan's first major film role) is the name on a fake passport he uses (Alan Bodillion Treherne) when Ed travels to Morocco to relocate a former CIA asset. That is the name of the [...] "sidekick" [...] character Caan played in the movie El Dorado with John Wayne.|$|E
