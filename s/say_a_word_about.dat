FitzHenry {{claimed to have}} known the Pig-faced Lady's sister, stating that [...] "Lady C.B. lived in Chelsea: her sister, Lady H.W., was much admired as a beauty. I was at a dinner-party forty years ago with Lady H.W., when all the party were cautioned previously not to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> pigs, out of delicacy to Lady H.W." [...] In the same issue, a George Lloyd claimed to have seen the Pig-faced Lady in Wakefield in around 1828–29 [...] "but {{was too young to}} take a note further than a mental one, which has haunted me ever since".|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{a number}} gap. In the Battle of Toro the {{proportion}} of both armies was practically 1:1, according to [...] (7,500 Juanistas to 8,500 Isabelistas), Álvaro L Chaves and [...] Pulgar, whereas at Aljubarrota that proportion was 5:1 according to [...] Fernão Lopes (31,000 Franco-Castilians to 6,500 Anglo-Portuguese)]] Fernão Lopes- Crónica de D. João I (2), 1983, chapters XXXVI and XXXVII. The army brought from Castile was enlarged on its way towards Aljubarrota with the forces from the many cities and fortresses loyal to Juan I, commanded by their respective alcaldes plus a large contingent from the Castilian armada which was besieging Lisbon reaching: 6,000 men at arms plus 15,000 peons plus 2,000 jennets and 8,000 javelin throwers. or [...] "at least 4:1"]] , translation of book III, folio 237r. according to [...] Jean Froissart. Elucidative is {{the attitude of the}} Castilian chronicler [...] Pero López de Ayala, who besides being a military expert and a royal counsellor, participated on the Battle of Aljubarrota: he described minuciously the disposition and the numbers of the Anglo-Portuguese army but understandably he didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> the soldiers’ number of his own army.]] Ayala-, tome II, 7th year: chapters XIII and XIV.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name is curious; it is not from the German Eidegenossen as has been supposed. Reguier de la Plancha {{accounts}} for it as follows: — [...] "The name huguenand was given {{to those of the}} religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retail it ever since. I'll <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called le moine bourré; at Orleans, le mulet odet; at Blois le loup garon; at Tours, le Roy Huguet; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical huguenands in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise." ...|$|E
