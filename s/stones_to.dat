5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of <b>Stones</b> <b>to</b> its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned <b>Stones</b> <b>to</b> Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Abilities are {{classified}} into action and support categories. Action abilities consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special moves {{that are used}} in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.|$|E
5|$|On the ship, Chloe and Young use the {{communication}} <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> contact Earth, allowing Chloe to inform her mother of her situation and Senator Armstrong's death. Young, meanwhile, is encouraged by O'Neill {{to repair the}} ship; {{in spite of his}} protests that their expedition is not cut out for it, O'Neill insists that no one really is ready for their kind of work.|$|E
50|$|Cimino was {{prompted}} <b>to</b> seek out <b>Stone</b> after reading, and being impressed by, Stone's (at the time) unproduced Platoon screenplay. Cimino asked <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> work on Year of the Dragon for a lower-than-normal wage {{as part of}} a quid pro quo deal, namely, that Year of the Dragon producer Dino De Laurentiis would provide the funding for <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> make Platoon. <b>Stone</b> agreed <b>to</b> this deal, although De Laurentiis later reneged on it, forcing <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> obtain funding for Platoon elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Echemendia was {{approached}} by director Oliver <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> collaborate on his movie, Savages. Echemendia worked with <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> aid in {{the authenticity of the}} script and production design. Echemendia also had a cameo role in the film as [...] "Wiley", the sound expert.|$|R

5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After {{a long period of}} use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on staddle <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> their hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Cole and Davie {{developed}} a two-player game {{based on the}} Euclidean algorithm, called The Game of Euclid, which has an optimal strategy. The players begin with two piles of a and b stones. The players take turns removing m multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of x and y stones, where x is larger than y, the next player can reduce the larger pile from x <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> x − my stones, {{as long as the}} latter is a nonnegative integer. The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones.|$|E

50|$|The {{coming of}} the railway was <b>to</b> end <b>Stone’s</b> era as a {{coaching}} and canal town. The North Staffordshire Railway opened its main line from Stoke-on-Trent through <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> Norton Bridge on 3 April 1848; the following year a branch line from <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> Colwich began operating.|$|R
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 meters from the prior location, with the original location still being used for staff meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} {{keep an eye on the}} chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|Kélé rituals are {{accompanied}} by the drumming of the tanbou manman (mother drum) and the tanbou ich (child drum), which play four different rhythms at specified moments; these are the adan, èrè, koudou and kèré rhythms. Kélé rituals also include singing and dance, as well as feasting, praying to Ogun and the other gods, the smashing of the calabash to appease Eshu {{at the end of}} the ceremony, the display of tools made of iron and steel to honor Ogun, and smooth <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> represent Shango, who also receives a ceremonially cleansed sacrificial ram.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying {{was carried}} out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the {{gatehouse}} leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> be removed from the site. In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, {{as part of a larger}} estate. In the mid-19th century the castle was the site of an annual two-day fete, raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3000 visitors a day.|$|E
5|$|Scotland was {{occupied}} by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from around 8500 BCE, who were highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements, like the stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE. The settlers also introduced chambered cairn tombs, as at Maeshowe, and the many standing stones and circles such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which dates from about 3100 BCE, and similar <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> which are found across Europe from about the same time.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E

5|$|The title Leave Home {{refers to}} the Ramones leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, {{who had worked with}} the Rolling <b>Stones</b> <b>to</b> yield the Black and Blue (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was a drawing of a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with a slab {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) wide, with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> continue standing upright.|$|E
5|$|Wave 9 {{requires}} the player {{to cross a}} river of lava by stunning the monsters that live there. Once across, Jones must grab the Sankara <b>Stones</b> <b>to</b> progress to the Map Room where he can use the map pieces he has collected {{to figure out where}} the secret door exit is in Wave 10. Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass {{requires the}} use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram.|$|E

5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E
