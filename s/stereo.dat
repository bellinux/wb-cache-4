5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a <b>stereo</b> or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or <b>stereo</b> mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is <b>stereo,</b> the subwoofers can also be in <b>stereo.</b> Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a <b>stereo</b> mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} multi-track tape, there had never been an official true <b>stereo</b> release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The <b>stereo</b> mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the <b>stereo</b> version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E

5|$|In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers {{to acquire}} <b>Stereo</b> Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for {{bankruptcy}} the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car <b>stereo</b> specialty shop at Mall 205, Car <b>Stereo</b> East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, {{so he decided to}} combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected.|$|E

5000|$|However, this is {{the main}} {{difference}} between shelf <b>stereos</b> and surround sound receivers.

5|$|Marble Madness is an arcade {{video game}} {{designed}} by Mark Cerny {{and published by}} Atari Games in 1984. The player uses a trackball to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language. It {{was also one of}} the first games to use true <b>stereo</b> sound; previous games used either monaural sound or simulated <b>stereo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The One’s {{audio system}} {{incorporates}} two front-facing BoomSound <b>stereo</b> speakers, Beats Audio software equalizer, and HDR audio recording. The BoomSound <b>stereo</b> system {{is controlled by}} two five-volt NXP TFA9887 integrated circuits combining NXP’s CoolFlux audio DSP, a class-D amplifier with current sensing, and a DC-to-DC converter to boost the output level of micro-speakers up to five times (up to 2.6W RMS) without damaging the driver.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} version of the song had stayed largely in the key of G major (except for {{transient}} modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and features a modulation, to G. The mono and <b>stereo</b> mixes of the song differ slightly: the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song, and includes crowd noise and laughter in the opening bars that are absent from the <b>stereo</b> mix.|$|E

5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in <b>stereo</b> sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in <b>stereo,</b> and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E

5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from <b>Stereo</b> 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car <b>stereo</b> systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

A <b>stereo</b> edition LP was issued by Buena Vista Records in 1961.
