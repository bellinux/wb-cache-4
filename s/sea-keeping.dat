5|$|The German navy {{found the}} ship to be very stiff in her <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities. Hansa was very maneuverable and was easily {{controlled}} while under sail; under steam the ship remained highly maneuverable but control suffered. The ship's crew numbered 28officers and 371 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. The ship also carried {{an unknown number of}} picket boats and barges. Anti-torpedo nets were briefly fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1888.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Sevastopol {{joined the}} Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. She {{returned}} fire when the Bolsheviks began to bombard Kronstadt Island and was hit by three 12-inch shells that killed or wounded 102 sailors. After the rebellion was bloodily crushed, she was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna after the Paris Commune on 31 March 1921. She was refitted several times before she was recommissioned on 17 September 1925. She was refitted again in 1928 at the Baltic Shipyard, in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet. Her forward funnel was raised and the upper part was angled aft {{in an attempt to}} keep the exhaust gases out of the control and gunnery spaces, while three 3-inch 'Lender' AA guns were added to the roofs of the fore and aft turrets. She received some additional rangefinders and she was given a false bow to improve her <b>sea-keeping</b> ability. She sailed for the Black Sea on 22 November 1929, in company of the cruiser Profintern, encountering a bad storm in the Bay of Biscay. The open-topped bow lacked enough drainage and tended to trap a lot of water which badly damaged both the false bow and the supporting structure. Parizhskaya Kommuna was forced to put into Brest for repairs, which included the removal of the bulwark that retained so much water. Both ships arrived at Sevastopol on 18 January 1930 and Parizhskaya Kommuna became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
25|$|In general layout, the Shiratsuyu-class vessels closely {{resembled the}} Ariake sub-class, or {{final version of}} the Hatsuharu class, differing only in the more compact bridge design and the shape and {{inclination}} of the funnels. The hull retained the general configuration of the Hatsuharu class with a long forecastle with a pronounced flare to improve <b>sea-keeping</b> at high speeds by adding buoyancy and reducing the spray and water coming over the deck.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 refit radically {{altered the}} ship's profile, when the {{original}} slim funnels were replaced with a single large one, and the outer decks between the bridge and the funnel were built in. Additionally, a bulbous bow was added below the waterline, improving the ship's <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities. During the refit, the ship's livery was also altered, with the new funnel painted in blue and white, while a white decorative ribbon was added to her hull. The exact same livery was maintained as Regent Sun, with the Regency Cruises funnel symbol replacing that of Royal Cruise Line.|$|E
25|$|Between January and August 1914 Gayundah {{underwent}} a significant refit at the Cockatoo Dockyard in Sydney. Changes {{during this time}} included work on her forecastle, improvement of her accommodation and <b>sea-keeping</b> characteristics, and the replacement of her 8-inch gun by a 4.7-inch gun. With the outbreak of World War I, Gayundah was assigned to coastal patrols of Moreton Bay and {{the east coast of}} Australia. In July 1915, one of Gayundahs 12-pounder guns was removed. In 1917, due to the threat posed by German raiders such as SMS Seeadler, Gayundah patrolled off Port Jackson and in the Spencer Gulf, although she made no contact with enemy ships during this time.|$|E
25|$|The eight {{ships were}} ordered under the {{provisions}} of the 1889 Naval Defence Act as an improved design of the preceding s. They were to displace 1000 tons more than the Apollos, and were to have improved <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities, and heavier and better placed armament. The result was a design with a full length deck that gave a higher freeboard amidships, and placed the main armament higher on the superstructure. Though this made them drier ships, the design was criticised for being a larger and more expensive development of the Apollos, but without offering any substantial increase in armament, speed or endurance. The increased weight did however make them more seaworthy, and the design provided the basis for the development of future protected cruisers. The ships were built at several of the principal navy dockyards: three at Devonport, two at Pembroke, and one each at Sheerness, Chatham and Portsmouth.|$|E
500|$|The Portland {{class was}} {{generally}} {{longer than the}} Northampton class by about [...] and featured a revised bow shape. They were otherwise generally similar to the Northampton class, with an extended forecastle to improve <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities. Their masts were reduced {{as compared to the}} Northampton class in order to reduce top weight.|$|E
500|$|Iéna {{was fitted}} with large bilge keels, but was {{reported}} to roll considerably and pitch heavily, although this is contradicted by the ship's captain's report of November 1905: [...] "From the <b>sea-keeping</b> point of view the Iéna is an excellent ship. Pitching and rolling movements are gentle and the ship rides the waves well." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her construction, Triton was the largest {{submarine}} ever built. Her knife-like bow, with its bulbous forefoot, provided improved surfaced <b>sea-keeping</b> for her radar picket role. Her surface <b>sea-keeping</b> was further enhanced by high reserve buoyancy (30%), provided by 22 ballast tanks, the most ever in an American submarine. She was the last submarine to have a conning tower, as well as the last American submarine to have twin screws or a stern torpedo room. [...] Her sail was the largest ever aboard an American submarine, measuring [...] long, [...] tall, and [...] wide, and designed to house the large AN/SPS-26 3-D air-search radar antenna when not in use. She also had a compartment solely for crew berthing, with 96 bunks, and two separate chief petty officers' (CPOs') quarters. [...] With an overall length of , Triton was the longest submarine {{in the history of the}} United States Navy until the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine [...] was commissioned in 1981.|$|E

Their transverse metacentric height was [...] They had a crew of 58officers and 1,005enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|König Wilhelm {{was noted}} by the German navy as having had [...] "satisfactory <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities"; the ship was {{responsive}} to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She suffered from severe roll but little pitch. The ship's crew numbered 36 officers and 694 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff composed of 9 officers and 47 enlisted men. König Wilhelm carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
500|$|Henri IV was {{designed}} by the famous French naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin to evaluate some of his ideas. She {{was designed}} to make her a small target and lacked most of the normal rear superstructure common to ships of her period, other than that needed to keep her rear turret from being washed out. Her rear hull had only [...] of freeboard, although she was built up to the normal upper deck height amidships and at the bow for better <b>sea-keeping</b> and to provide for her crew. Her superstructure was narrow and recessed from the hull above the main deck.|$|E
500|$|The Yorktown class gunboats—unofficially {{considered}} third-class cruisers—were {{the product}} of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. Concord was authorized in the 1888 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania. The hull for Concord was sublet by Palmer to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works and built to the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair design. The mechanical design was patterned after the layout for older sister ship [...] developed by William Cramp & Sons [...]|$|E

The most unusual feature of his design was the prominent forecastle that was built atop the forward part of the pressure hull, while the rear was virtually awash. This odd configuration gave the boat her nickname of toothbrush (brosse à dents).|$|E
500|$|The fleet {{embarked}} on a modest modernization program after the war, primarily focused on re-arming the ironclads with new rifled guns. Prinz Eugen was rebuilt in 1867, particularly to correct her poor <b>sea-keeping.</b> Her open bow was plated over and she was rearmed with twelve [...] muzzleloaders manufactured by Armstrong and two [...] 4-pounder guns. By 1873, the ship was obsolescent and had a thoroughly-rotted hull, so the Austro-Hungarian Navy decided to replace the ship. Parliamentary objection to granting funds for new ships forced the navy to resort to subterfuge to replace the ship. Reconstruction projects were routinely approved by the parliament, so the navy officially [...] "rebuilt" [...] Prinz Eugen and her sister ships. In reality, only {{some parts of the}} engines, armor plate, and other miscellaneous parts were salvaged from the ships, with work beginning at the Pola Navy Yard in November 1873. The new vessels were given the same names of the old vessels in an attempt to conceal their origin.|$|E
500|$|All of the dreadnoughts {{except for}} [...] were laid up in October–November 1918 {{for lack of}} manpower. [...] was {{severely}} damaged by a fire while laid up in 1919. Petropavlovsk was retained in commission to defend Kronstadt and Leningrad against the British forces supporting the White Russians although she also helped to suppress a mutiny by the garrison of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919. Her crew, {{and that of the}} , joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. After it was bloodily crushed, those ships were given proper 'revolutionary' names. The other two serviceable vessels were recommissioned and renamed in 1925–26 while some work was done to repair Frunze, as Poltava was now known, but the money quickly ran out for her repairs. Parizhskaya Kommuna, the former Sevastopol, was modified in 1928 to improve her <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities so that she could be transferred to the Black Sea Fleet which had nothing heavier than a light cruiser available. This proved to be {{the first of a series}} of modernizations where each ship of the class was progressively reconstructed and improved. A number of proposals were made in the 1930s to rebuild Frunze to match her sisters or even as a battlecruiser by removing one turret, but these came to naught and she was hulked preparatory to scrapping.|$|E
500|$|While under construction, Popov's {{design was}} {{modified}} {{by the addition}} of wood and copper sheathing to reduce biofouling, which increased Novgorods diameter to [...] She had a maximum draught of [...] and displaced [...] at normal load. Freeboard was only [...] and the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center. The ship had an unarmoured superstructure forward of the barbette that housed some of the crew's quarters. Despite initial concerns about her <b>sea-keeping</b> ability, Novgorod was a stable gun platform and had an easy roll that rarely exceeded 7–8°. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, on one occasion in 1877, lost all [...] during a Force eight storm. In some conditions the ship could pitch enough to lift her propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water so much that it took 40–45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship's speed. She had a crew of 151 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|Severe {{weather in}} the North Atlantic {{hampered}} Deutschlands raiding mission, though she did tie down several British warships assigned to track her down. The French Force de Raid, centered on the battleship , was occupied with protecting convoys around Britain {{to prevent them from}} being attacked by Deutschland. In early November, the Naval High Command recalled Deutschland; she passed through the Denmark Strait on 15 November and anchored in Gotenhafen on the 17th. In the course of her raiding mission, she sank only two vessels and captured a third. In 1940, the ship underwent a major overhaul, during which a raked clipper bow was installed to improve the <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities of the ship. At this time, she was re-rated as a heavy cruiser and renamed Lützow. Hitler in person made the decision to rename the ship, recognizing the propaganda value of the sinking of a ship that bore the name of its country. Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander in chief of the}} Kriegsmarine, also hoped that renaming the ship would confuse Allied intelligence; the [...] was designated for sale to the Soviet Navy, and it was hoped that the usage of her name for Deutschland would hide the transaction. The refit lasted until March 1940, after which it was intended to send the ship on another commerce raiding operation into the South Atlantic. In April, however, she was assigned to forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
500|$|Marat was {{partially}} reconstructed between {{the fall of}} 1928 and 8 April 1931 at the Baltic Works. The most obvious external change was a much more elaborate forward superstructure needed to house new fire control instruments. A KDP-6 fire-control director, with two [...] Zeiss rangefinders, was positioned {{at the top of}} the tubular foremast. An [...] Zeiss rangefinder was also added on the rear superstructure. The top of the forward funnel was lengthened by about [...] and angled backwards in an attempt to keep the exhaust gases away from the control and gunnery spaces. A derrick was added to the mainmast to handle a KR-1 flying boat imported from Germany that was stored above the third turret. No aircraft catapult was fitted so the aircraft had to take off and land on the water. A forecastle was added to the bow, which was also given much more sheer and flare to improve her <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities. Her turrets were overhauled, her guns replaced and new 8-meter rangefinders were installed on every turret. Her boilers were converted to only burn fuel oil and the more powerful boilers allowed the forward three boilers to be removed. The space freed up was used for anti-aircraft ammunition and various control spaces. The cruising turbines were also removed which simplified the ship's machinery at a small cost in power. These changes increased her displacement to [...] at full load and her overall length to [...] Her metacentric height increased to [...] from her designed [...] mainly because she now carried much of her fuel in her double bottom rather than in coal bunkers high on the sides of the ship. More weight was added to her before World War II, including an increase in the thickness of her turret roofs to , that decreased her metacentric height to only [...] This was unsatisfactory and plans were made to reconstruct her again, but they were cancelled when the Germans attacked in 1941.|$|E
500|$|Parizhskaya Kommuna was {{refitted}} in 1928 {{in preparation}} for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet {{the next year and}} she was given an open-topped false bow to improve her <b>sea-keeping</b> ability. However, while en route through the Bay of Biscay, she was caught in a heavy storm that damaged the bow and she was forced to put into Brest for repairs. Marat {{was the first of the}} class to be reconstructed between 1928 and 8 April 1931. Her superstructure was enlarged, her guns were replaced, the turrets overhauled, the anti-aircraft armament augmented and the fire-control equipment modernized. Her boilers were converted to burn only fuel oil and this produced enough steam that the forward three boilers could be removed and the boiler room was turned into anti-aircraft magazines and control spaces. The forward funnel was angled to the rear and extended to try to keep the exhaust out of the gunnery spaces and the bridge. She was also given a false bow, but hers had a solid top that turned it into a forecastle. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was the next ship to be rebuilt and profited from the experiences of her sister's modernization between 1931 and 1934. All twenty-five of her old boilers were replaced by a dozen oil-fired boilers originally intended for the [...] Izmail. The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal watertight bulkhead that greatly improved her underwater protection. The rest of her modernization was along the same lines as Marats, except that the latter's tubular foremast was replaced by a sturdier semi-conical mast, a new aft structure was built in front of the rear conning tower which caused the mainmast to be moved forward, her forward funnel was curved to the rear to better keep the bridge clear of exhaust gases and the thickness of her turret roofs was increased to [...] Parizhskaya Kommuna began her two-stage reconstruction in 1933 along the lines of Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiyas modernization. Major differences were that her guns and turrets were improved to increase their rate of fire to about two rounds per minutes and to extend their range, she was the first ship of the class to receive light anti-aircraft guns and her forward funnel was given a more sinuous curve to direct its exhaust gases away from the forward superstructure. She completed these alterations in 1938, but was returned to the dockyard from December 1939 through July 1940 to receive a new armored deck and anti-torpedo bulges which cured her stability problems and greatly increased her underwater protection at a modest cost in speed.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} war, the {{squadron}} was recorded to have given assistance on 360 occasions. After the war, there was some experimentation with hovercraft, which were planned to be armed with several machine guns and capable of [...] Four hovercraft—with a crew of 18 each—would have been able to take on the duties of six minesweepers, each with a crew of 35. Because of the limited range and poor <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities of hovercraft, however, these plans were quickly abandoned in favour of regular craft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ships of}} the Arleigh Burke class {{are among the}} largest destroyers built in the United States. Only the , [...] (...) and [...] classes (...) are longer. The larger [...] ships were {{constructed}} on Spruance-class hull forms, but are designated as cruisers due to their radically different mission and weapons systems than the Spruance and Kidd-class destroyers. The Arleigh Burke class were designed with a new, large, water-plane area-hull form characterized by a wide flaring bow which significantly improves <b>sea-keeping</b> ability. The hull form is designed to permit high speed in high sea states.|$|E
2500|$|USCGC Seneca {{or before}} 1915, USRC Seneca was a U.S. Coast Guard cutter built and {{commissioned}} as a [...] "derelict destroyer" [...] {{with the specific}} mission of locating and then destroying abandoned shipwrecks that were still afloat and were a menace to navigation. She was designed with excellent <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities, a long cruising range, good towing capabilities, and by necessity the capacity to store {{a large amount of}} munitions. She was one of five Coast Guard cutters serving with the U.S. Navy in European waters during World War I.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Coles's designs, , was {{completed}} in August 1864. Its existing broadside guns were replaced with four turrets on a flat deck and the ship was fitted with [...] of armour in a belt around the waterline. Early ships like Monitor and the Royal Sovereign had little <b>sea-keeping</b> qualities being limited to coastal waters. Coles, in collaboration with Sir Edward James Reed, went on to design and build HMS Monarch, the first seagoing warship to carry her guns in turrets. Laid down in 1866 and completed in June 1869, it carried two turrets, although {{the inclusion of a}} forecastle and poop prevented the guns firing fore and aft.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, an {{independent}} {{review of the}} safety and functionality of the ship revealed that some operating limitations {{will have to be}} accepted, as <b>sea-keeping</b> performance is poor in high sea states. The [...] "selection of a commercial Roll-on, Roll-off (Ro-Ro) design" [...] has [...] "been at the root of differences of opinion between Tenix, the Ministry of Defence and New Zealand Defence Force and the shortfalls in performance". The issues included that the propellers can come out of the water when the ship pitches in rough seas, with concern that this may affect the ship's machinery. The report also recommended relocating the ship's boats (or protecting them from waves if relocation was not possible) and adding more ballast or improving the ballasting system of Canterbury.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hull of the}} Hatsuharu-class vessels {{retained}} the general configuration of the Fubuki-class destroyers with a long forecastle and a pronounced flare of the forecastle to improve <b>sea-keeping</b> at high speeds by adding buoyancy and reducing the spray and water coming over the deck. A large bridge structure was located at the aft end of the forecastle deck topped by four fire control stations of various types. Lowest, just above the compass bridge, was the torpedo director (Hassha shikisho), with the gunnery fire direction station (Shageki shikisho) next above. The fire director tower (Hōiban shagekito) was third from the bottom and behind it was the [...] rangefinder. Each of these was protected by [...] plates of Dücol steel against strafing and shell splinters.|$|E
2500|$|Uragan was {{accepted}} on 16 December 1930 for sea trials.

She was also top-heavy which reduced her stability and <b>sea-keeping</b> abilities. She was proved capable of [...] during her trials, but [...] was her normal top speed. This was primarily because her boilers had been designed only deliver enough steam for her turbines, nothing was in reserve to power her steam-driven auxiliary machinery. And since her turbines drew 5-6% more steam than specified and her auxiliary machinery had to be powered there simply wasn't enough steam to power her turbines at their designed output.
