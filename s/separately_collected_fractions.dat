40|$|In my Graduation Thesis I {{deal with}} the problem of {{collecting}} and disposing of communal waste in Šentjernej municipality. I represent introducing of and setting up a system of separately collecting communal waste fractions, setting up locations for separate fractions collectors, building up collecting & recycling centre and a system of control over the contractor. It is important that in these maters, the existing legislation and law directives in the Republic of Slovenia and also the directives from the European Union are followed. One of the procedures for reducing the quantities of disposed waste is separate collecting of communal waste fractions at source. The advantage of this system is that the waste is more or less pure at source, therefore we can achieve the best quantity and quality of <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> <b>fractions</b> and the cost for further recycling is lower. In separate fraction collectors we separately collect: paper, glass, plastic and metal. With this approach of collecting waste we significantly reduce the quantity of disposed waste and also get secondary raw materials. There are 19 separate fractions collectors and one collecting & recycling centre planned on the area of Šentjernej municipality. Separate collecting of communal waste fractions on source is being carried out not only {{for the benefit of the}} present generation, but also for the benefit of the next generations. It is important that we properly introduce the system of separately collecting communal waste fractions as well as encourage environmental awareness for both will bring long-term financial benefits and a better culture of living to inhabitants of Šentjernej municipality...|$|E

Considering the scarce residual capacity of landfills, the Piemonte Region has imposed to reach the 50 % of source separation by 2011 in order to cover the needs until the start up of the incinerator. As it has been already registered in some cases, the target can be reached only with a door to door modality of source separation.

The two substrates used in the experiments were the mechanically selected organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and a blend of mechanically selected and <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> organic <b>fraction</b> of municipal solid wastes. Two transient conditions were studied: the mesophilic-thermophilic passage and the increase of the organic loading rate in thermophilic conditions. It was shown that enhanced fractions of biodegradable substrates determined a greater perturbation of the system and needed longer time to reach a new stable condition. The volatile fatty acids concentration and their indirect measure, alkalinity determined upon pH 4, was the more useful parameter to understand the process behaviour because of its sensitivity to the process variations...|$|R

40|$|Biowaste, the <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> organic <b>fraction</b> of {{municipal}} solid waste, can be reused for soil conditioning after composting. In this way, environmentally harmful waste management strategies, such as landfilling or incineration, can be reduced. However, frequent application of composts to soil systems {{may lead to}} the accumulation of heavy metals in soils, and therefore legal criteria were laid down in a decree to guarantee the safe use of composts. The heavy metal content of biowaste-composts frequently exceeds the legal standards, and thus raises a conflict between two governmental policies: the recycling of solid waste on the one hand, and the protection of natural ecosystems and public health on the other hand. In this study, the heavy metal content (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) of biowaste was compared with the natural background content of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the different constituents of biowaste. For this, the physical entities of biowaste were physically fractionated by wet-sieving and subsequent water-elutriation. In this way, organic and inorganic fractions of different particle sizes were obtained and the content of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn and the organic matter content of the different fractions were determined. On the basis of particle size, density and visual appearance, the particle-size fractions were assigned to various indoor and outdoor origins of the biowaste. It was found that a large amount of biowaste was not organic, but over 50 as made up of soil minerals due to the collection of biowaste constituents from gardens. The heavy metal content of the various fractions in biowaste was compared with the natural background contents of heavy metals in the constituents of biowaste, i. e. food products, plant material, soil organic matter and soil minerals, by collecting literature data. The heavy metal content in the fractionated physical entities of biowaste corresponded with the natural background concentration of its constituents and indicated that biowaste was not contaminated by other sources. However, the natural background content of biowaste constituents will result in heavy metal contents for biowaste-compost that will exceed the legal standards. It is advised that the legal standards for composts should be critically re-examined. The protection of soil systems could be better guaranteed if the input of heavy metals was evaluated for all inputs of fertilisers and soil conditioners, i. e. animal manures, various types of compost and artificial fertilisers...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} strategies aiming at increasing household source-separation of food waste were assessed through a case-study in a Swedish residential area (a) use of written information, distributed as leaflets amongst households and (b) installation of equipment for source-segregation of waste {{with the aim}} of increasing convenience food waste sorting in kitchens. Weightings of <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> food waste before and after distribution of written information suggest that this resulted in neither a significant increased amount of <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> food waste, nor an increased source-separation ratio. After installation of sorting equipment in households, both the amount of <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> food waste as well as the source-separation ratio increased vastly. Long-term monitoring shows that results where longstanding. Results emphasize the importance of convenience and existence of infrastructure necessary for source-segregation of waste as important factors for household waste recycling, but also highlight the need of addressing these aspects where waste is generated, i. e. already inside the household...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{can sustain}} {{high levels of}} {{employment}} and income, but the sector {{is a source of}} environmental and health impacts. One of the most important is the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW). However, {{there is a lack of}} studies which quantify how much the tourist population engages in total MSW and <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> recyclables. The aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of the tourist population on MSW, both total and <b>separately</b> <b>collected,</b> for the period 1998 - 2010, for the Mediterranean island of Menorca (Spain). We use dynamic regressions models, including data for monthly stocks of tourists. The results show that, on average, a 1 % increase in the tourist population in Menorca causes an overall MSW increase of 0. 282 % and one more tourist in Menorca generates 1. 31 kg day(- 1) (while one more resident generates 1. 48 kg day(- 1)). This result could be useful to better estimate the seasonal population of different regions, since intrannual fluctuation of MSW is used as a proxy measure of actual population (the sum of residents and tourists). Moreover, an increase of 1 % in the tourist population causes an increase of 0. 232 % in <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> recyclables and an additional tourist generates 0. 160 kg day(- 1). One resident selectively collects on average 47. 3 % more than one tourist. These results can help in the planning of waste infrastructure and waste collection services in tourist areas...|$|R

40|$|Separate {{collection}} of biowaste represents in Portugal only 2 % of total collected biowaste. Even though higher quality compost {{can be obtained}} through the separate {{collection of}} biowaste, this is generally regarded as more expensive and discarded as an option. In this work we assessed the viability of implementing the separate collection of biowaste targeting restaurants and canteens in city centers, using Aveiro as a case study. The current situation (no separate collection for biowaste) was compared with an alternative scenario in which biowaste was <b>separately</b> <b>collected</b> and valorized. The costs, constrains and the producers' attitude towards such a collection scheme are presented and discussed. On average 0. 46 kg of biowaste were produced per meal served. The acceptance of separate biowaste collection was high (67 %) among producers, {{and it could be}} increased further through informative campaigns and economic incentives such as pay-as-you-throw tariffs. Door-to-door collection of biowaste could reduce the cost per ton as much as 37 %, when compared to collection as unsorted waste.
