5|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} excavated {{from the}} acropolis {{date from the}} transition from the Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace. Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic. In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings. Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses. One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard. Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha. A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments. In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered. Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds. Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct. Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis, together with <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> and pieces of animal bones.|$|E
25|$|Group Q6-2 {{consists}} of structures laid out around three {{sides of a}} courtyard, with the fourth side left open. The group is located fairly close to Group A. Occupation at the group was fairly high status and {{was limited to the}} Late Classic. The architecture was built from well-cut stones, the buildings had rooms with benches and stucco floors. The group appears to have been the residence of artisans producing luxury and ritual stone items for the elite. Large quantities of stone waste together with flint hammers were found on top of the low southern platform, Structure Q6-9, which had on this evidence been identified as a stone workshop. Burial 4 in the Structure Q6-8 {{on the west side of}} the group contained a large amount of waste <b>stone</b> <b>chippings.</b> The ritual involved in depositing stone upon the burial was common among the elite in the Petexbatún region but Burial 4 is the only known burial where this rite was performed in a non-elite setting in the whole region. Excavators recovered a whole eccentric flint in a rubbish deposit to the north of Structure Q6-8.|$|E
5000|$|Littlehampton's port {{is based}} around the River Arun, which opens onto the English Channel. A small stretch of this, 5 miles {{out to sea}} and 6 miles wide, is locally known as the [...] "Littlehampton Channel". Littlehampton started as a fishing port but now is a {{thriving}} port for thousands of leisure craft which visit {{from all over the}} UK and Europe. In 2009, use of leisure craft at Littlehampton rose to the extent that at least 200 more moorings were required. Littlehampton is also a commercial port, handling around 50-60 ships a year from Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France with cargo including marine aggregates, <b>stone,</b> marble <b>chippings</b> and timber. From the early 1920s David Hillyard built yachts in Littlehampton, and the company of David Hillyard Ltd continued here until 2009 [...] producing a total of over 850 yachts.|$|R
500|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney {{in particular and}} Scotland north of Inverness in general. [...] "Lithic scatter" [...] sites at Seatter, South Ettit, Wideford Hill, Valdigar and Loch of Stenness have produced small polished <b>stone</b> tools and <b>chippings.</b> A charred hazelnut shell, recovered during the excavations at Longhowe in Tankerness in 2007, has been dated to 6820-6660 BC. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest whether or not these sites were in year-round occupation and no Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered anywhere in Scotland to date.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the monitoring {{and the experience}} of two full scale trials with surface dressing. In one of them modified emulsion was tested on the primary road 84 between Kasteln-Laforsen in the county Hälsingland in the north of Sweden. The test sections were produced during year 2001. A second full scale trial test was carried through during year 2004 with the purpose to optimise the utilizing of the <b>stone</b> aggregate (<b>chippings)</b> with different types of fractions 4 - 8, 4 - 16 and 8 - 16 mm. This trial was carried through on the secondary road 723 between Heden and Färila also in the county Hälsingland. In addition to testing different types of binders, the effect of breaking additive was studied in the respects of how soon the surface dressing could be swept from excess of loose stones after the surface treatment was carried out and the time of the year the surface treatment was carried out. The test sections have been monitored with respect to macro texture, rut depth, longitudinal evenness and noise emission as well as by visual inspections of damages and defects. In addition to this the laboratory testing of the wear resistance and the testing of the sensibility to the effect of water have been carried out. For this purpose a modified laboratory test method (Prall method), for surface dressing, has been used. During the production phase of the surface dressing some advantages were noticed by the use of polymer modified bitumen emulsion {{with the addition of a}} breaking additive. In principle the method is to inject the breaking additive into the emulsion just before spreading of the bituminous emulsion on the road. The stone aggregate was fixed to the road surface after a relatively short time which made it possible to sweep the surface treatment from the excess of loose stones after a few hours after the production of the surface treatment. Modified bitumen emulsion combined with the breaking additive showed consequently positive effects for the road users through better accessibility and a less risk of loose stones damaging the vehicles...|$|R

2500|$|Applying gravel, or [...] "metalling," [...] {{has had two}} {{distinct}} usages in road surfacing.

60|$|Here one observes a {{difference}} underfoot from {{what has gone}} before: scraps of Roman tile and <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> protrude through the grass in meagre quantity, but sufficient to suggest that masonry stood on the spot. Before the eye stretches under the moonlight {{the interior of the}} fort. So open and so large is it as to be practically an upland plateau, and yet its area lies wholly within the walls of what may be designated as one building. It is a long-violated retreat; all its corner-stones, plinths, and architraves were carried away to build neighbouring villages even before mediaeval or modern history began. Many a block which once may have helped to form a bastion here rests now in broken and diminished shape as part of the chimney-corner of some shepherd's cottage within the distant horizon, and the corner-stones of this heathen altar may form the base-course of some adjoining village church.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the tramroads was 3ft 4in, {{and it was}} {{constructed}} of edge rails of a plain cross-section 2 inches wide at the head and [...] inches wide at the base, and three inches deep. The wagon wheels were double flanged, straddling the rail. Cast iron sleepers maintained the gauge, and these were supported on square wooden blocks laid on <b>stone</b> <b>chippings.</b> There were no passing places on the single line tramroads: empty wagons were manhandled off the track to allow loaded wagons to pass them.|$|E
50|$|Modern cold applied liquid {{membranes}} {{have been}} durability rated by the British Board of Agreement (BBA) for 30 years. BBA approval is a benchmark {{in determining the}} suitability of a particular fiberglass roofing system. If standard fiberglass polyester resin is used such as the same resin used in boat repairs, {{then there will be}} problems with the roof being too inflexible and not able to accommodate expansion and contraction of the building. A fit-for-purpose flexible/elastomeric resin system used as a waterproofing membrane will last for many years with just occasional inspection needed. The fact that such membranes do not require <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> to deflect heat means there is no risk of stones blocking drains. Liquid applied membranes are also naturally resistant to moss and lichen.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{was based}} on sedimented shale and has an {{internal}} impervious core of organic clays (grass sods). During renovation work about 70 cm of the surface layer on the old downstream face was removed and replaced by layers of shale material. That {{was covered with a}} 10 cm thick layer of topsoil sown with grass seed. On the upstream side, 60 cm was removed and on a 30 cm thick layer of <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> a similarly thick protective layer of ballast. The dam was also raised in height by about 1 metre. After removing 90 cm of the old dam crest, a metre-wide toe wall was integrated from the subgrade (Planum). This extends as far as the cohesive earth material of the old dam core.|$|E
50|$|This {{building}} {{dates from}} around 700 BC (in the Preclassic Period) and measures 80 meters by 50 meters. A monolithic stone basin measuring 1.3 meters across and 60 cm high is found {{on top of}} the structure. A mutilated stela was deposited inside, bearing the carving of a snakes fangs and forked tongue. To the north of this were found two stone sculptures; one of a man dressed as a jaguar and the other of a man with pronounced forehead and lips holding a sceptre or staff in his right hand. A room was built at ground level against {{the west side of the}} Serpent Building. Large amounts of worked obsidian were found in the northeast corner of this building, indicating that it was probably used as a workshop. Items found include cores, <b>stone</b> <b>chippings,</b> knives, projectile points and scrapers as well as bone tools and antlers. Associated ceramic remains were used to date these finds to the Late Preclassic (350 BC - 100 AD).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{range of}} glass-based {{structures}} of various constructions and thicknesses {{have been subjected}} to impact loading by <b>stone</b> <b>chippings</b> similar to those found on the roadside. The failure modes have been examined in an attempt to elucidate the failure mechanisms and processes in these systems. Initial tests generated radial and lateral cracking at velocities well above that required to initiate damage; this form of cracking was not observed again since attention was focused on the critical velocity for damage initiation. Thinner structures were found to fail primarily by star cracking, a flexure induced rear surface failure. Thicker structures generally failed by partial cone cracking, a contact induced front surface failure. The addition of a polymeric layer to the glass monolith had no effect on the failure mechanisms, while the addition of an inner layer of glass (yielding a laminated construction) had a secondary influence on the impact resistance of the structure. This was clearly apparent for intermediate outer glass thicknesses, where an increase in the inner glass thickness causes the stiffness of the panel to increase sufficiently to alter the failure mode and thus cause an increase in the critical velocity for damage initiation...|$|E
