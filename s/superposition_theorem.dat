The {{hierarchical}} <b>superposition</b> based <b>theorem</b> proving cal-culus of Bachmair, Ganzinger, and Waldmann {{enables the}} hierarchic {{combination of a}} theory with full first-order logic. If a clause set of the combination enjoys a sufficient completeness criterion, the calculus is even complete. We instantiate the calculus for the theory of linear arith-metic. In particular, we develop new effective versions for the standard superposition redundancy criteria taking the linear arithmetic theory into account. The resulting calculus is implemented in SPASS(LA) and extends {{the state of the}} art in proving properties of first-order formulas over linear arithmetic. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} in situ toughened, Al, B and C containing, silicon carbide {{ceramics}} (ABC-SiC) has been examined with Al contents varying from 3 to 7 wt%. With increasing Al additions, the grain morphology in the as-processed microstructures varied from elongated to bimodal to equiaxed, {{with a change}} {{in the nature of the}} grain-boundary film from amorphous to partially crystalline to fully crystalline. Fracture toughness and cyclic fatigue tests on these microstructures revealed that although the 7 wt. % Al containing material (7 ABC) was extremely brittle, the 3 and particularly 5 wt. % Al materials (3 ABC and 5 ABC, respectively) displayed excellent crack-growth resistance at both ambient (25 C) and elevated (1300 C) temperatures. Indeed, no evidence of creep damage, in the form of grain-boundary cavitation, was seen at temperatures at 1300 C or below. The enhanced toughness of the higher Al-containing materials was associated with extensive crack bridging from both interlocking grains (in 3 ABC) and uncracked ligaments (in 5 ABC); in contrast, the 7 ABC SiC showed no such bridging, concomitant with a marked reduction in the volume fraction of elongated grains. Mechanistically, cyclic fatigue-crack growth in 3 ABC and 5 ABC SiC involved the progressive degradation of such bridging ligaments in the crack wake, with the difference in the degree of elastic vs. frictional bridging affecting the slope, i. e., Paris law exponent, of the crack-growth curve. In addition an investigation of fracture resistance in non-transforming ceramics toughened by grain bridging mechanism is presented using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Linear <b>superposition</b> <b>theorems</b> are used for the superposition of crack opening displacements, as well as stress intensity factors, resulting from the external tractions and the internal compressive bridging stresses. Specifically weight functions are used to relate the CODs, stress intensity factors, and tractions and the bridging stress. Expressions are derived for apparent material resistance, the bridging resistance and the intrinsic toughness, and an experimental procedure is proposed by which these predictions can be verified...|$|R

The analyses of quantum systems and their interpretation lead to many surprises, for example, the ability to detect the characteristics of an object without ever touching it in any way, via "interaction-free measurement," or the teleportation of an atomic state over large distances. The results can become downright bizarre. Quantum mechanics is a subtle subject that usually involves complicated mathematics [...] calculus, partial differential equations, etc., for complete understanding. Most texts for general audiences avoid all mathematics. The {{result is that the}} reader misses almost all deep understanding of the subject, much of which can be probed with just high-school level algebra and trigonometry. Thus, readers with that level of mathematics can learn so much more about this fundamental science.
