5|$|Nighttime levels feature slower-paced, action-oriented levels, {{in which}} Sonic {{transforms}} into the Werehog, a beast form that has great strength and <b>stretchable</b> arms. Gameplay here sees the player {{use a variety}} of melee and combo attacks to defeat large numbers of enemies, collect items, and move items around to advance through the level, and use his <b>stretchable</b> arms to cling to distant objects; simple puzzle elements are also featured. Collecting rings in these levels replenishes the Werehog's health, while a special move, Unleashed Mode, allows the Werehog to channel his energy into increasing the power of his attacks for a short time. Nighttime levels are adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote, such that players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in order to grab onto objects and proceed in the levels. The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of nighttime levels to daytime, with more than three times as many nighttime levels (twenty-five in all). After nighttime levels are completed, Dark Gaia Points are gained, allowing access to bonus moves.|$|E
25|$|Different {{devices have}} been {{developed}} {{in an effort to}} assist waitstaff in stabilising the service trays. Inventors have tried techniques such as attaching finger knobs/hubs (1998) and removable hand posts (2010) that protrude from the underside of the tray. They also tried the use of finger insertion holes in the tray to stabilize the tray. To restrain the hand to the underside of the tray, inventors have looked into devices such as a hand panel allowing insertion of two fingers of a hand (1985), a separately-fingered digit forward-retention device (1999), and a <b>stretchable</b> strap that forms a loop into which the user's fingers are inserted (2003).|$|E
25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, <b>stretchable</b> water {{resistant}} translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from <b>stretchable</b> material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E
500|$|An elastic force acts {{to return}} a spring to its natural length. An ideal spring is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and {{infinitely}} <b>stretchable.</b> Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, or pull when extended, {{in proportion to the}} displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. This linear relationship was described by Robert Hooke in 1676, for whom Hooke's law is named. If [...] is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals: ...|$|E
500|$|Comics scholar Jeet Heer called Rarebit Fiend [...] "perhaps {{the most}} bizarre {{newspaper}} feature in American history". [...] Merkl notes examples of the strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another woman out a window, as in Luis Buñuel's film L'Age d'Or (1930); and giant characters let loose in the big city, climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in King Kong (1933). [...] Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child's bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 Ray Bradbury story [...] "The Veldt", and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a <b>stretchable</b> face, to Salvador Dalí's surrealist painting Soft self-portrait with fried bacon (1941) and the cosmetic surgeries in Terry Gilliam's Brazil.

2500|$|Like other clothing, bras were {{initially}} sewn by small production companies and supplied to various retailers. The term [...] "cup" [...] {{was not used}} to describe bras until 1916, and manufacturers relied on <b>stretchable</b> cups to accommodate different sized breasts. Women with larger or pendulous breasts had the choice of long-line bras, built-up backs, wedge-shaped inserts between the cups, wider straps, power Lastex, firm bands under the cup, and even light boning.|$|E
2500|$|The game stars an {{anthropomorphic}} cartoon {{star who}} uses {{his hands and}} long, <b>stretchable</b> arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, [...] Sega has re-released the game {{a number of times}} digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties. In August 2017, the game was re-released digitally on the Sega Forever line of releases for mobile devices.|$|E
2500|$|Ristar plays as a 2D sidescrolling platformer, {{similar to}} {{games in the}} Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog series of video games, but {{focusing}} less on jumping and speed, {{and more on the}} use of Ristar's <b>stretchable</b> arms, which can reach in 8 different main directions. The player must maneuver Ristar through the level to its end, while avoiding damage from obstacles and enemies. Ristar's extendable arms are used as the main means of attacking enemies; through extending his arms, grabbing the enemy, and pulling himself towards them into a [...] "headbutt" [...] motion to defeat them. The same motion also allows for opening treasure chests containing various items, or striking different parts of the environment, such as knocking trees over. Additionally, his elastic arms can merely be used for grabbing and/or throwing objects as well.|$|E
2500|$|Vulcanization {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the <b>stretchable</b> substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|E
2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a {{hook and loop}} fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a protective padding of roll cotton or a premade quilted pad. [...] The bandage is started {{on the outside of}} the leg, in the middle of the cannon bone, then wrapped down to either the fetlock or the hoof, depending on the purpose for which it is used, then back up to just under the knee, then back to the center of the cannon just above the starting point, ending {{on the outside of the}} leg. [...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable <b>stretchable</b> wrap that sticks to itself, or with washable fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a hook and loop closure. [...] Bandages may also be taped with medical tape to help them stay on.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stretchable</b> {{electronics}}, {{also known}} as elastic electronics or elastic circuits, is a technology for building electronic circuits by depositing <b>stretchable</b> electronic devices and circuits onto <b>stretchable</b> substrates or embed them completely in a <b>stretchable</b> material such as silicones or polyurethanes. In the simplest case, <b>stretchable</b> electronics {{can be made by}} using the same components used for rigid printed circuit boards. One of the things that need to change is the substrate and the interconnections, being made , rather than flexible (see Flexible electronics) or rigid (Printed Circuit Boards). Typically, polymers are chosen as substrates or material to embed. When rigid components are deposited onto <b>stretchable</b> substrates, the interconnects will be subjected to high mechanical strain whenever the substrate is flexed. This is because, when bending the substrate, the outermost radius of the bend will stretch so that the relative spacing of each interconnect will effectively increase in line with the increasing length of the substrate. <b>Stretchable</b> electronics attempts biomimicry of human skin and flesh, in being <b>stretchable,</b> whilst retaining full functionality. The design space for products is opened up with <b>stretchable</b> electronics. 3D conformable circuits are now possible by the application of <b>stretchable</b> cyber-skins comprising elastomeric carrier substrates populated with <b>stretchable</b> conductors and devices.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{commonly}} used <b>stretchable</b> energy storage device {{is based on}} active materials for double-layer supercapacitors are carbon-based materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface areas. The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for <b>stretchable</b> supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart stretchability to the devices. Most recent study by Li et al. shows the fully functionality of the <b>stretchable</b> supercapacitor under dynamic charging and discharging, for the first time, which is composed of both elastic PDMS substrates, buckled SWCNTs macrofilm and elastomeric separators. Although achieving excellent cycling stability, however, the key drawback of this <b>stretchable</b> energy storage based on supercapacitor technology is the low specific capacitance and energy density and this can potentially be improved by the incorporation of redox materials, for example the SWNT/MnO2 electrode. Another approach to creating <b>stretchable</b> energy storage device {{is the use of}} Origami folding principle. The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and bendability.
