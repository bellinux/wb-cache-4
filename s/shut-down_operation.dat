The trace amount 0. 08 wt% of Pt doping efficiently suppressed the nickel particle sintering and improved the nickel oxides reducibility. The prepared Ni-Pt catalyst showed excellent performance during steam reforming of methane, kerosene and ethanol under both 3000 h stationary and 500 -time daily start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operation</b> modes. Self-activation ability of this catalyst was evidenced, which {{was considered to}} be resulted from the hydrogen spillover effect over Ni-Pt alloy.

40|$|Flaring {{emissions}} during abnormal {{operating conditions}} such as plant start-ups, shut-downs, and upsets in chemical process industries (CPI) are usually significant. Flare minimization can help to save raw material and energy for CPI plants, and to improve local environmental sustainability. In this paper, a systematic methodology based on plant-wide dynamic simulation is presented for CPI plant flare minimizations under abnormal operating conditions. Since off-specification emission sources are inevitable during abnormal operating conditions, to significantly reduce flaring emission in a CPI plant, they must be either recycled to the upstream process for online reuse, or stored somewhere temporarily for future reprocessing, when the CPI plant manufacturing returns to stable operation. Thus, the off-spec products could be reused instead of being flared. This can be achieved through the identification of viable design and operational strategies during normal and abnormal operations through plant-wide dynamic scheduling, simulation, and optimization. The proposed study includes three stages of simulation works: (i) developing and validating a steady-state model of a CPI plant; (ii) transiting the obtained steady-state plant model to the dynamic modeling environment; and refining and validating the plant dynamic model; and (iii) developing flare minimization strategies for abnormal operating conditions of a CPI plant via a validated plant-wide dynamic model. This cost-effective methodology has two main merits: (i) employing large-scale dynamic modeling and simulations for industrial flare minimization, which involves various unit models for modeling hundreds of CPI plant facilities; (ii) dealing with critical abnormal operating conditions of CPI plants such as plant start-up and shut-down. Two virtual case studies on flare minimizations for start-up operation (over 50 % of emission savings) and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operation</b> (over 70 % of emission savings) of an ethylene plant have been employed to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} proposed study...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{emissions}} of various industrial facilities under start-up, <b>shut-down,</b> and normal <b>operations.</b> The industries {{that have been}} investigated include power and/or heat generation, energy-from-waste generation, nuclear power generation, sulphuric acid production, ethylene production, petrochemical production, and waste incineration. The study investigated multiple facilities worldwide {{for each of these}} industrial categories. The different potential contaminants characteristic of each industry type have been investigated and the emissions of these contaminants under non-steady state have been compared to the steady state emissions. Where available, trends have been developed to identify the circumstances, i. e., the industrial sector and contaminant, under which the assessment and consideration of emissions from start-up and shut-down events is necessary for each industry. These trends differ by industrial sector and contaminant. For example, the study shows that sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions should be assessed for the start-up operations of sulphuric acid production plants, but may not need to be assessed for the start-up operations of a conventional power generation facility. The trends developed as part of this research paper will help air permit applicants to effectively allocate their resources when assessing emissions related to non-steady state operations. Additionally, it will ensure that emissions are assessed for the worst-case scenario. This is especially important when emissions under start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations</b> have the potential to exceed enforceable emission limits. Thus, assessing emissions for the worst-case scenario can help in preventing the emissions from adversely impacting public health and the environment...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{degradation}} of environmentally friendly lubricants prevents {{the spread of}} its utilisation in industrial applications. This process can be promoted by frictional heating occurred during accidental contacts of moving parts or star-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations.</b> The use of low friction coatings, like diamond-like carbon (DLC), can offer a solution to these problems. Their low friction properties, high wear resistance and excellent corrosion resistance can prevent the occurrence of such local heat spikes, which will protect the lubricant and hence prolong the lifetime of the tribological system. In this work, a synthetic bio-lubricant has been evaluated and compared with a mineral oil. Combinations with pure and Ti doped DLC coatings were taken into account. In {{order to have a}} proper evaluation of the tribosystem a wide range of conditions have been considered in high frequency reciprocating and unidirectional tests. The Stribeck curve at variable sliding speeds and loads was obtained. In steel/steel contacts friction is clearly lower when synthetic oil is used compared to a mineral based oil, which is not always true with DLC/DLC contacts. As a result of the tribotesting, the best combination of materials was. chosen in order to be validated in a real system (mechanical component in a machine tool), where results confirmed our expectations.

40|$|Asymmetric loading/unloading {{profiles}} {{during the}} start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations</b> of {{high pressure high temperature}} pipelines may cause an accumulated axial displacement over several operational cycles known as Pipeline Walking phenomenon. This pipeline walking can {{be triggered by}} several factors e. g. the seabed slope, riser tension and thermal transients. Several studies have been carried out in the literature regarding the influence from individual factors; nevertheless, very little has been made in the evaluation of coupled triggering mechanisms, common for a pipeline segment. This paper investigates the pipeline walking phenomenon using finite element modelling and analysis software SAGE Profile 3 D versus standard analytical formulae. The keys aims are (i) to study the interaction and coupling between the walking triggering mechanisms by comparing coupled and uncoupled analyses, and (ii) to compare the obtained numerical results with analytical predictions, commonly used in the subsea industry. Depending on the pipeline and soil properties, the effect of triggering mechanisms is parametrically investigated with varying pipeline tension and seabed slope for a specific thermal gradient profile. It is found that the common approach to sum up the individual walking rate by the uncoupled analysis for a combination of any two triggering mechanisms, underestimates the walking phenomenon when compared with the coupled analysis. This highlights how attention must be paid to the interaction mechanism. In addition, this study emphasizes that the analytical models severely overestimate the pipeline walking phenomenon, especially when more than one triggering mechanisms are present...|$|R

To account for their functionality in transient cycle simulations, including the highly transient start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations,</b> different capillary tube models and their implementation {{in such a}} cycle are investigated. These non-adiabatic capillary tube models comprise dimensionless correlations, neural network methods and one-dimensional homogeneous models which stem partly from open literature and from previous work of the authors. The difficulty in application of capillary models during off-design conditions is when two phase flow or even superheated vapor which enters the capillary tube. These conditions {{are not covered by}} most of the schemes. In this work a transient cycle simulation {{including a}} 1 d formulation of the heat exchangers and a semi-empirical compressor model serves as virtual test bench for several capillary tube models. The range of parameters is chosen according to the need of domestic applications using R 600 a - mass flow rates range between 0 and 5 kg/h at inlet pressures up to 10 bar. The comparison of different implementation strategies is carried out in terms of speed, accuracy and stability in off-design. The predictability of the models is evaluated by steady state experimental data from literature and own experiments as well as an in-house 1 d model for the regions where no measurements exist. It is concluded that the direct implementation of the 1 d code bears the disadvantage of low speed, whereas common dimensionless correlations lose accuracy off its design point.

Abradable seals are a highly adaptable, widely applicable and cheap method of improving seal performance. By retrofitting abradable coatings to existing labyrinth seals, improvements {{in the range of}} 0. 5 % - 1 % power output are seen with cost returns within two years [1]. The intention of this investigation was to develop fundamental understanding of the seal degradation process. A Multi Oxidation and Incursion Steam Test (MOIST) rig was designed from concept, through detailed design and finally commissioned. During commissioning the capabilities of the MOIST rig were defined. Although flowing steam operation was not achieved during this investigation, a theoretically proofed steam system is in place for future development. High temperature operation was achieved, although not reliably. Reliable, repeatable atmospheric tests were developed, representative of the start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations</b> of an industrial steam turbine. These tests produced relative velocities up to 121 ms- 1 between coatings and blades, and incursion rates up to 50 μms- 1. ST 12 T, Nimonic 80 A and Nimonic 101 blade materials were tested against a bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating. The results suggest that the bentonite-NiCrAl abradable coating tested was highly suitable as an abradable coating for all blade materials. Additionally, high temperature tests are necessary to fully prove {{the use of}} blade materials against coating systems. Simultaneously, non-MOIST rig oxidation testing was performed in the range of 580 ˚C - 800 ˚C in static air and 580 ˚C in flowing steam for exposure times up to 5000 hrs. Bentonite-NiCrAl top coat - NiAl bond coat and either a STG- 9 T or IN 625 substrate were analysed to devise mechanistic models for the oxidation of the top coat, bond coat, substrate and all associated interfaces.

In 1991 a rapid regional link was in operation between Hof and Nuremberg using tilting trains of Class 610, which were also heavily used by passengers changing from Saxony and Thuringia. Interregio connexions between Stuttgart and Dresden (via Nuremberg, Hof and Chemnitz, the Saxon-Franconian trunk line) as well as Munich and Berlin (via Regensburg, Hof and Leipzig) were introduced and the pair of night trains from Munich to Berlin and Stuttgart to Dresden met daily in both directions at Hof and exchanged through coaches.

After {{the withdrawal of the}} ICE-TD trains the Nuremberg-Dresden line was downgraded initially to an InterCity route again, using Class 612 trains. In 2006 however these were replaced by regional trains that plied between Nuremberg and Hof as well as Hof and Dresden and forced passengers to change at Hof. Likewise, the Interregio line, Munich-Berlin, was reduced to a regional service (with changes at Regensburg, Hof and Leipzig, and frequent stops), which actually led to a growth in passenger traffic on the ICE line Munich-Nuremberg-Bamberg-Leipzig-Berlin, but meant long waits for passengers in north-east Bavaria, because to get to Munich or Berlin a longer journey to Nuremberg or Bamberg was now needed. Meanwhile, a regional through express runs every three hours between Hof and Munich. Similarly, on the introduction of a <b>shut-down</b> of <b>operations</b> on the Marktredwitz-Regensburg route, the crossing point of the Munich-Berlin and Stuttgart-Dresden night train pairs was moved to Nuremberg.|$|R
40|$|Two RL 10 A- 3 - 3 A rocket engines {{comprise}} the {{main propulsion system}} for the Centaur upper stage vehicle. Centaur is used with bod Titan and Atlas launch vehicles, carrying military and civilian payloads from high altitudes into orbit and beyond. The RL 10 has delivered highly reliable service for the past 30 years. Recently, however, {{there have been two}} in-flight failures which have refocused attention on the RL 10. This heightened interest has sparked a desire for an independent RL 10 modeling capability within NASA and th Air Force. Pratt & Whitney, which presently has the most detailed model of the RL 10, also sees merit in having an independent model which {{could be used as a}} cross-check with their own simulations. The Space Propulsion Technology Division (SPTD) at the NASA Lewis Research Center has developed a computer model of the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 A. A project team was formed, consisting of experts in the areas of turbomachinery, combustion, and heat transfer. The overall goal of the project was to provide a model of the entire RL 10 rocket engine for government use. In the course of the project, the major engine components have been modeled using a combination of simple correlations and detailed component analysis tools (computer codes). The results of these component analyses were verified with data provided by Pratt & Whitney. Select modeling results and test data curves were then integrated to form the RL 10 engine system model The purpose of this report is to introduce the reader to the RL 10 rocket engine and to describe the engine system model. The RL 10 engine and its application to U. S. launch vehicles are described first, followed by a summary of the SPTD project organization, goals, and accomplishments. Simulated output from the system model are shown in comparison with test and flight data for start transient, steady state, and <b>shut-down</b> transient <b>operations.</b> Detailed descriptions of all component analyses, including those not selected for integration with the system model, are included as appendices...|$|R
40|$|Life {{assessment}} {{is of great}} importance to component repair and replacement scheduling of turbine systems which experience cyclic start-up and <b>shut-down</b> <b>operations</b> during their service lives. As vital parts where a severe stress concentration exists, the fir tree blade-disc interfaces are typically shot-peened. Their fatigue resistance {{is considered to be}} improved subsequently due to the surface compressive residual stress (CRS) field and strain hardening resulting from shot peening. However, current life assessment models are relatively conservative, merely considering shot peening as an additional safety factor rather than taking account of the benefits derived from the process. The objective of this research is to develop a life assessment method considering the effects of shot peening in the component lifing protocols. Successful development of this approach will achieve a more cost effective scheduling of repair or replacement of the assets while ensuring sufficient safety margins. In this study, a low pressure steam turbine material, FV 448, has been selected. The shot peening induced residual stress profiles as well as their evolution during fatigue loading were measured using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. In the modelling work, a 3 D finite element (FE) modelling approach has been developed to predict the residual stress relaxation behaviour during fatigue loading. Both the CRS and the strain hardening fields arising from shot peening have been reconstructed in the FE model as pre-defined conditions: The reconstruction of residual stresses was realised by the inverse eigenstrain approach. In this study, the application of this approach has been extended from a flat surface to a notched geometry. The strain hardening field was reconstructed by modifying the material parameters at different depths based on the shot peening induced plastic strain distribution, which was evaluated utilising an approach based on previous measurement of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) local misorientations. By allowing for both beneficial effects of shot peening, the simulated quasi-static residual stress relaxation occurring during the first cycle correlated well with corresponding experimental data. The retention of the CRS field in the notched sample during fatigue loading has been highlighted. The application of total life approaches in predicting the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of the shot-peened specimens has been investigated. The Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) and the Fatemi-Socie (FS) critical plane fatigue criteria have been selected in the present study. The developed FE models incorporating shot peening effects have been used to generate the stress and strain data required by the SWT and FS criteria. A good agreement between experiments and predictions was obtained using this FE-based approach. In addition, the FE analysis shows that the degree of the shot peening benefit in improving fatigue life can be reasonably related to the degree of the reduction in the mean stress level within the shot peening affected layer. The application of a critical distance method considering the stress and strain hardening gradients near the shotpeened surface has been found to effectively increase the accuracy of the life prediction. Damage tolerant approaches have also been employed to assess the fatigue life of the shot-peened notched specimens by predicting the short crack growth behaviour through the shot peening affected layer. This analysis was carried out using both 2 D and 3 D FE models containing a crack emanating from the notch root. The FE models have been upgraded from the models used to study the residual stress relaxation behaviour. The crack driving force has been appropriately characterised using both linear-elastic and elasto-plastic fracture mechanics (LEFM and EPFM), allowing for the effects of shot peening. An accurate quantification of the retardation of the short crack growth behaviour resulting from shot peening has been subsequently realised. Additionally, the associated crack shape evolution has also been predicted using the developed FE model, which explains the experimentally observed significant differences in crack shape evolution between varying surface conditions. The importance of taking the crack shape effects into account when evaluating the short crack growth behaviour has been emphasised. Overall, a FE tool has been developed in this study which has been demonstrated to be effective in analysing the benefits of shot peening in improving fatigue life. It also helps unveil the mechanism behind this life improvement, which contributes {{to the development of a}} robust and convenient lifing method that can be applied to shot-peened components and can be used to guide shot peening optimisation...|$|R
