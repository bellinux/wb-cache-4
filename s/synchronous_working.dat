The present paper describes the implementation of MGDs (teleporting, awareness and multiple views) and VT (the utterances of 23 previous users were embedded in a CVE as conversation tags), and their evaluation using an urban planning task. Compared with previous research using the same scenario, the new MGD techniques produced substantial increases in the amount that, and distance over which, participants communicated. With VT participants chose {{to listen to a}} quarter of the conversations of their predecessors while performing the task.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} for managing and delivering a global design class, and a clear alternative to the traditional joint project for participating institutes. The ‘task-based approach’ used to structure a Global Design class at the University of Strathclyde is described. This entailed {{the creation of a}} series of short design exercises to be run in conjunction with three partner institutions: the University of Malta in Msida, Malta; Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia; and Stanford University in Palo Alto, USA. These exercises focussed on specific aspects of distributed working, including <b>synchronous</b> <b>working,</b> asynchronous working and digital library support, according to the location and facilities afforded by each institution. This {{provides a}} number of pedagogical and organisation benefits. Students are required to take a more strategic approach to their design work, developing a higher evaluative understanding of the tools and processes required to produce a successful design. Staff members have a greater level of control afforded by a shared collaborative class component, including assessment, timetabling and learning objectives, rather than simply having a joint project. This potentially makes global design classes a more flexible and viable option for institutions interested in participating in such programme...|$|E
40|$|Using {{previously}} unexploited data on time scheduling in {{the employment}} and household contexts, we investigate {{the effect of}} flexible working on couples' coordination of their daily work time schedules in the UK. We consider three distinct dimensions of flexible working: flexibility of daily start and finish times (flexitime), flexibility of work times over the year (annualised hours), and generalised control of working hours. We find that in couples with flexitime there is greater spouse synchronization in daily working times by nearly one hour. The effect is driven by couples with dependent children. However, we find the effect in couples with children of any age (under 16), suggesting it does not stem from the childcare requirements of young children. Robustness checks indicate that flexitime is not endogenous, suggesting that an expansion of flexitime would increase couples' work time coordination. There is less evidence that broader control over working hours increases daily <b>synchronous</b> <b>working</b> time and no evidence that annualised hours increase synchronous time on a daily basis. The weaker relationships with daily synchronous time for these two flexibility measures are consistent with their broader scope (control over amount of hours as well as timing) and longer time span...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{advantage}} {{is taken from}} the particular characteristics of Enhancement-mode Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (E-pHEMT) devices {{for the design of}} synchronous rectifiers with an unbiased gate. Based on one of them, the design of a class E <b>synchronous</b> rectifier <b>working</b> in the 900 MHz frequency band, is proposed. A lumped-element multi-harmonic class E amplifier was first designed, exploiting the time-reversal dualily, to then introduce a drain-to-gate feedback and operate it in the desired synchronous rectifying mode. Competitive efficiency figures are demonstrated over a significant input power, frequency and load resistance range. An efficiency peak of 83 % has been measured at 17 dBm, staying above 70 % for a 14 dB input power range, a distinguishing characteristic when compared to Schottky diode based alternatives. The verified AM-AM conversion linearity would also allow using the rectifier for the efficient extraction of a time-varying excitation envelope without significant distortion...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} on <b>synchronous</b> remote <b>working</b> in CSCW has highlighted the troubles that can arise because actions at one site are (partially) unavailable to remote colleagues. Such ‘local action’ is routinely characterised as a nuisance, a distraction, subordinate and the like. This paper explores interconnections between ‘local action’ and ‘distributed work’ {{in the case}} of a research team virtually collocated through ‘MiMeG’. MiMeG is an e-Social Science tool that facilitates ‘distributed data sessions’ in which social scientists are able to remotely collaborate on the real-time analysis of video data. The data are visible and controllable in a shared workspace and participants are additionally connected via audio conferencing. The findings reveal that whilst the (partial) unavailability of local action is at times problematic, it is also used as a resource for coordinating work. The paper considers how local action is interactionally managed in distributed data sessions and concludes by outlining implications of the analysis for the design and study of technologies to support group-to-group collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Background Person-centred practice, which {{includes}} compassion, {{needs to be}} well facilitated in order to flourish in healthcare settings. Facilitation {{is known to be}} complex and requires expert knowing and skills. The importance of adequate facilitator support is recognised. The literature however is unclear about the nature of this support and how it can be offered to facilitators while engaging with others in real world practice contexts. Case description This paper presents a lived experience of a doctoral student working as a facilitator with clinical nurses and their leaders, to develop person-centred health care practice, through action research. Compassion with others and self is apparent throughout the experience. It illustrates a facilitator’s felt need to respond to this emotion that is triggered in the engagement with others, but which often is hindered by the context and perceptions of the situation. This causes imbalance within the facilitator, which in turn challenges the achievement of <b>synchronous</b> <b>working</b> with practitioners and the development of person-centred practice. Discussion A strong interplay between contextual and facilitator characteristics in the relationship with others impacts on the development of person-centredness in practice. Therefore compassion, as one of the attributes of person-centred practice, is fragile and fluid when lived in facilitative practice. A compassionate system of support is suggested to enable an understanding of context and self, in order to become and remain a person-centred, compassionate, facilitator in dynamic health care contexts. Conclusion A compassionate system of support has the potential to help professionals to navigate the context, without losing oneself, in the process of enabling person-centred, compassionate practice to thrive. Such support suggest an ‘ethic of care’ for the facilitator in discovering and engaging with the emotional context of facilitating person-centred practice...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Neonatal neurobehavioral {{organization}} is a multidimensional holistic phenomenon which involves <b>synchronous</b> <b>working</b> of autonomic, sensory and motor systems {{to influence the}} developmental maturation of neonates. Homeostasis of all these systems is well developed in term infants but preterm infants due to their physiological instability, incomplete cortical development are at higher risk of impaired neurobehavioral organisation. Neurobehavioral maturity of term infants has been documented in many studies but there is dearth of literature in preterm infants especially moderate to late preterm (MLP) category (32 weeks – 36 weeks of gestation). Thus {{the present study was}} aimed to assess the neurobehavioral profile of MLP infants and to compare it with standard reference scores provided in the NAPI manual. Methods: A cross sectional study was planned in which sixty moderate to late preterm infants were included during their stay in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Neurobehavioral assessment of preterm infants (NAPI) scale was used to document the neurobehavioral profile of preterm infants. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the baseline maternal and infant’s characteristics. One sample t test was used for comparing the study sample and standard values provided in NAPI Manual for parametric analysis. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for comparing variables values between two groups which were not following normal distribution. Results: Scarf sign at 34 and 36 weeks of gestation, motor development and vigor and alertness and orientation components of NAPI showed statistically significant difference between our study sample and standard reference values taken from NAPI manual. However statistically insignificant difference was found in popliteal angle, irritability, cry quality and percent sleep ratings domains of NAPI. Conclusion: present study reported the neurobehavioral profile of our population. We found significant variability in scores for motor development and vigor, alertness and orientation and scarf sign domains for our study sample as compared to western standards provided in the NAPI manual...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Implementing {{change and}} {{transforming}} nursing practice {{is not a}} linear but a complex process. The evidence within practice development (PD) and participatory action research (PAR) suggests that not enough {{is known about the}} interplay between the researcher’s characteristics and the contextual factors, in the facilitation of PAR. This study aims to understand this interplay in the development of evidence-based and person-centred practice through PAR, in collaboration with nurses and management at a centre for oncology in a Dutch hospital. The study is guided by a praxis methodology in which different philosophical perspectives are used to connect theory with the practice of PAR. Emancipatory praxis guides the transformation of practice through PAR and hermeneutic praxis guides the understanding of the reality of facilitating PAR within a specific context. The research approach integrates a mix of creative, cognitive and reflective methods. A variety of data about initiating action research in a clinical setting were collected and put into the form of a story in order to engage in a reflexive analysis, inspired by Van Manen’s principles of human science. Findings emphasise the importance of the orientation phase within PAR and suggest that it is essential for facilitators, in particular those new to the methodology, to create a system of support to help them to understand the characteristics of the context. This is necessary in order to create balance in their facilitation that is acceptable both to oneself and the context and which can then achieve <b>synchronous</b> <b>working</b> with practitioners. This study adds greater clarity to the existing body of knowledge about how facilitators of PAR can be helped to engage with the complexity of cultures in different contexts. It demonstrates that there are essential conditions necessary for facilitating PAR, these are captured within a ‘compass’-model. Principles for action for researchers of PAR are explained that are assumed to {{contribute to the development of}} researchers’ expertise engaged in the facilitation of PAR.

The paper argues that a number of (conflicting) options exist when developing the coordination aspects of group systems; they are classified across the following axes: specification and implementation of coordination; use of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>working</b> phases; information exchange and information sharing; support of sequential and concurrent processing; support of negotiation and conflict resolution; support of analytical modelling; and description of the organizational environment...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} sensitivity {{analysis of the}} optimal parameters for the axial flux permanent magnet <b>synchronous</b> machines <b>working</b> in the field weakening region is implemented. Thanks {{to the presence of}} a parameterized accurate analytical model, it is possible to obtain all the required parameters of the machine. The two goals of the ideal design are to maximize the power density: Pdensity and the ratio of maximal to rated speed: nmax/nr, which is an inductance related parameter keeping the efficiency at the target speed above 90 %. Different slots/poles/phases combinations are studied to reveal the optimum combination for each phase. This paper has studied the effect of the ratio of number of stator slots to number of rotor poles on the Pdensity and nmax/nr. It is shown that a low value of this parameter results in a better Pdensity and nmax/nr. The effect of the outer diameter, and the inner to outer diameter ratio are studied with respect to the two design goals. In addition, a comparison between the finite and the theoretical infinite speed designs is implemented.

40|$|With many {{engineering}} companies {{changing their}} focus from product delivery towards through-life service support, the realisation {{is that much}} of the information and knowledge being generated throughout each stage of the design process can aid in both product lifecycle support and also the development of new products.

40|$|The {{fact that}} web based {{distance}} learning concept has recently gained {{more and more}} significance has required the establishment of virtual campuses at universities {{and the provision of}} synchronous and asynchronous education facilities to be used in these campuses. While applying distance learning methods, the universities should adopt genuine learning management systems that could reflect their own characteristics and meet their own needs which are also adaptable to mid and long-term technological changes. The universities should also have synchronous education facilities integrated to the system. 1. Methodology As is required {{by the nature of the}} research problem itself, this study bears a qualitative feature. “Action research”, which is one of the qualitative research approaches has been used in this study. Documents and observations have been used as data collection instruments. The diaries of the students who participated to the research during the design of the system have been analysed using document analysis technique. The research has been conducted with the participation of 14 M. A. students from Karadeniz Technical University, Fatih Faculty of Education, Department of Computer and Instructional Technologies during 2008 - 2009 spring term. During the research students‟ individual diaries, have been coded and qualitatively analysed. The results of the qualitative analysis indicate similar and different cases experienced by two different students groups during the study. 2. System Design Process It has turned out that specific software with synchronous and asynchronous features should be employed in order to ensure effective use of the present distance learning system. The preparation of synchronous and asynchronous chapters has required different coding and design features therefore two different groups have been formed. The synchronous and asynchronous working groups have made a literature review regarding their own fields of study. The structure of Learning Management System (LMS) has been investigated by the asynchronous working group. A needs analysis has been conducted so as to determine the features of the system to be designed later throughout the process. In the light of the data achieved, the minimum software knowledge to be possessed by the members of the group has been defined. Following the literature review, the <b>synchronous</b> <b>working</b> group has examined the structure of the synchronous interfaces used in the existing distance learning systems. The characteristics of these systems as well as their capabilities were then determined. 3. Findings Within the framework of this research, the findings achieved from the logs (diaries) of the participants reflect their experiences both before and during the design process of the distance learning system. As a result of the qualitative analysis, through the study processes themes such as „preparedness, expectations, preparations, problems, solutions and recommendations‟ have been formed. 4. Conclusion and Recommendations The most important criteria for achieving success in designing a distance learning system is to conduct a good analysis of situation, elucidate the differences between current state and requirements conduct a group work for finding solutions for determined defeicincies. Despite the fact that a needs analysis has been conducted and the operation plan of the system has been prepared prior to the design of the system. However, the participants still encounter some problems during the process. This is because any study conducted prior to the design of such complicated systems only contribute to the formation of the infrastructure of the system and thus be beneficial for the participants. Not only the synchronic level but also the platform through which the system shall be supported is also very important while designing the system. Therefore, it is very crucial at this point that the LMS is designed as a dynamic one. Distance learning systems are formed either using the synchronous and asynchronous systems individually or in an integrated form. The system has been planned as a web based LMS enabling synchronous and asynchronous education, thus paving the way for an effective education environment. Such studies should be elaborated in detail considering the service requirements of the relevant organization, should be subject to a sound needs analysis and performed within a convenient time period with the participation of a professional team.  </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{a concern}} for {{sustainable}} development, the rational use of electrical energy implies having transportation networks capable of transmitting large quantities of electrical energy over long distances as well as adequate storage plants. This double requirement is the consequence {{of the fact that}} electrical energy has to be produced and consumed simultaneously, as direct storage of large quantities is not economically feasible. Nowadays, as thermal power plants and run-off river plants are always working at their nominal power for economic reasons; {{it is not possible to}} cover the large space and time demand variations without having an efficient transportation network and adequate storage capacities. The recent start up of major windformer sites also implies the need for supplementary storage capacities. The inventory of large storage plants reveals the solution "pump-storage plant" as being one of the best in terms of storage potential, flexibility, reliability, response time, efficiency, risks and costs. Nearly all the pump-turbine groups operating today consist of <b>synchronous</b> motor-generators <b>working</b> at the network frequency and therefore at constant speed. The performance and efficiency of such groups can be significantly improved by using variable speed motor-generators, and more specifically doubly-fed asynchronous motor-generators. The few variable speed units in operation today are equipped with a cyclo-converter cascade. The purpose of the present thesis is to propose the replacement of the cyclo-converter solution by a back to back 3 -level VSI cascade and investigate the complete regulation strategy. This solution compared to the former has the advantage of providing the possibility of regulating the reactive power in the rotor cascade as well as not polluting the network with sub-harmonics. The three steps followed in such a study, modelling, simulation and practical measurements have permitted the elaboration of a functional tool for the design of the control for such a system...|$|R
40|$|To aid the {{creation}} and through-life support of large, complex engineering products, organizations are placing {{a greater emphasis on}} constructing complete and accurate records of design activities. Current documentary approaches are not sufficient to capture activities and decisions in their entirety and can lead to organizations revisiting and in some cases reworking design decisions in order to understand previous design episodes. Design activities are undertaken in a variety of modes; many of which are dichotomous, and thus each require separate documentary mechanisms to capture information in an efficient manner. It is possible to identify the modes of learning and transaction to describe whether an activity is aimed at increasing a level of understanding or whether it involves manipulating information to achieve a tangible task. The dichotomy of interest in this paper is that of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>working,</b> where engineers may work alternately as part of a group or as individuals and where different forms of record are necessary to adequately capture the processes and rationale employed in each mode. This paper introduces complimentary approaches to achieving richer representations of design activities performed synchronously and asynchronously, and through the undertaking of a design based case study, highlights the benefit of each approach. The resulting records serve to provide a more complete depiction of activities undertaken, and provide positive direction for future co-development of the approaches...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{we focus on}} the coding by cell {{assemblies}} in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and discuss the diversity of the coding, which results in stable and dynamic representations and the processing of various information in that higher brain region. The key activity that reflects cell-assembly coding is the synchrony of the firing of multiple neurons when animals are performing cognitive and memory tasks. First, we introduce some studies that have shown task-related synchrony of neuronal firing in the monkey PFC. These studies have reported fixed and several types of dynamic <b>synchronous</b> firing during <b>working</b> memory, long-term visual memory, and goal selection. The results of these studies have indicated that cell assemblies in the PFC can contribute to both the stability and the dynamics of various types of information. Second, we refer to rat studies and introduce the findings of cellular interactions that contribute to synchrony in working memory, learning-induced changes in synchrony in spatial tasks, and interactions of the PFC and hippocampus in dynamic synchrony. These studies have proposed neuronal mechanisms of cell-assembly coding in the PFC and its critical role in the learning of task demands in problematic situations. Based on the monkey and rat studies, we conclude that cell-assembly coding in the PFC is diverse and has various facets, which allow multipotentiality in the higher brain region. Finally, we discuss the problem of the sizes of cell assembly, how diverse the sizes are in the PFC, and the technical problems in their investigation. We introduce a unique spike-sorting method that can detect small and local cell assemblies that consist of closely neighboring neurons. Then, we describe the findings of our study that showed that the monkey PFC has both small and large cell assemblies, which have different roles in information coding in the working brain...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} studies that reveal {{the nature of}} design {{thinking}} {{and the nature of}} conceptual design as distinct from detailed or embodiment design. The results can assist in our understanding of how the process of design can be supported and how new technologies can be introduced into the workplace. Existing studies provide limited information about the nature of collaborative design as it takes place on the ground and in the actual working context. How to provide appropriate and effective of support for collaborative design information sharing across companies, countries and heterogeneous computer systems is a key issue. As data are passed between designers and the computer systems they employ, many exchanges are made. These exchanges may be used to establish measures of the benefits that new support systems can bring. Collaboration support tools represent a fast growing section of the commercial software market place and a reasonable range of products are available. Many of them offer significant application to design for the support of distributed meetings by the provision of video and audio communications and the sharing of information, including collaborative sketching. The tools that specifically support 3 D models and other very design specific features are less common and many of those are in prototype stages of development. A key question is to find viable ways of combining design information visualisation support with the collaboration support technologies that can be seen today. When collaborating, different views will need to be accessible at different times to all the collaborators. The architects may want to explain some ideas on their model, the structural engineers on their model and so on. However, there are issues of ownership when the structural engineer wants to manipulate the architect’s model and vice versa. The modes of <b>working,</b> <b>synchronous</b> or asynchronous may have a bearing as in a synchronous session there is control of what is happening...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this Ph. D. thesis is the study and the {{development}} of the instruments needed to monitor and calibrate the Muon Detector of the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment. LHCb is currently under installation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and will start to take data during 2007. The experiment will study B mesons decays to achieve a profound understanding of favour physics in the Standard Model framework and to search signs of new physics beyond. Muons {{can be found in the}} final states of many B-decays which are sensitive to CP violation. The Muon Detector has the crucial role to identify the muon particles generated by the b-hadron decays through a measurement of their transverse momentum, already at the first trigger level (Level- 0). A 95 % effciency in events selection is required for the Muon Trigger, which operates at the Level- 0. 1380 detectors are used to equip the whole Muon System and the corresponding 122, 112 readout channels must be time aligned and monitored with a resolution of a few ns to assure the correct Muon Trigger selection. In order to satisfy these requirements, it is necessary to distinguish the time distributions of muons generated by B-decays from the background and center them inside the bunch crossing period. Moreover, the selected events must be unambiguously associated to the bunch crossing which generated the detected muons. Before synchronization, signals generated to the same bunch crossing and coming from different readout channels will have different absolute delays with respect to the interaction time. The electronic instruments designed to time align and to monitor each Muon Detector readout channel are two Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), called DIALOG (DIagnostic time Adjustment and LOGics) and SYNC, developed in CMOS IBM 0. 25 um technology. The DIALOG chips are placed on the detectors, at the beginning of the electronic chains used to collect and to send the channel information to the Muon Trigger. The SYNC chips are placed at the end of the chains. In the Muon System there are 7632 DIALOG and 3552 SYNC devices. DIALOG and SYNC are VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits and were designed in Cagliari by the LHCb group. My research activity was at first focused on the design and on the simulation of the two ASICs. DIALOG is a mixed-signal circuit constituted by analog, digital and mixed blocks. SYNC is a <b>synchronous</b> digital circuit <b>working</b> at 40 MHz. After chip submissions, a semi-automatic test bench called DIALOG Test System (DTS) was developed to characterize and validate all DIALOG prototype characteristics. About 500 DIALOG chips were characterized in full detail by means of the DTS, allowing the definition of the proper sorting intervals needed to perform the validation of the about 12, 000 DIALOG mass production chips. The last part of my work was to study the feasibility of the Muon System time alignment, using the realized instruments during the first phase of LHCb data taking.
