50|$|Music therapy {{interventions}} {{used with}} children can {{fall into two}} categories. The first, Supportive active therapy, is product- oriented and can included rhythm activities such as body percussion (stomping feet, clapping hands, etc.), singing songs which re-inforce nonmusical skills, awareness and expression, or movement to music (as simple as marching to the beat, as complex as structured dances). The second area is called Insight music therapy which is process-oriented. Activities could include song-writing, active listening and reacting, or auditory discrimination activities for <b>sensory</b> <b>skill</b> development. Music therapy for children is conducted either in a one-on-one session or in a group session. The therapist typically plays either a piano or a guitar, which allows {{for a wide variety}} of musical styles to suit the client's preferences. The child is usually encouraged to play an instrument adapted to his or her unique abilities and needs. These elements are designed to improve the experience and outcome of the therapy.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Developmental {{dysgraphia}} {{is a kind}} {{of learning}} disabilities in school students. Evaluation of the <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>skills</b> in hand&nbsp; of these persons by appropriate, functional and real tests demonstrates that their fine and complex hand sensory-motor abilities are prerequisites of intervention planning. &nbsp; Purdue Pegboard and Two-Point Discrimination Tests are used for evaluation of the hand motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>skills</b> respectively. This study was aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of these tests in students with developmental dysgraphia. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study hand sensory-motor skills were evaluated in 23 students with developmental dysgraphia (8 - 11 years) in Tabriz city by Purdue Pegboard and static and moving Two-Point Discrimination tests. Test-retest reliability of mentioned tests was done between and within examiners via intra-class correlation coefficient and independent t-test&nbsp; was done for the comparison of the skills between girls and boys and right and left-handed students and Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the relationship between motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>skills.</b> &nbsp; Results: Intra-class correlation coefficients of Purdue Pegboard, static and moving two-point discrimination tests for inter-session and intra-session reliability were ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 94 and 0. 69 to 0. 92 respectively. There was no significant relationship between motor and <b>sensory</b> <b>skills</b> (p&gt; 0. 05). &nbsp; Conclusion: Because of high reliability of these tests, it can be used them for evaluating the sensory-motor skills and intervention planning in students with developmental dysgraphia.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{solution}} to the problem of pose estimation of three-dimensional objects using feature maps. Our approach relies on quaternions as the mathematical representation of object orientation. We introduce the rigid map, which is derived from Kohonen 's self-organizing feature map. Its topology is fixed and chosen in accordance with the quaternion representation. The map is trained with computer-generated object views such that it responds to a preprocessed input image with one or more sets of object orientation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that a pose estimate within the accuracy requirements can be found in more than 90 % of all cases. Our current implementation operates at near frame rate on real input images. 1 Introduction Determining the three-dimensional position and orientation of objects is an essential <b>sensory</b> <b>skill</b> of intelligent robots, with applications such as online path or task planning, world model update and visual servoing.

40|$|Improvements in task {{performance}} following practice can {{occur as a}} result of changes in distinct cognitive and neural processes. In some cases, we can improve our performance by selecting a more successful behavior that is already part of our available repertoire. Skill learning, on the other hand, refers to a slower process that results in improving the ability to perform a behavior, i. e., it involves the acquisition of a behavior that was not available to the controller before training. Skill learning can take place both in the sensory and in the motor domains. <b>Sensory</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition in perceptual learning tasks is measured by improvements in sensory acuity through practice-induced changes in the sensitivity of relevant neural networks. Motor skill is harder to define as the term is used whenever a motor learning behavior improves along some dimension. Nevertheless, we have recently argued that as in perceptual learning, acuity is an integral component in motor skill learning. In this special topic we set out to integrate experimental and theoretical work on perceptual and motor skill learning and to stimulate a discussion regarding the similarities and differences between these two kinds of learning...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the accuracy in position-matching {{in the upper}} limb in two groups of subjects who were physically fit and movement aware. DESIGN: A mixed-group design was used. Objective measurement of the accuracy in position-matching at the shoulder and elbow in both dominant and nondominant arms consisted of photographic record of the position-matching test, with goniometric measurement. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy department at the Birmingham Royal Ballet and School of Health Science, University of Birmingham. SUBJECTS: Two subject groups: physiotherapy students (n = 10), professional ballet dancers (n = 10). RESULTS: A mixed design analysis of variance found {{significant differences between the}} accuracy in position-matching at both the shoulder and elbow joints in the two groups (p < 0. 05), with the ballet dancers having greater accuracy then the physiotherapy students. A significant difference in the joint positions tested were demonstrated (p < 0. 05) with the positions of abduction at the shoulder and extension of the elbow showing greatest accuracy in matching. There was no significant difference found between the dominant and nondominant upper limb in position-matching. CONCLUSION: Professional ballet dancers demonstrated greater accuracy in position-matching the upper limb, implying that mass and continuing practice can improve a motor <b>sensory</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background : Patients taking lithium often {{report of}} {{difficulties}} in concentration, memory, learning, and attention. Laboratory tests of cognitive functions in healthy volunteers on chronic lithium demonstrate that disruptions in memory-learning processes are apparent {{at the time}} of memory retrieval. Aim : This study has attempted to evaluate the impact of lithium ingestion on cognition and some subset of <b>sensory</b> <b>skill,</b> by examining comparatively how lithium or a lithium / saline supplement either harms or helps the brain. Materials and Methods : Wistar Rats (male and female) were housed in individual improvised cages. The rats were acclimatized for two weeks after which they were randomly grouped into three, namely, control, lithium-treated, and lithium with saline-treated groups, and treated for four weeks. The lithium-treated group received 40 mM lithium bicarbonate per kg of feed for the first one week, and the dosage was increased to 60 mM per kg of feed {{for the rest of the}} three weeks. The lithium-saline group received saline solution in addition to lithium. The control group was given normal feed and water liberally for the period of the experiment. The rats were subjected to a cognitive test using the Barnes maze, assessments of negative geotaxis, cliff avoidance, and some neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and glutamate). The data were analyzed by Microsoft excel 2007. Results : This study shows that lithium ingestion is characterized by a significant (P &# 8804; 0. 05) decline in learning and memory as compared to the control. While the lithium-saline-treated animals exhibit enhanced cognitive ability. The subset of sensory activity was assessed; negative geotaxis and cliff avoidance were grossly compromised, thus lithium carbonate appeared to have definite negative effects on the psychsensory speed. Conclusion : In conclusion lithium should be co-administered with saline to counter the detrimental effects of lithium noticed in this study, which include impairment of tasks on psychomotor speed and cognition...|$|E

For German car mechanics, listening to car sounds was, since the institutionalization of the trade in the 1930 s, a legitimate entrance to diagnostic knowledge. The introduction of new diagnostic equipment in the 1950 s contested the epistemic status of diagnostic listening. Manufacturers and trade authors claimed that these new testing instruments alone gave objective measurements, whereas old-fashioned bodily practices like diagnostic listening were too subjective and thus insufficient for automobile diagnostics.

30|$|Digital memory gaming {{involves}} {{motivation and}} possibly creates a pleasurable response, for example, passing a phase.

In this case, digital memory gaming, by means of the conditioned or instrumental response, can provide for associative learning that is common and of great adaptive value. Considering the temporal sequence in the storage of information, memory consolidation requires the mental repetition of this information, which may facilitate, for instance, the storage of basic information concerning everyday life and related to speaking, writing, motor activity, and other essential activities. Subsequently, {{it is possible that the}} long-term storage of this information can contribute to forming procedural memories, which involve habits, motor <b>skills,</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>skills,</b> and cognitive skills (Izquierdo, 2011).

Background in human-computer interaction. Computers have been used effectively for some time in training neuromuscular skill development in diverse areas including sports, speech pathology, and non-native language teaching. The use of computers as an effective learning tool for singers requires that we understand what information must be represented, and how to make that information accessible and useful to the singer.
