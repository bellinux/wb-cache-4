2500|$|The MARA University of Technology {{began as}} RIDA (Rural & Industrial Development Authority) Training Centre (...) , {{inspired}} by Onn Jaafar, {{the founder and}} former president of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The idea was conceived {{as a result of a}} <b>study</b> <b>visit</b> to Ceylon in 1951 (now Sri Lanka) to look into its rural development programme. A resulting working paper outlined the establishment of Rural and Industrial Development Authority (RIDA) and its objectives of rebuilding the rural society, as well as improving the economy of rural Malays. A bill Paper No. 10/1951 was passed by the Federal Legislative Council on the same year that led to its establishment; reveals an interesting insight into the connection between RIDA Training Centre and the Malay community. Section 5 of this paper outlines the justification and the necessity of establishing Rural Industrial Development Authority (RIDA). The word kampong (...) , which is synonymous with the Malays, is also used in Section 8 of the paper.|$|E
