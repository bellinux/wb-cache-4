25|$|The Long Depression of 1873–79 {{forced a}} number of unions to merge in order to survive. In 1876, the Sons of Vulcan (a puddlers union), the Iron and Steel Heaters Union (a union of workers who {{operated}} roughing and rolling machines, and who acted as catchers for still-hot rolled steel), the Iron and <b>Steel</b> <b>Roll</b> Hands Union (another union of roughers, rollers and catchers) and the Nailers Union (riveters) merged to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA).|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the T1 is a two-seat configuration, lacking any amenities and luxuries to reduce excess weight. The passenger's seat is set back from the driver's seat slightly, allowing the seats to be placed closer together, thereby reducing the overall width of the T1. Offered are a head protection system, six-point harnesses for the driver and passenger, compatible with a HANS device, and is designed with a central safety cell made of a high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> hoop with a fire system. The dashboard is multi-function with race data logging and speed sensors for traction control and launch control.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{designed}} to have standard features such as AC/Heat (manufactured by RedDOT), AM/FM stereo, power windows/door lock, cruise control, three airbags, a reinforced <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> cage, side intrusion beams, stability control, and disc brakes with ABS. Continental AG has created a tire specifically for the Elio. The Elio designs meet motorcycle standards because as a three-wheeler, it is within the U.S. government's motorcycle classification. The company has lobbied in most states, to alter regulations that would otherwise require drivers to wear a helmet and, in many states to remove the requirement for operators to have a motorcycle endorsement on their driver license.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on TMCP and UFC technology, the microstructures {{and impact}} {{toughness}} of low carbon bainitic steel were studied in this paper. The bainite morphology and fracture surfaces of Charpy impact specimens were observed by SEM, and mechanical properties of bainitic steel were measured by tensile and impact test. The {{results showed that}} the yield and tensile strengths of steel were 804 MPa and 1015 MPa, and elongation was 15. 7 % when the rolling was finished in the austenite recrystallization region. The <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> below Tnr temperature obtained tht yield strength of 930 MPa, tensile strength of 1090 MPa and elongation of 16. 2 %. However, the impact toughness was deteriorated in the <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> above Tnr temperature while the excellent impact toughness existed in the <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> below Tnr temperature. The impact toughness of <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> below Tnr temperature was 140 J at- 60 ℃, while the impact toughness of 15 J at the same temperature was obtained for the <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> above Tnr temperature. The large cleavage fracture region on the fracture surface occured with the decrease of tested temperature in the <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> above Tnr temperature and inevitably reduced the impact toughness, while the main ductile fracture existed in the <b>steel</b> <b>rolled</b> below Tnr temperature at the same temperature. The rolling process of steel can strongly affect impact toughness of low carbon bainitic steel. Hence, the different rolling processes can adjust the occurrence of cleavage fracture and ductile fracture in order to improve the impact toughness...|$|R

25|$|Other {{iron and}} steel unions had also formed in the post-Civil War period, and in 1873 merger of the largest unions was proposed. The Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers, and Roughers had formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1861. This craft union {{recruited}} the skilled workers who rolled steel in railroad track mills, but soon expanded its membership to rollers throughout the {{iron and steel}} industry. Another union, the Iron and <b>Steel</b> <b>Roll</b> Hands of the United States, formed in Chicago in 1870. This union attracted anyone whom the Associated Brotherhood would not permit as a member. The Roll Hands never achieved much membership growth, which led the union to propose merger {{as a way of}} combating employer resistance to unions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rolled</b> <b>Steel</b> Products Ltd gave {{security}} {{to guarantee the}} debts of a company called SSS Ltd to British Steel Corporation. This was a purpose that did not benefit <b>Rolled</b> <b>Steel</b> Products Ltd. Moreover, <b>Rolled</b> <b>Steel's</b> director, Mr Shenkman was interested in SSS Ltd (he had personally guaranteed a debt to British Steel’s subsidiary Colvilles, which SSS Ltd owed money to). The company was empowered to grant guarantees under its articles but approval of the deal was irregular because Mr Shenkman's personal interest meant his vote should not have counted for the quorum at the meeting approving the guarantee. The shareholders knew of the irregularity, and so did British <b>Steel.</b> <b>Rolled</b> <b>Steel</b> Products {{wanted to get out}} of the guarantee, and was arguing it was unenforceable either because it was ultra vires, or because the guarantee had been created without proper authority.|$|R

50|$|The third type of finish {{is called}} a plater finish, and whereas the first two types of finish are {{accomplished}} by the calender stack itself, a plater finish is obtained by placing cut sheets of paper between zinc or copper plates that are stacked together, then put under pressure and heating.

For an engine, the Porsche 934-derived Type-935 2.8L flat-6 was used with air cooling and a single Kühnle, Kopp und Kausch AG K36 turbocharger instead of the twin K27 turbochargers of the Group C 956, as twin-turbo systems were not allowed in IMSA's GTP class at the time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Steel</b> <b>Roll</b> Mangle Co. of 108 Franklin Street, Chicago, Illinois {{offered a}} gas heated home mangle for {{pressing}} linens in 1902. In the 1930s electric mangles were developed {{and are still}} a feature of many laundry rooms. They consist of a rotating padded drum which revolves against a heating element which can be stationary, or {{can also be a}} rotating drum. Laundry is fed into the turning mangle and emerges flat and pressed on the other side. This process takes much less time than ironing with the usual iron and ironing board.|$|E
50|$|Like the BMW M4 Coupé, {{the racing}} version also meets the highest safety {{standard}}s. Over 50 of the 5,000 plus parts {{that make up}} the BMW M4 DTM are standard components, which are used in all DTM cars.

With an integrated tank, <b>steel</b> <b>roll</b> cage and additional crash elements, it offers the driver effective protection in case of a crash. Parts like the gearbox, clutch, dampers and rear wing are identical in all DTM cars. This also keeps a lid on development costs.|$|E
