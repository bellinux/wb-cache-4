5|$|In a {{molecular}} analysis of Boletaceae phylogeny, the brawny bolete was most {{closely related to}} Boletus luteocupreus; these two <b>species</b> <b>formed</b> a clade that was sister to B.luridus.

This indicated that the brawny bolete and its relatives needed to be placed in a new genus. It was made the type species of the new genus Imperator, becoming Imperator torosus, in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that <b>species</b> <b>formed</b> in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a <b>species</b> <b>formed</b> of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E

The word squatina is the angelshark's name in Latin, derived from the word for skate; it was made the genus name for all angel sharks by the French zoologist André Duméril in 1806. Other common names used for this species include angel, angel fiddle fish, angel puffy fish, angel ray, angelfish, escat jueu, fiddle fish, monk, and monkfish. Stelbrink and colleagues (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, {{and found that the}} sister species of the angelshark is the sawback angelshark (S. aculeata).

Clade A corresponds with subgenus Liliorhiza centred in California, but a number of species (F. camschatcensis - Japan and Siberia), F. maximowiczii and F. dagana - Russia) are also found in Western Asia. These Asian species form a grade with the true North American species, suggesting an origin in Asia followed by later dispersal.

2500|$|In {{the first}} edition of Principles, the first volume briefly set out Lyell's concept of a steady state with no real {{progression}} of fossils, in which humanity had appeared recently, with unique intellectual and moral qualities but no great physical distinction from animals. The second volume dismissed Lamarck's claims of animal forms arising from habits, continuous spontaneous generation of new life, and man having evolved from lower forms. Lyell explicitly rejected Lamark's concept of transmutation of species, drawing on Cuvier's arguments, and concluded that species had been created with stable attributes. He discussed the geographical distribution of plants and animals, and proposed that every species of plant or animal was descended from a pair or individual, originated in response to differing external conditions. Species would regularly go extinct, in a [...] "struggle for existence" [...] between hybrids, or a [...] "war one with another" [...] due to population pressure. He was vague about how replacement <b>species</b> <b>formed,</b> portraying this as an infrequent occurrence which could rarely be observed.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, the dormant public enthusiasm was stimulated by music at an uncomfortably early {{hour in the}} morning. Two horn players and a clarionet player; a fat {{musician}} who blew through a very small fife and kept time with his head; and a withered little man who beat furiously on a mighty drum--drew up in martial array, one behind the other, before the principal inn. Two boys, staring about them in a stolidly important manner, and carrying flags which bore a suspicious resemblance to India pocket handkerchiefs sewn together, formed {{in front of the}} musicians. Two corpulent, solemn, elderly gentlemen in black (belonging, apparently, to the churchwarden-type of the human <b>species),</b> <b>formed</b> in their turn {{on each side of the}} boys--and then the procession started; walking briskly up and down, and in and out, and round and round the same streets, over and over again; the musicians playing on all their instruments at once (drum included), without a moment's intermission on the part of any one of them. Nothing could exceed the gravity and silence of the popular concourse which followed this grotesque procession. The solemn composure on the countenances of the two corpulent civil officers who went before it, was reflected on the features of the smallest boy who followed humbly behind. Profound musical amateurs in attendance at a classical quartet concert, could have exhibited no graver or more breathless attention than that displayed by the inhabitants of Fowey, as they marched at the heels of the peripatetic town band.|$|E

60|$|If the law above enunciated be true, {{it follows}} that the natural series of affinities will also {{represent}} the order in which the several species came into existence, each one having had for its immediate antitype a closely allied species existing {{at the time of its}} origin. It is evidently possible that two or three distinct species may have had a common antitype, and that each of these may again have become the antitypes from which other closely allied species were created. The effect of this would be, that so long as each species has had but one new <b>species</b> <b>formed</b> on its model, the line of affinities will be simple, and may be represented by placing the several species in direct succession in a straight line. But if two or more species have been independently formed on the plan of a common antitype, then the series of affinities will be compound, and can only be represented by a forked or many branched line. Now, all attempts at a Natural classification and arrangement of organic beings show, that both these plans have obtained in creation. Sometimes the series of affinities can be well represented for a space by a direct progression from species to species or from group to group, but it is generally found impossible so to continue. There constantly occur two or more modifications of an organ or modifications of two distinct organs, leading us on to two distinct series of species, which at length differ so much from each other as to form distinct genera or families. These are the parallel series or representative groups of naturalists, and they often occur in different countries, or are found fossil in different formations. They are said to have an analogy to each other when they are so far removed from their common antitype as to differ in many important points of structure, while they still preserve a family resemblance. We thus see how difficult it is to determine in every case whether a given relation is an analogy or an affinity, for it is evident that as we go back along the parallel or divergent series, towards the common antitype, the analogy which existed between the two groups becomes an affinity. We are also made aware of the difficulty of arriving at a true classification, even in a small and perfect group;--in the actual state of nature it is almost impossible, the species being so numerous and the modifications of form and structure so varied, arising probably from the immense number of species which have served as antitypes for the existing species, and thus produced a complicated branching of the lines of affinity, as intricate as the twigs of a gnarled oak or the vascular system of the human body. Again, if we consider that we have only fragments of this vast system, the stem and main branches being represented by extinct species of which we have no knowledge, while a vast mass of limbs and boughs and minute twigs and scattered leaves is what we have to place in order, and determine the true position each originally occupied with regard to the others, the whole difficulty of the true Natural System of classification becomes apparent to us.|$|E
60|$|General Appearance.--Capitulum highly {{variable}} {{in all its}} characters; thick and broad in proportion to its length, but the breadth is variable,--in some specimens, the capitulum being longer by one-fifth of its total length than broad; in others, one-fifth broader than long. Valves generally approximate; in some varieties, however, from the narrowness of the carina and terga, the valves stand far apart, there being an interval between the carina and scuta of nearly half {{the breadth of the}} latter. Valves excessively thin, brittle, transparent, colourless, smooth, but generally sinuous along the zones of growth, which are conspicuous: valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane, which is thickly clothed, especially in the interspaces between the valves, with minute spines, barely visible to the naked eye. Scuta with {{the lower part of the}} tergo-carinal margin extremely protuberant; occludent margin, more or less, but slightly reflexed, with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex; basal margin much reflexed, but to a variable extent and at a varying angle, even up to a right angle,--an external rim or collar being thus formed. There are no distinct internal teeth, but the basal margin under the umbones, is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection, which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed as the rest of the basal margin: there is no distinct internal basal rim. The primordial valves are generally visible, but they do not lie, as in all other species, close to the basal margin, but a little above it,--the lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed. Terga flat, with the occludent margin slightly arched, and not, as in the foregoing <b>species,</b> <b>formed</b> of two sides; apex bent towards the carina; width of the lower half {{highly variable}}, owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out; in some specimens, the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout; in other specimens this lower part is spear-shaped. The widest part of the tergum either equals in width, or is only two-thirds of the width of the widest part of the carina beneath its umbo. Carina (Pl. I, fig. 6 a) highly variable in shape, with the part above the umbo either spear-shaped and slightly concave within, or nearly flat and furnished with a central external ridge; or the upper part (fig. 6 c) is of equal and extreme narrowness throughout, and deeply concave within, appearing as if only the central ridge had been developed. The part below the umbo, (answering to the fork in the foregoing species,) is about one-third of the length of the whole valve, and generally twice as wide as the upper part, but in the variety with the upper part of the carina equally narrow throughout, the lower part is thrice as wide as the upper; the disc, or lower part, is generally slightly concave within, exteriorly either with or without a central ridge; basal margin rounded; lateral margin more or less curved, according to the form of the upper part. The disc is not more deeply imbedded in membrane than is the upper part of the valve. The heel or umbo is either angular and prominent, or rounded. In very young specimens the carina is simply bowed, instead of being rectangularly bent.|$|E
60|$|The really {{surprising}} fact in {{this case}} of the Galapagos Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, {{is that the new}} <b>species</b> <b>formed</b> in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British Channel, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map. Nevertheless a good many species, both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common to the several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory, when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each; thus there are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it succeed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From these considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, not having universally spread from island to island. In many other instances, as in the several districts of the same continent, pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life. Thus, the south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants.|$|E
