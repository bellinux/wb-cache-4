The Republican Party claimed that the <b>shortfall</b> was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion <b>shortfall</b> in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget <b>shortfall.</b> Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget <b>shortfall.</b> Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the <b>shortfall.</b> The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E

On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{measuring}} {{how far away}} banks are from complying with a multi-ratio regulatory framework. We suggest measuring the efforts a bank has to make to reach compliance as an additional portfolio which is derived from a microeconomic banking model. This compliance portfolio provides an integrated measure of the <b>shortfalls</b> resulting from a new regulatory framework. Our method complements the descriptive reporting of individual <b>shortfalls</b> per ratio when monitoring banks' progress toward compliance with a new regulatory framework. We apply our concept {{to a sample of}} 46 German banks in order to quantify the effects of the interdependencies of the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements. Comparing our portfolio approach to the <b>shortfalls</b> reported in the Basel III monitoring, we find that the reported <b>shortfalls</b> tend to underestimate the required capital and to overestimate of the required stable funding. However, compared to the overall level of the reported <b>shortfalls,</b> the effects resulting from the interdepen- dencies of the Basel III ratios are found to be rather small...|$|R

40|$|We {{monitored}} pasture biomass on 20 permanent plots over 35 {{years to}} gauge the reliability of rainfall and NDVI as proxy measures of forage <b>shortfalls</b> in a savannah ecosystem. Both proxies are reliable indicators of pasture biomass {{at the onset of}} dry periods but fail to predict <b>shortfalls</b> in prolonged dry spells. In contrast, grazing pressure predicts pasture deficits {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Large herbivores play a primary role in determining the severity of pasture deficits and variation across habitats. Grazing pressure also explains oscillations in plant biomass unrelated to rainfall. Plant biomass has declined steadily and biomass per unit of rainfall has fallen by a third, corresponding to a doubling in grazing intensity over the study period. The rising probability of forage deficits fits local pastoral perceptions of an increasing frequency of extreme <b>shortfalls.</b> The decline in forage is linked to sedentarization, range loss and herbivore compression into drought refuges, rather than climate change. The results show that the decline in rangeland productivity and increasing frequency of pasture <b>shortfalls</b> can be ameliorated by better husbandry practices and reinforces the need for ground monitoring to complement remote sensing in forecasting pasture <b>shortfalls...</b>|$|R
