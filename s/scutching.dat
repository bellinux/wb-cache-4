25|$|<b>Scutching</b> {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first <b>scutching</b> machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The <b>scutching</b> machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|E
500|$|In 1916 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief {{scientists}} Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey {{created a}} paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 [...] "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material", {{in which they}} stated that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was [...] "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood". Merrill and Dewey's findings were not repeated in a later book by Dewey and have not been confirmed by paper production experts. The consistency of long fibers is too low in hemp hurds for commercial papermaking. Numerous machines had been devised for breaking and <b>scutching</b> hemp fibers, but none had {{been found to be}} fully satisfactory in actual commercial work. To produce fiber from hemp was a labor-intensive process if harvest, transport and processing are included. Technological developments decreased the labor but not sufficiently to eliminate this disadvantage.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally the hemp stalks {{would be}} water-retted first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand; {{a process known}} as <b>scutching.</b> As {{mechanical}} technology evolved, separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers that would produce a nearly clean fiber. After the Marijuana Tax Act was implemented in 1938, the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained [...] "frozen in time".|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: <b>scutched</b> fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There {{is a need}} for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of <b>scutched</b> flax and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of <b>scutched</b> flax. Tow bundles were 15 % shorter than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles and tow bundles were 25 % thicker than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of <b>scutched</b> flax allowed volume fractions of 0. 7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0. 6. Despite the visual and morphological difference between tows and <b>scutched</b> flax both can be good candidates for composite reinforcement in high performance applications...|$|R

50|$|<b>Scutching</b> is done {{several ways}} by machine. <b>Scutching</b> mills started in Ireland, and were {{commonly}} used there by 1850, {{at a time when}} hand <b>scutching</b> was still common in Continental Europe. Machine <b>scutching,</b> while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than <b>scutching</b> by hand. One method of machine <b>scutching</b> is to crush the stalks between two metal rollers so that parts of the stalk can be separated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scutching</b> {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The <b>scutching</b> process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers. <b>Scutching</b> can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand <b>scutching</b> of flax is done with a wooden <b>scutching</b> knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of <b>scutching</b> flax are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|E

50|$|Codilla is {{the name}} given to the broken fibres which are {{separated}} from the flax during the <b>scutching</b> process. On this account it is sometimes termed <b>scutching</b> tow. Quantities of this material are used along with heckled tow {{in the production of}} tow yarns.|$|E

50|$|Dressing the flax is {{the process}} of {{removing}} the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, <b>scutching,</b> and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the <b>scutching</b> process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.|$|E

50|$|The <b>scutching</b> knife is scraped {{down with}} a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is {{repeated}} until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When <b>scutching</b> was done by hand people could scutch up to 15 lb of flax in one day, though the amount depended {{on the quality of}} the flax. Coarser flax, harder flax and poorly retted flax takes longer to scutch. Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the <b>scutching</b> process. Over-retting the flax causes the fibers to deteriorate and break.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{spinning}} {{produced a}} lot of waste so naturally this was recycled. This waste was the raw material of a condensor spinning mill. It came in three forms, loose staple, unspun rovings and spun thread (hard waste) that had been pirned but rejected. No matter its source {{it had to be}} devilled (broken down) to staple, then <b>scutched</b> and carded in the normal way. After these processes the staple was very short, and the processing of the lap was different - a Derby Doubler was used to mix slivers into sliver lap. A notable feature of the mule was that the rovings weren't on individual bobbins but on a beam. As the fine spinning of cotton contracted so did the need for condensing.|$|R
50|$|The first {{building}} in Richwood was a one-room log cabin {{on the north}} side of Ottawa Street occupied by Dr. John P. Brookins and his family. Dr. Brookins was a friend of Philip's from Mt. Vernon and had been looking for a place to practice his medicine. For many years, he was the only doctor in Richwood and served as Justice of the Peace and as Postmaster. The cabin had one door, two windows, a puncheon floor, clapboard roof, and a <b>scutched</b> (smoothed) interior. The first death in Richwood was Dr. Brookins' daughter Mary Jane, who died of severe burns when her clothes caught fire. Two versions of the story exist; one being that she had been sitting too close to the hearth, and the other being that she got too close to a log-burning. His family also saw the town's first wedding.|$|R
40|$|Noil {{hemp fibre}} (NHF) {{is a kind}} of textile hemp fibre after deep {{degumming}} from <b>scutched</b> hemp fibre (SHF), mechanically-degummed hemp fibre. Both NHF and SHF with strong mechanical properties are good candidates as reinforcing fibres for plastics such as polypropylene (PP). The PP/NHF and PP/SHF composites were blended via internal mixing process. The effect of fibres on the morphology, thermal resistance and reinforcement of the composites were investigated. PP/NHF composites showed higher impact strength, lower flexural strength than PP/SHF at the corresponding loading because NHF has smaller diameter and better thermal resistance than SHF. Meanwhile, NHF has the similar reinforcement to tensile strength with SHF. The effect of maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) on the fibre-resin interface bonding was also comparatively studied. With increasing amount of MAPP, the tensile, flexural and impact strengths of PP/NHF and PP/SHF increased, respectively. The morphology of PP/SHF and PP/NHF results well showed that MAPP improved the interaction of the fibres with PP through chemical adhesion. ...|$|R
5000|$|The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in {{open air}} or by {{mechanical}} means, and are frequently stored {{for a short}} period to allow [...] "curing" [...] to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the <b>scutching</b> operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and <b>scutching</b> operations. Waste material from the first <b>scutching,</b> consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre (tow) thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>scutching</b> process some of {{the fiber}} is also {{scutched}} away along with the stalk, {{a normal part of}} the process.|$|E
50|$|After retting, {{the stalks}} {{are ready for}} <b>scutching,</b> which takes place between August and December. <b>Scutching</b> removes the woody portion of the stalks by {{crushing}} them between two metal rollers, so that {{the parts of the}} stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as linseed, shive, and tow are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are heckled: the short fibers are separated with heckling combs by 'combing' them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers.|$|E
40|$|In some late years {{a number}} of fibre flax {{varieties}} and new breeding lines have been created and investigated at the Upytė Research Station of Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture (LIA). The fibre quality parameters of the new varieties of fibre flax are studied and {{compared with those of}} standard flax varieties. Flax was pulled at the stage of early yellow ripeness, warm water-retted, threshed, <b>scutched</b> and hackled. Long fibre content was calculated from the dry mass of unretted straw. Fibre quality’s parameters of some flax varieties (“Belinka ” (standard), “Baltučiai”, “Ariane”) and new breeding lines (No. 01057 - 12, No. 1698 - 13 a, No. 1864 - 24, No. 1963 - 3) grown in 2001 – 2003 are investigated. The main properties of flax fibre as fineness, flexibility, and tensile strength are measured, and the data obtained by common methods and some new modern methods are compared. The flax varieties producing the fibre of higher qualities are revealed...|$|R
50|$|Richard Arkwright was a hard-nosed {{businessman}} from Preston. Arkwright {{produced a}} {{continuous spinning machine}} that was unlike Hargreaves hand operated spinning jenny. The jenny required two motions, one to draw {{and the other to}} spin and wind. Arkwrights frame spun and wound {{at the same time and}} was operated by turning a wheel. The prototype that was powered by hand, was patented in 1769. The process was particular suitable to the application of power which in those times meant a water wheel. Arkwright developed the principle into an industrial machine where a pair of frames would have 96 spindles. In searching for a reliable source of power Arkwright set up his first factory on Cromford, on the River Derwent in Derbyshire. In 1775, he filed a patents for powered preparatory machines that would card and <b>scutch</b> the roving needed by the waterframe. The lantern frame, to draw the roving, and development of the waterframe known as a throstle followed.|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{much of his}} {{writings}} tom Jones Hughes has returned {{again and again to}} the theme of Irish regionalism. Notwithstanding his acknowledgement of the role of cultural, and indeed ethnic, factors in the identification of patterns, he has most frequently employed economic variables in a search for regional indicators. His classic cartographic portrayal of the extend of eighteenth and nineteenth century landlord improvements was based on a detailed interpretation of the Griffith Valuation, and analyses of agricultural statistics provided him with the configuration of major regions of economic specialisation in post-Famine rural Ireland. Even his more recent writings have placed considerable emphasis upon economic data, as witness his mapping of farms with a valuation of one hundred pounds or more. While the ultimate goal of all this analysis has been to identify and measure the nature, scale and intensity of spatial differentiation within this island, and while he would probably recoil from being labelled an economic geographer, it is nonetheless apparent that Tom Jones Hughes’s writings suggest a strong interest in regional economies, their landscapes and their socio-cultural manifestations. This essay seeks to identify the agricultural background of probably the most distinctive regional economy to have matured in nineteenth century Ireland, the linen industry of the northern half of the country. Specifically, this essay will explore the regional dimension of flax cultivation and its immediate proto-industrial offshoot, <b>scutch</b> milling. The secondary stages of textile production – the spinning, weaving and bleaching processes – do not form part of the present study...|$|R
