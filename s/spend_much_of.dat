5|$|Because banded sea kraits <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{their time}} on land, they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time feeding {{in order to gain}} enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|Lions <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{their time}} resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with {{a period of}} socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They {{spend an average of}} two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E

5|$|Muskrats <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{their time}} in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel {{them through the}} water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that acoustical mimicry {{is related to}} the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{their time}} grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, {{but they are not}} known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the time lying down in cover. Since {{the presence of a}} mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E

5|$|He <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{his fortune}} on {{political}} activism, and was nearly bankrupt {{by the time}} of his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of Warsaw. It is likely that major reasons he preferred not to have been elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in Warsaw. He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and his large funeral was paid for by the City of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and {{only a small part}} at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the rest of his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E

Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E
5|$|While at this {{training}} unit, Graf {{was promoted to}} Leutnant (equivalent to second lieutenant) on 1 May 1940. At Merseburg, Graf met and befriended two other pilot trainees, Alfred Grislawski and Heinrich Füllgrabe, with whom he would later <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his combat career. Their {{time spent in the}} unit meant they missed the air combat of the Battle of France and Battle of Britain. On 6 October 1940, Handrick was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of III./Jagdgeschwader 52 (III./JG52). Handrick had some influence on the personnel rotation within his Gruppe and had Graf and Füllgrabe transferred to 9./JG52 with him, where they rejoined Grislawski.|$|E
