50|$|In New Zealand {{service in}} Japan was more popular with {{applications}} from returned servicemen who were having trouble readjusting to civilian {{life as well}} as from {{young men and women who}} had missed out on wartime service and wanted adventure. Between May 1946 and August 1947 four relief drafts were dispatched from New Zealand to Japan. The relief drafts also featured women in the form of nurses, <b>shorthand</b> <b>typists,</b> hostesses and welfare staff.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial draft}} of 200 women were posted to the RNZAF air base at Rongotai, Wellington, in April 1941. Initially WAAFs were not {{provided}} with accommodation, {{and had to}} either live at home or find lodgings for themselves, but eventually quarters were provided on the air stations were they served. By January 1942 WAAFs were based at 11 air stations, serving as cooks, mess-hands, drivers, clerks, equipment assistants, medical orderlies and <b>shorthand</b> <b>typists.</b> The general ratio of replacement was five women to four men.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1942 WAAFs {{were serving}} on 21 air stations, and were {{eventually}} posted to every major station in New Zealand, and some served overseas. In January 1943 a party of 19 WAAFs were sent to Fiji to serve as <b>shorthand</b> <b>typists,</b> clerks, drivers, and equipment assistants. Later, as {{the size of the}} party expanded to 77, wireless operators, telephone and teleprinter operators, and cipher officers predominated, and it also included meteorological observers and medical orderlies. Only volunteers aged between 23 and 33 were permitted to go, with a tour of duty limited to eighteen months. This was later reduced to nine months, to allow more WAAFs to serve overseas. A WAAF detachment also served on Norfolk Island, which at its largest numbered 94, mostly cipher officers, but also including medical orderlies, and a clerk-librarian.|$|R

50|$|The {{organisation}} remained {{rooted in}} its Victorian origins, still {{operating under the}} 1886 Prosecutions of Offences Regulations, until the appointment of Sir Theobald Mathew in 1944. The youngest man (and only solicitor) to be appointed DPP at that time, Matthews modernised the office, updating the Prosecutions of Offences Regulations, introducing trunk dialling and using dictaphones {{to make up for}} the small number of <b>shorthand</b> <b>typists.</b> He reorganised and modernised the department as a whole, and many of his modifications are still in place; for example, a provision in many new Acts of Parliament dealing with the criminal law that requires the consent of the DPP for a prosecution. At the same time he battled with the Civil Service for an increase in staff numbers, securing the appointment of three new Assistant Solicitors in the late 1950s; a large leap for a staff which had previously numbered five, excluding secretaries. The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 created the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 1986, a dedicated, nationwide prosecution service under the control of the DPP, then Sir Thomas Hetherington QC. This involved the recruitment of 3,000 new staff, which despite difficulties the DPP succeeded in doing. The CPS now handles the vast majority of prosecutions.|$|R
50|$|The union {{formed in}} 1903 as the Association of <b>Shorthand</b> Writers and <b>Typists</b> and {{changed its name}} in 1912 to AWCS.

40|$|These records comprise: Dominions Office and Commonwealth Relations Office: Original CorrespondenceThe Dominions Office {{was created}} in 1925 by the {{separation}} of the Dominions Division from the Colonial Office, and the transfer of the divisional staff to the new department (though in fact the two Offices continued to occupy the same building, and they originally shared the same individual as Secretary of State for both offices). The Dominions Office continued, however, to utilise Colonial Office staff for the following functions: establishment and personnel matters (provided by the Colonial Office General Department for both home and overseas posts), accounts, legal advice, registry and archiving services, printing and binding, library services and <b>typists</b> and <b>shorthand</b> <b>typists.</b> For this reason the published list of the establishment was a joint Colonial and Dominion Office list from 1925 until publication ceased because of the Second World War in 1940. It was not until 1947, when the Colonial Office moved from the shared premises in Downing Street to new offices in Great Smith Street, that it was decided that the common departments should be split, as the staff of the two offices below under-secretary level would no longer be interchangeable. The formal date of separation was 1 April 1947 though the physical move of Colonial Office staff did not exactly coincide with this. From this date, the Dominions Office had its own establishment and common services staff, who then became the common services staff of the Commonwealth Relations Office when it was created on 3 July 1947. For this short period, the only services which remained shared between the two Offices were those vested in a single individual, such as the work of the ceremonial and reception secretary, most of whose duties related to the work of the Dominions Office, but who continued to perform occasional duties for the Colonial Office...|$|R
