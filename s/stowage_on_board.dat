60|$|The <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the Grampus {{was most}} clumsily done, if stowage {{that could be}} called which was little better than a {{promiscuous}} huddling together of oil-casks {*1} and ship furniture. I have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold. On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for the present.|$|E
50|$|In 1930 the French Navy {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a light coastal patrol seaplane mainly {{for use in the}} French colonies. Gourdou-Leseurre built and designed a prototype GL-831 HY which was a modification of the companies earlier GL-830 HY with a smaller Hispano-Suiza radial engine. The GL-831 HY first flew on 23 December 1931. In 1933 the French Navy ordered 22 aircraft designated GL-832 HY, this had a less powerful engine than the prototype. The GL-832 HY was a metal construction low-wing monoplane with fabric covered wings and twin floats. The aircraft had a large wing to take the stresses of a catapult launch, the wings also folded to allow <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a ship. Unusually the braced-horizontal tailplane was attached to the underside of the rear fuselage. Two open cockpits in tandem were provided for the two crew, each cockpit having a windscreen. The first production aircraft flew on 17 December 1934 and the last on 12 February 1936.|$|E

50|$|By early August, Siegfried Battery and Grosser Kurfürst Battery {{were fully}} {{operational}} as {{were all of}} the Army’s railway guns. Seven of the railway guns, six 28 cm K5 guns and a single 21 cm K12 gun {{with a range of}} 115 km, could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28 cm guns and five 24 cm guns, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24 cm guns and ten 21 cm guns, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long loading time and ammunition types. Land-based guns have always been feared by navies because they are on a stationary platform and are thus more accurate (and can be larger, with more ammunition <b>stowage)</b> than those <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ship. Super-heavy railway guns can only be traversed by moving the entire gun and its carriage along a curved track, or by building a special cross track or turntable. This, combined with their slow rate of fire (measured in rounds per hour or even rounds per day), makes {{it difficult for them to}} hit moving targets. Another problem with super-heavy guns is that their barrels (which are difficult to make and expensive to replace) wear out relatively quickly, so they could not be fired often.|$|R

There were merits in both arguments but thereafter the <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> her British operated sister ships was reduced from 75-88,000 gallons down to 36,000 gallons, and the USN reduced theirs also but not as drastically.|$|R

It was armed with a 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine gun operated by the observer.

25|$|Racks {{under the}} seats {{were used for}} {{ammunition}} and rations; additional racks behind the seat backs held the squad's rifles and other stowage. A small rack for mines was added {{on the outside of}} the hull just above the tracks. In combat, most units found it necessary to stow additional food, rucksacks and other crew <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> the outside of the vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and very late vehicles had rear-mounted racks for this crew stowage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} M114 {{required the}} commander's cupola hatch be opened {{to fire the}} [...]50 caliber machine gun, which rotated along with the hatch to allow aim in any direction. The updated M114A1 allowed the firing of the machine gun from the inside, utilizing manual traverse and elevating mechanisms. The M114A2 (aka M114A1E1) had a hydraulically powered cupola and mounted the M139 20mm cannon with greatly improved firepower. The observer in the rear had an M60 7.62mm machine gun mounted on a pedestal. There was <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> the rear door for three M72A1 [...] "LAW" [...] anti-tank rockets.|$|R

Some back seat leg room was sacrificed to the luggage space, being reduced from 43¾ inches in the Ford 7Y to 38½ inches in the Anglia. The Anglia replaced the 7Y saloon, but the van version of the earlier model continued to be built until 1946, after which some very minor changes sufficed to rebaptize the van the [...] "E04C".|$|R

40|$|Results from a Fire Test with a three-by-three {{stack of}} {{standard}} 6 m long International Standards Organization shipping containers containing combustible fuels and empty radioactive materials packages are reported and discussed. The stack {{is intended to}} simulate fire conditions that could occur during on-deck <b>stowage</b> <b>on</b> container cargo ships. The fire is initated by locating the container stack adjacent to a 9. 8 x 6 m pool fire. Temperatures of both cargoes (empty and simulated radioactive materials packages) and containers are recorded and reported.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R
