40|$|For {{some future}} space power systems using high {{temperature}} nuclear heat sources {{most of the}} output energy {{will be used in}} other than electrical form, and {{only a fraction of the}} total thermal energy generated will need to be converted to electrical work. The paper describes the conceptual design of such a partial energy conversion system, consisting of a high temperature fusion reactor operating in series with a high temperature radiator and in parallel with dual closed cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power systems, also referred to as closed Brayton cycle (CBC) systems, which are supplied with a fraction of the reactor thermal energy for conversion to electric power. Most of the fusion reactor's output is in the form of charged plasma which is expanded through a magnetic nozzle of the interplanetary propulsion system. Reactor heat energy is ducted to the high temperature <b>series</b> <b>radiator</b> utilizing the electric power generated to drive a helium gas circulation fan. In addition to discussing the thermodynamic aspects of the system design the authors include a brief overview of the gas turbine and fan rotor-dynamics and proposed bearing support technology along with performance characteristics of the three phase AC electric power generator and fan drive motor...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Stingel created a <b>series</b> of <b>radiator</b> sculptures made of {{translucent}} cast resin in which orange acrylic paint was poured during the casting process. Installed like ordinary radiators, the works nevertheless disallow their identification to a purely utilitarian object through their marbled ember-like glow.|$|R
50|$|The back boiler is {{typically}} {{used with a}} gravity feed circuit to the hot water cylinder, with a vent or overflow to prevent excess pressure build up.

5000|$|In 1938 Volvo {{presented}} {{its light}} LV101-series truck, affectionately {{known as the}} [...] "Sharpnose". At the same time Volvo introduced the taxicab PV800. The two models <b>series</b> shared engine, <b>radiator</b> cover and bonnet. The smallest model LV101 was mechanically almost identical to the taxicab, while the larger LV102 was a “genuine” truck.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} earlier SD70 units, the SD70ACe rides {{on a new}} underframe and uses mostly new sheet metal above the frame. [...] Electrical cables and air lines have been routed beneath the walkways on opposite sides, allowing easier access for maintenance. Continuing the designs of the SD80 and SD90 <b>series,</b> the <b>radiator</b> on the locomotive is nearly {{as wide as the}} cab, the center hood section is a step down below the roofline, and the dynamic brakes have been moved {{to the rear of the}} hood. The SD70ACe uses the cab design of late-model SD90MAC-H units, which uses rectangular window glass and is externally different from the two cab variations used on earlier SD70M and SD70MAC units. In 2008, EMD standardized the isolated cab on subsequent SD70ACe's after non-isolated cab units were restricted from leading on BNSF Railway due to excessive cab vibration.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-temperature}} radiator {{has been}} designed to reject 17. 62 kW of thermal power from an isotope Brayton power system. This power system has an electrical output of 7. 1 kW. The total radiator consists of two <b>radiators</b> connected in <b>series.</b> Both <b>radiators</b> have a redundant coolant loop, shared fins, and are close to flight configuration. A silicone oil is used as the working fluid. Low flow rates and moderate pressure drop in the radiator required a small hydraulic diameter with large heat transfer area and large flow area. To obtain these characteristics and meet schedule limitations, an expanded tube configuration (with an approximately trapezoidal cross section) was selected. Because of the low flow rates and unconventional tube shape, small scale tests were performed to evaluate the validity of existing heat transfer and pressure drop correlations to this case. The results of these tests were in good agreement with predictions...|$|R

50|$|The {{power unit}} on launch was a Leyland O350H 97 bhp 5.76-litre {{four-stroke}} direct-injection six-cylinder diesel, mounted horizontally in mid-wheelbase driving through a unit-mounted Albion clutch and constant mesh gearbox to an overhead-worm rear axle derived from that fitted to the FT and PF <b>series</b> lorries. The <b>radiator</b> was mounted {{behind the front}} axle and was inclined to allow a larger surface area without intrusion into the saloon. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic with an engine-driven vacuum exhauster. The fuel tank was a 35 gallon cylindrical unit transversely mounted between the frame members aft of the rear axle. The engine was fitted with an oil-bath air cleaner and a centrifugal oil filter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that for every {{selection}} of illumination spectra there is a coordinate system such that all coordinate vectors of these illumination spectra are located in a cone. A natural set of transformations of this cone are the Lorentz transformations. In this paper we investigate if sequences of illumination spectra can be described by one-parameter subgroups of Lorentz-transformations. We present two methods to estimate the parameters of such a curve from a set of coordinate points. We also use an optimization technique to approximate a given set of points by a one-parameter curve with a minimum approximation error. In the experimental part of the paper we investigate <b>series</b> of blackbody <b>radiators</b> and sequences of measured daylight spectra and show that one-parameter curves provide good approximations for large sequences of illumination spectra. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a scheme to}} {{generate}} tunable multi-color attosecond coherent X-ray radiation for future light source applications. This scheme uses an energy chirped electron beam, a laser modulators, a laser chirper and two bunch compressors to generate a multi-spike prebunched kilo-Ampere current electron beam from a few tens Ampere electron beam out of a linac. Such an electron beam transports through a <b>series</b> of undulator <b>radiators</b> and bunch compressors to generate multi-color coherent X-ray radiation. As an illustration, we present an example to generate two attosecond pulses with $ 2. 2 $ nm and $ 3 $ nm coherent X-ray radiation wavelength and more than $ 200 $ MW peak power using a $ 30 $ Ampere $ 200 $ nm laser seeded electron beam...|$|R
50|$|Both high tolls and {{transportation}} costs pushed SAT to start domestic sourcing. The third production batch included parts made by such Finnish companies as Keskusvalimo, Suomen Gummitehdas, Pietarsaaren Konepaja and Kone ja Silta. Five vehicles {{of the fourth}} production batch were equipped with frames produced by Crichton-Vulcan. The sixth <b>series</b> got Finnish-made <b>radiators</b> produced by Oksanen & Kumpp., hub caps by Lohmann, headlight brackets by Teräskalustaja, rear axle housing by Karhulan Tehtaat, radiator caps by Metalli-Niklaus and electric cables by Suomen Kaapelitehdas. In some cases SAT {{had to go back}} to Volvo parts; for example domestically produced track rods turned out to be too weak. Also the first Karhula-produced axle housings did not fulfill the requirements but problems were resolved after. Some of the imported parts were substituted by own component production; fuel tanks as an example.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{get more}} {{appropriate}} louvered fin {{structure of a}} <b>series</b> of subcompact <b>radiators,</b> Fluent was {{used to analyze the}} subcompact radiator louvered fins numerically. The fin model was verified availably by testing the error between the simulation results and experimental ones. Through modifying the critical dimension of louvered fin models, the friction factor f and the heat factor j of subcompact radiator louvered fins under different fin height were obtained. The regression analysis indicated that the friction factor was linear with fin height, and the heat factor was the power function of fin height. The dimensionless parameter j/f 1 / 3 was introduced to evaluate the comprehensive performance of fins, and the research indicated that the performance would be best when the fin height was 8. 94 mm. The result has a certain practical value for improving the performance of subcompact radiators...|$|R
