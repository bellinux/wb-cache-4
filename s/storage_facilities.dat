5|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> at Gorleben, Lubmin and Ahaus until temporary <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> {{can be built}} near reactor sites.

5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will be especially efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged and are still developing in the seeds. Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in <b>storage</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out.
