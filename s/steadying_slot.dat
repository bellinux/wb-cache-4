40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>steady</b> <b>slot</b> suction {{as a means}} of {{controlling}} separation on a blunt elliptical airfoil were investigated and compared to the effects of steady blowing applied to the same airfoil previously investigated. Slots whose width approaches 1 % of the chord and are located downstream of the natural separation location generate the highest lift for a given dimensionless mass-flow coefficient C_Q. This holds true whether the flow separates near the leading edge due to high incidence or near the trailing edge due to the bluntness of the airfoil and is contrary to the observations made when blowing was used. Lift generated by suction through a moderately wide slot located downstream of the natural separation line depends only on C_Q, but if the slot is located upstream of the separation line it depends on Reynolds number as well. Contrary to separation control by blowing no deleterious effects were observed at low levels of suction regardless of the suction-slot location. Adding a wedge to the blunt trailing edge of this airfoil enhances the effectiveness of suction, whereas making blowing less effective at low momentum inputs thus increasing the gap between these two approaches to flow separation...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1988, Dunham {{felt his}} career {{went as far as}} it could go in Texas, and he moved to Los Angeles, California, never having, as he has commented, [...] "a real job", much to the concern of his parents, who assumed he would relegate his act to local venues such as church groups. When he first arrived in Los Angeles, the comedy in his act bombed. Dunham {{attributes}} this initial reaction to his underdeveloped comedy, explaining that while the characters' personalities were developed at that point, his jokes were not. In addition to this, the comedy world was not welcoming to ventriloquists, and his manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, did not use the word [...] "ventriloquist" [...] when finding bookings for him, choosing to present him as a comedy duo. After Dunham became friends with Mike Lacey, owner of The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, Lacey gave Dunham a <b>steady</b> <b>slot</b> at the club, where Dunham sharpened his act by observing the techniques of comedians like Jerry Seinfeld, and taking the advice of colleague Bill Engvall, moving away from his G-Rated material toward edgier, more adult themes.|$|R
40|$|Thermocapillarity {{can drive}} steady flows in float-zone configurations. These flows can become {{unstable}} and exhibit time-periodic oscillations. In {{order to obtain}} insight into such phenomena, studies are made of a simplified system consisting of liquid in a two-dimensional <b>slot.</b> <b>Steady</b> flows and their instabilities are examined...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- From general {{equations}} which describe the transient electromechanical {{behavior of the}} asynchronous squirrel-cage motor, and which include the influence of space harmonics and mutual slotting, simplified models are derived and compared. The models derived are demonstrated in examples where special at-tention is paid {{to the influence of}} the place of the harmonics in the mutual inductance matrix and the in-fluence of mutual slotting. Further, the steady-state equations are derived and the back-transformation for the stator and rotor currents is given. One example is compared with the result of measurements. Keywords- asynchronous machines, space harmonics, mutual <b>slotting,</b> <b>steady</b> state and tran-sients...|$|R
50|$|Middlesbrough were up {{next for}} United, at the Riverside. A usually tricky {{game for the}} Reds ended with a {{comfortable}} 2-0 away win, thanks to goals either side of half-time. Ryan Giggs opened the scoring with his first goal since being named as PFA Player of the Year, and his 98th Premier League goal in total. Giggs received the ball from Nemanja Vidić, <b>steadied</b> himself, and <b>slotted</b> it past Brad Jones' left hand {{from the edge of}} the area with 25 minutes played. United created a handful of chances in the remainder of the first half but none worried Boro's Australian goalkeeper. Park Ji-sung doubled the Reds' lead though shortly after half-time. Giggs and Federico Macheda combined with a one-two before Wayne Rooney threaded a pass through the Boro defence to find Park superbly. Park then settled the game with a decisive strike low into the bottom corner.|$|R
40|$|Part 9 : Smart Monitoring SystemsInternational audienceExperimental {{optoelectronic}} {{characterization of}} a p-i’(a-SiC:H) -n/p-i(a-Si:H) -n heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers shows {{the feasibility of}} tailoring channel bandwidth and wavelength by optical bias through back and front side illumination. Front background enhances light-to-dark sensitivity of the long and medium wavelength range, and strongly quenches the others. Back violet background enhances the magnitude in short wavelength range and reduces the others. Experiments have three distinct programmed time slots: control, hibernation and data. Throughout the control time <b>slot</b> <b>steady</b> light wavelengths illuminate either or {{both sides of the}} device, followed by the hibernation without any background illumination. The third time slot allows a programmable sequence of different wavelengths with an impulse frequency of 6000 Hz to shine upon the sensor. Results show that the control time slot illumination has an influence on the data time slot which is used as a volatile memory with the set, reset logical functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to study quantitatively thermocapillary flows in two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries {{in order to learn}} the impact of such flows on float-zone refining configurations. The work begins with the analytical study of <b>steady</b> flows in <b>slots</b> and zones to obtain predictions of surface curvature, flow and heat transport. It then examines the instability of such flows. Three new instability mechanisms have been identified and the results show that thermocapillary flows of high Prandtl number fluid become convectively unstable while those of low Prandtl number fluid become hydrodynamically unstable. The work includes numerical simulations of steady, high Marangoni number flows in unit aspect ratio boxes and asymptotic solutions in large boxes. Furthermore, the effect of surface contamination on the steady thermocapillary flows was examined. This fundamental study focused on fluid dynamical systems used to understand events in the flow of melts in float-zone geometries both on Earth and in microgravity environments...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{sound waves}} can be {{generated}} by boundary-layer instability modes when the latter are scattered by a rapid mean-flow distortion. This is a rather generic mechanism and operates when an oncoming T-S wave is scattered by a <b>steady</b> local suction <b>slot.</b> This paper focuses on this problem by extending a recently developed Local Scattering Theory (Wu & Dong, J. Fluid Mech. submitted), where a so-called transmission coefficient, defined as {{the ratio of the}} T-S wave amplitude downstream of the scatter to that upstream, is introduced to characterize the effect of a local scatter on boundary-layer instability and transition. As in the earlier work, the mathematical formulation is based on triple-deck formulism, but in order to accommodate the acoustic far field, which was not considered in the paper mentioned, the unsteady terms in the upper deck, which play a leading-order role in radiation, are retained, and the influence of the radiated sound on the near-wall perturbation is included. The upper deck equation for the pressure is the Helmholtz equation rather than the Laplace equation. This leads to a modified pressure-displacement relation, which is coupled with the linearized boundary-layer equations in the lower deck. Discretization of the whole system formulates a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is solved numerically. It is found that suction suppresses oncoming T-S waves, and this effect increases with the suction velocity and the slot width. The directivity is ndependent of the flow parameters only when the Mach number is low. The intensity of the radiated sound in general increases with the frequency, the suction velocity and the width of the suction slot. Interestingly, for O(1) suction velocities, the radiated sound is very weak, indicating that the gain of stabilizing effect does not cause aeroacoustic penalty...|$|R
30|$|Since 1975, {{when the}} Norwegian {{legislature}} introduced its first ‘kindergarten act’ (Ministry of Education and Research 2010) (‘kindergarten’ {{is the term}} commonly used in Norwegian legislation for ECEC), {{there has been a}} <b>steady</b> increase in <b>slots</b> in publicly subsidized child care centers with regulated quality measures, with an initial emphasis on preschool children (age 3 or older). With new legislation in 1995, slots for 1 - to 2 -year-olds were also increased. This was further intensified by a broad political agreement in 2002 which stated that all children should have access to ECEC from age 1, if their parents wanted this. As part of this agreement, child care costs were capped in 2005 to approximately NOK 2000 ($ 333 USD or € 240; in 2005, the median income for an individual after tax in Norway was NOK 192 000 [USD $ 32, 000 USD or € 23, 100]) monthly with a sliding scale for lower-income families. In Norway, child care centers are either public (run by the municipalities) or private, but public subsidies, price cap, and regulations of quality standards have been equal across centers since the 2002 agreement, regardless of owner. A growing percentage of the child population was enrolled in publicly subsidized center care from 2000 to 2010, as owners (public and private) received financial support to build more slots. Although the proportion of {{children under the age of}} 1 in center-based care remained under 5 % across time (in large part due to generous parental leave policy), the proportion of 1 - to 2 -year-olds in center-based care rose from under 40 % in 2000 to nearly 80 % in 2010, and the proportion of 3 - to 5 -year-olds from 80 to nearly 97 %. Quality standards in terms of pedagogical content and education level of the unit leader are regulated by law, whereas the curriculum is directed by an educational content framework plan (Ministry of Education and Research 2006). Mandatory quality standards include teacher-child ratios of 1 : 10 for children younger than 3  years, 1 : 19 for older children, and a national curriculum (Ministry of Education 2010), with teachers being required to have a 3 -year tertiary degree in early childhood education. Additionally, there are untrained assistants working under each teacher, and an adult-child ratio of 3 : 10 for children younger than 3  years and 3 : 19 for older children is recommended but not enforced by law. Standards of teacher requirements and adult-child ratios are currently not entirely met in all centers (UNICEF Innocenti Research Center 2008). As a consequence, there are high and relatively homogenous quality standards across most centers (Gulbrandsen and Sundnes 2009).|$|R
