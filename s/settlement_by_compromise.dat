50|$|The {{deadlock}} was {{not even}} broken when the citizens of Viterbo locked up the cardinals in the Episcopal palace where they were meeting, and finally tearing off part of {{the roof of the}} building. Finally, in August 1271, the Cardinals decided to appoint a committee, three of their number from each side, to negotiate a <b>settlement</b> (Election <b>by</b> <b>Compromise).</b> When the six could not agree, however, on the choice of one of the cardinals, they decided to look outside their ranks. They settled on Teobaldo Visconti, the Archdeacon of Liège. Their decision was ratified by all of the Cardinals on 1 September 1271. This was a victory, in fact, for the French-leaning faction, since Teobaldo had intimate connections with France, and his nephew, Vicedomino de Vicedomini, a native of Piacenza but Archbishop of Aix in Provence, had been a follower and advisor of Charles of Anjou ever since he came into Italy.|$|R
60|$|There {{have been}} many efforts made to settle it. Again and again it has been fondly hoped that it was settled; but every time it breaks out afresh, and more violently than ever. It was settled, our fathers hoped, <b>by</b> the Missouri <b>Compromise,</b> {{but it did not}} stay settled. Then the compromises of 1850 were {{declared}} to be a full and final settlement of the question. The two great parties, each in national convention, adopted resolutions declaring that the <b>settlement</b> made <b>by</b> the <b>Compromise</b> of 1850 was a finality that it would last forever. Yet how long before it was unsettled again? It broke out again in 1854, and blazed higher and raged more furiously than ever before, and the agitation has not rested since.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Flawed {{clinical}} practice guidelines may compromise patient care. Commercial {{conflicts of interest}} on panels that write treatment guidelines are particularly problematic, because panelists may have conflicting agendas that influence guideline recommendations. Historically, {{there has been no}} legal remedy for conflicts of interest on guidelines panels. However, in May 2008, the Attorney General of Connecticut concluded a ground-breaking antitrust investigation into the development of Lyme disease treatment guidelines by one of the largest medical societies in the United States, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Although the investigation found significant flaws in the IDSA guidelines development process, the subsequent review of the guidelines mandated <b>by</b> the <b>settlement</b> was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> a lack of impartiality at various stages of the IDSA review process. This article will examine the interplay between the recent calls for guidelines reform, the ethical canons of medicine, and due process considerations under antitrust laws as they apply to the formulation of the IDSA Lyme disease treatment guidelines. The article will also discuss pitfalls in the implementation of the IDSA antitrust settlement that should be avoided in the future. </p...|$|R
