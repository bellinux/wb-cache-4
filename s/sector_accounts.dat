In addition, this project identifies strategies for making the accounting curriculum more public sector inclusive. The findings suggest that currently there is limited teaching of public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> in Australian universities. The implications of these findings suggest that accounting graduates may not have gained basic knowledge of the accounting reporting requirements in the public <b>sector.</b> Universities and <b>accounting</b> departments appear to rely on academics who have a research interest in the public sector to include public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> examples into their teaching and the curriculum. It is suggested that a multi-faceted effort is required from the professional accounting bodies, government agencies and accounting academics to facilitate greater public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> in the curriculum...|$|R

40|$|Accounting systems play {{a hidden}} but {{fundamental}} role as mode and instrument of representation, coordination and organisation {{for the public}} sector and its specific public action. Therefore, financial and accounting reforms transform, implement and reshape public policies {{as well as the}} working and very existence of public administration. Last March 2013, the European Commission started a relevant project with the intention to create harmonised “European Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards” (EPSAS) and implement them in the Member States. Between 1995 and 2002, a similar project was already achieved for private <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> standards-setting, leading to adoption and implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The EPSAS project should decide if public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> standards-setting shall follow a similar pattern to converge towards the International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (IPSAS) that transplant the IFRS in the public sector. This choice may have fundamental implications for the European (Monetary) Union, since public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> and public finances are fundamental elements of its institutional framework.

The entire project {{is based on the assumption}} that the “superiority of the accruals principle, whether for macro or micro fiscal monitoring, is indisputable” (EC, 2013, p. 6). The paper offers critical perspective on the possible adoption of the European Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (EPSAS) inspired by the International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (IPSAS). More specifically, the paper deals with the theoretical concepts of harmonization, standardization, and unification, as defined by the international accounting literature, with a view to identify the possible consequences of the public accounting unification process that is going to be promoted by the EU. In the European Union perspective, accounting unification is a desirable outcome, a pre-condition for attaining, measuring, controlling, and demonstrating budgetary equilibrium, according to a strictly rational logic consistent with a functionalist perspective of public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting.</b> Such an approach, it is argued in the paper, leads to a misunderstanding of public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting,</b> which is considered as a neutral technology whereas it is actually a tool of commensuration with a strong influence on the economic and political life of social communities, since it generates interpretative categories and contributes to change social relationships and values prioritization...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the reasons why Sri Lanka adopted International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards (IPSAS) recently. Many less {{developed}} countries (LDCs) have introduced IPSAS during the recent past. However, little research has been conducted to study the New Public Financial Management and accrual accounting and their impact on LDCs. Methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach, the methods of this paper consist of interviews, a documentary review and participatory observation in the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) and Auditor General&# 039;s Department of Sri Lanka, and present a critical interpretation supported by the perspective of globalisation. Findings: The findings of the research indicate that the public sector reforms and the transition from cash accounting to accrual accounting in the public sector have been strongly affected by the global pressures imposed by international agencies such as International Public <b>Sector</b> <b>Accounting</b> Standards Board (IPSASB) and the World Bank (WB). Empirical evidence shows the dysfunctional impact of globalisation in the public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> standards as there are major structural issues yet to resolve. There are increasing doubts over whether the change to accrual accounting is worth the costs and the additional risks involved. Research limitations: The results of the interviews are based on the knowledge and past experiences of interviewees. What is generalisable is an understanding of the processes and mechanisms that relate to the way the public <b>sector</b> <b>accounting</b> functions.
