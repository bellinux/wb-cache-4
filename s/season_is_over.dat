5|$|The NHL Entry Draft {{eligibility}} requires {{players to}} have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order {{is determined by the}} previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order of placement in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order is determined by the Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular <b>season</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> a weighted lottery is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the lottery could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing some teams from winning the top selection regardless of winning the lottery. During that time, the Islanders won the lottery twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009). The team finished last in the league standings in the 2000–01 season, but picked second in the draft after the Atlanta Thrashers won the lottery.|$|E

It has been recorded by pilots flying more than a mile above the surface of the earth, including one seen at [...] It is incapable of perching upright like most birds do; instead, it clings to vertical surfaces.

This behavior can result in a loud [...] "thundering" [...] sound if large roosts of the birds are disturbed. The sound is thought to be the bird's way of scaring away potential predators.|$|E
