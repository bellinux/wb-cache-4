It was not necessary to turn the ashes into an actual bar soap, such as those now mixed with olive oil and lime for the production of an alkaline <b>sodium</b> <b>soap.</b> The congealed extract from the barilla plants was sufficient in cleansing the operculum. Barilla plants include such desert flora as the Jointed Anabasis (Anabasis articulata), as also other related plants, such as saltwort (Salsola kali, or Salsola soda, or Seidlitzia rosmarinus), all of which are native to the regions about Judaea and were used in soap making since time immemorial. The medieval Jewish commentator, RASHI, held a similar view, saying that the soap either comes from a place called Karshina, or else it is made from a peculiar soap herb called by that name. Elsewhere, in Malachi 3:2, Rashi explains the words [...] "fullers' soap" [...] as implying, in Old French, [...] "saponaire" [...] (Saponaria). The famous 18th century Yemenite scholar and Rabbi, Yiḥye Ṣāliḥ, also defines Karshinah as being an alkali plant called in غاسول, any plant whose ashes are used in making a soap containing a fatty acid with soda. The Karshinah soap is not a true incense, but was rather used to scrub therewith the operculum, and thereby improve it. Maharitz, citing the Kol Bo, says that the purport of using this soap was to whiten the operculum withal, since its natural color was black and tended to darken the other constituents if not cleaned first in this manner. No more than nine kabs of karshinah were needed for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{of sodium}} soaps in dilute aqueous salt solutions has been systematically investigated by direct visual phase behavior observations. The added electrolytes, including simple inorganic salts and bulky organic salts, influence the solubility of sodium soaps in water, {{as represented by}} the varied soap Krafft point. Two inorganic salts, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, demonstrate a "salting-out" property. On the other hand, tetraalkylammonium bromides show an excellent ability to depress the soap Krafft point and enhance the soap solubility in water. With increasing the tetraalkylammonium ionic size, the degree of "salting-in" of soaps in water increases. However, solubility of pure tetraalkylammonium bromide in water decreases as {{the length of the}} alkyl chains increases. Furthermore, in the ternary water-tetrapentylammonium bromide (TPeAB) -sodium myristate (NaMy) system, we observed an upper cloud point phenomenon, which greatly shrinks the 1 -phase micellar solution region in the phase diagram. This miscibility gap, together with the organic salt solubility limitation, restricts the use of tetraalkylammonium bromides with alkyl chains longer than 4 carbon atoms as effective soap solubility enhancement electrolytes.

30|$|RSO {{may become}} {{significant}} as a raw {{material in the}} pyrolysis process due to its relatively high oil content, geological distribution over a wide area, free availability and non-edible nature. The identification of the potential of RSO to produce SMOC will be an added advantage for rubber plantations. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids is important for obtaining different SMOC since saturated fatty acids are especially suitable for obtaining linear hydrocarbons (Knothe et al. 1997). The total content of unsaturated fatty acids in rubber seed oil is relatively {{higher than those of}} palm and coconut oils but is comparable with that of soybean oil. The fatty acid composition of soybean oil is Linoleic 54.51  %, Oleic 22.98  %, Stearic 4.09  %, Palmitic 10.58  %, and Linolenic 7.23  % (Farzana et al. 2011) whereas the fatty acid composition of RSO is Linoleic 39.60  %, Oleic 24.60  %, stearic 8.70  %, Palmitic 0.2  % and Linolenic 16.30  % (Junaid et al. 2014). The pyrolysis of soybean oil has produced olefins, paraffins, carboxylic acids and aldehydes of C 10 –C 18 (Junming et al. 2009) and hence, RSO also has a potential to become a good renewable source for pyrolysis. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} identify the SMOC obtained by the pyrolysis process of RSO and <b>sodium</b> <b>soap</b> of RSO as an alternative renewable source for petrochemicals.|$|E
40|$|It will be {{seen from}} the above that we have studied the {{conditions}} associated with the deposit of calcareous salts: (I) in connection with normal and pathological ossification, and (2) in pathological calcification as exhibited in (a) atheroma of the vessels; (b) calcification of caseating tubercular lesions; (c) calcification of inflammatory new growth, and (d) degenerating tumors; and we have induced experimentally deposits of calcareous salts in the lower animals: (a) within celloidin capsules containing fats and soaps; (b) in the kidney, and (c) in connection with fat necrosis. I. We have found that bone formation and pathological calcareous infiltration are wholly distinct processes. In the former {{there is no evidence of}} associated fatty change, and the cells associated with the process of deposition of calcium are functionally active. In the latter there is an antecedent fatty change in the affected areas, and the cells involved present constant evidences of degeneration. The view that would seem to account best for the changes observed in the latter case is that with lowered vitality the cells are unable to utilize the products brought to them by the blood, or which they continue to absorb, so that the normal series of decompositions associated with their metabolism fails to take place and hence they interact among themselves in the cytoplasm with the result that insoluble compounds replace soluble ones. II. Besides the fact that calcification is always preceded by fatty change within the cells, another fact should be emphasized. namely: that combination of the fats present with calcium salts to form calcium soaps tends to occur. The stages immediately preceding these are difficult to follow with anything approaching certainty, perhaps because the earlier stages vary under different conditions. In fat necrosis, for instance, the cells affected are normally storehouses for neutral fats, and as long as they remain healthy neutral fats alone are present in them. When they are subjected to the action of the pancreatic juice with its fat-splitting ferment the cells are killed and coincidently the neutral fats are decomposed, fatty acids being deposited. The fatty acids now slowly combine with the calcium salts. In degenerating lipomata the process would seem to be similar. But in other cases the cells are not obviously fat-containing in the normal state; nevertheless prior to calcification they undergo so-called fatty degeneration, which is really a form of cell degeneration accompanied by fat infiltration. As regards the source of the cell fats in general we may safely accept: 1. That fats are transported in the blood as diffusible soaps. 2. That taken up by the cells these soaps may either— (a) Be reconverted into neutral fats and become stored in the cytoplasm as such, or (b) undergo assimilation proper, becoming part and parcel of the cell substance, in which case they are not recognizable by the ordinary microchemical tests. 3. If these two possibilities be accepted it follows that the appearance of fats and soaps in the degenerating cell may be due to either— (a) Absorption or infiltration of soaps from the surrounding medium, the degenerating cell retaining the power of splitting off the fat but being unable to utilize this in metabolism. (b) Cytoplasmic disintegration with dissociation of the soap-albumen combination or, more broadly, liberation of the fats from their combination with the cytoplasm. The appearances seen in the cells of atheromatous areas indicate that the first of these does occur. III. In areas undergoing calcareous infiltration we have demonstrated. the presence of soaps, and this often in such quantities that they can be isolated and estimated by gross chemical methods. By microchemical methods also we have been able to show that after removing all the neutral fats and fatty acids by petroleum ether there remains behind a substance giving with Sudan III the reaction we associate with the presence of soap. And experimentally we have produced these soaps within the organism, more particularly by placing capsules containing fats and fatty acids within the tissues and after several days finding that the capsules contain calcium soaps and possess a calcium content far in excess of that of the normal blood and lymph. IV. While these are the facts, certain of the details of this reaction demand elucidation. The existence of sodium and it may be potassium soaps in the degenerated cells is comprehensible if we accept that these are present in the circulating lymph and simply undergoing absorption. But even then, as these are diffusible substances how is it to be explained that they become stored up in these particular areas? We have found that, as a matter of fact, in regions which give the reaction for soaps, but which give no reaction for calcium (which therefore presumably contain at most amounts of the insoluble calcium soap too small to need consideration, the ordinary solvents for potassium and sodium soaps do not forthwith remove the stainable material; they are relatively insoluble. The reason for this insolubility is suggested by the observations made in the test tube, that soap solutions mixed with solutions of white of egg or blood serum form a precipitate of combined soap and albumen, which likewise is insoluble in water and alcohol. The indications are therefore that in cells undergoing degeneration, with degeneration of the cytoplasm, certain albuminous molecules unite with the soaps present to form relatively insoluble soap-albuminate. V. With regard to calcium soaps, these are also present and in certain stages appear to be the dominating form in the affected tissues. Two questions suggest themselves, viz. : what is the source of calcium, and what is the process by which they become formed? As to the source, the amount present in well-marked calcification is far in excess of the normal calcium contents of the affected tissue. If in the kidneys of experimental calcification three hundred times as much calcium may be present as in the normal kidney (von Kossa), the calcium must be conveyed to the part by the blood and lymph, and that this is so is demonstrated, as we have pointed out, by the distribution of the infiltration in solid organs, that like ovarian fibroids have undergone necrosis, in which the earliest deposits are superficial. As to the process, there are three possibilities: 1. That sodium and potassium soaps and soap albuminates are first formed and that interaction occurs between them and the diffused calcium salts from the lymph, the less soluble-calcium replacing the sodium and potassium. 2. That under certain conditions the calcium salts act directly on the neutral fats present in the degenerating cells. 3. That the neutral fats are first broken down into fatty acids and that these react with the calcium salts to form the soaps. We are assured that the first process occurs and that because in the boundary zone of areas of calcification we can detect soapy particles devoid of calcium, identical in position and arrangement with the particles more deeply placed which give the calcium reactions. But this is not the only reaction. In case of fat necrosis we see clearly that the third process is in evidence. And we are far from being convinced that the second does not also obtain. We have been impressed by the large accumulation of neutral fats in the cells in cases of early atheroma and the absence at any stage of the process of recognizable fatty acid. While soaps, it is true, are compounds of fatty acids with alkalies, it is recognized in ordinary domestic life that they can be formed by the direct action of strong lye upon ordinary fats, and this even in the cold. It is quite possible therefore that there occurs a similar direct process in the organism. The point is worth noting, however, that this does not occur in healthy cells the seat of fatty infiltration. We therefore leave this an open question, only laying down that, as indicated by the hyalin albuminous matrix left when calcium salts are dissolved out of an area of calcification, there must exist a calcium soap- or fat-albuminate similar to the potassium and sodium soap-albuminates already mentioned—such an albuminate as we can form with calcium soaps in the test tube. VI. In old areas of calcification soaps are largely if not entirely wanting, although these are to be detected at the periphery, when the process is still advancing. The reactions given by these older areas are almost entirely those of calcium phosphate, though some calcium carbonate is at times to be made out. This seems surely to indicate that the final stage in calcification is an interaction between the calcium soap-albuminates and substances containing phosphoric and carbonic acids. Such substances, it is needless to say, are present in considerable amounts in the lymph and blood. We must conclude that the acid sodium phosphates of the lymph act on the calcium soap, the highly insoluble calcium phosphates being formed (plus the albuminous moiety of the original compound) and diffusible <b>sodium</b> <b>soap</b> being liberated, while similarly alkaline carbonates form calcium carbonate and liberate sodium and potassium soaps. Calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate thus become the insoluble earthy salts of old crystalline areas of calcification. VII. As already stated very little soap is to be found in these old areas. It is possibly worth suggestion that the soaps liberated in this last reaction, as they diffuse out, again react with diffusible calcium salts and form calcium soaps which once more react with the alkaline salts to produce the phosphates and carbonates; that, in short, they have a katalytic action. Certain it is that old calcareous areas are extraordinarily dense, and have a coarse crystalline structure, wholly at variance with the finely granular appearance of the more recent areas, and these large crystalline masses, it would seem, can only be formed by successive deposition of new material and eventual fusion, as the interspaces become filled in between the original masses...|$|E

In this thesis, four related aspects of naphthenate deposits are studied, as follows: (i) Characterization of various field naphthenates samples from different parts of the world, involving naphthenic acid extraction method development and subsequent extract analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (APCI MS) techniques. It was observed that different naphthenic acid extraction and analysis methods affected the naphthenic acid identification and apparent composition; (ii) Geochemical studies have been carried out on various crude oils which form calcium naphthenate deposits, <b>sodium</b> carboxylate <b>soaps</b> and emulsions. Biomarker correlation analysis was employed on the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the crude oil samples using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS); (iii) Thermodynamic modelling of naphthenate formation was carried out, and both a simple thermodynamic pH change naphthenate model and a full naphthenate precipitation model have been developed. This thermodynamic model describes the chemistry of a simple partitioning “pseudo” naphthenic acid which may form calcium naphthenate “precipitate”, according to a solubility product type description.

50|$|Zinc {{phosphate}} coatings {{are frequently}} {{used in conjunction}} with <b>sodium</b> stearate (<b>soap)</b> to form a lubrication layer in cold and hot forging. The sodium stearate reacts with the phosphate crystal which in turn are strongly bonded to the metal surface. The reacted soap layer then forms a base for additional unreacted soap to be deposited on top so that a thick three part coating of zinc phosphate, reacted soap and unreacted soap is built up. The resulting coating remains adhered to the metal surface even under extreme deformation. The zinc phosphate is in fact abrasive and it is the soap which performs the actual lubrication. The soap layer must be thick enough to prevent substantial contact between the metal forming dies and phosphate crystal.|$|R
5000|$|... {{also known}} as {{saponification}} {{is an example of}} a nucleophilic acyl substitution with the hydroxide ion acting as a nucleophile. In this case the leaving group is an alkoxide ion, which immediately removes a proton from a water molecule to form an alcohol. In the manufacture of <b>soap,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride is added to salt out the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid; this is an example of the application of the common-ion effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancing}} {{effect of}} the synthetic wetting agents Tween 40, Tween 60, and Tween 80 on the growth of tubercle bacilli {{is due in part}} to the fact that these water-dispersible, esters constitute for the bacteria a non-toxic source of palmitic, stearic, or oleic acid. Indeed, enhancement of growth can also be observed with the <b>sodium</b> <b>soaps</b> of these same fatty acids, as well as of linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids, provided that the bacilli are protected against the toxic action of these soaps, for example by the addition of serum albumin to the medium (6). In addition to long chain fatty acids, there exist in tissues other lipids which enhance the growth of tubercle bacilli (1, 2, 5, 10). Further study of this problem has led to the recognition that, in this respect, sphingomyelin is more active than any of the other naturally occurring phospholipids and cerebrosides tested in our laboratory. It will be shown in the present paper that the addition to simple culture media of sphingomyelin prepared from various tissues markedly increases the density of growth within a short period of incubation and also facilitates initiation of growth from small inocula, even in the absence of serum albumin or other protein. EX-PERI~NTAL All experiments described in the present report were carried out with a virulent culture of the strain of human tubercle bacillus I-I 37 Rv recently recovered from infected mouse lung and maintained in the Tween-albumin medium described elsewhere (8). The 10 day old culture used for inoculation consisted of finely dispersed bacilli and contained approximately 0. 35 rag. bacillary cells (dry weight) per cc. of medium. The basal medium used in the experiments had the following composition...|$|R
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make <b>sodium</b> hydroxide for <b>soaps</b> and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|R
