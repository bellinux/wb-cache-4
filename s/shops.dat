5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain <b>shops</b> where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, <b>shops</b> are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the <b>shops</b> are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of <b>shops</b> throughout the game: boot <b>shops</b> allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor <b>shops</b> contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield <b>shops</b> contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical <b>shops</b> allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, three metaheuristics are {{proposed}} for solving {{a class of}} job <b>shop,</b> open <b>shop,</b> and mixed <b>shop</b> scheduling problems. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithms by means of a set of Lawrence’s benchmark instances for the job <b>shop</b> problem, a set of randomly generated instances for the open <b>shop</b> problem, and a combined job <b>shop</b> and open <b>shop</b> test data for the mixed <b>shop</b> problem. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely well on all these three types of <b>shop</b> scheduling problems. The results also reveal that the mixed <b>shop</b> problem is relatively easier to solve than the job <b>shop</b> problem {{due to the fact that}} the scheduling procedure becomes more flexible by the inclusion of more open <b>shop</b> jobs in the mixed <b>shop...</b>|$|R
