40|$|The EU is {{developing}} a border management strategy aiming at an “integrated and global response ” to the challenges posed by the phenomenon of irregular immigration through the common external borders. “The <b>Southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>borders</b> ” constitute {{one of the main}} targets addressed by this strategy. On November 2006, the European Commission published a communication calling for the reinforced management of the EU’s <b>Southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>borders</b> and for the maximisation of the capacities of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union – FRONTEX. This paper provides some reflections about these current policy approaches by looking at the nature, scope and practical implications of the implementation of the Integrated Border Management strategy and its relationship with a common EU immigration policy. After assessing the latest policy developments in these areas, we raise a number of questions about some of the functions and capacities carried out by FRONTEX, and present a series of vulnerabilities characterising the joint operations coordinated by this Community body taking th...|$|E
40|$|Frontex {{has been}} often criticised {{for failing to}} take action against the deaths of asylum seekers and {{migrants}} trying to reach Europe by crossing the sea. The EU’s border agency Frontex is an easy target for criticism regarding {{the way in which the}} EU’s <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>borders</b> are controlled. However, a closer look at the Agency’s tasks reveals that its powers are limited and that the responsibility for operational activity at sea continues to lie largely with the Member States. The EU should speak out against Member States’ practices that are in breach of international refugee law and use Frontex as a tool to increase the awareness of protection issues amongst national border-guard authorities...|$|E
40|$|The Maltese {{archipelago}} {{has always}} been the object of intense migration patterns and is a site of intense historical as well as modern competition over sovereignty. It is also the object of intense Anthropological intrigue specifically in the instance of Jeremy Boissevain and others. Possible reasons for this include its colourful history of occupations by various peoples from the Mediterranean, the Middle East as well as North Africa. It is also a series of Islands of immense strategic value, both historically and more recently as one of three <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>borders</b> of “Fortress Europe”.

40|$|British Columbia {{shares a}} <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> with Washington State that bisects the Gulf Islands from the San Juan Islands. The RCMP is {{responsible}} for the <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> security between ports of entry. Challenges to <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> enforcement include a lack of marine domain awareness, globalization, terrorism, transnational organized crime and drug trafficking, criminal networks, and jurisdictional issues. The RCMP have partnered with the US Coast Guard to enforce cross-border criminality in a program called the Integrated Cross-border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations Act (ICMLEO), also referred to as Shiprider. The Shiprider program was implemented under the standard model of policing. By gathering and utilizing better information, adapting an intelligence-led approach, and leveraging technology, the Shiprider program could become more efficacious...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 25 years the <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> of the European Union {{witnessed}} {{the interaction of}} considerable and increasingly complex irregular migration flows in the Mediterranean with the progressive construction and implementation of restrictive migration control policies by the European Union and its member states at their external borders. The article describes the evolving migration patterns and changes in migration routes both as a stimulus and a consequence of locally stepping up migration control at the emerging hotspots at {{different parts of the}} border, creating deviation effects in migration routes with alternative points of entry and higher costs and risks for migrants. Special attention is given to the impact of the 2015 refugee crisis on border management and the new challenges it poses to the asylum system and the protection of fundamental rights. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{policing}} the external {{borders of the}} European Union (EU), an issue that recently has witnessed significant developments {{in connection with the}} externalisation of the fight against undocumented migration. After a presentation of the conceptual elements underpinning the research (1), the paper presents the EU agency Frontex and its origin, tasks and responsibilities (2). The next section will focus on Frontex-led operations carried out at the <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> (3), in order to critically look at issues arising in this context (4), with reference to their legal framework. The results of my analysis will be discussed in connection with the externalisation of migration policies, arguing that the EU and Member States (MSs) have engaged into a multiple exercise of venue shopping, to conclude with a (hopeful) outlook on the future, with the Lisbon Treaty providing new possibilities to fix current problems (5) ...|$|R
40|$|Largely in {{response}} to irregular migration flows, a Euro-African border is under construction at the southern edges of Europe. The latest phase in this 'borderwork' is a system known as Eurosur, underpinned by {{a vision of a}} streamlined surveillance cover of Europe's <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>border</b> and the African 'pre-frontier' beyond it. Eurosur and other policing initiatives pull in a range of sectors - from border guards to aid workers - that make the statistically small figure of the irregular border crosser their joint target. To highlight the economic and productive aspects of controlling migratory flows, I call this varied group of interests an 'illegality industry'. Casting an eye on the Spanish section of the external EU border, this article investigates how the illegality industry conceptualizes migrants as a source of risk to be managed, visualized and controlled. The end result, it is argued, is a 'double securitization' of migrant flows, rendering these as both a security threat and a growing source of profits...|$|R

40|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{refugee crisis}} in Europe of 2015 - 2016 has revealed several unfinished elements and shortcomings in current EU policies and approaches to migration, asylum and borders, particularly those applying in <b>southern</b> EU <b>maritime</b> <b>borders</b> and frontier {{states in the}} Mediterranean. This book provides a critical examination of the main issues and lessons learned from this crisis and gives an up-to-date assessment of the main policy, legal and institutional responses that {{have been put in}} place at the EU level. It further examines {{the extent to which these}} responses can be expected to work under the current system of sharing responsibilities among EU member states in assessing asylum applications and ensuring a consistent implementation of EU legal standards that comply with the rule of law and fundamental rights. This report is based on original research and draws upon the existing literature, along with the discussions of a CEPS Task Force that met over six months, under the chairmanship of Enrico Letta, President of the Jacques Delors Institute, Dean of the Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) at Sciences Po and former Prime Minister of Italy. The rapporteurs offer specific recommendations and possible scenarios for policy optimisation and assess the extent to which the establishment of a European Border and Asylum Service (EBAS) could address the current gaps and challenges in EU and member states’ migration policies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the immigration control policies of three southern European countries: Greece, Italy and Spain. The paper outlines the flows of irregular migrants through the EU’s <b>southern</b> <b>maritime</b> and land <b>borders</b> {{and seeks to}} assess the character and effect of the policies {{put in place to}} manage and/or stop these flows. The paper argues that policies have become increasingly based on international cooperation between countries of origin/transit and countries of destination rather than mere enforcement. However, their effectiveness remains questionable especially if onecompares the number of immigrants discouraged or arrested with the sums of money spent. The role of human smuggling networks as well as the strong motivation of immigrants to reach a European country, are important factors {{that need to be addressed}} in the border management policy of EU countries. Moreover, there needs to be more coordination between general migration management policies, channels for legal migration, regularization policies and policies for border control. To this day, such coordination is only partial. The importance of a EU policy on migration control from the South cannot be underestimated either although the costs and benefits of such policy need also to be more carefully considered...|$|R
