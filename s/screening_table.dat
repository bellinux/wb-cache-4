40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{attrition}} behavior of the first accessions, fiscal year 1984 accessions, into the Sea/Air Mariner (SAM) program and develop an improved <b>screening</b> <b>table</b> for SAM applicants. Data files of active Navy, Ready Mariner, and SAM personnel were used as the basis for applying statistical methods to develop an improved <b>screening</b> <b>table.</b> This study found serious deficiencies with the SAM data file. The necessity that manpower data be accurate and reliable must be continually emphasized. Data should be screened for accuracy prior to being sent to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Continued efforts to develop selection standard models are essential, for it is through these efforts that the cost of recruiting and training Naval personnel can be reduced.

40|$|The ARM Series {{of three}} output DC/DC {{converters}} are {{designed specifically for}} use in the high-dose radiation environments encountered during deep space planetary missions. The extremely high level of radiation tolerance inherent in the ARM design is assured as a result of extensive research, thorough analysis and testing, careful selection of components and lot verification testing of finished hybrids. Many of the best circuit design features characterizing earlier International Rectifier products have been incorporated into the ARM topology. Capable of uniformly high performance through long term exposures in radiation intense environments, this series sets the standard for distributed power systems demanding high performance and reliability. The ARM converters are hermetically sealed in a rugged, low profile package utilizing copper core pins to minimize resistive DC losses. Long-term hermeticity is assured through use of parallel seam welded lid attachment along with International Rectifier’s rugged ceramic pin-to-package seal. Axial lead orientation facilitates preferred bulkhead mounting to the principal heat-dissipating surface. Manufactured in a facility fully qualified to MIL-PRF- 38534, these converters are fabricated utilizing DSCC qualified processes.

The ATW 28300 S DC-DC converter features high power density and an extended temperature range {{for use in}} mil i tary and industrial applications. Designed to MIL-STD- 704 D input requirements, this device operates with a nominal 28 VDC input with an adjustable output of 150 to 300 V via external potentiometer.

HYBRID HIGH-RELIABILITY DC-DC CONVERTER Manufactured in a facility fully qualified to MIL-PRF- 38534, this converter is available in four screening grades to satisfy a wide range of requirements. The CH grade is fully compliant to the requirements of MIL-PRF- 38534 for class H. The HB grade is processed and screened to the class H requirement, but may not necessarily meet all of the other MIL-PRF- 38534 requirements, e. g., element evaluation and periodic inspection not required. Both grades are tested to meet the complete group “A ” test specification over the full military temperature range without output power deration.

Materials and Methods: In this research, the gums of plant root were collected from the Heidary nature reserve in Razavi Khorasan Province (Iran) in August 2012. The ethnopharmacological data about traditional uses of plant were obtained from the rural healers (women 67 - 75 year) of this region. Essential oil of the plant root gum was obtained by hydrodistillation (Clevenger apparatus) and was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Antibacterial activity of plant ethanolic extract was studied in vitro against Candida albicans and 9 Gram-positive and negative bacteria using well method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Results: Results showed that a total of 39 components have been identified in the plant sampl oil, representing 81 % of the total oil and β-pinene (19. 88 %), guaiol (8 %), shyobunone (6. 96 %), delta-cadinene (4. 65 %), α-pinene (3. 16 %), β-phellandrene (3. 28 %) and myrtenol (2. 8 %), were the main essential oil composition, respectively. The results from antibacterial <b>screening</b> (<b>Table</b> 2), were showed that C. albicans (25. 2 ± 1. 6), Staphylococcus epidermidis (23. 6 ± 0. 7 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (21. 3 ± 0. 2 mm), Escherichia coli (16. 5 ± 0. 8 mm), Bacillus cereus (19. 5 ± 0. 1 mm), Enterococcus faecalis (17. 2 ± 0. 8 mm) and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (17. 8 ± 0. 2 mm) inhibition zone and MIC (35. 4 - 112 μg/ml) were the most sensitive pathogenes to the plant extract respectively, which followed Shigella (12. 3 ± 0. 3 mm) and Klebsiella pneumonia (12. 5 ± 0. 2 mm) were found to be moderate sensitive bacteria and then the Salmonella typhymorium which completely was resistant to plant root extract.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} improve the {{acoustic}} comfort of the users in open plan offices, several solutions are proposed. One of them consists in the installation of a small absorbing screen between two face to face work stations. The height of this <b>table</b> <b>screen</b> is variable. Nowadays {{it is difficult to}} predict accurately the efficiency of this kind of installation. A typical case of an office work station has been modeled and different heights of the <b>table</b> <b>screen</b> have been investigated through simulation. Two simulation methods have been compared: The first one (ICARE software developed at CSTB) uses asymptotic methods and is based on beam tracing including edge diffraction. The second method (MICADO 3 D software developed at CSTB) uses the resolution through the Boundary Element Method where the Green function is optimized by the use of a source image technique. The simulation results show the insertion loss for the <b>table</b> <b>screen</b> and permits to determine the most efficient height for the protection between two work stations.

Method We began screening HIV-positive patients for LTBI in July 2011; this prospective study reports our 3 year data. Patients had an IGRA (T-SPOT.
