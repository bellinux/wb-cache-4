5000|$|The railway was {{serviced}} by three Avonside Engines J.Crotty (No.1)(AE 1392/1899), JP Lonergan (No.2)(AE 1393/1899), and DJ Mackay (No.3)(AE 1394/1899). It also had three <b>Shay</b> <b>engines</b> - Number 4 (Lima 698/1902) - 3 cylinder two truck, Number 5 (Lima 697/1902), Number 6 (Lima 704/1902) ...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{and wooden}} {{trestles}} supported railroad tracks on the West Side Dock at Kelleys Island. Stone was hauled from the quarries by narrow-gauge <b>Shay</b> <b>engines</b> on movable track. With {{the construction of}} four docks on Kelleys Island, the Kelleys Island Limestone &amp; Transport Company consolidated limestone quarrying and shipping operations into an efficient, profitable enterprise...|$|R
40|$|Lima (Ohio) Locomotive Works built eight <b>Shay</b> <b>engines</b> for Kelleys Island Lime and Transport Company {{to use at}} its Kelleys Island quarries. Number 30 was a straight-boiler engine used until {{quarrying}} {{ended on}} the island. Connecting the island quarries by rail greatly facilitated the transporting of stone and flux to the lime kilns {{and then to the}} Kelleys Island docks for shipping...|$|R

A 70-ton <b>Shay</b> <b>engine,</b> used to pull a typical logging {{railroad}}, is in the back in the center. A railroad flatcar, which carried the logs, is on the right.|$|E
50|$|World War II {{interrupted}} construction plans, but by 1954 {{the cornerstone}} was laid—a stone {{from the original}} White House, Washington, D.C. Since that time, the Historical Society has amassed a large collection of items—both local and international. Archival and documentary railroad collections include builder's prints and diagrams from the Lima Locomotive Works, which was the third largest steam locomotive builder in the United States. Central {{to the production of}} the Lima Locomotive Works was the <b>Shay</b> <b>engine,</b> invented by Ephraim Shay.|$|E
50|$|Forks {{displays}} {{one of a}} few <b>Shay</b> <b>engines</b> {{remaining in}} Washington. Shay locomotives are unusual in that they have a crank shaft running down the side, powering all wheels. They were designed to be used to transport lumber out of forests. Rayonier #10 (c/n 3348) was built for stock by Lima in 1930. It has three cylinders and three trucks. The Ozette Timber Company bought it 11 years later. In 1945 it was acquired by Rayonier for their lumber operation near Forks. It was retired near the north end of Forks in Tillicum Park in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The Shay Logging Locomotive is a <b>Shay</b> {{locomotive}} <b>engine</b> {{located on}} Cass Street in City Park in Cadillac, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1981.|$|R
2500|$|In 1901, Pennsylvania {{entrepreneur}} Colonel Wilson B. Townsend purchased [...] of land along Little River {{and established}} the Little River Lumber Company. Townsend {{set up a}} band saw mill in Tuckaleechee Cove, laying {{the foundation for the}} town that would later bear his name. [...] Rather than splash dams, which are {{at the mercy of the}} volatile mountain streams, Townsend constructed a logging railroad between the company's sawmill in Tuckaleechee and the river's upper reaches, all the way to the Three Forks area (where the river absorbs Fish Camp Prong and Rough Creek). [...] The railroad was later extended to Walland, connecting it to Maryville and Knoxville. [...] The railroad employed 10 <b>Shay</b> <b>engines</b> to move the log-filled flatcars along the river valley. [...] Logging skidders were used to pull trees from the steeper slopes. [...] Elkmont was established in 1908 as a transfer station where logs were moved from gear-operated trains (used for reaching higher elevations) to rod-operated trains for transport to the sawmill at Townsend.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, the {{operations}} of the Goodyear's lumbering company was noted as being the most extensive in the state of Pennsylvania. The mills at Austin, Galeton, and Cross Fork were the most modern in style, and included all the newest and most up-to-date machinery. The mill at Austin was listed as the largest in the state. The Goodyear's employed 2400 men, working 10 hr day. They owned 11 log loaders manufactured by the Marion Steam Shovel Co. (Goodyear owned the patent). Five <b>shay</b> <b>engines</b> moved 207 log cars. One Shay locomotive would handle two log loaders, and about 30 log cars. There were 75 mi of logging railroads, which were constantly moved around to uncut parts of the forest. These logging railroads then connected with the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. It was reported in 1898, that the Goodyear's had 10 years worth of timber left. Some of the mills operated 22 hours per day, and used electric lights to keep the men working at night.|$|R

50|$|Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio built Ephraim <b>Shay's</b> {{prototype}} <b>engine</b> in 1880.Prior to 1884, all the Shays Lima produced weighed 10 to 15 ST {{each and}} had just two cylinders. In 1884, they delivered the first 3-cylinder (Class B) Shay, and in 1885, the first 3-truck (Class C) Shay. The success of the Shay led to a major expansion and reorganization of the Lima company. When Lima first received the Shay idea it was not impressed, until John Carnes influenced the company to use the idea, resulting in the classic Shay design.|$|R
50|$|Patrons of the tramway {{included}} {{more than the}} local population. Passengers from Brisbane would travel to Palmwoods to meet the tram and then journey to Buderim. The tram consisted of perhaps some thirteen wagons, one passenger coach and a guard/brake van, pulled behind a German Krauss or American <b>Shay</b> steam <b>engine.</b> The flat-top wagons had fruit cases placed down their centres along which planks of timber were arranged to form central seats. In this manner about 150 passengers could be carried each trip. and at times two trips per day were made. The visitors would stay {{in one of the}} Buderim Guest/Boarding Houses, or travel down to the coast.|$|R
50|$|Komoka {{village is}} a {{crossing}} point for many railway lines and was formerly a railway hot spot featuring various hotels and development. Today, the Komoka Railway museum keeps the local railway history alive and features unique artifacts {{such as a}} 1913 <b>Shay</b> Steam <b>Engine</b> and a 1972 Grand Trunk Western caboose. There is an elementary school - Parkview Public School, and Providence Reformed Collegiate − a private Christian high school, and the new Komoka Wellness Centre in the village. The village also supports a number of youth sports teams, including baseball and soccer. The Komoka Park has two baseball and two soccer fields, tennis courts, and a children's play area. There are two small business areas in the village: the downtown Komoka Foodtown and Post Office area, and the Glendon Drive / Komoka Road intersection with a bank, gas stations and variety stores, restaurants, and hair salon.|$|R
