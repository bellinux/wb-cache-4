5000|$|The northeastern active fold belt of Iran, the Kopet Dagh, {{is formed}} on the Hercynian metamorphosed {{basement}} at the southwestern {{margin of the}} Turan Platform. The belt is composed of about 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments (mostly carbonates) and, like the Zagros, was folded into long linear northwest-southeast trending folds during the last phase of the Alpine Orogeny, in the Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene time. No magmatic rocks are exposed in Kopet Dagh except {{for those in the}} basement in the Aghdarband and some Triassic basic dikes. This basin was located in the northeastern Iran. From Middle Jurassic, it was covered with a vast continental shelf sea. In this period of time and due to transgression as well as rapid subsidence basin, the western part became deeper. In this basin, a thick sequence of continuous marine and continental sediments was deposited (about 10 km). No major sedimentary gap or volcanic activities during Jurassic to Miocene have ever been reported. This <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> provides suitable conditions for accumulation of hydrocarbons. Kopet Dagh sedimentary rocks were placed in their current position due to uplifting {{at the end of the}} Miocene. The Kopet Dag Range, itself, is made chiefly of Cretaceous rocks with a smaller portion of Jurassic rocks in the southeastern parts. The mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during the Alpine orogeny. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise rotation of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Turan Platform. This collision folded the entire rocks that had been deposited in this geosyncline or basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene and formed the Kopet Dag Mountains.|$|E
40|$|The lithostratigraphic {{sequence}} in the Rosário–Neves Corvo antiform comprises the Phyllite–Quartzite Group, whose top is of Famennian age, the Volcanic <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Complex,</b> of Strunian to upper Visean age, and the Mértola Formation (the lower {{unit of the}} Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group) of upper Visean age. The volcanic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> comprises a lower sequence of Strunian (Late Famennian) age and an upper sequence of lower to upper Visean age. Detailed mapping of the antiform towards NW of the Neves Corvo mine, supported by palynological dating, identified two new lithostratigraphic units: the Barrancão member (upper Famennian) ascribed to the Phyllite–Quartzite Group and made up of laminated dark shales with siliceous lenses and nodules, and the Ribeira de Cobres Formation of the Volcanic <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>Complex,</b> containing shales, siltstones and fine volcaniclastic rocks. Based on zircon U–Pb isotope dating, five discrete felsic magmatic events were identified at approximately 354, 359, 365, 373 and 384 Ma. This suggests that the volcanic activity in the area has extended for about 30 Ma, {{in a context of}} high regional heat flow as indicated by the geochemical signatures of the felsic volcanic rocks. The characteristics of magmatism and the depositional environment indicated by the sedimentary record should therefore have been highly favourable for massive sulphide formation. However, evidence of massive sulphide mineralization in the study area is still to be found. Moreover, reconstruction of the volcanic facies architecture demonstrated that the volcanic units in the Rosário area are strongly dominated by coherent facies typical of the inner part of thick lavas/domes. In fact, most of their external part, the more favourable location for possible massive sulphide mineralization, is missing. Palynological dating indicates a significant hiatus, recognised between the lower and upper sequences of the volcanic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex,</b> which implies erosion of the top of the volcanic centre, where VHMS deposits could possibly have formed. However, lateral areas of this volcanic centre, eventually preserved at depth, have good potential to host massive sulphide mineralization...|$|E

The former three mountain blocks are made up mainly of Jurassic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex.</b> This <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> is subdivided into three tectonostratigraphic units: the Kasama, Takatori and Karasuyama Units in structurally ascending order. The Kasama Unit are composed mainly of upper Upper Jurassic sandstone and shale. Chert-clastic sequence occupies {{the lower part of}} this unit. Chert and siliceous shale are Middle Triassic and middle to upper Upper Jurasic, respectively. Uppermost Jurassic dark green shales containing many radiolarians are intercalated withiun the coarse clastic rocks. The Takatori Unit is subdividable into two parts; the lower part which is characterized by tectonic repetition of chert-clastic sequences composed of upper Lower Triassic siliceous claystone, Middle Triassic to lower Middle Jurassic chert,Middle Jurassic to middle Upper Jurassic siliceous shale and middle to upper Upper Jurassic clastic rocks, and the upper part consisting mainly of coarse clastic rocks containing Upper Jurassic shale. The Karasuyama Unit, which is distributed only in the western margin of the Torinoko Mountain Block, is made up of Upper Jurassic melange containing slabs and clasts of upper Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic chert, lower Upper Jurassic siliceous shale,Upper Jurassic sandstone and shale. These lithologic and structural features suggest that the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> in the Yamizo Mountains was formed by subduction-accretion tectonics in Late Jurassic time. Above mentioned three tectonostratigraphic units in the Yamizo Mountains are correlated with the units or complexes conducted by previous authors in the Tamba and Mino areas as follows. The Karasuyama Unit is correlated with parts of the Complex F and G of Tamba area, the Kanayama Unit of the central Mino area and melange unit of the Misogawa Complex of the eastern Mino area. The Takatori Unit corresponds with the Complex G of Tamba area, the Unit D of the central Miono area and the Misogawa and kyogatake Complexes of the eastern Mino area. The Kasama Unit may be correlated with the Yabuhara Complex of the eastern Mino area.

The proportion of particular sedimentary rock types fluctuates throughout the Mesozoic. The proportion of sandstone + siltstone changes quite similarly to that of shale. A comparison of stratigraphic data from northern Eurasia and North America reveals some similarities, including a Lower Triassic increase in the conglomerate proportion, a Middle-Upper Triassic increase {{in the proportion of}} siliceous rocks, Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic and Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous “clastic spikes”, and a Middle-Upper Jurassic “carbonate-evaporite spike”.

The evolution of the Cimini complex includes three main close-in time phases: (1) intrusion of a shallow laccolith, rising along NW and NE trending faults and stagnating at the contact between the Mesozoic-Cenozoic and the Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary units constituting the bedrock of the volcano; (2) emplacement of lava domes along radial and tangential fractures formed by the swelling induced by the laccolith growth; (3) ignimbrite eruptions and final effusion of olivine-latitic lavas. Domes are both of Pelean and low lava dome type and their morphologywas controlled by the location on the inclined surface of the swelled area.

40|$|Abstract The {{evolution}} of sedimentary basins can be explored {{by analyzing the}} changes in their lithologies and lithofacies (i. e. predominant lithologies). The Greater Caucasus Basin, which was located at the northern margin of the Neotethys Ocean, represents a complete Sinemurian-Tithonian succession. A quantitative analysis of compiled datasets suggests that principal lithologies and lithofacies are represented by siliciclastics, shale and carbonates. The relative abundance of siliciclastics and shale decreased throughout the Jurassic, whereas that of carbonates increased. Evaporites are known from the Upper Jurassic, while volcaniclastics and volcanics, as well as coals, are known only in the Lower to Middle Jurassic. Siliceous rocks are extremely rare. Lithology and lithofacies proportions change accordingly. The Sinemurian-Bathonian <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> is siliciclastic-and-shale-dominated, whereas the Callovian-Tithonian <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> is carbonate-dominated. A major change {{in the character of}} sedimentation occurred during the Aalenian-Callovian time interval. Regional transgressions and regressions were more important controls of changes in the sedimentary rock proportions than average basin depth. Landward shoreline shifts were especially favorable for carbonate accumulation, whereas siliciclastics and shale were deposited preferentially in regressive settings. An extended area of the marine basin, its lower average depth, and a sharp bathymetric gradient favored a higher diversity of sedimentation. An orogeny at the Triassic-Jurassic transition was responsible for a large proportion of siliciclastics and extensive conglomerate deposition. An arcarc collision in the Middle Jurassic also enhanced the siliciclastic deposition. Both phases of tectonic activity were linked with an increase in volcanics and volcaniclastics. Volcanism itself might have been an important control on sedimentation. A transition to carbonate-dominated sedimentation occurred in the Late Jurassic, reflecting a tectonically calm period...|$|E

40|$|The Andaman Islands {{form part}} of the outer-arc accretionary <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complex</b> {{belonging}} to the Andaman-Sumatra active subduction zone. The islands are characterized by thick cover of Neogene sediments along with exposed ophiolite rocks at few places. A regional magnetic survey was carried {{out for the first}} time over the Andaman Islands with a view to understand the correlation of anomaly signatures with surface geology of the islands. The residual total field magnetic anomaly maps have revealed distinct magnetic anomalies having intermediate to high amplitude magnetic signatures and correlate with the areas over/close to the exposed ophiolite rocks along the east coast of north, middle and the south Andaman Islands. The 2 D modelling of magnetic anomalies along selected E-W profiles across the islands indicate that the ophiolite bodies extend to a depth of about 5 - 8 km and spatially correlate with the mapped fault/thrust zones...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} between Stopnik, [ebrelje and Pick of [ebrelje the Ladinian clastic, {{carbonate}} and volcanogenic rocks, in the thickness of more then 600 m, are very diversely developed. They are situated on diferent structural blocks bounded by the middle Triassicfaults and overlay partly eroded Anisian dolomite in the footwall. Variegated volcanogenic sedimentary rocks with conglomerate lenses comprising the middle part of the Ladinian succession in the broader sorounding of Stopnik are very important for paleogeographicinterpretation of the area. Ten conglomerate lenses were separated {{in the middle of}} volcanoclastic and volcanogenic rocks on the [ebrelje structural block. Cross sections of the conglomerate lenses are some 10 m to 550 m long and 15 to 60 m thick. Their axes arearranged in the direction NW-SE. In the lower and upper part of the lithological succession in the lenses prevail conglomerates with more ordered internal structure, denser packing of pebbles and more distinct bedding but in the middle part of the succession in lensesprevail sandy conglomerates and pebbly sandstones with less ordered internal structure, less denser packing of pebbles and less distinct bedding. The pebbles consist of diferent types of limestone, dolomite, volcanic rocks, tuffs, tuffaceous sandstone and conglomerate. They represent prevailing resedimented lower Ladinian rocks. The described sedimentary rocks are interpreted as a product of alluvial fan and fan delta <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complexes,</b> which were transgressively covered by tuffaceous muddy marine sediments passing intothe Cordevolian dolomite...|$|R
40|$|The Early Paleozoic Gelnica Group (Gemeric Superunit, Western Carpathians) is {{composed}} of low-grade metamorphosed flysch-like <b>sedimentary</b> <b>complexes</b> alternated with volcanogenic complexes built up mostly by acid volcaniclastic rocks. Volcaniclastic rocks and small rhyolite bodies Ordovician in age underwent subsolidus alkali metasomatism locally overprinted by multiple stages of younger metamorphic and hydrothermal alterations. The observed variability in chemical compositions indicates that the most of acid volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks experienced potassic or sodium metasomatic alteration, the unaltered or Mg-metasomatised rocks occur less frequently. The dominating K-metasomatism is related mainly to the K-feldspar, partly also biotite and muscovite/sericite formation {{at the expense of}} matrix or original feldspar phenocrysts. The Na-metasomatism is connected with albite formation. The highest concentrations of alkalies (up to 13. 52 wt. % K 2 O and 7. 08 wt. % Na 2 O respectively) have been found in rocks originally represented by glassy dacites. The elements like Al, Ti and Zr remain immobile in alkaline metasomatic processes in contrast to Rb or metals. Based on the results from areas with analogical geological structure and evolution, especially the Bergslagen area in Sweden, we suppose that alkali metasomatism in the Gelnica Group is a product of hydrothermal system caused by the infiltration and circulation of sea water. The areas with K-, Na- or Mg-metasomatism represent different parts of the original hydrothermal system, where the K-metasomatism was probably its lower temperature section. This hydrothermal system probably mobilised some metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn) for the formation of stratiform sulfide and oxide mineralizations or served as the metal pre-concentrator for younger siderite-sulfide vein deposits...|$|R
