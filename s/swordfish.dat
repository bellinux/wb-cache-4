5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA {{took off with}} his Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> {{formation}} at 12:25 to attack the ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the <b>Swordfish</b> squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to low cloud cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and <b>Swordfish</b> were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Schöpfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the <b>Swordfish</b> forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six <b>Swordfish</b> were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several <b>Swordfish</b> managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen <b>Swordfish</b> crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out largely by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swordfish</b> {{was ordered}} from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 18 August 1913 {{although}} she was not laid down until 28 February 1914. The start of the First World War six months later greatly hindered her completion, {{and she was not}} launched until 18 March 1916. HMS <b>Swordfish</b> was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before completion, and renamed HMS S1 that same day. She was not completed until 21 July.|$|E

5|$|The {{longfin mako}} has large eyes and is {{attracted}} to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying {{that it is}} a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a 3.4-m-long female with the broken bill from a <b>swordfish</b> (Xiphius gladias) lodged in her abdomen was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on <b>swordfish</b> as the shortfin mako does, or encountered the <b>swordfish</b> in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|After quick repairs, which {{included}} the removal of several rows of turbine blades, Furious returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed Royal Air Force 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at Bardufoss was ready. One Gladiator and the guiding <b>Swordfish</b> crashed en route, killing all crewmen. The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off, carrying only six Sea Gladiators of 804 Squadron and nine <b>Swordfish</b> of 816 Squadron for self-protection while ferrying 263 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the ship}} {{returned}} to the UK to ferry 801 Squadron to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7 June. Together with Eagle, Argus was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June (Operation Harpoon). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine <b>Swordfish</b> from 813 Squadron and four more <b>Swordfish</b> from 824 Squadron to protect the convoy from submarines while Eagle loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One <b>Swordfish</b> crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and one CANT Z.1007 bomber. Eagle transferred her Fulmars to Argus {{over the course of}} the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The <b>Swordfish</b> were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft was difficult. The Beaufort squadrons were all spread out and {{it was difficult to}} bring them together. One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the <b>Swordfish</b> loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the <b>Swordfish</b> approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The <b>Swordfish</b> then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|While Illustrious {{was being}} moved in {{preparation}} for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the tugboat Poolgarth capsized {{with the loss of}} three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the Firth of Clyde with six Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with <b>Swordfish.</b> She began working up off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too risky, and Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 <b>Swordfish</b> aboard.|$|E
40|$|Polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) and {{organochlorine}} (OC) pesticides are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The Italian Ministry of Environment {{has undertaken}} a program (1999 – 2001) to measure levels of contaminants in top marine predators {{and to develop}} sensitive biomarkers {{for the evaluation of}} toxicological risk in these species. In 1999, 15 <b>swordfishes</b> (Xiphias gladius) taken from the Mediterranean Sea along the Sicilian coast (Strait of Messina, Italy) and in the Atlantic Ocean along the Azores Islands, and analysed for 34 congeners of PCBs and 27 organochlorine (OC) pesticides in gonad, muscle, liver and blubber tissues. In the tissues of Mediterranean <b>swordfishes</b> the sum of the determined PCBs congeners ranged from 4. 61 to 4651. 17 ngg 1 on fresh tissue basis. Among organochlorine pesticides DDE, DDT and DDD (TDE) predominated with an overall range of 2. 37 – 4734. 56 ng 1 w. w. In particular p,p 0 -DDE had concentrations appearing up to 3900 ng 1, with the highest values found in fatty tissues, such as blubber. In the liver of Azores Island <b>swordfishes</b> lower levels of PPCBs (8. 43 – 294. 17 ng/g w. w.) and PDDTs (< 0. 01 – 217. 44 ng/g w. w.) were determined...|$|R
50|$|In {{accord with}} {{his love of}} the ocean, he built a two-man <b>swordfishing</b> boat and {{spent much of his}} time at sea. He died on January 6, 1993, of heart failure. His death was widely {{reported}} in both the printed and the broadcast press.|$|R
60|$|To {{the great}} {{majority}} of anglers it may seem unreasonable to place <b>swordfishing</b> in a class by itself--by far the most magnificent sport in the world with rod and reel. Yet I do not hesitate to make this statement and believe I can prove it.|$|R
5|$|Fish steaks are cut {{perpendicular}} to the spine and include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from <b>swordfish,</b> halibut, tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E
5|$|From 1933 {{to the end}} of 1938 Courageous carried No. 800 Squadron, which flew {{a mixture}} of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters. 810, 820 and 821 Squadrons were {{embarked}} for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions during the same period. They flew the Blackburn Baffin, the Blackburn Shark, the Blackburn Ripon and the Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> torpedo bombers as well as Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. As a deck landing training carrier, in early 1939 Courageous embarked the Blackburn Skua and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters of 801 Squadron and the <b>Swordfish</b> torpedo bombers of 811 Squadron, although both of these squadrons were disembarked when the ship was relieved of her training duties in May.|$|E
5|$|Glorious {{could carry}} up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers, and Fairey IIIF {{reconnaissance}} planes of the Fleet Air Arm. From 1933 until Glorious {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from a period when refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey <b>Swordfish</b> in May 1936.|$|E
50|$|The {{spearfish}} remora (Remora brachyptera) is {{a species}} of remora with a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical seas.

5|$|On 14 June, {{carrying}} {{only half}} of 816 Squadron for her own protection, Furious sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying £18,000,000 in gold bullion. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space {{should be used to}} transport sugar to Britain. Upon her arrival, she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron, as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine <b>Swordfish</b> of 825, and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø in September and October 1940, at a cost of several aircraft. Both <b>Swordfish</b> squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August, Furious left Belfast with {{a load of}} 49 Hurricanes, {{carrying}} three Fulmars of 800 Squadron {{and four}} Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine <b>Swordfish</b> of 812 Squadron for Ark Royal. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes {{because some of the}} Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When Ark Royal returned, she transferred the six <b>Swordfish</b> of 810 Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was Furiouss last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>Swordfish</b> {{was paid}} off on 30 October 1918 and {{stricken}} from the Navy List by January 1919. She was sold for scrapping to Pounds, of Portsmouth in July 1922, but {{was reported to}} have been resold to Hayes, of Porthcawl in 1923.|$|E

5|$|While {{covering}} another convoy to Malta on 12October, she {{was damaged}} by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system {{was not immediately}} apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27October. Four of her <b>Swordfish</b> from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other <b>Swordfish</b> laid mines. On 28October, Eagle {{and the rest of}} the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.|$|E
5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} to take off from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build up near the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow. <b>Swordfish</b> and Seafire aircraft flew protective patrols over the Home Fleet throughout the morning's operations.|$|E
