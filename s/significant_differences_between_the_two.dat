5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups. The present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in reading. 2. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in arithmetic. 3. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in language. 4. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in attitude toward school. 5. There will be no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups as evaluated by their teachers. Data concerning these problems were collected from standardized tests from teacher-appraised school adjustment rating scale, and from school records...|$|R
25|$|There are <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Talmud compilations. The {{language}} of the Jerusalem Talmud is a Western Aramaic dialect, which differs from the form of Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud is often fragmentary and difficult to read, even for experienced Talmudists. The redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, is more careful and precise. The law as laid down in the two compilations is basically similar, except in emphasis and in minor details. The Jerusalem Talmud has not received much attention from commentators, and such traditional commentaries as exist are mostly concerned with comparing its teachings {{to those of the}} Babylonian Talmud.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Talbot {{applied for}} an {{extension}} of the 14-year patent. At that time, one of his lawsuits, against photographer Martin Laroche, was heard in court. The Talbot v. Laroche case proved to be pivotal. Laroche's side argued that the patent was invalid, as a similar process had been invented earlier by Joseph Reade, and that using the collodion process did not infringe the calotype patent in any case, because of <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> processes. In the verdict, the jury upheld the calotype patent but agreed that Laroche was not infringing upon it by using the collodion process. Disappointed by the outcome, Talbot chose not to extend his patent.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the theory}} include sexual {{behavior}} scientists J. Michael Bailey, James Cantor, Alice Dreger, and some openly trans health care providers, Anne Lawrence and Maxine Peterson, and others who {{say that there are}} <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life, generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They {{are also more likely to}} come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds, have lower IQs, as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or asexual. They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise paraphilic arousal.|$|E

25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the PWD are widely {{thought to be the}} Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.|$|E

500|$|The Imperator Aleksandr II-class battleships {{were the}} first all-steel battleships to be built for the Baltic Fleet and were {{designed}} to allow Russia to dominate the Baltic Sea by defeating rival ships like the [...] and the German s, {{both of which were}} built of wrought iron. They were designed according to the tactical theories of the day which emphasized ramming and incorporated a ram bow. In addition their forecastle deck sloped slightly downwards to allow the main guns to fire at the waterline of the enemy at short range as the ship closed to ram. A full transverse armored bulkhead protected the forward [...] guns from raking fire and no armor was originally provided to protect them from the side. They were given a full sailing rig to allow for deployments to the Mediterranean and other distant locations although it was never actually used. Imperator Nikolai I was originally going to be built to a completely different design, but this was changed at the last minute to {{a modified version of the}} Imperator Aleksandr II design, so there were <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> ships.|$|E
