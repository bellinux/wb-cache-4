40|$|This paper {{argues that}} using gold as {{collateral}} for highly distressed bonds would bring great {{benefits to the}} euro area in terms of reduced financing costs and bridge-financing. It is mindful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal issues that this will raise and that such a suggestion will be highly controversial. However, a necessary condition is that <b>the</b> European System <b>of</b> Central Banks (ESCB) has agreed to <b>the</b> temporary transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national central bank's gold to a debt agency in full independence. This debt agency passes the gold along, in strict compliance with <b>the</b> prohibition <b>of</b> monetary debt financing. The paper also explains that gold {{has been used as}} collateral in the past and how a gold-backed bond might work and how it could lower yields in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro crisis. This move is then compared to <b>the</b> <b>ECB's</b> now terminated Securities Market Programme (SMP) and its recently announced Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). Namely, a central bank using its balance sheet to lower yields of highly distressed countries where the monetary policy transmission mechanism is no longer working. Beyond some similarities between the moves, <b>the</b> specific benefits <b>of</b> using gold in this manner vis-a-vis the SMP and the OMTs are highlighted. For instance, there is by and large no transfer of credit risk between high risk/low risk countries, losses are borne by specific countries and not by <b>the</b> largest <b>shareholders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECB,</b> it {{would turn out to be}} more transparent, it would not be inflationary and would foster reforms...|$|R

40|$|An article {{devoted to}} <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Justice 2 ̆ 7 s (“ECJ” or the “Court”) {{judicial}} review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Central Bank 2 ̆ 7 s (“ECB”) level of constitutional autonomy and independence {{may seem a}} bit arcane in a book dedicated to honor Advocate General Francis Jacobs upon his retirement from the Court. The topic is, however, eminently suitable, because it highlights his influence in a case remote from <b>the</b> many fields <b>of</b> law in which his impact has been so marked [...] e. g., free movement of goods, competition law, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, free movement of services and establishment rights, human rights protection, and taxation. This Article will first discuss <b>the</b> high importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> independence for <b>the</b> <b>ECB</b> in its control of monetary policy and the European currency, noting some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic debate concerning <b>the</b> appropriate level <b>of</b> such independence. <b>The</b> first section also observes that a debate about the constitutional nature and autonomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECB</b> has become intertwined with <b>the</b> appraisal <b>of</b> its level <b>of</b> independence. <b>The</b> Article then reviews the EC Treaty 2 ̆ 7 s attribution to <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> jurisdiction within Monetary Union, including a power of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECB</b> 2 ̆ 7 s status, measures and decisions.

Contrary to the widely held interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECB</b> as an inflation targeter—and a rather soft one, too—it is argued that <b>the</b> key characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ECB</b> is <b>the</b> pronounced asymmetry in its policy approach and mindset. Curiously, this asymmetry has not only given rise to an antigrowth bias, but to upward price pressures and distortions as well.

This raises the question as to whether inflation targeting would have led to better results, or could do so in future.
