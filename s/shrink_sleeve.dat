First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil {{on the mother}} roll {{as well as the}} spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width. The foils are fed to an automatic winder, which makes a wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided with a rubber sealing disc, and mechanically tightly sealed by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating <b>shrink</b> <b>sleeve</b> film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.|$|E

40|$|Organon Teknika Corporation markets a {{diagnostic}} test system that detects mycobacteria. The test media {{is sold in}} a tubing glass bottle which may break if dropped or weakened in shipment to the laboratory. Because mycobacteria is a very infectious airborne agent, there is concern in the marketplace that the potential for breakage of glass bottles places the laboratory technician and environment at risk. While tests {{are under way to}} identify a plastic bottle suitable for this application, Organon Teknika is pursuing the use of a heat <b>shrink</b> <b>sleeve</b> as an option to improve the safety of this product. This study addresses the feasibility of using a heat <b>shrink</b> <b>sleeve</b> as a safety mechanism by comparing bottles with sleeves to bottles without sleeves. While the PVC sleeve will not eliminate bottle breakage, tests have shown that this sleeve can reduce the likelihood of glass and liquid scatter in the case of bottle breakage.

40|$|PVC and PET-G (Glycol {{modified}} polyethylene terephthalate) {{have the}} highest consumption in the <b>shrink</b> <b>sleeve</b> market due to its high shrink abilities and cost effectiveness. The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as print half-tone mottle. The presence of print half-tone mottle is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of gravure process parameters viz. ink viscosity, press speed, impression hardness and line screen and develop statistical model for print half-tone mottle in shrink films. The base line for print half-tone mottle was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The half-tone area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate print half-tone mottle. The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the print half-tone mottle. The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing print half-tone mottle. The results showed minimization of print half-tone mottle by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films. Furthermore, regression model was developed and validated for print half-tone mottle and a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8696 and 0. 879 was achieved for PET-G and PVC respectively. The proposed model is helpful in determining the impact of gravure process parameters and prediction of print half-tone mottle in shrink films...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evaluate the dynamic mechanical response of MAX phase material Ti 2 AlC at high temperature (HT) and under radial confinement. A Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus {{was employed to conduct}} experiments at a strain rate of 500 s 1. High speed photography was used to capture the dynamic response of unconfined specimens. An induction coil was used to heat the specimens from 25 to 1000 °C. Nickel-cobalt-ferrous alloy (Kovar) <b>shrink</b> fit <b>sleeves</b> were utilized to produce a mechanical radial pressure of 30 to 195 MPa. Unconfined room temperature (RT) and HT experiments revealed that Ti 2 AlC fails in a gradual brittle (also referred to as graceful failure) manner with a low dependency on temperature up to 800 °C. All experiments conducted with radial confinement produced a fully plastic response without failure. The addition of hydrostatic confinement increased the maximum compressive stress for all temperatures and allowed specimens to reach strains in excess of 8 % without failing. Optical and Scanning Election Microscopy (SEM) images were taken of the cross-section of recovered confined specimens. Imaging revealed conical damage patterns on each end of the specimen which facilitate the plastic response. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Five European {{national}} metrology institutes {{in collaboration}} with a university, a research institute and five industrial companies {{are working on a}} joint research project within a framework of the European Metrology Research Programme aimed at development of 1. 6 GPa primary and 1. 5 GPa transfer pressure standards. Two primary pressure standards were realised as pressure-measuring multipliers, each consisting of a low pressure and a high pressure (HP) piston-cylinder assembly (PCA). A special design of the HP PCAs was developed in which a tungsten carbide cylinder is supported by two thermally <b>shrunk</b> steel <b>sleeves</b> and, additionally, by jacket pressure applied to the outside of the outer sleeve. Stress-strain finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to predict behaviour of the multipliers and a pressure generation system. With FEA, the pressure distortion coefficient was determined, taking into account irregularities of the piston-cylinder gap. Transfer pressure standards up to 1. 5 GPa are developed on the basis of modern 1. 5 GPa pressure transducers. This project shall solve a discrepancy between the growing needs of the industry demanding precise traceable calibrations of the high pressure transducers and the absence of adequate primary standards for pressures higher than 1 GPa in the European Union today. ...|$|R
40|$|Eight high {{intensity}} portable fluorescent lights were produced. Three prototype lights were also produced, {{two of which}} were subsequently updated to the physical and operational configuration of the qualification and flight units. Positioning of lamp apertures and reflectors in these lights is such that the light is concentrated and intensified in a specific pattern rather than widely diffused. Indium amalgam control of mercury vapor pressure in the lamp gives high output at lamp ambient temperatures up to 105 C. A small amount of amalgam applied to each electrode stem helps to obtain fast warm-up. <b>Shrinking</b> a Teflon <b>sleeve</b> on the tube and potting metal caps on {{each end of the}} lamp minimizes dispersion of mercury vapor and glass particles in the event of accidental lamp breakage. Operation at 20 kHz allows the lamps to consume more power than at low frequency, thus increasing their light output and raising their efficiency.

40|$|A {{shrink-fit}} is a semi-permanent assembly system, {{widely used}} in industry, {{which is designed to}} resist the relative movement or transmit torque between two components. This done by creating high radial pressures at the interface of the constituent parts. Examples include fitting of gears to shafts to transmit torque and shrink fitted hard wearing sleeves to shafts for steel rolling mills. This paper presents measured and predicted residual stresses from a variety of shrink fitted assemblies, including aluminium alloys, stainless steel and cast irons. In a number of cases the <b>sleeves</b> <b>shrink</b> fitted to the shaft were subjected to prior machining or prior quenching to introduce initial residual stresses in the sleeve. Residual stresses were measured using a combination of deep-hole drilling (DHD) and incremental centre hole drilling (ICHD) techniques. The ICHD method provided near surface residual stress measurements to depths up to about 1 mm. The DHD method measured through thickness residual stresses along radial lines through the outer sleeve and into the shaft up to depths of 400 mm. Results are shown for a variety of assemblies and reveal residual stress that are significantly different from both simple analysis and finite element studies. For example, prior machining introduced near surface compressive residual stresses, that is then expected to be counteracted by the near surface tensile shrink fit residual stresses. However, measurements reveal {{that this is not the}} case...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed {{that is capable of}} (1) dynamically loading the specimen in multiaxial compression; (2) controlling the stress state in the specimen in the range from uniaxial stress to uniaxial strain; and (3) allowing the recovery of the sample after loaded by a single, well defined pulse for the characterization of the failure mode. In this technique, cylindrical ceramic specimens were loaded in the axial direction using a split Hopkinson pressure bar modified to apply a single loading pulse, and were confined laterally either by <b>shrink</b> fit <b>sleeves,</b> or by eletro-magnetic force. Quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial compression experiments have been performed on a machinable glass ceramic, Macor, and a monolithic engineering ceramic, sintered aluminum nitride (A 1 N). The cylindrical ceramic specimens were confned laterally by shrink fit sleeves: the amount of confining pressure (0 - 230 MPa) was varied by using different sleeve materials. The quasi-static axial load was applied by a hydraulic driven Material Test System (MTS), whereas the dynamic axial load was provided by a modified split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB). Under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions, the experimental results for both materials showed that the failure mode changed from fragmentation by axial splitting under conditions of uniaxial stress (without lateral confinement) to localized deformation on faults under moderate lateral confinement. The fault initiation process was studied experimentally in detail. Based on the experimental results, a compressive brittle failure process was summarized. A transition from brittle to ductile behavior was observed in Macor under high confinement pressure which was achieved using a second sleeve around the inner sleeve. The compressive failure strengths of both materials increased with increasing confinement pressure under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The highest dynamic compressive strengths of Macor and A 1 N measured in the experiments were 1. 35 GPa and 5. 40 GPa, respectively, whereas their quasi-static compressive strength were measured to be 0. 43 GPa and 2. 5 GPa, respectively. Based on the experimental results on A 1 N together with available data in the literature, a failure/flow criterion was developed for ceramic materials under multiaxial loading. A Mohr-Coulomb criterion and an improved Johnson-Holmquist model were found to fit the experimental data for brittle failure, whereas the materials exhibited pressure insensitive plastic flow at high pressures. Observations made in other types of dynamic experiments (e. g., shock wave loading) were rationalized based on the postulated failure mechanisms and the possibility of plastic flow beyond the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL). The effect of various material properties on the failure behavior was investigated using the proposed failure criterion. The applicability of the present model to a range of ceramics was also explored and the limitations of the model were outlined. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} experimental and theoretical study of subsynchronous rotordynamic instability in rotors caused by interference and shrink fit interfaces. The experimental studies show {{the presence of}} strong unstable subsynchronous vibrations in two different rotor setups with interference and shrink fit interfaces that were operated above their first critical speeds. The unstable vibrations occur at the first natural frequency of the rotor-bearing system. The instability caused complete wreckage of the test rig {{in one of the}} setups showing that these vibrations are potentially dangerous to the safe operation of rotating machines. The two different rotor setups that are studied are a single-disk rotor mounted on a uniform diameter shaft and a two-disk rotor with an aluminum <b>sleeve</b> <b>shrink</b> fitted to it at the outer surface of the two disks. In the single-disk rotor, an adjustable interference arrangement between the disk and the shaft is obtained through a tapered sleeve arrangement, which acts as the interference fit joint. The unstable sub-synchronous vibrations originate from slippage in the shrink fit and the interference fit interfaces that develop friction forces, which act as destabilizing cross-coupled moments when the rotor is operated above its first critical speed. The unique contribution offered through this work is the experimental validation of a physically correct model of internal friction which models the destabilizing mechanism as a system of cross-coupled internal moments at the shrink fit interface. The dissertation describes stability simulations of various test rotor setups using the correct internal moments model. A commercial finite-element based software called XLTRCTM is used to perform rotordynamic simulations for stability studies. The method of stability study is the computation of eigenvalues of the rotor-bearing system. A negative real part of the eigenvalue indicates instability. The simulations include the test rotors that were experimentally observed as stable and unstable with shrink and interference fit interfaces in their assemblies. The dissertation also describes the simulations of various imagined rotor configurations with shrink fit interfaces, and seeks to explain how configurations differ on rotordynamic stability depending upon several rotor-bearing parameters such as geometry and elastic properties, as well as upon the amount of internal friction parameters, which differ from configuration to configuration...|$|R
