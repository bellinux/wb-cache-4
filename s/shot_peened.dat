5000|$|In the mid-1960s, Chrysler {{decided to}} adapt the 318 cu.in. small block V8 into a lightweight, high output engine equally suited for drag strip or street {{performance}} use. Its block was bored out to 4.04 in but 3.31 in stroke left unchanged, resulting in the 340 cu in (5.6 L). Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> steel crankshaft instead of the cast nodular iron unit used in the 318. This also included <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> and forged pushrods, connecting rods and pistons. A 4-barrel carburetor was mated to a high-rise, dual plane intake manifold feeding high-flow cylinder heads that are still considered among the best of that era. Its big ports used 2.02 in intake and 1.60 in exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted {{to take advantage of}} the much better breathing top end. 1968 4-Speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two bolt main bearing caps, leading some to initially underestimate the 340's potential. The '68-'71 340's compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted windage tray. Power output was officially stated as [...] Gross for the 4 barrel.|$|E

Using a heavier composite section instead of a pure steel structure solved this problem. For reasons of durability and to enhance the appearance, further studies concluded that the tower skin should be fabricated from a duplex stainless steel (grade 1.4462 to BSEN10088) with a <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> surface finish.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Shot</b> <b>peening</b> is {{a common}} {{procedure}} to improve the static and cyclic strength of metal components {{by a combination of}} work hardening and the introduction of compressive stresses into the surface region. Our investigations through the last years showed that high compressive stresses of more than 1 GPa can also be introduced in brittle ceramics under specific <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> conditions. These stresses significantly increase the near-surface strength. Based on the findings for ceramics, <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> procedures have now been developed for cemented carbides and hard chromium platings. Recent investigations showed that, due to the higher fracture toughness of cemented carbides, <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> could be performed using higher peening intensities leading to a higher gain in strength properties. Although chromium platings are less brittle than ceramics, <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> of these layers are very challenging due to the formation of a micro-crack network being typically for these coatings.

If the strip deforms another 10%, then one obtains the intensity of the blast stream. Another operation to gauge the intensity of a <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> process is the use of an Almen round, developed by R. Bosshard.|$|R

Four different surface conditions of notched samples have been considered: polished, ground, T 0 (industry applied <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> process) and T 1 (a less intense <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> process). Fatigue crack aspect ratio (a/c) evolution {{in the early stages}} of crack growth in polished and <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> cases was found to be quite different: the former was more microstructure dependent (e. g. stringer initiation) while the crack morphology in the <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> cases was more related to the shot peening process (i. e. surface roughness, position with respect to the compressive stress and strain hardening profiles). Under similar strain range conditions, the beneficial effect of shot peening (in the T 0 condition) was retained even at a high strain level (?? 11 = 0. 68 %), Nf, ground< Nf, T 1 < Nf, polished < Nf, T 0. The a/c evolution effects were incorporated in K-evaluations and used in calculating da/dN from surface replica data.
