5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the {{peregrine}} falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|E
5|$|The family Hirundinidae is a {{group of}} passerines characterised by their {{adaptation}} to aerial feeding. The family includes <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins.</b> These adaptations include a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings, and short bills with a wide gape. The feet are adapted to perching rather than walking, and the front toes are partially joined at the base.|$|E
5|$|When a {{specimen}} of the African river martin from Gabon was first formally described by German zoologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, {{it was not}} initially identified {{as a member of}} the swallow and martin family. Hartlaub placed it with the rollers, and later authors either put it in its own separate family, or with the woodswallows. It was only following study of the anatomy of the species by Lowe that it was determined to be closely related to the <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins,</b> but sufficiently different that it could be placed in a separate subfamily Pseudochelidoninae.|$|E
50|$|Breeding species include {{reed and}} sedge warbler and water rail. Wintering species include bearded reedling, snipe, {{redshank}} and bittern. During the migration periods {{significant numbers of}} <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> sand <b>martin</b> are seen.|$|R

5|$|The river martins form a {{distinctive}} subfamily Pseudochelidoninae within the <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> <b>martin</b> bird family Hirundinidae. The two species are the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina, {{found in the}} Congo and Gabon, and the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand. These are medium-sized, largely black swallows that have a light buoyant flight and feed on insects caught in the air. They {{appear to be more}} terrestrial than other swallows, frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The African species excavates nest holes in sandy ridges in rivers, while the breeding locations and habits of the Asian bird are unknown.|$|R
5|$|When the African river {{martin was}} first {{discovered}} in the 19th century, Gustav Hartlaub {{thought it was a}} roller, and later authors either placed it in its own family, or with the woodswallows. Study of the anatomy revealed that the species was closest to the <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins,</b> but that it possessed a number of distinctive features, such as its robust legs and feet and stout bill. These indicated that it should be placed in a separate subfamily. The two river martin species are usually considered to belong to a single genus, Pseudochelidon, due to their having a number of structural similarities. However, Brooke proposed that the white-eyed river martin be placed in a separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon.|$|E
25|$|The chicks of {{swallows}} hatch naked, generally {{with only}} a few tufts of down. The eyes are closed and do not fully open for up to 10 days. The feathers take a few days to begin to sprout, and the chicks are brooded by the parents until they are able to thermoregulate. On the whole they develop slowly compared to other passerine birds. The parents do not usually feed the chicks individual insects but instead a bolus of food comprising ten to a hundred insects. Regardless of whether the species has males that incubate or brood the chicks the males of all <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> will help feed the chicks. It is difficult to judge when <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> fledge, as they will be enticed out of the nest after three weeks by parents but frequently return to the nest afterwards in order to roost.|$|E
25|$|The family Hirundinidae was {{introduced}} (as Hirundia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> are morphologically unique within the passerines, with molecular evidence placing {{them as a}} distinctive lineage within the Sylvioidea (Old World warblers and relatives). They have also {{been linked to the}} white-eyes and the tits. Under the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy they have been placed in the infraorder Passerida.|$|E

It was probably the house originally occupied by his steward or land agent, but was now devoted to hospitable purposes and the reception of guests.|$|R
25|$|Species of <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> <b>martin</b> {{that are}} {{threatened}} with extinction are generally endangered due to habitat loss. This {{is presumed to}} be the reason behind {{the decline of the}} critically endangered white-eyed river martin, a species that is only known from a few specimens collected in Thailand. The species presumably breeds in riverbanks, a much diminished habitat in SE Asia. As the species hasn't been reliably seen since 1980 it may already be extinct. Two insular species, the Bahama <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> golden <b>swallow,</b> have declined due to forest loss and also competition with introduced species such as starlings and sparrows, which compete with these swallows for nesting sites. The golden swallow formerly bred on the island of Jamaica, but was last seen there in 1989 and is now restricted to the island of Hispaniola.|$|R

25|$|The <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> have an {{evolutionarily}} conservative {{body shape}} {{which is similar}} across the clade but is unlike that of other passerines. Swallows have adapted to hunting insects on the wing by developing a slender, streamlined body and long pointed wings, which allow great maneuverability and endurance, as well as frequent periods of gliding. Their body shape allows for very efficient flight; the metabolic rate of swallows in flight is 49–72% lower than equivalent passerines of the same size.|$|E
25|$|The <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> have a {{worldwide}} cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. One species, the Pacific swallow, occurs as a breeding bird {{on a number}} of oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Mascarene martin breeds on Reunion and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, and a number of migratory species are common vagrants to other isolated islands and even to some sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Many species have enormous worldwide ranges, particularly the barn swallow, which breeds over most of the Northern Hemisphere and winters over most of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|The lakes provide {{habitat for}} {{large numbers of}} birds. Clumber lake is fringed by alder, sallow and ash trees, with some sedge marsh. It {{was one of the}} first sites in the country used by gadwall for breeding, and also has a winter {{population}} of goosander. Hobbys frequent the reed bed below Clumber Dam in August and September, where they hunt <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins.</b> The upper lake is fringed by oak, yew, beech and Scots pine trees, and provides habitat for willow tits and woodpeckers, with blackcaps visiting in the summer. Mandarin ducks also visit occasionally.|$|E

It was probably the house originally occupied by his steward or land agent, but was now devoted to hospitable purposes, and the reception of guests. As to his lordship, it was one of his many eccentricities, that he never slept in the main edifice, but lodged apart in a wooden house not much above twelve feet square. In a small building was his office, where quitrents were given, deeds drawn, and business transacted with his tenants.|$|R
25|$|Swallows are tolerated {{by humans}} {{because of their}} {{beneficial}} role as insect-eaters, and some species have readily adapted to nesting in and around human habitation. The barn <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> house <b>martin</b> now rarely use natural sites.

50|$|The water area {{encourages}} {{wading birds}} such as spotted redshank, greenshank, green sandpiper and curlew. Snipe are recorded as over-wintering. Breeding birds include little grebe, moorhen, mallard, teal and tufted duck. The heathland area encourages whinchat, skylark, tree pipit, cuckoo, nightjar, kestrel and sparrowhawk. The reserve {{is one of}} three known sites in the Forest of Dean where stonechat breed. Swift, <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> house <b>martin</b> are regular feeders as the site is rich in insect life.|$|R
500|$|The crag martins may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins, and that species also treats common kestrels, [...] Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs. The dusky crag martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater false vampire bat, Megaderma lyra.|$|E
500|$|The Phedina {{swallows}} {{are placed}} within the Hirundininae subfamily, which comprises all <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> except the very distinctive river martins.

50|$|A {{count in}} May 2008 found 58 {{different}} species of birds, attracted by the various habitats. Woodland birds include jay, green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, carrion crow, blue tit, great tit, common chaffinch, nightingale, kestrel and bullfinch. Around the lake, depending {{on the time of}} year, are graylag geese, Canada geese, mute swan, great crested grebe, common tern, moorhen, coot, occasional kingfisher, cormorant, and grey heron, with <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> house <b>martins</b> skimming the water. Buzzards can increasingly been seen above the Forest.|$|R
50|$|The {{crag martin}} has {{over the last}} few decades {{increasingly}} used houses and other man-made sites to nest. This greater availability of breeding sites has enabled the species to expand its range, but it is possible that this will lead to competition with other hirundines, such as the barn <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> common house <b>martin,</b> which also use artificial nest sites.|$|R
500|$|The four Ptyonoprogne {{species are}} members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> except the very distinctive river martins. DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the [...] "core martins" [...] including burrowing species like the sand martin, the [...] "nest-adopters", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the [...] "mud nest builders". The Ptyonoprogne species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; Hirundo species also build open nests, Delichon house martins have a closed nest, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel.|$|E
500|$|Delichon martins are 13–15cm (5–6in) long, blackish blue above with a {{contrasting}} white rump, {{and with}} white or grey underparts. They are chunky, bull-headed and short-tailed birds, and have feathering on the toes and tarsi. [...] The common house martin {{is the largest}} bird of the three, with an average weight of 18.3g (0.65oz), and has the most deeply forked tail; the Nepalese species is the smallest (15g, 0.53oz) and has the squarest tail. Distinctive species plumage features are the black chin and black undertail coverts of the Nepal house martin, and the greyish wash to the underparts of the Asian house martin. As with other <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins,</b> the moult is slow and protracted {{because of the need}} to maintain efficient flight at all times to enable feeding. Moult normally starts on arrival at the wintering grounds, but overlaps with the breeding season for the non-migratory Nepal house martin.|$|E
500|$|The three Delichon {{species are}} members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> except the very distinctive river martins. DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. [...] The groups are the [...] "core martins" [...] including burrowing species like the sand martin, the [...] "nest-adopters", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the [...] "mud nest builders". The Delichon species construct a closed mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; they appear to be intermediate between the Hirundo and Ptyonoprogne species that make open cup nests, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows, which have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel. The genetic evidence suggests a close relationship between Hirundo and Delichon, which is further supported by the frequency of interbreeding between two widespread species, the barn swallow and the common house martin, despite being their being in different genera. The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud-building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees.|$|E
50|$|The meadow also {{supports}} a large variety of birds, including great tits, blue tits, common chaffinches, linnets and treecreepers within the bordering hedges; whilst grey wagtails, reed buntings, sedge warblers, <b>swallows,</b> sand <b>martins</b> <b>and</b> swifts {{can be found}} around the rivers and ditches.|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago only four species were {{commonly}} regarded as house birds [...] the house wren, the bluebird, the tree <b>swallow,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>martin.</b> Since the movement to protect birds and make neighbors of them began, however, their natures and needs have become better understood, {{and it is now}} known that many other species will avail themselves of houses constructed for them by their human friends. The practice of erecting bird houses in this country, while now nation-wide, is not so common and uniformly distributed as it should be, and more extended provisions of this nature can not fail to result in a largely increased number of house birds.

50|$|The nest is a loose ball {{assembled}} from {{grass and}} feathers. A nest may {{be built on}} branches, or in the crown of palm trees, or in tree hollows. The birds also use cavities in buildings, and the old nests of the Ethiopian <b>swallow</b> <b>and</b> African sand <b>martin.</b> They have been observed once removing nestlings of the African sand martin to take over their nests. A clutch contains three to six eggs. They are white with brown and gray spots. The breeding season falls in Eritrea during January to March and May to November, in Ethiopia breeding may occur from April to December.|$|R
500|$|These {{are members}} of the swallow family of birds, and are placed in the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins</b> except the very distinctive river martins.

The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> <b>martins,</b> or Hirundinidae, are {{a family}} of {{passerine}} birds found {{around the world on}} all continents except Antarctica.|$|E

Tufted ducks, goldeneye and great crested grebe can be seen year-round, and both goldeneye and great crested grebe can be seen performing their courtship dance in early spring.|$|R
5|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have taken up {{residence}} in urban environments. They tend to be adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. Rats and mice have followed man around the globe, pigeons, peregrines, sparrows, <b>swallows</b> <b>and</b> house <b>martins</b> use the buildings for nesting, bats use roof space for roosting, foxes visit the garbage bins and squirrels, coyotes, raccoons and skunks roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around Chicago. A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities {{in the twentieth century}} found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants {{and a number of other}} groups. In warmer climates, termites are serious pests in the urban habitat; 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage.|$|R
