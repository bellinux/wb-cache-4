5000|$|Many of {{the early}} Christian sepulchral {{inscriptions}} provide information concerning the original development of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Thus, for example, from the earliest times we meet in them all the hierarchical grades from the door-keeper (ostiarius) and lector up to the Pope. A number of epitaphs {{of the early}} popes (Pontianus, Anterus, Fabianus, Cornelius, Lucius, Eutychianus, Caius) {{were found in the}} so-called [...] "Papal Crypt" [...] in the Catacomb of St. Callistus on the Via Appia, rediscovered by De Rossi. Numbers of early epitaphs of bishops have been found from Germany to Nubia. Priests are frequently mentioned, and reference is often made to deacons, subdeacons, exorcists, lectors, acolytes, fossores or gravediggers, alumni or adopted children. The Greek inscriptions of Western Europe and the East yield especially interesting material; in them is found, in addition to other information, mention of archdeacons, archpriests, deaconesses, and monks. Besides catechumens and <b>s,</b> <b>reference</b> is also made to virgins consecrated to God, nuns, abbesses, holy widows, one of the last-named being the mother of Pope Damasus I, the restorer of the catacombs. Epitaphs of martyrs and tituli mentioning the martyrs are not found as frequently as one would expect, especially in the Roman catacombs. It may be that during periods of persecution, Christians had to give secret burial to the remains of their martyrs.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates Jane Austen <b>s</b> <b>{{references}}</b> to {{food and}} meals in her novels, {{and how these}} references can participate in developing her characters. The characters are of paramount importance {{in this kind of}} novel, and the more information we have about them, the better we can understand their actions and comments, and hence the novel. The reader is often too carried away with the actions and conversations which these meals frame to notice that the meal itself is often used as a tool, and may convey a great deal of information. Austen s use of the meals, or the simple mentioning of a single food item, makes her able to reveal or describe much of either the characters in question, the time the action takes place, where, and maybe even which social class we are dealing with. My main aim with this thesis is to demonstrate how Jane Austen <b>s</b> <b>references</b> to food can reveal more about the action and characters in her novels than one might think.

Monoclonal antibodies to these fimbriae were produced {{to better understand the}} role of fimbriae as serotype-specific agglutinogens and to investigate the antigenic relationship between these fimbriae. Three monoclonal antibodies were identified that specifically agglutinated B. pertussis cells containing the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Reference</b> Factor 2 agglutinogen, and six monoclonal antibodies were produced that agglutinated only those strains containing the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Reference</b> Factor 6 agglutinogen. Indirect immunofluorescence studies and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that these monoclonal antibodies bind to an outer membrane component on serotype-specific strains of B. pertussis. All of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with native or partially assembled type-specific fimbriae but not with monomeric fimbrial subunits as indicated by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. The fimbrial agglutinogens recognized by the monoclonal antibodies were also uniquely reactive with either U. <b>S.</b> <b>Reference</b> Factor 2 or 6 antiserum (Eldering agglutinogen 2 or 6 polyclonal antiserum) in an indirect ELISA. No cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies with the unrelated fimbriae was observed in any of the comparative immunological studies. Some of the monoclonal antibodies agglutinated certain strains of B. bronchiseptica, suggesting that this closely related species can contain antigenically similar fimbriae. These monoclonal antibodies should prove useful for further structural and functional analysis of Bordetella fimbriae and for studies on the role that these antigens play in prevention of infection and disease...|$|E

Instead these measures reflect the arbitrary labeling of underlying fiscal conditions.

40|$|Near the {{supercritical}} thermodynamic point, coolant {{density is}} {{very sensitive to}} temperature which gives potential to several instabilities in the supercritical water-cooled nuclear reactors. The flow stability features of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>reference</b> Supercritical Water- Cooled Reactor (SCWR) have been investigated. Single channel stability features were studied by the decay ratio calculations for Density Wave Oscillations (DWO). The system response matrix was developed through perturbation and linearization of the conservation equations in the time domain. Then, the DWO decay ratio was calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the system response matrix. It {{was found that the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>reference</b> SCWR will satisfy the stability criterion at steady state if an inlet orifice coefficient was properly chosen. Simplified stability maps that define the onset of DWO instability have also been constructed based on a frequency domain method for both the single channel and the channel-to-channel DWO. At supercritical pressure, a three-region model consisting of heavy fluid region, heavy-light fluid mixture region and light fluid region has been used. New non-dimensional governing parameters, namely, the Expansion Number and the Pseudo-Subcooling Number have been identified. It has been found that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>reference</b> SCWR will be stable at full power operating condition with large margin. Although the SCWR operates in the supercritical pressure region at steady state, operation at subcritical pressure will occur during a sliding pressure startup process. At subcritical pressure, the stability maps have been developed based on the traditional Subcooling Number and Phase Change Number (also called as Zuber Number). The sensitivity of stability boundaries due to different two phase flow models has been studied. It has been found that the Homogenous-Nonequilibrium model (HNEM) yields more conservative results at high subcooling numbers while the Homogenous Equilibrium (HEM) model is more conservative at low subcooling numbers. Based on these stability maps, a stable sliding pressure startup procedure has been suggested for the reference SCWR design...|$|E

He presented a paper on reference services that listed sixty of his reference questions at the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Medical Library Association (MLA) in 1927. During a two-month period in 2001, the authors examined Ballard's questions by attempting to answer them with print sources from the 1920 s and with the Internet. The searchers answered 85 % of the questions with the Internet and 80 % with 1920 <b>s</b> <b>reference</b> sources. The authors compared Internet and 1920 s print resources for practical use.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an alternative theory of price adjustment resting on consumer loss aversion {{in the price}} dimension. In line with prospect theory the perceived losses from price increases are weighted stronger in the consumer s utility function than the perceived gains resulting from price decreases of equal magnitude. Prices are evaluated relative to a certain reference price which is endogenous, sluggish and depends to the consumer s recent rational price expectations. Two key modeling implications arise: First, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the consumer <b>s</b> <b>reference</b> price. Second, changes in the consumer s recent rational price expectations and hence in the consumer <b>s</b> <b>reference</b> price can alter demand through {{what we call the}} reference-price-updating effect. We incorporate this into an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition and analyze price and quantity reactions to various demand shocks. We find that although firms may change their prices flexibly, {{depending on the size of}} the shock the prices adjust more or less pronounced than in the standard monopoly model and that prices can even be rigid. Additionally, we find that the price adjustment is asymmetric with respect to shock size and sign and the current state of the business cycle, i. e. pricing is state-dependent...|$|E
