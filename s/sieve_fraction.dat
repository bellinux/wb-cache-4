40|$|The size-normalised weight (SNW) of planktic foraminifera, {{a measure}} of test wall {{thickness}} and density, is potentially a valuable palaeo-proxy for marine carbon chemistry. As increasing attention is given to developing this proxy {{it is important that}} methods are comparable between studies. Here, we compare SNW data generated using two different methods to account for variability in test size, namely (i) the narrow (50 μm range) <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> method and (ii) the individually measured test size method. Using specimens from the 200 – 250 μm <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> range collected in multinet samples from the North Atlantic, we find that sieving does not constrain size sufficiently well to isolate changes in weight driven by variations in test wall thickness and density from those driven by size. We estimate that the SNW data produced as part of this study are associated with an uncertainty, or error bar, of about &plusmn; 11 %. Errors associated with the narrow <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> method may be reduced by decreasing the size of the sieve window, by using larger tests and by increasing the number tests employed. In situations where numerous large tests are unavailable, however, substantial errors associated with this sieve method remain unavoidable. In such circumstances the individually measured test size method provides a better means for estimating SNW because, as our results show, this method isolates changes in weight driven by variations in test wall thickness and density from those driven by size...|$|E

However, choosing a power station as an experimental set-up for research is awkward because of the scale of operation (> 500 MWct). Therefore, BTG has designed and constructed a droptube reactor for well-controlled Miscanthus devolatilisation experiments with operational conditions that resemble those of a pulverised coal combustor. The droptube reactor has an internal diameter of 0, 050 m and a maximum heated length of 1. 6 m. Parameters which have been varied are: the droptube temperature (1000 °, 1200 °, 1300 °, 1400 °C); the heated roptube length (0. 4, 0. 8,!. 2, 1. 6 m); and the particle size or <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> (0. 6 - 1, 1 - 2, 2 - 2. 8 mm).

The new species differs from typical members of the genus Leptohalysis in the following features: 1) the chambers are rounded and abut closely with a distinct suture between them, rather than being flask-shaped with more or less flat, truncated bases; 2) the wall structure is less regular and consists mainly of grains with flat exposed faces that abut to create an outer surface resembling an uneven pavement, {{the edges of the}} grains being obscured by copious amounts of organic cement; 3) the proloculus is sometimes followed by a single “adventitious”chamber, located {{to one side of the}} axis of growth.

40|$|Effective {{dissolution}} of plutonium dioxide {{has traditionally been}} accomplished by contact with strong nitric acid containing {{a small amount of}} fluoride at temperatures of {approximately} 100 C. In spite of these aggressive conditions, PuO{sub 2 } dissolution is sometimes incomplete requiring additional contact with the solvent. This work focused on an alternative to conventional dissolution in nitric acid where an electron transfer catalyst, Fe(II), was used in hydrochloric acid. Cyclic voltammetry was employed as an in-situ analytical technique for monitoring the dissolution reaction rate. The plutonium oxide selected for this study was decomposed plutonium oxalate with > 95 % of the material having a particle diameter (< 70 {micro}m) as determined by a scanning laser microscopy technique. Attempts to dry sieve the oxide into narrow size fractions prior to dissolution in the HCl-Fe(II) solvent system failed, apparently due to significant interparticle attractive forces.

The model predicts full conversion of Miscanthus particles for particles with a diameter smaller than 3 mm, in the core of the coal flame. Feeding of Miscanthus particles with a diameter up to 3 mm can therefore be recommended. Miscanthus particles with a diameter larger than 3 mm contribute to a geometrical extension of the coal flame in the upward direction.

Therefore, pelletisation experiments were carried out with microcrystalline cellulose and lactose in a coffee grinder (small-scale) and in a Gral 10 ('large'-scale). A toroidal flow-pattern was observed and described for both apparatus. There was no effect of increased impeller speed on the velocity of pellets in the torus; only a change in angle with the tangential direction was observed. Moreover, the size of pellets decreased rapidly to a new value. This size increased again when the impeller speed was reduced to the initial (low) value. This suggested the existence of fast break-up and growth, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium depending on the impeller speed. Tracer experiments were used to investigate the turnover limes of different <b>sieve</b> <b>fractions.</b> First order conversion rate constants for the pellets of different <b>sieve</b> <b>fractions,</b> calculated from colour concentrations at several processing times, were equal for both apparatus when plotted against the dimensionless diameter of the pellets (d/d(50)).

Due to their high environmental variability, faunal patterns and the drivers of these patterns within canyons remain poorly understood. With this in mind, benthic macrofaunal {{samples were collected}} from three branches (Western, Central and Eastern) of the Whittard Canyon, a major feature on the Celtic margin (NE Atlantic), and one site on the adjacent slope {{to the west of}} the canyon. A total of 136 core samples (each core 78. 5 cm 2 surface area) was collected at depths of ~ 3500 m during 22 deployments of a hydraulically-dampened Megacorer at these four main sites. The samples yielded 4444 macrofaunal individuals (> 300 -µm <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction)</b> that were identified to higher taxon level; these included 2225 polychaetes identified to species level and 410 macrofaunal nematodes (> 500 -µm <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction)</b> identified to genus level. Macrofaunal abundance varied significantly among sites, and decreased from the Eastern branch (6249 ± standard deviation 1363 ind. m- 2) to the slope site (2744 ± SD 269 ind. m- 2). Ordination of macrofauna higher taxa and polychaete family and species level assemblages revealed that the Central and Eastern branches were substantially similar, while the Western branch and slope sites were relatively distinct. A similar pattern was evident in a corresponding ordination of environmental variables across the sites. In contrast, ordination of macrofaunal nematode assemblages grouped the three canyon sites together while the slope site was distinct. A total of 110 polychaete morphospecies was recorded, of which 46 species were found only in the canyon. Paramphinome jeffreysii was the most abundant species followed by Aurospio sp. B. Forty-eight nematode genera were identified, with Paramesacanthion and Metacylicolaimus being the most abundant. The canyon branches had broadly similar levels of polychaete species richness and diversity; these metrics and evenness values were higher on the slope than inside the canyon, while dominance was correspondingly lower on the slope. Polychaete feeding modes and nematode feeding groups shifted across the study site. Omnivorous polychaetes and predatory nematodes were more abundant inside the canyon compared with the slope site. Additional polychaetes were collected for molecular analysis (CO 1 and 16 S genes) from shallower parts (~ 1000 m) of the canyon and nearby Goban Spur. A total of 109 sequences was obtained from 139 specimens resulted in the identification of 33 polychaete species, of which 5 could be assigned Latin binomial names based on phylogenetic analyses. Only one of these species (P. jeffreysii) occurred at the deeper (3500 m) sites. Overall, this project highlighted the variability of macrofaunal assemblages within the soft-sediment habitat of a submarine canyon.

In contrast, flake graphite was absent in virtually all the drop-tube samples, even in those with the most modest cooling rates. Microstructural analysis revealed that as the cooling rate increased there was less fragmentation of the primary austenite/ferrite dendrites and the volume fraction of primary dendritic material increased.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new method to measure a behavioral shape property of sand grains is presented. This property "rollability " is related to the angle of slope on which a grain will roll down in air. It is measured on the inside of a slightly inclined revolving cylinder mantle. The grains emerge from {{the lower end of the}} cylinder and the time it takes them to reach this lower end is a measure for their rollability. The property "rollability " correlates well with the influence of grain shape in other processes such as settling in water. The rollability is measured on ~ phi sieve fractions. The measurements are transferred to relative rollability values. For a certain area, the mean of all the rollability values is calculated per <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> and the individual measurements are expressed as percentile deviations of this mean value. In this way, the strong influence of the source of the material on the shape characteristics is largely excluded and the observed shape differences between samples can be attributed exclusively to shape sorting phenomena. This facilitates the comparison between sediments of same depositional circumstances but different source. Per sample, graphs are plotted which show the distribution of the relative rollability values over the size fractions. This property is called the Shape Distribution Character (S. D. C.).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{correlations between}} silt and clay fractions determined by pipette method and laser diffraction, samples from Dutch fine marine, fluvial, and loess deposits were analysed by both methods. For fluvial deposits, correlations for fractions 50 µm were excellent (R 2 > 0. 95), those for 2 - 4, 4 - 8, 16 - 32 and 32 - 50 µm were satisfactory (R 2 = 0. 80 - 0. 95), while {{that for the}} fraction 8 - 16 µm had an R 2 of only 0. 68. For marine deposits, correlations for 50 µm {{were in the same}} range, but those of all other fractions except 8 - 16 µm were lower. In the loess samples, correlations for all but the 8 - 16 µm fraction were unsatisfactory. Laser diffraction gave 42 % of pipette clay in marine samples, and 62 % in fluvial and loess samples if regressions are forced through 0. Sand fractions detected by laser diffraction were 107 % of the <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> in marine samples, and 99 % in the fluvial samples. Correlations for fractions smaller than reference size are generally better than those for individual size fractions. Both the 2 µm and the 50 µm boundary cause problems in the comparison. The first because of platy shape of clay minerals, and the second due to both a change in method in the pipette/sieving procedure, and to nonsphericity of particles. Apparently, correlations for clay- and silt-size fractions obtained by pipette method and laser diffraction will be different for each type of sediment...|$|E

The new method (NM) was compared aginst the classical Shewhart control chart (OM) using synthetic datasets from normal and non-normal distributions as well as over an industrial example. The NM involved taking {{the difference between the}} specified probability density estimate and non-parametric density estimate of the variable of interest to calculate an error value. Both OM and NM were found to work well for normally distributed data when process is in-control and out-of control situation. Both methods could be returned back to normal operation upon feeding in control data. In case of non-normally distributed data, the OM failed significantly to detect small shifts in mean and standard deviation, however the NM maintained its performance to detect such changes. In the application to an industrial case (data were obtained from a local cement manufacturer about a 90 micrometer <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> of the final milled cement product), the NM methodology outperformed the OM by recognizing the change in the mean and variance of the measured parameter. The data were tested for its distribution and were found to be non-normally distributed. Violations beyond the control limits in the new developed technique were easily observed. The NM was found to successfully operate without the necessity to apply run rules...|$|E
40|$|This {{data package}} {{contains}} the K Basin sludge characterization results obtained by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory during {{processing and analysis}} of four sludge core samples collected from Engineered Container SCS-CON- 210 in 2010 as requested by CH 2 M Hill Plateau Remediation Company. Sample processing requirements, analytes of interest, detection limits, and quality control sample requirements are defined in the KBC- 33786, Rev. 2. The core processing scope included reconstitution of a sludge core sample distributed among four to six 4 -L polypropylene bottles into a single container. The reconstituted core sample was then mixed and subsampled to support a variety of characterization activities. Additional core sludge subsamples were combined to prepare a container composite. The container composite was fractionated by wet sieving through a 2, 000 micron mesh and a 500 -micron mesh sieve. Each <b>sieve</b> <b>fraction</b> was sampled to support a suite of analyses. The core composite analysis scope included density determination, radioisotope analysis, and metals analysis, including the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Hazardous Waste Facility Permit metals (with the exception of mercury). The container composite analysis included most of the core composite analysis scope plus particle size distribution, particle density, rheology, and crystalline phase identification. A summary of the received samples, core sample reconstitution and subsampling activities, container composite preparation and subsampling activities, physical properties, and analytical results are presented. Supporting data and documentation are provided in the appendices. There were no cases of sample or data loss {{and all of the}} available samples and data are reported as required by the Quality Assurance Project Plan/Sampling and Analysis Plan...|$|E

TAP (temporal anal. of products) outlet pulse responses over a one-zone bed with porous particles. Different temps., gas molar masses, and pellet <b>sieve</b> <b>fractions</b> were used to validate the Knudsen diffusion relation for inert gases inside porous catalyst pellets. The zeroth to third moments of the outlet pulse response were anal. derived for rectangular, cylindrical and spherical pellets. The third moment provides a significantly more accurate access to the intrapellet diffusivity than the second moment does. The exptl. window of the TAP reactor is explored for porous silica as catalyst support bed filling. The relevance of concn. gradients inside the pellet is illustrated with model simulations...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of {{particle size data}} is limited when one uses sleve-derlved weight frequency data, inas-much {{as there is no}} well-defined sample "size " associated with the total sample. However, the smallest measur-able (reproducible) weight-unit used in the technique may be considered as a basic unit for weight frequency. On this basis the sample size is defined {{by the total number of}} such weight units in the sample. Thus, if the <b>sieve</b> <b>fractions</b> are weighed to the nearest 0. 05 gram, the sample size is found by dividing the total sample weight by 0. 05 gram. A numerical example lends support o the concept hat population units may advanta-geously be defined as aggregates of grains, rather than as individual grains, in size frequency analysis...|$|R
40|$|K-feldspar (Kfs) {{from the}} Chain of Ponds Pluton (CPP) is the archetypal {{reference}} material, on which thermochronological modeling of Ar diffusion in discrete “domains” was founded. We re-examine the CPP Kfs using cathodoluminescence and back-scattered electron imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and electron probe microanalysis. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar stepwise heating experiments on different <b>sieve</b> <b>fractions,</b> and on handpicked and unpicked aliquots, are compared. Our results reproduce the staircase-shaped age spectrum and the Arrhenius {{trajectory of the}} literature sample, confirming that samples collected from the same locality have an identical Ar isotope record. Even the most pristine-looking Kfs from the CPP contains successive generations of secondary, metasomatic/retrograde mineral replacements that post-date magmatic crystallization. These chemically and chronologically distinct phases are responsible for its staircase-shaped age spectra, which are modified by handpicking. While genuine within-grain diffusion gradients are not ruled out by these data, this study demonstrates {{that the most important}} control on staircase-shaped age spectra is the simultaneous presence of heterochemical, diachronous post-magmatic mineral growth. At least five distinct mineral species were identified in the Kfs separate, three of which can be traced to external fluids interacting with the CPP in a chemically open system. <b>Sieve</b> <b>fractions</b> have size-shifted Arrhenius trajectories, negating the existence of the smallest “diffusion domains”. Heterochemical phases also {{play an important role in}} producing non-linear trajectories. In vacuo degassing rates recovered from Arrhenius plots are neither related to true Fick’s Law diffusion nor to the staircase shape of the age spectra. The CPP Kfs used to define the "diffusion domain" model demonstrates the predominance of metasomatic alteration by hydrothermal fluids and recrystallization in establishing the natural Ar distribution amongst different coexisting phases that gives rise to the staircase-shaped age spectrum. Microbeam imaging of textures is as essential for 40 Ar- 39 Ar hygrochronology as it is for U-Pb geochronology...|$|R
