40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of participation in a Computer-Assisted instructional program (CAI) on fourth grade student attitudes and achievement in reading and mathematics. This study, based on Campbell and Stanley's quasiexperimental design 10, utilized Diascriptive Reading software for the CAI mathematics group and Milliken Math Sequences software for the CAI mathematics group and was completed by 242 students. The time span between pretests and posttests was seven months. Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Level 10, Form 7 / 8 was used for achievement testing and Estes Attitude Scale was used for attitude testing. Analysis of covariance was used to determine significance at the. 05 level. The findings for this study were: 1. Reading Comprehension posttest <b>scores</b> were <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> for the control group than for the reading experimental group; 2. Reading Comprehension posttest <b>scores</b> were not <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> for boys than for girls within the reading experimental group; 3.

40|$|Abstract: Concern {{about the}} {{prevalence}} of sexism and eating disorders (EDs) underlies this study, which had two goals: 1) To analyze gender differences and changes with age in sexism and in eating disorders (EDs) (DT-drive for thinness, BN-bulimia, BD-body dissatisfaction); and 2) to explore the relations between sexism and EDs. The sample comprised 941 students from 14 to 25 years old. The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick & Fiske, 1996) and the Eating Disorders Inventory (Gar-ner, 1990) were applied. The results confirm that males <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> in sexism. Fema-les <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> in DT, BN, BD. Sexism decreased with age. BN increased with age, DT and BD did not vary, whereas some psychological traits (perfectionism, maturity fears, impul-sivity, and social insecurity) decreased with age.

The three studies examined student achievement in schools in 5 geographically dispersed states.

These findings imply that low and partly middle SES kindergarteners may be at a disadvantage for quality HLEs and so we educators have {{to look for ways to}} support these families. However results also point that all three groups fell within the “moderate HLE” range which shows that Turkish kindergarteners from all SES strata may need to be supported through systematic interventions. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} link between {{unemployment}} and subjective well-being by introducing historically sensitive variables related to neoliberal ideology and policies such as measures of self-blame, shame, work ethic and flexibility. Drawing on a survey study we find that young job seekers (N = 357) have a significantly lower self-reported subjective well-being than employed persons {{of the same age}} (N = 183). Young and older unemployed people (N = 52) report the same level of subjective well-being; however, older unemployed people <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> on clinical measures of depression, anxiety and stress. In contrast, younger job seekers <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> on measures relating to the neoliberal development. We identify a minority of people who do not perceive themselves as unemployed even though they formally are, and drawing on governmentality studies we infer them to be entrepreneurs. We highlight the need to recognize heterogeneity and historical sensitivity when addressing the complex relationship between subjective well-being and unemployment. The implications of this empirical study are that different groups might benefit from different interventions and that policy makers should take this into consideration...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports a}} series of six studies, each {{investigating}} the power of self-rated analytical, creative, and practical abilities for predicting one of six individual-difference variables: cognitive development, modes of thinking, career interests, learning approaches, thinking styles, and personality traits. Contributing to the composition of 18 samples, the 5019 (1904 males and 3115 females) university students were from three cultural groups: Hong Kong, mainland China, and the United States. Each of the six variables was assessed by a self-report inventory. Results indicated that in all three cultures, students who rated themselves higher on the ability scales tended to <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> on the individual-difference variable scales that denote positive values, such as higher cognitive-developmental levels and creativity-generating thinking styles. Moreover, students who rated themselves lower on the ability scales tended to <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> on the individual-difference variable scales that indicate negative values such as a lower cognitive-developmental level and norm-favoring thinking styles. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to both research and education. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} treated a {{combination}} of psychological apathy and decreased motivation as a tendency to lethargy, and implemented a survey into the tendency to lethargy demonstrated by students, in order to study {{the impact of a}} sense of belonging in the four relationships between the student and the people considered most likely to be interacted with during university life—those with family, friends at university, friends outside university and boyfriend/girlfriend. In addition, the authors implemented a survey and study that included additional categories relating to career maturity. The study was performed on 250 university students, using an anonymous questionnaire that graded resp onses using criteria to measure a sense of belonging, psychological apathy characteristics, areas of decreased motivation, and career maturity. The subjects were classified by the school year to which they belonged, their gender, {{and whether or not they}} had a boyfriend/girlfriend, and consideration was given to the relationship between psychological apathy, decreased motivation, career maturity and a sense of belonging. In terms of gender difference in regard to each of the criteria, partially, the study indicated that male students <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> than female students in terms of a sense of belonging, females <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> than males for decreased motivation in regard to classes, and males <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> than females in relation to career maturity. No significant difference in scores was noted between males and females in relation to psychological apathy. The impact of a sense of belonging on psychological apathy, decreased motivation and career motivation was seen in the fact that across all categories, those students with a good relationship with friends at university had a suppressed level of decreased motivation in regard to university by the portions given in this document. </p...|$|R

A 2014 study published in the journal PLoS ONE by researchers Jerzy Wojciechowski,and Maciej Stolarski found differences favoring women for performance-based EI ability tests supporting the held common hypothesis that women have higher EI scores than men do.
