60|$|It {{was also}} {{the secret of the}} {{formation}} of the wonderful Natural Bridge. Part of the rancher's cultivated land, to the extent of several acres, was the level top of this strange bridge. A meadow of alfalfa and a fine vineyard, in the air, like the hanging gardens of Babylon! The natural bridge spanned a deep gorge, at the bottom of which flowed a swift stream of water. Geologically this tremendous arch of limestone cannot be so very old. In comparatively recent times an earthquake or some <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbance</b> or some other natural force caused a spring of water to burst from the slope above the gorge. It ran down, of course, over the rim. The lime salt in the water was deposited, and year by year and age by age advanced toward the opposite side until a bridge crossed the gorge. The swift stream at the bottom kept the opening clear under the bridge.|$|E
6000|$|While {{this book}} {{passed through the}} press, a long {{correspondence}} called [...] "On the Trail of a Ghost" [...] appeared in The Times. It illustrated the copious fallacies which haunt the human intellect. Thus it was maintained by some persons, and denied by others, that sounds of unknown origin were occasionally heard in a certain house. These, it was suggested, might (if really heard) be caused by slight seismic disturbances. Now many people argue, [...] "Blunderstone House is not haunted, for I passed a night there, and nothing unusual occurred". Apply this to a house where noises are actually caused by young earthquakes. Would anybody say: [...] "There are no seismic disturbances near Blunderstone House, for I passed a night there, and none occurred"? Why should a noisy ghost (if {{there is such a}} thing) or a hallucinatory sound (if there is such a thing), be expected to be more punctual and pertinacious than a <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbance?</b> Again, the gentleman who opened the correspondence with a long statement on the negative side, cried out, like others, for scientific publicity, for names of people and places. But neither he nor his allies gave their own names. He did not precisely establish his claim to confidence by publishing his version of private conversations. Yet he expected science and the public to believe his anonymous account of a conversation, with an unnamed person, at which he did not and could not pretend to have been present. He had a theory of sounds heard by himself which could have been proved, or disproved, in five minutes, by a simple experiment. But that experiment he does not say that he made.|$|E

From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{strength}} and behaviour of model reinforced concrete structures subjected to simulated <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are examined. The performance of a closed loop electrohydraulic testing system {{used in conjunction with}} a small shaking table is described. This testing system could accurately reproduce <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbances</b> and was used in the testing of a single storey structure and two six storey structures. All structures had a single bay in each direction and they were approximately one fifth of full size. The problems associated with modelling work are discussed and techniques suitable for constructing small scale three-dimensional model reinforced concrete structures are reported. Loading tests were conducted on typical beam and column structural members and the moment-curvature curves obtained are compared with those determined using theoretical methods. Both static and dynamic cyclic lateral loading tests were conducted on the structures and the apparent strengths of the structures under each type of loading are compared. The accuracy of an existing frame analysis program in predicting the displacement response of the model structures to simulated <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbances</b> is discussed and the more important parameters affecting the response are investigated. The experiments revealed that under lateral loading considerable torsion is induced into the lateral beams and that this may be sufficient to cause failure of those beams. A method is presented for calculating the distribution of torsion induced in the lateral beams and for calculating the magnitude of the torsional contribution to the flexural strength of the longitudinal beams. A discussion on collapse mechanisms is included and a design recommendation is made to reduce the likelihood of the structure collapsing by a column sidesway mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{location}} of seismic events {{can be improved}} if accurate picks can be assigned for later seismic phases, which requires both the detection of an arrival and the recognition of its character. Such phase identifications are particularly valuable {{if they can be}} provided in real-time as the <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbance</b> passes across a broad-band seismic recording station. A simple but promising scheme for characterizing arrivals can be constructed by analysing the energy content of the seismic trace as a function of time. Such an approach can be used to detect arrivals by using a method comparing the short-term average energy to a long-term average, with averaging windows that are adaptive to the local frequency of the <b>seismic</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The phase detector can be tuned to different classes of arrivals by utilizing three-component records. By comparing the energy on the vertical component of motion to that in the horizontal plane, it is possible to start to separate P and S arrivals. Phase assignments can be refined by the use of adaptive filtering and by including polarization information. With an estimate of the azimuth of propagation it is possible to use approximate projection methods which attempt to compensate for the influence of the free surface, since the surface corrections are not a strong function of slowness for teleseismic arrivals. By this means, an instantaneous estimate can be made of the relative contributions of P, SVand SH arrivals which can be very helpful in determining the phase assignment for a particular arrival. Key words: free-surface corrections, frequency content, phase identification, real-time analysis, signal detection. ...|$|E
