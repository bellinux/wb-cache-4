A ~ 150 m sediment succession was recovered from three holes on a bathymetric high ~ 33 km southwest of Montserrat. A series of shipboard and newly-generated chronostratigraphic tools (biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, astrochronology, and stable isotope chemostratigraphy) were employed to generate an integrated age model. Two possible chronostratigraphic interpretations for the Brunhes chron are presented, with hypotheses to explain the discrepancies seen between this study and Wall-Palmer et al. (2014). The recent Wade et al.

Here, we report recent results on the stratigraphy, structure, and evolution of {{the southern part of the}} Vulsini volcanic district (0. 6 - 0. 1 Ma), Roman Province, in the light of a new geological survey for the 1 : 50, 000 map of Italy (CARG Project). We focus on the integration of different kinds of stratigraphic units, including lithostratigraphic, lithosomatic, and unconformity-bounded stratigraphic (UBS) units, to define and group mappable volcanic bodies. Lithostratigraphic units are characterized in terms of textural features, indicative of eruptive and emplacement scenarios, and rock-type compositions. The intervening stratigraphic discontinuities are defined in terms of nature, position, and areal extent, and they are attributed to local depositional processes versus significant temporal hiatuses in the eruptive activity or regional and interregional geological events. The mapped volcanic units are thus correlated to lithosomatic units, corresponding to volcanic source edifices, as well as to the local and regional UBS unit settings recently defined for the Tyrrhenian coast nearby. On these grounds, we illustrate the geological evolution of the study area as the interplay of constructional and destructional volcanic activity, erosion, pedogenesis, <b>secondary</b> volcaniclastic <b>sedimentation</b> during intereruptive periods, and sea-level fluctuations...|$|R

The total {{sedimentation rate}} included both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation.</b> As the annual average total sedimentation rate, 53. 2 6 44. 1 g m 22 d 21, is more than 25 times the primary value, <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> due to wind-induced resuspension is very important. The average of the largest 30 % of wave mixed layer (WML) values, a function of wind speed and effective fetch, strongly correlates with the total sedimentation rate (r 2 values of 0. 69 and 0. 98 at two westerly sites) at most of the sites. As the WML value approaches the water depth, then the orbital motion of the waves and the associated turbulence cause sediment disturbance and resuspension. Changing WML values, then, provide a basis to describe the ‘‘random redistribution’ ’ (RR) of sediment in lakes and these resuspension events can occur as frequently as 2 – 3 times every two weeks. This study provides, for the first time, clear results and a description of the process of RR of sediment in a lake, particularly the link between wind and sediment resuspension.

The theoretically calculated sedimentation kinetics showed a good agreement with the experimentally observed kinetics. Both showed a decline in sedimentation velocity over time, caused primarily by variation in (oo) cyst density. The initial apparent sedimentation velocities in Hanks balanced salt solution at 23 °C was 0. 35 μm · s− 1 for oocysts and 1. 4 μm · s− 1 for cysts. (Oo) cysts that enter the surface water environment by discharges of biologically treated sewage may be attached to sewage particles, and this will affect their sedimentation kinetics. Therefore, (oo) cysts were mixed with settled secondary effluent. (Oo) cysts readily attached to the (biological) particles in effluent; 30 % of both cysts and oocysts attached during the first minutes of mixing, and this fraction increased to approximately 75 % after 24 h. The sedimentation velocity of (oo) cysts attached to secondary effluent particles increased with particle size and was (already in the smallest size fraction [1 to 40 μm]) determined by the sedimentation kinetics of the effluent particles. The observed sedimentation velocities of freely suspended (oo) cysts are probably too low to cause significant sedimentation in surface water or reservoirs. However, since a significant proportion of both cysts and oocysts attached readily to organic biological particles in <b>secondary</b> effluent, <b>sedimentation</b> of attached (oo) cysts after discharge into surface water will probably be a significant factor in the environmental ecology of C. parvum and G. lamblia.

In addition, a landslide breached a diversion canal downstream of the J. C. Boyle dam and caused <b>secondary</b> erosion and <b>sedimentation</b> in the “bypass” reach of the Klamath River. The peak flows and landslide may have influenced fish habitat and river geomorphology. I updated existing flood frequency analyses for four gauges in the upper Klamath River basin using new annual peak streamflow data.

I also identified differences in flood frequency estimates based on the method used to analyze annual peak streamflow data. I evaluated the effects of the December 2005 landslide that breached the canal feeding water to the JC Boyle powerplant. The landslide deposited sediment in the Klamath River and the subsequent closure of the canal resulted in increased flows in the river. I expect the effects of the canal breach on downstream fish habitats to be minor because of the short duration of the canal closure and the high flows in the river since January 2006 that likely mobilized the impinging sediment...|$|R

Their structural properties were investigated by optical denaturation curves, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), electron microscopy, sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium and velocity <b>sedimentation.</b> <b>Secondary</b> {{structures of the}} RNAs and theoretical denaturation curves were calculated using an energy optimization program. The secondary structure of lowest free energy for unit length and oligomeric transcripts is a rod-like structure {{similar to that of the}} mature circular viroids.

At high temperatures, however, (+) strand transcripts exhibited a transition which was more stable than expected from the calculations or than was known from curves of mature viroids. This transition arises from a rearrangement of the central conserved region of viroids to a helical region of 28 stable base pairs either intermolecularly leading to bimolecular complexes, or intramolecularly giving rise to a branched secondary structure. The rearrangement could be detected by electron microscopy, HPLC, and analytical ultracentrifugation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to optimise a numerical model to predict the flow in circular <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> tanks. The numerical models in the literature were reviewed and the new opportunities for research were identified. Single-phase flow characteristics of two circular sedimentation tanks were investigated using the CFD program, CFX-F 3 D. The flow in the circular clarifiers were modelled in two dimensions (axial and radial) and using the standard k-E turbulence model. Results indicated that a vertical inlet instead of a horizontal inlet did not improve the correlation with the experimental data in a pilot-scale tank. Modelling the diurnal variation in flow to a full-scale tank significantly improved the correlation with experimental data. The `Eulerian multi-fluid' model in the program, CFX-F 3 D was modified to predict the flow in circular <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> tanks. The model compared quite closely with the measured residence time of the effluent and return activated sludge (RAS) in a conventional secondary clarifier. The residence time of the effluent in another secondary clarifier with a turbulent jet, was over-predicted. The mean particle diameter in the model was found by comparing the numerical predictions with experimental data. The particle diameter was between 100 to 190 μm for the secondary clarifiers, which was {{in agreement with the}} experimental data in the literature. The flow patterns in the conventional secondary clarifier were affected by the particle density, particle diameter, axial slip velocity, colloids settling parameter, axial turbulent Prandtl number, inlet flow rate and inlet solids concentration. A 3 -D simulation of the conventional secondary clarifier was in agreement with a 2 -D simulation. Recommended values were given for all these parameters. However, the drag force between the phases was not formulated correctly and the water surface was modelled as a symmetry plane.

40|$|A {{real-time}} solids odor {{monitoring system}} provides an odor management feedback tool for both process control and a biosolids management program. Since higher odor levels means higher process costs, {{as well as}} greater potential for nuisance odors at land application sites, identifying the processes that contribute to these elevated levels is critical to responsible, economical, and efficient wastewater plant management and biosolids land application programs. 	A real-time system is currently being utilized to monitor DC Water's 370 mgd plant in Washington, D. C. Each year, DC Water applies biosolids to over 20, 000 acres of agricultural land. Nuisance odors from recycling biosolids on land may drift into surrounding neighborhoods and motivate neighboring communities to enact legislation to ban land application. Therefore, the reduction of odor emissions from biosolids recycled on field sites is a major concern. 	Odors levels generated by dewatered solids and limed biosolids are measured by headspace monitoring devices in enclosed conveyance systems. Both total reduced sulfur compounds (TRS) and nitrogen (N) -containing compounds are measured with online electro-chemical sensors. The system correlates odorant levels of dewatered solids and biosolids and utilizes treatment process scenarios and various operational parameters throughout the wastewater treatment process. This study uses ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation and instrumental variable (IV) estimation to create explanatory and predictive models. Furthermore, cross-validation analyses are employed to validate both explanatory and predictive models. 	Data analyses suggest that waste-activated percent solids (WAS %S) and dissolved-air flotation total solids (DAF TS) can contribute to mitigating TRS. However, all process variables at <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation,</b> which are gravity thickening percent solids (GT %S), gravity total solids (GT TS), and blend ratio, can contribute to increase TRS. The IV estimation indicates that % lime feeding, # centrifuges, cake percent solids (Cake %S), temperature at secondary effluent, and ambient temperature cannot directly explain TRS post-lime, but they do explain TRS levels via post-lime temperature. Additionally, cationic polymer at the secondary and dewatering process coupled with post lime temperature can contribute to increase N-containing compounds at the lime addition process. The accumulated cationic polymer inside the sludge of <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> can also contribute to high N-containing compounds at the downstream. </italic...|$|E

Die Belastungsgrenze haengt von der Art der abfiltrierbaren Stoffe ab. Im Dauerbetrieb liegt die Obergrenze bei 20 - 40 mg/l. Kurzfristig koennen auch hoehere Belastungen abgefangen werden. Bei weitgehender Reduzierung von Phosphaten wird die Filtration durch Faellung und Flockung ergaenzt (Flockungsfiltration).

40|$|Leather {{industry}} {{plays an}} important role in the economic development of the country and the wastewater from this industry is a major source of pollution among all industrial sectors considering both volume and composition of effluent. During leather processing, a number of size reduction, levelling and purification operations are carried out which results in generation of untanned and tanned proteinaceous waste materials which pose as a major environmental problem if not managed effectively. Large-scale production systems are adopted for leather processing and so this industry receives focus of environmentalists and society. Consequently, tremendous pressure is exerted by various pollution regulatory bodies to treat the effluents before disposal. The tannery effluents contain tannins, high suspended solids, and dissolved solids, BOD and some inorganic compounds such as chlorides, sulphides, sulphates, sodium and some toxic heavy metals, which affect the environment. Thus there is a need for innovative treatment technologies for the removal of these heavy metal ions from wastewater. Numerous physical and chemical methods such as screening, flow equalization, primary sedimentation, chemical flocculation, aerobic activated sludge treatment, <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> have been employed for the disposal of wastes. These methods are ver...|$|E
40|$|Riyadh Municipal Treatment Plant has a {{capacity}} of 200, 000 m 3 /day of wastewater. Wastewater is screened, de-gritted and aerated in two-parallel basins. The aerated sewage is then distributed to four primary sedimentation tanks. The clarified liquor is then subjected to biological treatment based on the activated sludge process with nitrification/denitrification in a single tank. The liquor passes alternating aerobic and anoxic zones. The biological treated liquor is then distributed to 12 <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> tanks for separation of clarified water and sludge withdrawal. The clarified water is treated in sand gravity filters. Finally it undergoes chlorination. The reuse of treated municipal wastewater for irrigation is the oldest and largest reuse. However, water with good quality can be produced if reverse osmosis (RO) {{is used for the}} treatment of the tertiary treated municipal water. This will help in preserving the natural strategic water resources, reducing the environmental pollution as well as providing alternative resources. This paper describes the design basics of utilizing a reverse osmosis technology in the treatment of tertiary treated municipal water. Special emphasis will be made on the design parameters and membrane characteristics for reclaiming effluent from Riyadh Municipal Treatment Plant...|$|E
40|$|This study concems the {{dynamics}} of the nitrifying efficiency of a trickling filter for waste water treatment. In a novel approach, based on minimum plant area usage, a filter will be placed after the <b>secondary</b> <b>sedimentation</b> tanks with recirculation to the activated sludge process stage. The objective of the trickling filter model is to describe the growth of the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter in the bio-film. A steady state mass-balance model for the substrates in the film based on Monod kinetics has been formulated. The dynamics of the filter, or the “memory”, is described by a division of the film in four volume fractions, Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, inert (non-active) material and water. These fractions are calculated at different depths of the film as well as for various layers of the filter StrUCtUTe. Data from a pilot plant at Rya treatment plant in Gothenburg, Sweden, have provided the necessary feedback for calculating model parameters, verifying assumptions etc. A shooting and matching routine in the NAG Fortran library is used for the solution of the model equations. Simulations performed so far have indicated that it can take days and even weeks for changes in the bacteria populations to take place. This means that the working point for the proposed full scale filter at the plant should track the past history of the filter...|$|E
