40|$|As part of {{the trend}} towards Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) for the next leap in {{computing}} performance, many architectures have explored sharing the last level of cache among different processors for better performance–cost ratio and improved resource allocation. Shared cache management is a crucial CMP design aspect {{for the performance of}} the system. This paper first presents a new classification of cache misses – CII: Compulsory, Inter-processor and Intra-processor misses – for CMPs with shared caches to provide {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between memory transactions of different processors at the level of shared cache in a CMP. We then propose a novel approach, called <b>set</b> <b>pinning,</b> for eliminating inter-processor misses and reducing intra-processor misses in a shared cache. Furthermore, we show that an adaptive <b>set</b> <b>pinning</b> scheme improves over the benefits obtained by the <b>set</b> <b>pinning</b> scheme by significantly reducing the number of off–chip accesses. Extensive analysis of these approaches with SPEComp 2001 benchmarks is performed using a full system simulator. Our experiments indicate that the <b>set</b> <b>pinning</b> scheme achieves an average improvement of 22. 18 % in the L 2 miss rate while the adaptive <b>set</b> <b>pinning</b> scheme reduces the miss rates by an average of 47. 94 % as compared to the traditional shared cache scheme.

40|$|In {{the field}} of Smart Homes a {{fundamental}} issue {{is that of the}} localization of people. Some technologies that work well outdoors, such as GPS, do not function as well inside a house. The problem of indoor localization is far from being solved, as a number of issues have to be addressed such as costs, acceptability of the solution by the user, robustness of the solution, amount of structural changes to the buildings that have to occur, and privacy. The issue is often addressed recurring to high frequency radio waves. Techniques like Time of Arrival, Angle of Arrival and Signal Strength can be used to provide an estimate of the position of a device. Since the earlier two have the need of highly specialized hardware then the latter, we opt to investigate a solution that adopts the use of a Signal Strength Identifier. The Signal Strength Identifier, or SSID for short, is a value that indicates the strength of a received WIFI signal. This approach has to handle the problem that the design of the building (such as walls, pipes, etc.) interferes with the line of sight of the signal and causes problems. For instance, the degradation of the signal is not regular. To tackle this problem, we propose the use of Calibration Pin Points. These Pin Points provide each room with one or more Points of measured SSID values. From these values features can be extracted, which in turn can be used to either locate a device in relation to such a Pin Point. In this paper we define the method to <b>set</b> <b>Pin</b> Points and use them for indoor localization, we also provide an evaluation of the method in a building of the University of Groningen. The approach is {{based on the fact that}} the person to be localized carries a device to receive the earlier mentioned signal strengths. In our evaluation, we resort to a simple implementation that can easily be ported to Hardware that is already in many users possessions. The increase of Smart Phones like the iPhone, Android Phones, Windows Mobile Phones, Symbian S 60 Phones and the likes can be used to help tackle this problem. Many of these devices are capable of receiving these Signal Strengths and sending these values to a server. The actual localisation is Server side as to prevent load on the Smart Phone. As a result the paper proposes a system that is capable of locating this device with a high enough precision to be used in a Smart House. The solution is cost effective with the use of ordinary access points and routers and can be implemented in any house without any construction necessary. Provided of course the house owners places the earlier mentioned routers and carry their phones with them. ...|$|E
