These ground-based instruments have used large discrete components, which are impractical for remote operation in space-based deployment. The Texas Instruments 2 ̆ 7 Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) was originally conceived purely for display purposes, {{but is a}} viable candidate to be use as a <b>slit</b> <b>mask</b> in a space-based multi-object spectrograph (MOS). The Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing industry has enabled the robust integration of both silicon transistors and Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) optical components into a very reliable monolithic chip (the DMD). The focus of this work was in three areas that addressed the suitability of proposing DMDs for future space missions. The DMDs were optically characterized to assess their utility in a spectrograph. The DMDs were also cooled in a liquid nitrogen dewar to determine their minimum operating temperature. The low temperature tests indicated that the DMD can operate to temperatures as low as 130 K. In addition, several DMDs were irradiated with high-energy protons at the LBNL 882 ̆ 2 Cyclotron to determine how robust the devices are to ionizing radiation (protons).

40|$|The astronomical {{community}} {{continues to}} be interested in suitable programmable <b>slit</b> <b>masks</b> for use in multi-object spectrometers (MOSs) on space missions. There have been ground-based MOS utilizing digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and they have proven to be highly accurate and reliable instruments. This paper summarizes the results of a continuing study to investigate the performance of DMDs under conditions associated with space deployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration and mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD under cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the long-term reflectance of a bare device have also been investigated. The results of the radiation testing demonstrate that DMDs in orbit would experience negligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden, we predict SEU rate of 5. 6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock testing was performed according to the NASA General Environmental Verification Standard (GEVS), no mirrors failed in the devices tested. The results of low temperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected by the thermal load and operate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity of a bare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient conditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs off state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000 /: 1 when illuminated with an f/ 4 optical beam. Overall, DMDs are extremely robust and promise to provide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in space as remotely programmable <b>slit</b> <b>masks</b> for MOS design...|$|R

40|$|Computer Generated Holograms (CGHs) {{are useful}} for {{wavefront}} shaping and complex optics testing, including aspherical and free-form optics. Today, CGHs are recorded directly with a laser or intermediates masks but allows only recording binary CGHs; binary CGHs are efficient but can reconstruct only pixilated images. We propose to use a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) for writing binary CGHs as well as grayscale CGHs, able to reconstruct fulfilled images. DMD is actually studied at LAM, for generating programmable <b>slit</b> <b>masks</b> in multi-object spectrographs. It is composed of 2048 x 1080 individually controllable micro-mirrors, with a pitch of 13. 68 Î¼m. This is a real-time reconfigurable mask, perfect for recording CGHs. A first setup has been developed for hologram recording, where the DMD is enlightened with a collimated beam and illuminates a photosensible plate through an Offner relay, with a magnification of 1 : 1. Our set up resolution is 2 - 3 Î¼m, leading to a CGH resolution equal to the DMD micro mirror size. In order to write and erase CGHs during test procedure or on request, we use a photochromic plate called PUR-GD 71 - 50 -ST developed at Politecnico di Milano. It is opaque at rest, and becomes transparent when it is illuminated with visible light, between 500 and 700 nm; then it can be erased by a UV flash. We choose to code the CGHs in equally spaced levels, so called stepped CGH. We recorded up to 1000 x 1000 pixels CGHs with a contrast greater than 50, knowing that the material is able to reach an ultimate contrast of 1000. A second bench has also been developed, dedicated to {{the reconstruction of the}} recorded images with a 632. 8 nm He-Ne laser beam. Very faithful reconstructions have been obtained. Thanks to our recording and reconstruction set-ups, {{we have been able to}} successfully record binary and stepped CGHs, and reconstruct them with a high fidelity, revealing the potential of this method for generating programmable/rewritable stepped CGHs on photochromic materials...|$|R

Rather than gray ash, the {{substance}} of the Sea is a white, caustic powder that blows around and causes those who do not protect their mouths and noses with damp cloths to cough blood. Mixed with water, it forms a strong lye. The light reflecting off the white dunes will blind those who do not protect their eyes with <b>slitted</b> visors or <b>masks.</b> Glassy depressions in the central Sea are said to correspond to former cities of the Suel.|$|R
