5000|$|As median {{home prices}} {{began to rise}} {{dramatically}} in 2000-2001 following the fall in interest rates, <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases</b> of homes also increased. Fortune magazine's article on housing speculation in 2005 said, [...] "America was awash in a stark, raving frenzy that looked every bit as crazy as dot-com stocks." [...] In a 2006 interview in BusinessWeek magazine, Yale economist Robert Shiller said {{of the impact of}} speculators on long term valuations, [...] "I worry about a big fall because prices today are being supported by a speculative fever", and former NAR chief economist David Lereah said in 2005 that [...] "there's a speculative element in home buying now."footnote Speculation in some local markets has been greater than others, and any correction in valuations is expected to be strongly related to the percentage amount of <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases.</b> In the same BusinessWeek interview, Angelo Mozilo, CEO of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, said in March 2006: [...] In areas where you have had heavy speculation, you could have 30% price declines... A year or a year and half from now, you will have seen a slow deterioration of home values and a substantial deterioration in those areas where there has been speculative excess. The chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, David Seiders, said that California, Las Vegas, Florida and the Washington, D.C., area [...] "have the largest potential for a price slowdown" [...] because the rising prices in those markets were fed by speculators who bought homes intending to [...] "flip" [...] or sell them for a quick profit.Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher said in 2006 that the Fed held its target rate at 1 percent [...] "longer than it should have been" [...] and unintentionally prompted speculation in the housing market.|$|R

5000|$|The Forfeit Estates Commission {{had offered}} for sale in July 1723 the {{interests}} in remainder in the Derwentwater estates contingent upon the death without male issue of John.

Accordingly, the sale was declared void by a 1731 Act. [...] The purchase was, according to the Commissioners' Registrar, made on behalf of a group including John Bond, Sir Joseph Eyles and Matthew White.

25|$|Historically, in many countries, a {{contract}} {{needs to have}} a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage {{of the value of the}} transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases</b> of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the United States, transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.|$|R

60|$|I {{have already}} {{described}} {{the state of}} the markets for commodities which accompanies what is termed a commercial crisis. At such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand: in other words, there is an under-supply of money. From the sudden annihilation of a great mass of credit, every one dislikes to part with ready money, and many are anxious to procure it at any sacrifice. Almost everybody, therefore, is a seller, and there are scarcely any buyers: so that there may really be, though only while the crisis lasts, an extreme depression of general prices, from what may be indiscriminately called a glut of commodities or a dearth of money. But it is a great error to suppose, with Sismondi, that a commercial crisis is the effect of a general excess of production. It is simply the consequence of an excess of <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases.</b> It is not a gradual advent of low prices, but a sudden recoil from prices extravagantly high: its immediate cause is a contraction of credit, and the remedy is, not a diminution of supply, but the restoration of confidence. It is also evident that this temporary derangement of markets is an evil only because it is temporary. The fall being solely of money prices, if prices did not rise again no dealer would lose, since the smaller price would be worth as much to him as the larger price was before. In no matter does this phenomenon answer to the description which these celebrated economists have given of the evil of over-production. That permanent decline in the circumstances of producers, for want of markets, which those writers contemplate, is a conception to which the nature of a commercial crisis gives no support.|$|R
60|$|The {{inclination}} of the mercantile {{public to}} increase their demand for commodities by making use of all or much of their credit as a purchasing power depends on their expectation of profit. When {{there is a general}} impression that the price of some commodity is likely to rise from an extra demand, a short crop, obstructions to importation, or any other cause, there is a disposition among dealers {{to increase their}} stocks in order to profit by the expected rise. This disposition tends in itself to produce the effect which it looks forward to—a rise of price; and, if the rise is considerable and progressive, other speculators are attracted, who, so long as the price has not begun to fall, are willing to believe that it will continue rising. These, by further purchases, produce a further advance, and thus a rise of price, for which there were originally some rational grounds, is often heightened by merely <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases,</b> until it greatly exceeds what the original grounds will justify. After a time this begins to be perceived, the price ceases to rise, and the holders, thinking it time to realize their gains, are anxious to sell. Then the price begins to decline, the holders rush into the market to avoid a still greater loss, and, few being willing to buy in a falling market, the price falls much more suddenly than it rose. Those who have bought at a higher price than reasonable calculation justified, and who have been overtaken by the revulsion before they had realized, are losers in proportion to the greatness of the fall and to the quantity of the commodity which they hold, or have bound themselves to pay for.|$|R

60|$|This is {{the ideal}} extreme case {{of what is called}} a {{commercial}} crisis. There {{is said to be a}} commercial crisis when a great number of merchants and traders at once either have, or apprehend that they shall have, a difficulty in meeting their engagements. The most usual cause of this general embarrassment is the recoil of prices after they have been raised by a spirit of speculation, intense in degree, and extending to many commodities. When, after such a rise, the reaction comes and prices begin to fall, though at first perhaps only through the desire of the holders to realize, <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases</b> cease; but, were this all, prices would only fall to the level from which they rose, or to that which is justified by the state of the consumption and of the supply. They fall, however, much lower; for as, when prices were rising, and everybody apparently making a fortune, it was easy to obtain almost any amount of credit, so now, when everybody seems to be losing, and many fail entirely, it is with difficulty that firms of known solidity can obtain even the credit to which they are accustomed, and which it is the greatest inconvenience to them to be without, because all dealers have engagements to fulfill, and, nobody feeling sure that the portion of his means which he has intrusted to others will be available in time, no one likes to part with ready money, or to postpone his claim to it. To these rational considerations there is superadded, in extreme cases, a panic as unreasoning as the previous over-confidence; money is borrowed for short periods at almost any rate of interest, and sales of goods for immediate payment are made at almost any sacrifice. Thus general prices, during a commercial revulsion, fall as much below the usual level as during the previous period of speculation they have risen above it; the fall, as well as the rise, originating not in anything affecting money, but in the state of credit.|$|R

40|$|World {{market prices}} for {{industrial}} raw materials {{have picked up}} strongly since early 1994. On annual average, the increase over 1993 is estimated at 16 percent. Major reasons for the rebound are the business cycle recovery and inventory build-up in industrialized countries, supply cuts, and <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases.</b> Commodity prices are generally expected to continue rising throughout 1995 and into early 1996. Projections for industrial raw materials are for an increase of 17 percent in 1995 and of 2 {{percent in the first}} quarter of 1996. Price hikes in 1995 are expected to be strongest for agricultural commodities (+ 20 percent). Quotations for pulp may move up by as much as 33 percent, due to supply shortages for timber on the one hand and the cyclical strengthening of demand on the other. Sawn timber is projected to go up by 18 percent; here, too, prices reflect more scarce supply. Prices for cotton in 1994 were affected by higher world import demand caused by poor harvests in major producer countries like China and India, leading to an average price increase of approximately 25 percent. In 1995, quotations may go up by a further 9 percent, despite an expected increase in aggregate supply. Prices of wool, having risen by 43 percent in 1994, may increase another 23 percent. Non-ferrous metals are projected to become 17 percent more expensive in 1995, with lead topping the increase (+ 22 percent). Copper prices (+ 18 percent in 1994, + 20 percent in 1995) are being pushed upward by strong demand in the U. S. and in South-East Asia, and by the recovery in Europe. Aluminum prices may rise by 19 percent while nickel (+ 12 percent), zinc (+ 9 percent), and tin (+ 3 percent) should register below-average price increases. Austrian imports of industrial raw materials, on a schilling basis, recorded a lower rate of inflation in 1994 (first to third quarter + 7. 9 percent year-over-year) than world market prices on a dollar basis. This is explained partly by the weakening of the dollar and partly by a structural composition effect of Austrian commodity imports. Industrierohstoffpreise erholen sich stärker als erwartet.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the current trend in urban condominium and loft sales in the United States. It focuses specifically on the question of whom, demographically speaking, is buying the incredible influx of new urban residential products that has come onto the market since 2000. There is only anecdotal evidence gathered to date, where some claim that it is the empty-nesters abandoning the suburbs for the convenience of city life. However, there has not been the corresponding drop in suburban population levels or house sale levels to corroborate that hypothesis. Other market participants claim that the sales are primarily to investors, who are either renting or riding appreciation expectations to resell. If that is true, then there are considerable market implications for the future. Others project that it is an urban pied-a-terre trend; however the 2000 census only identifies 3 % of the whole housing stock as seasonal, recreational, or second homes. This thesis pools and analyzes recent historical data in four urban downtowns: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Diego to determine what is happening in each city and to try to discover a national trend. It utilizes raw mortgage origination data, assessor's data, and surveys and interviews with developers and brokers {{in each of the four}} designated cities. (cont.) In addition to demographic profiles of buyers, this study determines whether these are second homes, <b>speculative</b> <b>purchases,</b> or complete relocations from outside the city. Ultimately, what can be concluded from this analysis is that a much larger segment of demand for urban condos in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and San Diego consists of second home purchasers and investors than are counted in the 2000 Census. Surveys of 7849 units indicate 66 % owner occupancy, 22 % second home purchase plus investors with no plan to rent and finally another 12 % investors who rent out their units. Trends are similar across markets, although the Atlanta market is driven by younger buyers and San Diego has the lowest percentage of owner occupants, indicating the most speculative buying. by Robert M.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical essays in financial economics that explore the role financial regulation can play in firm, household, and investor decision making. In the first chapter for households with homes worth less than the mortgage I test the effect of "household debt overhang" on their labor supply decisions. I utilize a new transaction-level dataset with comprehensive information on assets, liabilities, and deposits for all customers of a major U. S. financial institution from 2010 - 2014. I then exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of home purchases among households in the same region and time as an instrument for the probability of negative home equity and find that negative equity causes a 2 %- 6 % reduction in household labor supply. These results are robust to the inclusion of time-varying national cohort fixed effects as well as using a life-event driven proxy for the timing of home purchase based on the date of college attendance. Income-contingent loss mitigation creates implicit marginal tax rates that provide a plausible channel by which household debt overhang acts. Consistent with this explanation I find that the labor supply decline is larger in regions where mortgage modifications are more prevalent, even if foreclosures occur less frequently. Taken together these results provide evidence that the moral hazard problem caused by mortgage debt overhang can exacerbate employment declines and highlights the potential unintended consequences of mortgage assistance programs. In the second chapter I investigate whether restrictions on bank speculation can be costly for non-financial firms by examining the unexpected inception of federal rating-contingent investment restrictions in 1936 preventing banks from <b>purchasing</b> <b>speculative</b> grade securities. Immediately following the ruling I find a persistent 3 - 5 % equity value decline for firms requiring speculative financing, concentrated in industries reliant on external financing, but no change in bond yields. Rather than face increases in default risk or direct interest costs these firms reduce debt issuances to improve ratings, leading to reduced investment and asset growth {{in the years following}} the ruling. In the third chapter (co-authored with Eric Hughson and Marc Weidenmier) we explore the role clearinghouses play in global financial stability. Empirical identification of the effect of centralized clearing on counterparty risk is challenging because of the co-incidence of macro-economic turbulence and the introduction of clearinghouses. We overcome these concerns by examining a novel historical experiment, the establishment of a clearinghouse on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1892. During this period the largest NYSE stocks were also listed on the Consolidated Stock Exchange (CSE), which already had a clearinghouse. Using identical securities on the CSE as a control, we find that the introduction of clearing reduced annualized volatility of NYSE returns by 90 - 173 bps and increased asset values. Prior to clearing, shocks to overnight lending rates reduced the value of stocks on the NYSE, relative to identical stocks on the CSE, but this was no longer true after the establishment of clearing. We also show that at least V 2 of the average reduction in counterparty risk on the NYSE is driven by a reduction in contagion risk - the risk of a cascade of broker defaults. Our results indicate that clearing can cause a significant improvement in market stability and value through a reduction in network contagion and counterparty risk. Chapter 1.

40|$|Commercial {{banks were}} leading {{participants}} in the U. S. securities markets during the great bull markets of the 19202 ̆ 7 s and the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Those stock market booms and the crashes that followed were extraordinary events. Is it merely a coincidence that the two most dramatic stock market booms and crashes in U. S. history occurred during periods when commercial banks played major roles in our securities markets? Or did the exercise of universal banking powers contribute to the financial and economic conditions that produced both episodes? This essay is the first installment of a larger project that seeks to answer these questions. This essay offers a preliminary assessment of {{the role played by}} universal banks in the economic boom-and-bust cycle of 1921 - 33. Part I reviews the reasons for Congress 2 ̆ 7 decision to prohibit universal banking in 1933. Senator Carter Glass and other proponents of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) maintained that banks and their securities affiliates encouraged speculative behavior and helped to promote unsustainable booms in the securities markets and the broader economy. Glass and his colleagues also contended that universal banking powers created conflicts of interest that prevented commercial banks from acting as impartial lenders or objective investment advisors. Part II examines the role of commercial banks during the economic boom of the 19202 ̆ 7 s. In response to a relaxation of legal rules governing bank powers, banks greatly expanded their financing of business firms and consumers through five channels - loans on securities, securities investments, public offerings of securities, real estate mortgages, and consumer credit. This surge of new financing enabled business firms and consumers to assume heavy debt burdens and to make risky investments that proved to be unviable when the U. S. economy entered a sharp recession in the summer of 1929. In addition, the entry of commercial banks into the securities markets created competitive pressures that caused commercial banks and traditional investment banks to abandon prudential standards and promote speculative domestic and foreign ventures. Commercial banks re-entered the securities markets during the 19902 ̆ 7 s as a result of court decisions and administrative rulings that opened loopholes in the GSA. In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which effectively repealed the GSA and authorized the creation of financial holding companies. GLBA reflected a widely-shared view among modern scholars that the 1933 legislation was misguided from the outset. However, due to the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 and the revelation of scandals involving universal banks (e. g., Enron and WorldCom), some commentators have begun to reconsider the benefits and risks of universal banking. Part III of the essay offers a preliminary response to the modern scholarly critique of the GSA. First, contrary to the claims of some scholars, Congress did not adopt the 1933 legislation for the purpose of protecting investment banks from competition with commercial banks. Instead, Congress separated commercial and investment banking in order to prevent speculative booms and to ensure that banks acted impartially in making loans and providing investment advice. Second, there was substantial evidence for Congress 2 ̆ 7 belief that universal banks posed serious risks to the banking system. Universal banks undermined the soundness of smaller correspondent banks by encouraging them to <b>purchase</b> <b>speculative</b> securities during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Losses on securities were a major cause of bank failures during the 19302 ̆ 7 s. In addition, several large universal banks failed between 1930 and 1933, due in part to risky investments and loans they made to support their own stock prices and to prop up affiliates. Those failures triggered regional banking panics and also contributed to the widespread loss of depositor confidence in the banking system. Third, modern scholars have attacked the conclusions reached by the Pecora investigation of 1933 - 34. However, earlier scholars concluded that the Pecora hearings produced credible evidence of conflicts of interest and other abuses involving universal banks during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Given recent episodes of similar misconduct by universal banks during the 19902 ̆ 7 s, {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the risks created by universal banks during both periods...|$|R
