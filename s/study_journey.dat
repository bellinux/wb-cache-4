40|$|Abstract: Car {{dependence}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in the sustainability of cities with low-density suburban sprawl. Increasing {{the use of public}} transport is one of the policy objectives commonly adopted to overcome this problem. It is essential to <b>study</b> <b>journey</b> to work travel behavior by car and bus. This paper applied preference function to analyze travel behavior and Moran’s I spatial statistic to evaluate the spatial association. The results indicated that the commuting preferences of residents have moved towards distance maximization. In general, bus was preferred for shorter distance trips whilst car was preferred for longer distance trips. Unlike car, by increasing distances from the Central Business District, residents tended to use bus for shorter distance trip. A significant positive spatial association was identified for both the slope preferences by car and bus where zones with a preference towards longer or shorter trips tended to travel to zones with similar preferences...|$|E

40|$|We all receive paper based {{certificates}} {{during our}} <b>study</b> <b>journey,</b> {{but they are}} hard to manage to avoid damage or loss. The field of e-learning provides technological developments, such as e-portfolios, which enable greater power and flexibility in displaying achievements. These may include on-line versions of certificates of the applicant's attainment which overcome the limitations of paper-based versions. However, these "e-certificates" present a number of practical challenges, which so far have not been addressed, such as the validation of claimed e-qualification certificates. This paper addresses the issues, and explores the gap between current e-portfolio tools and the desired e-qualification certificate system. Through analysis of the existing systems and e-certificate use cases, we have identified existing services that can be reused and the services that require further development, thereby presenting an approach which solves the above problems. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} recommendation from this research meets the design requirements, and could form the foundation of future e-certificate implementations...|$|E
30|$|Sometime in {{the spring}} of 1665, De Graaf left Leiden for a ‘peregrinatio academia’, a <b>study</b> <b>journey,</b> through France where an {{interested}} audience came to listen to his lectures and participated in his demonstrations of the pancreatic fistula. On 23 July 1665, he earned his medical degree of ‘medicinae doctor’ in Angers, after which he returned to his home country and established himself in Delft at the end of 1666. He became one the most sought-after physicians in that city and further completed his studies on the structure and the functions of male and female sex organs [6, 7]. De Graaf selected Delft because of its favourable scientific climate, physicians and surgeons were interested in medical investigative work, and he had access there to an anatomy theatre and a well-stocked library. But whilst Leiden was indeed a scientific centre, De Graaf was well aware that an academic career in that city was impossible for him because of his Roman Catholic beliefs. Nonetheless, his years in Delft were happy ones. He found peace and tranquility and married on 13 June 1672. Unfortunately, his married bliss was ended abruptly by his death on 17 August 1673. His son, who was born after his passing, was christened with his name and also became a physician.|$|E
40|$|Higher {{education}} is undergoing change, whereby technology {{is used to}} mediate learning for an increasingly diverse student population. Many choose flexible options studying online and at a distance to the university. Such policy directions have created an educational problem for students, namely how to manage this mode of learning while maintaining complex lives juggling work, home and study. This research forms part of an extended design-based research project studying the practical problem of health science students transitioning to online distance study. A subset of five students studying an undergraduate fully online nursing degree at a regional university {{was used to examine}} their engagement with an online orientation resource designed to smooth the transition to university study. Their digital footprints illustrating student access levels were combined with qualitative interview data to identify and interpret meanings about the way they encountered and constructed their study world. Findings indicated that technical aspects, lifestyle, interaction and academic supports created both barriers and enablers for this transition. The essence of the students’ experience revealed a complex <b>study</b> <b>journey</b> with multiple layers of transition. This involved adjusting to being a university student, managing the distance and online environment and re-positioning their occupational mindset. Their ability to manage these layers of transition was influenced by their selfregulatory varied approaches to enable successful transition for distance and online learners...|$|E

Our own practices, as a learning development lecturer and a literacy advisor, have been challenged by what we heard and this has prompted us to investigate dyslexia and the discourses {{that are associated with}} it in more depth. In order to learn more we interviewed four students about their <b>study</b> <b>journeys,</b> and asked them to identify what lecturers did or could do to make learning easier. Using a narrative analysis approach we identified five clear themes: resilience (these students were studying successfully); the positive impact of identification; the importance of self-awareness; implementation of compensatory strategies; and, the positive consequences of being open about dyslexia in terms of receiving institutional assista,ce and accessing support in the learning environment, for example, assistive technologies. Recommendations are also made about what lecturers can do to make learning easier for students with dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|Though {{concern about}} student {{attrition}} and failure {{is not a}} new phenomenon, higher education institutions (HEIs) have struggled to significantly reduce the revolving door syndrome. Open distance learning higher education is particularly susceptible to high student attrition. Despite a great deal of research into the student journey and factors impacting on likely success, we are not necessarily closer to understanding and being able to mitigate against student attrition. Learning analytics as emerging discipline and practice promises to help penetrate the fog… This case study describes work undertaken at the Open University in the UK to investigate how a learning analytics approach allows the University to provide timely and appropriate student support in a cost-effective manner. It includes a summary of the establishment of curriculum-based student support teams and a framework which defines more standardised student support informed by both student data and an enhanced knowledge of the curriculum. The primary aim of student support teams is to proactively support students through their <b>study</b> <b>journey</b> and to optimise their chances of reaching their declared study goals. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are making increasing use of learning analytics to support delivery of timely and relevant student support. The Open University in the UK, like other HEIs, knows a great deal about its students before they start to study and is able to track student behaviours once study has begun. Until recently, the university has not taken full advantage of the additional insight offered by such information. This paper describes the framework of support interventions established for all student support teams and describes the learning analytics approach used to support that framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} of sculpture was transformed during {{the eighteenth century}} as the creation and appreciation of art became increasingly associated with social interaction. Central to this transformation was the esteemed yet controversial body, the AcadÃ©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. In this richly illustrated book, Tomas Macsotay focuses on the sculptorâs life at the AcadÃ©mie, analysing the protocols that dictated the production of academic art. Arguing that these procedures were modelled on the artistâs <b>study</b> <b>journey</b> to Rome, Macsotay discusses the close links between working practices introduced at the AcadÃ©mie and new notions of academic community and personal sensibility. He explores the bodily form of the morceau de rÃ©ception on which the election of new members depended, and how this shaped the development of academic ideas and practices. Macsotay also reconsiders the early revolutionary years, where outside events exacerbated tensions between personal autonomy and institutional authority. The Profession of sculpture in the Paris AcadÃ©mie underscores the moral and aesthetic divide separating modern interpretations of sculpture based on notions of the individual artistic persona, and eighteenth-century notions of sociable production. The result is a book which takes sculpture outside the national arena, and re-focuses attention on its more subjective role, a narrative of intimate life in a modern world. Introduction 1.

40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions are making {{increasing use of}} online course delivery {{as part of their}} standard offering. E-learning can support the move toward global student bodies and the possibility of more responsive teaching and learning environments. The Open University Business School has offered online distance learning courses for over 10 years and supports thousands of students each year. As student numbers have grown, the capacity to provide truly personalised academic, pastoral and administrative student support is clearly affected. This case study describes a pilot approach to delivering more intelligent and proactive intervention to students registered on an online, open entry, level 3 undergraduate programme. We briefly outline the programme and existing comparative data on known differences between the retention and final achievements of students receiving support solely online compared to those receiving a more traditional blended means of course delivery and tuition support. The study goes on to describe the developing work of the pilot team in setting in place a number of key interventions thought most likely to support the student through their <b>study</b> <b>journey</b> and optimise their chances of completion. The Open University in the UK, like other HE institutions, knows a great deal about its students before they start to study, and, perhaps like others, has not always fully exploited this information. The pilot team is now using profiling data to identify key student characteristics which suggest that additional pre-course contact would be helpful. This may be a discussion of how we might best support the student whilst on course, or may include advice about transferring to another course more suited to their experience or circumstances given the open entry nature of the courses. Systems have been developed and refined which allow the team to track student behaviour once the course has begun, and since the courses within the pilot make heavy use of a Moodle-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), there is much that is transparent to us. Each course has a number of defined milestones which have been agreed to be key or at least facilitative to the students' eventual completion and success. Our systems help us to work closely with course tutors and students to trigger additional contacts from the support team. Other support activities are designed to complement this ongoing work and will be described more fully in the paper. It is crucial that all of the work has the potential for automation and scalability – currently the pilot team is working with over 800 students in around 30 countries. This paper aims to demonstrate that the piloted levels of intervention are both achievable in the long term and cost-effective. Results from the first 2 pilot presentations will be shared alongside results from a comparator cohort...|$|E
