It aims to quantitatively assess the effects of different production configurations on flow time and production capacity. In particular, the production phases of men’s jackets are examined. Eight configurations are evaluated, stemming from the combination of two parameters: batch size and number of machines. For each configuration, the flow time, the production capacity and the waiting time are computed. A subsequent Design of Experiment (DoE) analysis has been performed on these configurations, with the aim of identifying significant single and combined effects of the above parameters on the results observed.

40|$|In apparel manufacturing, cut order {{planning}} (COP) plays {{a significant}} role in managing the cost of materials as fabric usually occupies more than 50 % of the total manufacturing cost. Following the details of retail orders in terms of quantity, size and colour, COP seeks to minimize the total manufacturing costs by developing feasible cutting order plans with respect to material, machine and labour. In this paper, a genetic optimized decision-making model using adaptive evolutionary strategies is proposed to assist the production management of the apparel industry in the decision-making process of COP in which a new encoding method with a shortened binary string is devised. Four sets of real production data were collected to validate the proposed decision support method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce both the material costs and the production of additional garments while satisfying the time constraints set by the downstream <b>sewing</b> <b>department.</b> Although the total operation time used is longer than that using industrial practice, the great benefits obtained by less fabric cost and extra quantity of garments planned and produced largely outweigh the longer operation time required. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{explores the}} culture {{surrounding}} the dyeing of royal garments {{in the late}} Joseon Dynasty. The find-ings {{of this study are}} as follows. First, several dyes were used to color royal garments, such as jicho, honghwa, danmok, simhwang, sambo, goehwa, chija, and namjong. Mordants such as maesil, hwanghoemok, yeohoe, and baekban were also used with the dyes. Second, the Sangeuiwon (尙衣院) was the department in charge of the purchasing of dyes and the entire dyeing practice. It was the Seonhyecheong (宣惠廳) and the Hojo (戶曹) who provided revenue to the Sangeuiwon through a wongong, regular tribute, and a bokjeong (supplementary tribute). Additionally, additional dyes, if found to be insufficient, could be provided by the Hojo. Every year the Hojo provided jicho, honghwa, and danmok to the Sangeuiwon, and sometimes imported namjong from China. Third, royal garments were, in most cases, dyed by the Sangeuiwon’s pro-fessional dyers and court ladies belonging to the <b>sewing</b> <b>department</b> in each palace. Naenongpo (內農圃) eunuchs were in charge of the indigo crops of each palace. Finally, more dye was used in royal garments than in the clothes of com-moners to obtain a deeper shade of color. In addition, dyers tried to achieve a clear and vivid tone in their garments. Silk which absorbed color relatively easily, was dyed inside the palace using an ice vat filled with fresh indigo leaves; however...|$|E

H 577 P ITC 2016 Makxviii, 273 pages :color illustrationsIn {{the apparel}} industry, various {{production}} departments are involved to fabricate {{the completion of}} garments. Among the numerous departments, production planning and scheduling in the <b>sewing</b> <b>department</b> are the most complicated as they involve a large range of manual sewing operations. In the current manufacturing environment, the apparel production scheduling system in the <b>sewing</b> <b>department</b> which concerns the type of items for production, their quantities, when they would be produced, and on which production line {{in order to satisfy}} customer demand still heavily relies on the experience and subjective assessment of production management. Consistent and optimal solutions are difficult to obtain under a dynamic manufacturing environment. In the face of increasingly fierce competition and fast changing customer demands today, there is the need for the involvement of apparel manufacturers in the production planning and scheduling process by using scientific and effective methods. The purpose of this research is therefore to develop simulation- and algorithm-based methodologies for the production planning and scheduling process of apparel manufacture. The selection of an appropriate production system is a key element in the apparel scheduling process and considered critical to business success. To improve the selection of the production system, manufacturers must understand how the production system responds to dynamic manufacturing environments. However, it is costly and time-consuming to study the system behaviors through observation or experimentation. A computer simulation model, which takes into consideration the various factors in dynamic manufacturing environments and analyzes the impacts of these factors on production system performance to evaluate the performance of apparel production systems, has been therefore developed in this research. To enhance the representativeness of the simulation analysis, three inadequacies in the existing literature and simulation methods are identified and refined before the simulation model is applied to explore the mentioned objective. They concern the inadequacies in simulating the realistic learning curves of operators, and incompetence in the approach of the validation methods and the simulation experimental analysis. A set of rules for the selection of apparel production systems in different manufacturing environments is generated from the simulation experimental results. In typical practices in the industry, production scheduling plans are most often formulated with constant production capabilities, thus leading to frequent changes of operator assignments and machines on the assembly floor as they need to cope with the changes in actual production capabilities. Although frequent changes to the lot size scheduling plans are very common in the apparel manufacturing industry regardless of the associated high costs, it should not be used as an excuse to accept the current level of prediction accuracy. A novel hybrid computer simulation-genetic algorithm (CS-GA) that takes into consideration the stochastic characteristics of apparel production systems is thus proposed in response, so as to address the dynamic manufacturing environments during the scheduling process. The proposed CS-GA approach includes a single-objective as well as a multi-objective based optimization model. The former imitates a typical goal in the industry, which is to generate scheduling plans that minimize setup frequency with consideration of due-date constraints. In the latter, the goal is to generate scheduling solutions which consider the impacts of the scheduling decisions on the performance of apparel production systems in addition to minimizing setup frequency and satisfying the due-date requirements of customers. The aim is to improve the performance of apparel production systems in terms of resource utilization and work-in-process inventory through scheduling decisions. The proposed approach will therefore eliminate the weaknesses of the manual scheduling procedures and generate optimal scheduling solutions in apparel manufacture. Based on production data from a real apparel manufacturing enterprise, experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodologies. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to model apparel production systems and production scheduling in the apparel manufacturing industry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Industrial {{training}} in the Fashion Apparel Industry is confronted with difficult objectives. In this industry, continual style and fabric change challenge the effectiveness of conventional industrial training techniques and concepts. To meet this challenge, the "Self-Help" training concept was developed. "Self-Help" centers around the philosophy of training sewing machine operators to be self-sufficient when confronted with a dynamic work environment. "Self-Help" accomplishes this goal by exposing the trainees {{to the principles of}} motion economy, feel and work measurement. This training is augmented with practical exercises on various sewing machines normally found in a production <b>sewing</b> <b>department.</b> The training cycle concludes by giving each trainee the opportunity to produce garments requiring the use of lockstitch, hem and overseam sewing machines. When compared to conventional training methods, the anticipated results of "Self-Help" oriented training programs are: increased learning rates, higher overall productivity levels and reduced labor turnover. During the Fall of 1964, a "Self-Help" training program was initiated at Jantzen, Inc., Portland, Oregon. A Control Group, consisting of 73 women, was hired and given on-the-job training. A Test Group, consisting of 33 women, was hired simultaneously and vestibule trained, using the concept of "Self-Help. " Performance of the two groups was recorded over a twelve week period and then evaluated with respect to production rates and labor turnover. The results of this evaluation indicated that the learning curve for the Test Group progressed more rapidly than the corresponding curve of the Control Group. A statistical comparison of production rates for the twelfth week of employment indicated that the productivity level of the Test Group was significantly greater than the productivity level of the Control Group. During the entire twelve week evaluation period the labor turnover rate for the Test Group was substantially lower than the corresponding rate of the Control Group. By the end of the twelfth week of employment, the Test Group turnover rate was approximately one-third less than the turnover rate for the Control Group. Based on the results of the evaluation, the author concluded that the "Self-Help" approach to operator training definitely increased worker efficiency while reducing labor turnover. It is suggested, however, that additional research be conducted to further develop and refine the presentation of the unique subjects associated with the "Self-Help" training concept. It would also be advisable to consider the possibility of presenting follow-up short courses to reinforce learning on material covered during the initial "Self-Help" training cycle...|$|E
