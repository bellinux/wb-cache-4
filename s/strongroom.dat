As the group {{contains}} [...] "a lot {{of different types of}} musicianship", the band [...] "have to be spontaneous whenever [...] can." [...] Doyle, the guitarist, stated that Hot Chip change the original recordings when playing their music live. At the London-based studio called the <b>Strongroom,</b> [...] "One Pure Thought", [...] "Hold On" [...] and [...] "Shake a Fist" [...] were recorded live, instead of on multitrack, and were subsequently pieced together. This was the first occasion that Hot Chip had recorded music in a studio environment.|$|E

500|$|For his [...] "incredible take on what {{popular music}} means in today's world", Wainwright {{recruited}} Neil Tennant to advise him, act as {{executive producer of}} the album, and assist with the editing process. Parts of the album were recorded at Second Story and Legacy in New York City, Brooklyn Recording in Brooklyn, Saal 4 in Berlin, and <b>Strongroom</b> and Angel Studios in London. Wainwright had his sister Martha Wainwright, half-sister Lucy Wainwright Roche, and mother Kate McGarrigle appear on the album, along with father and son musicians Richard Thompson and Teddy Thompson.

Rowe recalls feelings similar to Stannard's: [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive; Stannard and Rowe discussed the songwriting process with the group and talked about what the group wanted to do on the record.

500|$|Away {{from the}} front line, Hines {{developed}} a record of indiscipline. He was court martialled on nine occasions for drunkenness, impeding military police, forging entries in his pay book and being absent without leave. He also {{claimed to have been}} caught robbing the <b>strongroom</b> of a bank in Amiens, though this is not recorded in his Army service record. As a result of these convictions, Hines lost several promotions he had earned for his acts of bravery. He was also fined on several occasions, and the resulting need for money may {{have been one of the}} factors that motivated his looting. A member of the 3rd Battalion described Hines as [...] "not normally a weak man but rather one ... uncontrolled". An officer from the 45th Battalion stated after the war that Hines had been [...] "two pains in the neck".|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion {{consider}} the heavily decorated late 17th-century ceilings {{of the house}} to be [...] "the finest single architectural legacy among the country houses of the region". As in Plas Taliaris and several other country houses in the county, the ceilings are panelled, with [...] "thick moulded beams and wreaths in the panels and winged cherubs' heads in the corners". The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A <b>strongroom</b> with [...] walls and heavy steel fire-proof doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables. On the upper floors are rooms with 18th-century fittings, including [...] "panelled dados, lugged architraves, low relief plaster ceilings and closets within angled turrets". The bedroom on the northeast of the house features a particularly detailed coffered ceiling with floral patterns.|$|E
500|$|In 1885–87 the {{partnership}} designed Abbeystead House for the 4th Earl of Sefton in North Lancashire. Hubbard describes this as [...] "the finest of Douglas's Elizabethan houses, {{and one of}} the largest which he ever designed". During this time additions were made to Jodrell Hall in Cheshire and Halkyn Castle in Flintshire. In 1885 the Castle Hotel at Conwy, Caernarfonshire, was remodelled, and in 1887–88 a <b>strongroom</b> was added to Hawarden Castle, followed by a porch in 1890. During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate, and these included houses and cottages, such as Eccleston Hill, and Eccleston Ferry House, and farms such as Saighton Lane Farm. In 1890–91 an obelisk was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall. The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was Brocksford Hall (1893) in Derbyshire. This was a country house in Elizabethan style using diapered brick and stone dressings with a clock tower. In Chester city centre, 38Bridge Street (1897) is a timber-framed shop that incorporates a section of Chester Rows and contains heavily decorated carving. From 1892 {{the partnership}} designed houses and cottages in Port Sunlight for Lever Brothers. Also in the village they designed the Dell Bridge (1894), and the school (1894–96), which is now called the Lyceum. In1896 Douglas designed a house for himself, Walmoor Hill in Dee Banks, Chester, in Elizabethan style. Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings {{on the east side of}} StWerburgh Street in the centre of Chester. At its south end, on the corner of Eastgate Street, is a bank whose ground storey is built in stone, and behind this leading up StWerburgh Street, the ground storey consists of shop fronts. Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic, which are covered in highly ornamented timber-framing. On the first floor is a series of oriel windows, the second floor is jettied, and at the top are eleven gables. Pevsner considers that this range of buildings is [...] "Douglas at his best (though also at his showiest)". Hubbard expresses the opinion that [...] "in this work, the city's half-timber revival reached its very apogee".|$|E

25|$|Historically, <b>strongrooms</b> {{were built}} in the {{basement}} of a bank where the ceilings were vaulted, hence the name.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the tracks on Halcyon were recorded with producer Jim Eliot of Kish Mauve (also known for his work with Kylie Minogue and Ladyhawke) in a converted barn near Lyonshall, Herefordshire, the village where Goulding grew up. Recording sessions for the album also took place at Studio Splendido in Wales; AIR Studios, The Ballroom, EMI Studios, Fly Eye Studio, Starsmith HQ and <b>Strongroom</b> Studios in London; Red Rhino Studios and Troublemakers Studio in Montreal; and Biffco Studios in Brighton. In an interview with Carson Daly on his 97.1 AMP Radio show on 6 August 2012, Goulding explained the inspiration behind the album's title, saying, [...] " [...] like a bird that basically during the winter, it would lay its eggs by the sea and bring calm to the stormy waters {{and a lot of}} my songs on this record are about the ocean and water." [...] She also unveiled two songs from the album—"Only You" [...] and the title track [...] "Halcyon".|$|E
2500|$|New {{material}} was written and debuted at several one-off live performances and acoustic showcases throughout 2008. Recording {{of the new}} album started in September 2008 at <b>Strongroom</b> 33 Studios in East London. In February 2009 all songs were written and [...] "Wade In" [...] was made available as a free download on the band's MySpace page. A demo of the new album's intro was posted to their MySpace for a free listen as well. In April 2009, it was stated that 13 songs were written and recorded for their then still untitled second studio album. In the following months, they were mixed with a release eventually expected in early 2010. Although the full album was leaked online as early as October 2009. While taking a short break from mixing the upcoming album, Stateless embarked on a small acoustic tour in the Netherlands in June 2009, playing 4 locations, which they repeated in late October 2009 with another 4 Dutch acoustic showcases.|$|E
50|$|Some {{changes have}} been made to the {{original}} building. The rear upper storey verandah has been altered, a fireplace on the rear, right-hand- side wall of the ground floor has been boarded up and wall partitions have been added to create office space {{at the rear of the}} original building on the ground floor. The interior staircase to the basement, which was accessed from behind the staircase to the upper floor, has been closed off from access from the ground floor. The original <b>strongrooms</b> on the ground floor and in the basement are extant. In 2009 the upper floor offices were unchanged as was the staircase leading to the first floor from the foyer. The original counter in the foyer is in place but the clerk's grill with writing slope has been removed, although it remains stored in the building. An extension has been added to the rear of the original building for offices on the ground floor, with a new opening through the rear wall of the 1896 building, and staff facilities in the basement area are accessed by a new staircase. The basement retains its <b>strongrooms,</b> fireplace, staircase and windows, including their security bars.|$|R
50|$|However, in October 1966 {{minutes of}} the County Records Sub-Committee noted {{the need for more}} {{accommodation}} - the <b>strongrooms</b> were likely to fill up in a year. The archives could not accommodate all the visitors comfortably. There was no private accommodation for staff and refreshments had to be taken in the repairer's room. The repair room was too small, meaning big maps could not be repaired. Bookshelves were overflowing. All this led to the need to build a new record office.|$|R
50|$|Sheffield’s Central Library {{was officially}} opened in 1934. In {{planning}} it Mr J. P. Lamb, {{who was then}} City Librarian, gave considerable thought to the accommodation and expansion of the local history and 'special' collections (as they were then called). A large reading room was provided to accommodate readers and house the local collection of printed material; there were storage facilities for maps and special collections in an adjoining room and two small <b>strongrooms</b> in the basement, providing about 700 feet of shelving for manuscripts.|$|R
2500|$|The {{group were}} {{supposed}} to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield {{the day after the}} departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: [...] "None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process." [...] Two tracks of the album were composed in that session: [...] "Love Thing" [...] and [...] "Say You'll Be There". In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the <b>Strongroom</b> in Curtain Road, east London.|$|E

6000|$|My poor Lady Maria was not {{the only}} one of our family who was to be sent out of the way to American wildernesses. Having borrowed, stolen, cheated at home, until he could cheat, borrow, and steal no more, the Honourable William Esmond, Esquire, was {{accommodated}} with a place at New York; and his noble brother and royal master heartily desired that they might see him no more. When the troubles began, we heard of the fellow and his doings in his new habitation. Lies and mischief were his avant-couriers wherever he travelled. My Lord Dunmore informed me that Mr. Will declared publicly, that our estate of Castlewood was only ours during his brother's pleasure; that his father, out of consideration for Madam Esmond, his lordship's half-sister, had given her the place for life, and that he, William, was in negotiation with his brother, the present Lord Castlewood, for the purchase of the reversion of the estate! We had the deed of gift in our <b>strongroom</b> at Castlewood, and it was furthermore registered in due form at Williamsburg; so that we were easy on that score. But the intention was everything; and Hal and I promised, as soon as ever we met Mr. William, to get from him a confirmation of this pretty story. What Madam Esmond's feelings and expressions were when she heard it, I need scarcely here particularise. [...] "What! my father, the Marquis of Esmond, was a liar, and I am a cheat, am I?" [...] cries my mother. [...] "He will take my son's property at my death, will he?" [...] And she was for writing, not only to Lord Castlewood in England, but to his Majesty himself at St. James's, and was only prevented by my assurance that Mr. Will's lies were notorious amongst all his acquaintance, and that we could not expect, in our own case, that he should be so inconsistent as to tell the truth. We heard of him presently as one of the loudest amongst the Loyalists in New York, as Captain, and presently Major of a corps of volunteers who were sending their addresses to the well-disposed in all the other colonies, and announcing their perfect readiness to die for the mother country.|$|E
