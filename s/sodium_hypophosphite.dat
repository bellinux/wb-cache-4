40|$|Twenty-eight {{crystalline}} salts were X-irradiated {{and treated}} with an ammoniacal nickel hypophosphite solution. Treatment (development) of {{six of the}} salts resulted in precipitation of nickel metal. The developable salts were four <b>hypophosphites,</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphite, and nickel formate. A mechanism is proposed for the process based on the postulate that micro amounts of hydrogen atoms are formed during the radiation step. During development, these hydrogen atoms cause the formation of nucleation sites of nickel metal. In turn, these sites catalyze further reduction of the nickel cations by the hypophosphite.

5000|$|Chemical Reduction. Chemical reductants {{can reduce}} silver ions into silver nanoclusters. Some {{examples}} of chemical reductants are sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> (NaPO2H2.H2O).

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> {{is capable}} of {{reducing}} nickel ions in solution to metallic nickel on metal substrates {{as well as on}} plastic substrates. The latter requires that the substrate is activated with fine particles of palladium. The resulting nickel deposit contains up to 15% phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> (NaPO2H2, {{also known}} as sodium phosphinate) is the sodium salt of hypophosphorous acid and is often {{encountered}} as the monohydrate, NaPO2H2·H2O. It is a solid at room temperature, appearing as odorless white crystals. It is soluble in water, and easily absorbs moisture from the air.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{does not}} react with {{hydrogen}} even on heating, thus copper hydrides are made indirectly from copper(I) and copper(II) precursors. Examples include {{the reduction of}} copper(II) sulfate with <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> {{in the presence of}} sulfuric acid, or more simply with just hypophosphorous acid. Other reducing agents, including classical aluminium hydrides can be used.|$|E
50|$|Electroless {{nickel plating}} (EN) is an auto-catalytic {{chemical}} technique used to deposit {{a layer of}} nickel-phosphorus or nickel-boron alloy on a solid workpiece, such as metal or plastic. The process relies {{on the presence of}} a reducing agent, for example hydrated <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> (NaPO2H2·H2O) which reacts with the metal ions to deposit metal. The alloys with different percentage of phosphorus, ranging from 2-5 (low phosphorus) to up to 11-14 (high phosphorus) are possible. The metallurgical properties of alloys depend on the percentage of phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|Electroless nickel (EN) {{deposits}} {{are typically}} classified as functional coatings and historically have found use in applications that require protection from either corrosion or wear {{and in some}} cases, both. Because of the unique deposit properties and uniformity of the resultant film, many other applications have emerged that continue {{to capitalize on the}} chameleon-like nature of electroless nickel. The majority of EN films used commercially are deposited from solutions formulated with <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> as the reducing agent. This results in nickel films that are alloyed with phosphorus in ranges between 1 and 12 weight percent.|$|E
50|$|Electroless plating, {{also known}} as {{chemical}} or auto-catalytic plating, is a non-galvanic plating method that involves several simultaneous reactions in an aqueous solution, which occur {{without the use of}} external electrical power. The reaction is accomplished when hydrogen is released by a reducing agent, normally <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> (Note: the hydrogen leaves as a hydride ion) or thiourea, and oxidized, thus producing a negative charge {{on the surface of the}} part. The most common electroless plating method is electroless nickel plating, although silver, gold and copper layers can also be applied in this manner, as in the technique of Angel gilding.|$|E
50|$|Most {{pesticides}} contain ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate {{is used as}} {{an agricultural}} spray adjuvant for water-soluble insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. There, it functions to bind iron and calcium cations that are present in both well water and plant cells. It is particularly effective as an adjuvant for 2, 4-D (amine), glyphosate, and glufosinate herbicides. The brilliant dark blue-violet color and a good solubility make tetraammine copper (II) sulfate an excellent chemical to dye fabrics. Some of the recent research and development for copper include various studies of tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate. One such research is “Chemical reduction method for preparing copper nano-powder with high purity using <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> as reductant”, which uses tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate.|$|E

Synthetic nickel sulfate solution and <b>sodium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> solutions at concentration of 0. 5 g/L were used as nickel feed solution and reducing agent, respectively. Additives were investigated at high and low concentrations of 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L. The effect of additives on reduction behavior of nickel was investigated by studying the evolution of the volume distribution, moments, specific surface area, and rate of reduction and purity of the powder product. EMA was found to be a growth promoter and PA was found to be a growth inhibitor. The highest reduction rate was observed in the presence of EMA and the lowest in the presence of PA. The SEM micrographs of the powder obtained in the presence of EMA and PA showed that the powder was spherical shaped, open, dentritic and more porous compared with that of the seed particles.
