5|$|Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action-adventure game, heavily {{focused on}} {{exploration}} and puzzle-solving, with non-linear gameplay. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although {{similar to a}} human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for personal computers, {{was designed to be}} primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her health meter, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} {{decided to}} return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis Sonic games, which producer Yuji Naka felt was refreshing. Despite this, they also included concepts that were incorporated in the Dreamcast games, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to grind on rails and and the modernized character designs by Yuji Uekawa. As the Sonic games released for the Dreamcast allowed players to download the Chao Garden minigame onto the VMU, the development team decided to expand upon this idea by implementing a similar minigame that was compatible with the GameCube's GBA link cable, thus making Sonic Advance one of the first games {{to make use of the}} cable. It also makes use of graphical techniques such as rotation effects and Mode 7. The game's musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda.|$|E

This version of the game, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100.

5|$|Raziel retains most of {{the powers}} he possessed in <b>the</b> {{previous}} game, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> to glide, climb walls, fire bolts of telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating enemies. The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human enemies exist only in the material world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are enemies who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings <b>such</b> <b>as</b> demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. Enemies leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed.|$|R

5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to upgrade}} powers {{and to make}} moral choices {{with a focus on}} non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E
5|$|Immortal Throne {{features}} multiple additions and alterations over Titan Quest. The main addition {{is a new}} Mastery titled Dream Mastery: {{available to}} new players {{from the start of}} the main campaign, it is a magic-focused skill that relies on illusion and stasis effects to disrupt enemy groups. Among the abilities available are putting nearby enemies to sleep until they are hit by a weapon strike, turning enemies on each other, and effects which make enemies take damage when they strike the player or faster health and energy recovery. In addition to extra quests, new items and equipment are included. An additional item slot for the player character is reserved for Artifacts, charms crafted for the player by Enchanters after the player discovers enough Arcane Formulae after defeating enemies. Artifacts are divided into three levels (Lesser, Greater and Divine), which grant a variety of status effects depending on their level. A separate type of item are Scrolls, expendable items that produce powerful effects and can be equipped in a similar fashion to healing potions. Additional sellers and storage Caravans are included in between towns. Multiplayer functions return from the original game, while adding refinements <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to automatically join parties and engage in player-versus-player matches.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Fusion is an action-adventure {{platform}} shooter {{in which}} the player controls Samus Aran. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Fusion {{is set in a}} large open-ended world with elevators that connect regions, which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors. Samus opens most doors by shooting at them, while some only open after she reaches a certain point. Metroid Fusion unfolds in a more linear manner than previous Metroid games due to its focus on storyline; for example, Navigation Rooms are introduced in Metroid Fusion, which tell the player where to go. The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies while searching for power-ups that allow Samus to reach new areas. Injected with a Metroid vaccine in Metroid Fusion, Samus can absorb X Parasites that restore health, missiles, and bombs. Power-ups can be obtained either by downloading them in Data Rooms, or absorbing a Core-X, which appears after defeating each boss. Metroid Fusion includes gameplay mechanics new to the series <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to grab ledges and climb ladders.|$|E
