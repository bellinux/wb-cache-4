50|$|The cupola tender {{observes the}} furnace through the sight glass or peep {{sight in the}} tuyeres. Slag will {{rise to the top}} of the pool of iron being formed. A <b>slag</b> <b>hole,</b> located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let the slag flow out. The viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes the slag which runs out the <b>slag</b> <b>hole</b> is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined. With acid refractory lined cupolas a greenish colored slag means the fluxing is proper and adequate. In basic refractory lined cupolas the slag is brown.|$|E
40|$|Key words ： {{electric}} arc furnace；refractories；erosion；measures Abstract. The erosion {{situation of the}} refractories of the deep reduction {{electric arc}} furnace have been introduced firstly, including the regions such as furnace wall, tapping hole and <b>slag</b> <b>hole,</b> and analyzing on {{the causes of the}} erosion shows that high temperature, chemical erosion of oxides in slag, as well as physical scour are the main causes of the serious erosion to the lining. Based on the practical production conditions three solutions are provided including preventing oxidation of metallized pellets, control the temperature and carrying out hot-spray-mending on the furnace...|$|E
40|$|This study summarises the {{research}} efforts undertaken in iron foundry plants {{in which the}} process are mostly automated and mechanised. The research program was limited in scope, focusing on causes of surface defects in castings products that are attributable to the bentonite-containing sand and the mould system. One of the potential roots of surface defects is heterogeneity of sand grains, containing lumped ball-shaped grains and irregular pellets with a layered-structure. The moisture contents of those lumped grains is different than the moisture level required in the process, besides these grains may contain various elements and metallic compounds which, when cast into moulds, may react with molten metals in an uncontrolled manner. As a result, surface defects are produced, such as surface blowholes, burst penetration, sand <b>holes,</b> <b>slag</b> inclusions, pinhole porosity. This study investigated the efficiency of key sand preparation and moulding machines and installations integrated into the casting process line. The efficiency of machines and installations is {{defined in terms of}} quality parameters of sand mix and moulds, which are associated with the emergence of surface defects on castings...|$|R
40|$|The hole defects {{can easily}} occur in {{magnesium}} alloy castings that are prepared by low pressure lost foam casting (LP-LFC) process when the process parameters such as vacuum, pouring temperature and filling velocity are not properly selected. In this study, the forming {{mechanism of the}} hole defects in AZ 91 D magnesium castings by LP-LFC process was investigated. The shape, location and surface appearance of the hole defects were observed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the chemical composition {{on the surface of}} the holes was analyzed using energy spectrometer. The result indicates that there are two types of hole defects, i. e., the pyrolysis products related hole defects, including concentrative hole and blow <b>hole</b> defects, and <b>slag</b> related <b>hole</b> defects. The concentrative hole and the blow-hole defects were formed either by the liquid-EPS degradation products entrapped in the molten metal under the condition that the pouring temperature is equal to or lower than 730 ℃, or by the hindered transport of EPS pyrolysis products. Some irregular shape hole defects were caused by slag or by coating slough entrapment when the pouring temperature is equal to 750 ℃ and the filling velocity is equal to or greater than 100 mm·s- 1. To reduce or eliminate the hole defects, the vacuum and filling velocity must be properly chosen to ensure that the metal front profile exhibits convex shape and in laminar current state, and the pouring temperature should be just high enough to ensure that the molten melt has adequate heat energy to complete the foam pyrolysis and to fully occupy the mould. For AZ 91 D magnesium castings in this study, the parameters should be 730 ℃ pouring temperature, 0. 02 - 0. 03 MPa vacuum and 80 mm·s- 1 filling velocity...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{components}} contain several defects. These defects {{are introduced}} during {{the extraction of}} the alloys and at various stages of manufacturing. Existence of defects such as, blow <b>holes,</b> <b>slag</b> inclusions, quench cracks, weld defects, notches, mechanical holes etc. are common in engineering materials and components. Their presence may reduce the load carrying capacity of the component and may cause immature failure in the both under monotonic and dynamic loading. These defects also interact with a propagating fatigue crack and may cause crack deflection, crack growth acceleration and even retardation. This investigation aims to study fatigue crack-hole interaction and prediction of crack path. The study has been made using 25 × 25 mm 2 cross section aluminium beam of span length 300 mm with circular hole of 3 mm diameter located at different positions. All fatigue tests were conducted using a 100 kN BiSS servo-hydraulic UTM. The tests were conducted under constant load amplitude condition maintaining a stress ratio, R= 0. 3. The monitoring of crack path was done by tip tracking method (TTM) using 10 x magnification travelling microscope. The beams were subjected to constant amplitude load cycle under four-point bending loading condition. Presence of the hole deflected cracks from their normal paths. In some cases the cracks merged into the hole and resulted crack arrest. In the present work an attempt {{has been made to}} develop a model to predict the fatigue crack path...|$|R
