5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed â€“ two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been {{a stop on the}} Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be undertaken to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E
5|$|The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has {{proposed}} to MDOT that I-475 should {{be connected to}} US23 {{in the southern part}} of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The <b>study</b> <b>will</b> also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2016, it's been {{revealed}} that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding {{is coming from the}} Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The <b>study</b> <b>will</b> take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The <b>study</b> <b>will</b> look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this <b>study</b> <b>will</b> also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This <b>study</b> <b>will</b> not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second <b>study</b> <b>will</b> put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E

25|$|Some {{patients}} {{may need to}} do an overnight sleep study to determine if insomnia is present. Such a <b>study</b> <b>will</b> commonly involve assessment tools including a polysomnogram and the multiple sleep latency test. Specialists in sleep medicine are qualified to diagnose disorders within the, according to the ICSD, 81 major sleep disorder diagnostic categories. Patients with some disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, are often mis-diagnosed with primary insomnia; when a person has trouble getting to sleep and awakening at desired times, but has a normal sleep pattern once asleep, a circadian rhythm disorder is a likely cause.|$|E
25|$|Later that spring, the ALTUS II flew another {{series of}} ARM-UAV missions. Hard-to-measure {{properties}} of high-level cirrus clouds {{that may affect}} global warming were recorded using specially designed instruments while the ALTUS flew at 50,000 feet altitude off the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Clouds both reflect incoming solar energy back to space, and absorb warm longwave radiation from the Earth's surface, keeping that heat in the atmosphere. Data from the <b>study</b> <b>will</b> help scientists better understand how these dual roles of clouds in reflecting and absorbing solar energy work, and build more accurate global climate models.|$|E

25|$|Esperanto is {{estimated}} to have approximately 100,000 to 2 million fluent speakers. In the same manner estimates {{for the number of}} Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of <b>study</b> <b>will</b> enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, {{and there are a number}} of people that have learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Sediment or rock {{samples are}} {{collected}} from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted {{by a variety}} of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical microfossil <b>study</b> <b>will</b> involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 the Eastern North Carolina NPO/RPO {{coalition}} {{proposed a}} southern extension of Interstate 795 {{from its current}} terminus, south along US 117 and NC 403 to Interstate 40 near Faison. In January 2004, a feasibility studied the idea of extending the US 117 Freeway (I-795) south from its current NC 581 terminus to US 13. The Strategic Highway Plan, list the Wilson-Wilmington Corridor as Corridor 50 and indicates {{the need to improve}} US 117 south of Goldsboro to a four lane divided access freeway. A <b>study</b> <b>will</b> include US 117 from US 13 to the boundary of the Goldsboro MPO. Currently US 117 between I-40 and Goldsboro is not at freeway grade, and many at-grade crossings would have to become interchanges or be eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{released}} a report in 2004 supporting the use of clinical studies under strict regulations; the regulations mandated that the study's benefit to society outweigh the risk to the individual, that the study be conducted under a strict ethical code, that there be reasonable certainty that no harm will come to participants {{and that it has}} been shown that no other <b>study</b> <b>will</b> work. In 2005, adhering to a congressional directive, the EPA adopted the Human Studies Regulation; the regulations permit human studies, do not allow the use of pregnant women or children in human studies, mandate that a strict ethical code be followed and establish a Human Studies Review Board to oversee the use of human studies. The EPA considers the regulations as a major accomplishment in public policy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic Otitis media (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of <b>study</b> <b>will</b> suffer from sampling bias because children with otitis media {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for otitis media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of otitis media on language outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Now Hipparchus {{made such}} an {{examination}} principally from the sun. Since from other {{properties of the}} sun and moon (of which a <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be made below) it follows that if the distance of one of the two luminaries is given, the distance of the other is also given, he tries by conjecturing the distance of the sun to demonstrate the distance of the moon. First, he assumes the sun to show the least perceptible parallax to find its distance. After this, he makes use of the solar eclipse adduced by him, first as if the sun shows no perceptible parallax, and for exactly that reason the ratios of the moon's distances appeared different to him for each of the hypotheses he set out. But with respect to the sun, not only the amount of its parallax, but also whether it shows any parallax at all is altogether doubtful.|$|E
