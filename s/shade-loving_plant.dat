50|$|An {{attempt at}} {{commercial}} cultivation {{was made in}} New Zealand in the 1980s, though an overall lack of selective breeding, the unpredictability of fruit flavor (usually very sweet, but sometimes sour or bitter), the somewhat delicate nature of this <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plant,</b> and an attractiveness to pests like aphids, white flies and spider mites all caused those domestication efforts to fail. On rare occasions, it is encountered as a dooryard fruit tree.|$|E

40|$|This paper discuses the {{economic}} and ecological benefits of integrating abaca in established monoculture fruit trees and mixed forest culture, especially rainforestation farming. Integration of agricultural crops with high tolerance to shade, that will provide additional income to farmers and preserve the environment, {{is one of the}} key elements of a sustainable tree farming system. Inclusion of natural fibre plants such as abaca, a natural <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plant,</b> to the smallholder tree farming system will not only provide income opportunities to the farmers but also prevent soil erosion and conserve forest water. However, precautionary measures must be undertaken not to overshade the abaca since overshading causes the production of weak fibre. Integrating abaca in established monoculture fruit trees and mixed forest culture especially rainforestation farming is found to have a number of economic and ecological benefits...|$|E
40|$|Coffea arabica is {{originated}} in the montane rainforests of southwest Ethiopia and thus it is a <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plant,</b> but thrives best in moderate shading. The original forest habitat is being disturbed largely due to deforestation practice in parallel with an increasing population pressure. Therefore there is an urgent need to identify prominent coffee shade trees and {{this study was conducted}} with the primary objective to evaluate the yield response of known Coffea arabica cultivars sub-planted under different shade trees at the Jimma Research Center, southwest Ethiopia. Shade tree arboreta consisting of eight coffee shade trees were established to sub-plant with coffee berry disease resistant Coffea arabica cultivars in split-plot design with three replications. The shade trees and coffee cultivars were assigned as main and sub-plot factor, respectively. All the routine cultural practices were uniformly applied to the experimental field throughout the study period. All agronomic variables were considered at the different growth stages of coffee trees, though yield response is focused in this paper. The findings depict that the highest and most stable coffee yield performances were obtained under Albizia schimperiana, Acaci...|$|E

[...] The reasons for their popularity vary but it may be a result of the Romantic Movement which emphasised the beauty of nature.

Ferns were very fashionable and hundreds of new species were introduced to Britain from around the world. The stumpery made an ideal habitat for these <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plants.</b> [...] Additionally stumperies may have been used in place of rockeries in areas where suitable rocks were in short supply.

50|$|The {{shrub layer}} is the stratum of {{vegetation}} within a habitat with heights of {{between one and}} a half to about five metres. Young trees are also part of this layer. It may be divided into the first and second shrub layers (low and high bushes). The shrub layer needs sun and only a little moisture, unlike the moss layer, which requires a lot of water. This stratum only receives light filtered by the canopy. i.e. it is preferred by semi-shade or <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plants</b> that would not tolerate bright sunlight. In the shrub layer, which consists of young trees and bushes, birds like the blackbird, song thrush, robin or blackcap are at home. They build their nests protected in the bushes and are therefore referred to as bush nesters. In addition to shrubs, such as elder, hazel, hawthorn, raspberry and blackberry, clematis may also occur. At the edge of a wood, the shrub layer acts as a windbreak close to the trees and protects the soil from drying out.|$|R

40|$|Background: Both Panax ginseng Meyer and Panax quinquefolius are obligate <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plants</b> whose natural {{habitats}} are broadleaved forests of Eastern Asia and North America. Panax species are easily damaged by photoinhibition {{when they are}} exposed to high temperatures or insufficient shade. In this study, a cytohistological study of the leaf structures of two of the most well-known Panax species was performed to better understand the physiological processes that limit photosynthesis. Methods: Leaves of ginseng plants grown in soil and hydroponic culture were sectioned for analysis. Leaf structures of both Panax species were observed using a light microscope, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. Results: The mesostructure of both P.  ginseng and P.  quinquefolius frequently had one layer of noncylindrical palisade cells and three or four layers of spongy parenchymal cells. P.  quinquefolius contained a similar number of stomata in the abaxial leaf surface but more tightly appressed enlarged grana stacks than P.  ginseng contained. The adaxial surface of the epidermis in P.  quinquefolius showed cuticle ridges with a pattern similar to that of P.  ginseng. Conclusion: The anatomical leaf structure of both P.  ginseng and P.  quinquefolius shows that they are typical shade-loving sciophytes. Slight differences in chloroplast structure suggests that the two different species can be authenticated using transmission electron microscopy images, and light-resistant cultivar breeding can be performed via controlling photosynthesis efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Originally an {{existence}} of a lithoprotection had been proposed based on observations of increased plant and animal diversity in habitats with rock cover compared to habitats without rock cover in the same conditions of an arid climate and steep slopes [...] (Safarian, 1960; Tadevosyan, 2001). To explain this phenomenon, the author compared the life forms of plants, and the body sizes and escape strategies of animals inhabiting habitats with and without rock cover (Tadevosyan, 2001 - 2002). His conclusion was that many groups of vascular plants, including trees, shrubs, succulents, ferns, and moss species, linked to rocky substrates because they require higher than an area's average soil humidity, sometimes being shaded by a solid piece of rock, as well as strong attachment to the substrate. On the other hand, many relatively large animals (including larger lizards, snakes, some mammals and many bird species) need habitats with a dense network of shelters created by crevices and spaces between rocks in order survive overheating and predation. Thus, due to its ability to prevent the evaporation of humidity from the soil, to catch the seeds of plants, to hold trees and shrubs securely {{to the ground and}} to serve as a network of efficient shelters for many animals and <b>shade-loving</b> <b>plants,</b> rock cover lithoprotection is being considered as a protective element of a habitat biodiversity.|$|R
