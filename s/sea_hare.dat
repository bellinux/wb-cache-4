25|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>hare</b> A californica {{is a model}} {{organism}} in neurobiology {{to study}} among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two-hybrid system has been developed in A californica neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have speculated}} {{on the exact}} nature of his death, and to which mistake Titus alluded in his final words. Philostratus writes that he was {{poisoned}} by Domitian with a <b>sea</b> <b>hare</b> (Aplysia depilans), and that his death had been foretold to him by Apollonius of Tyana. Suetonius and Cassius Dio maintain he died of natural causes, but both accuse Domitian of having left the ailing Titus for dead. Consequently, Dio believes Titus's mistake refers to his failure to have his brother executed when he was found to be openly plotting against him.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the <b>sea</b> <b>hare,</b> as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>hares</b> are herbivorous, and are {{typically}} found on seaweed in shallow water. Some young <b>sea</b> <b>hares</b> seemingly {{are capable of}} burrowing in soft sediment, leaving only their rhinophores and mantle opening showing. <b>Sea</b> <b>hares</b> have an extremely good sense of smell. They can follow even the faintest scent using their rhinophores, which are extremely sensitive chemoreceptors.|$|R
2500|$|The California <b>sea</b> <b>hare,</b> a gastropod, {{has more}} {{successful}} inhibition of egg-laying hormones outside of mating [...] season {{due to increased}} effectiveness of inhibitors in the brain.

50|$|The {{maximum length}} {{recorded}} for the California <b>sea</b> <b>hare</b> is 75 cm when crawling and thus fully extended, although most adult specimens are half this size or smaller.

40|$|Because {{there are}} no known predators to feed on them in their adult state, the <b>sea</b> <b>hares</b> {{do not seem to}} enter into the prey-predator {{relationships}} of the sea. They do, however, appear to have a place in the food economy in certain limited ways. Great numbers of larvae are produced by the <b>sea</b> <b>hares</b> (MacGinitie, 1934), which presumably are consumed in large numbers by predaceous plankton and filter-feeders. Large quantities of sea weed are masticated, partially digested, and passed in the fecal pellets, thus somewhat abbreviating the process by which sea weed becomes detritus. Finally, when the adults die their bodies {{become a part of the}} marine economy by providing nutrition for bacterial flora, or perhaps for scavengers such as Pachygrapsus, which on occasion have been observed feeding on the bodies of dead <b>sea</b> <b>hares...</b>|$|R
