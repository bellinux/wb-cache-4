25|$|Early in Wikipedia's development, {{it began}} to expand internationally, with the {{creation}} of new namespaces, each with a distinct set of usernames. The first subdomain created for a non-English Wikipedia was deutsche.wikipedia.com (created on Friday 16 March 2001, 01:38 UTC), followed after a few hours by Catalan.wikipedia.com (at 13:07 UTC). The Japanese Wikipedia, started as nihongo.wikipedia.com, was created around that period, and initially used only Romanized Japanese. For about two months Catalan was the one with the most articles in a non-English language, although statistics of that early period are imprecise. The French Wikipedia was created on or around 11 May 2001, in a wave of new language versions that also included Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These languages were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian. In September 2001, an announcement pledged commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia, notifying users of an upcoming roll-out of Wikipedias for all major languages, the establishment of core standards, and a push for the translation of core pages for the new wikis. At the end of that year, when international statistics first began to be logged, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> were announced.|$|E

50|$|The name of Kikinda {{is first}} found {{recorded}} {{at the beginning}} of the 15th century as Kokenyd, and most probably denoted, together with the name Ecehida, a number of small settlements, i.e. estates, firstly belonging to Hungarian and later to Serb local rulers. The name of the town first appears on a map of 1718 as Gross Kikinda, indicating an uninhabited area or a wasteland and not a settlement. The adjective Gross, Nagy or Velika (Great) in German, Hungarian and <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> respectively, was in official use as the name of the town until the end of 1947.|$|E
50|$|A {{tradition}} of divinations {{arranged for the}} days of the week on which certain feast days occur develops in the Early Medieval period. There are many later variants of this, including the German Bauern-Praktik and the versions of Erra Pater published in 16th to 17th century England, mocked in Samuel Butler's Hudibras. South and East Slavic versions are known as koliadniki (from koliada, a loan of Latin calendae), with Bulgarian copies dating from the 13th century, and <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> from the 14th century.Medieval Christian traditions associated with the lucky or unlucky nature of certain days of the week survived into the modern period. This concerns primarily Friday, associated with the crucifixion of Jesus. Sunday, sometimes personified as Saint Anastasia, was itself an object of worship in Russia, a practice denounced in a sermon extant in copies going back to the 14th century.|$|E

40|$|Work {{engagement}} {{is defined}} as a positive, affective-motivational state of work-related well-being characterized by vigor, dedication and absorption. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) is the most frequently used measure of work engagement. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the psychometric properties of the <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> of the UWES- 17 and UWES- 9. The sample consisted of 860 employees from a number of organizations and jobs across Serbia. Based on the UWES- 17 findings, the data confirm both the three-factor and one-factor solutions by giving a slight advantage to the three-factor solution. As for the UWES- 9, based on the PCFA and CFA, the one-factor solution was obtained as the preferred one. Taking into account the UWES- 9 reliability and correlation patterns of its subscales with other well-being variables, both one- and three-factor solutions of the UWES- 9 are suggested for future research. <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> of both the UWES- 17 and UWES- 9 have satisfactory psychometric properties with high reliability, factorial structure in line with the theoretical model, and good predictive validity. The study contributes to enhanced understanding of work engagement by offering an insight from the Serbian cultural and economic context, significantly different from the UWES originating setting. There is still a need for exploring how employees from Serbia conceptualize work engagement, as well as for further, more stringent investigating of the cultural invariance of the UWES factorial structure...|$|E

The theoretical part of the thesis also contains the Serbo-Croatian issue including the historic discursus, the analysis of its break up causes and the self-regard standard language comparison in the particular surroundings. The thesis confronts the conclusions, which concern the correspondences and differences between the Croatian and Serbian standard language, with the language of the concrete prose texts. The analysed sample are texts that are included with the Czech, Croatian and <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> of the parallel corpus INTERCORP. It can answer for an appropriate instrument to compare close languages which largely coincide with each other, and many differences between them consist rather in the frequency than existence or every single language phenomenon admissibility. However, an objective comparison of such close languages is difficult in another way for, concerning the high mutual understanding rate, the direct translations between them are not very common. The thesis summarises the examination of qualitative and quantitative differences between the language of the Croatian and Serbian texts and it seeks to impartially assess and compare the current [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a common, chronic {{skin disease}} in children {{that may affect}} {{their quality of life}} (QoL). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess QoL in children in Montenegro with moderate to severe AD. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Clinic of Dermatology and Venereology, Clinical Center of Montenegro, Podgorica, between January and December 2014. The study group included 200 children (97 boys and 103 girls) with the diagnosis of AD. The Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQOL) and the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) were used to determine QoL for 90 infants (< 4 years old) and 110 children (4 - 16 years old), respectively. Severity of disease was measured by the three-item severity (TIS) score. The mean scores were 14. 38 ± 5. 57 for IDQOL and 18. 43 ± 4. 88 for CDLQI. A positive correlation was observed between AD clinical severity (TIS) and all the items of IDQOL with Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ) ranging from 0. 31 to 0. 74, and between AD clinical severity and all domains of CDLQI (ρ= 0. 31 - 0. 69). The impact of AD on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was more severe for younger girls, but only in some domains (IDQOL), and for older boys (CDLQI). The linguistically validated <b>Serbian</b> <b>versions</b> of both IDQOL and CDLQI questionnaires showed good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0. 88 and 0. 73, respectively. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that AD has a great impact on QoL. A positive correlation between clinical severity and quality of life was seen. </p...|$|E

After completing the questionnaires, the patients returned them to the general practitioners. The general practitioners collected the clinical characteristics of the patients during the encounter, using a purpose-built checklist. Headache severity was assessed by the patient, using a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 – 100  mm). Headache diagnoses had previously been made by neurologists, and {{for the purpose of}} this study were copied from the patients’ files.

30|$|The {{translation}} and cultural {{adaptation of the}} CHQQ was made according to the guidelines of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) (Wild et al. 2005). The original scale was first translated from Hungarian to Serbian by two independent Serbian persons, a professional translator and a bilingual university lecturer. They translated the scale independently of each other, and then the translations were harmonized to one <b>Serbian</b> <b>version</b> at {{the meeting of the}} study investigators and the translators. The harmonized <b>Serbian</b> <b>version</b> was then translated back to Hungarian by a native Hungarian translator, who was not aware of the original Hungarian version of the CHQQ. The back-translation to Hungarian was then compared with the original Hungarian version by the study investigators, and at new meeting of investigators the final <b>Serbian</b> <b>version</b> of the CHQQ was agreed on. The final translation of CHQQ to Serbian was then tested on 10 headache patients at the Health Center in Kragujevac, Serbia for clarity and comprehension. After the pilot a few minor changes of wording were made, and then final <b>Serbian</b> <b>version</b> of the CHQQ was copied and prepared for psychometric testing.|$|R
