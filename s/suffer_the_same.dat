5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, Arnold {{was joined}} by 2,300 troops under command of Major General William Phillips, who took command of the {{combined}} forces. Phillips resumed raiding, defeating the militia at Blandford, then burning the tobacco warehouses at Petersburg on April 25. Richmond was about to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate, but Lafayette arrived. The British, not wanting {{to engage in a}} major battle, withdrew to Petersburg on May 10.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E

5|$|Moira {{explains}} {{that while some}} ghosts in the house only wish for the living to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fates they did, other ghosts are innocent and {{do not wish to}} see any more bloodshed. The Harmons realize the house is a danger to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E
5|$|U-255 {{made two}} short patrols in the Bay of Biscay on the 6 – 9 May and 6 – 15 June 1944, {{but had no}} successes. U-255 began her ninth patrol on 6 May 1944 when she left St. Nazaire. However she was {{recalled}} to her home port after only 2 days fully at sea on 8 May. U-255s tenth patrol was to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate as her ninth. She left St. Nazaire on 6 June 1944, (the day of the Normandy landings) and was recalled home on 15 June after only 10 days at sea.|$|E
5|$|French troops entered Korçë on November 29, 1916 {{during a}} {{military}} operation that aimed to connect the Allied front in Thessaloníki in the Macedonian front to the region in south Albania, which was held by the Italian troops. French troops in Korçë were under General Maurice Sarrail, and under direct command of Colonel Descoins. There were two groups of rebels active {{in the region of}} Korçë, one was led by Themistokli Gërmenji and another by Sali Butka. In the meantime, Albanian irregular bands, headed by Butka and cooperating with the Austrian forces, completely ravaged Moscopole, and threatened that if Korçë would <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate if it did not raise the Albanian flag and surrender to Albanian authorities.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his own career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at this young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. Initially he played in the youth teams for Tamil Nadu as a batsman who was learning to keep wicket, and was regarded by Robin Singh as having very high levels of fitness.|$|E
5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up the {{contents}} of his locker. He concedes that it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E

5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E

25|$|After the sack, many feared other European Christian kingdoms would <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate as Constantinople. Two {{possible}} responses emerged {{amongst the}} humanists and churchmen of that era: Crusade or dialogue. Pope Pius II strongly advocated for another Crusade, while Nicholas of Cusa supported {{engaging in a}} dialogue with the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|Although Louisiana {{had created}} a class of death-eligible crimes {{somewhat}} narrower than North Carolina had, it still had a mandatory death penalty for a significant range of crimes, which were aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping and treason; the lack of discretion in sentencing caused the Louisiana scheme to <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> unconstitutional infirmities as North Carolina's.|$|E
25|$|The Oshawa Arena (later {{known as}} the Hambly Arena) opened in 1930 and was built {{in large part to}} the {{contributions}} of Colonel Robert Samuel McLaughlin. It was the first brick facade and steel support structure for hockey in Oshawa. Shortly after training camp in 1953, the arena would <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> demise as its predecessor and burned to the ground on September 15.|$|E

25|$|When {{the king}} {{realized}} that Heracles was winning, {{he stopped the}} contest and forbade him to participate. Eurytus was well-aware of Heracles' murder of his previous wife, Megara and their children and thus afraid that Iole and her offspring by him would <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate. Eventually, Heracles had won the contest but was not entitled to the prize because of his reputation. Eurytus broke his promise to give his royal daughter to {{the winner of the}} archery contest.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} points may be partly correct in themselves, but they leave {{unanswered}} {{the question of}} why Beck acted like he did. A possible explanation is that he needed to repair his reputation: He was a politician and had during the First War of Schleswig 15 years earlier been passed over for promotion for criticism by Colonel Læssøe, and would probably <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again, for in February during the battle of Sankelmark he left his unit while it was in battle.|$|E
25|$|The Railway Gazette, {{cited in}} Ahrons, {{suggests}} {{that there was an}} even earlier design for Cornwall, as a 2-2-2 with single 4' wheels both forward and back. It's uncertain if Cornwall was ever built in this form. The drawing does show a considerable front overhang, with a high load placed on the front axle. If constructed like this, the likelihood is that it would <b>suffer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problems as its contemporary, Gooch's first 2-2-2 Great Western class of 1846, where a broken front axle led to re-design as a 4-2-2.|$|E
