5|$|Army {{commitments}} intervened {{during the}} 1943 season. Lindwall {{had attempted to}} enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force, but he was rejected because the employees of his firm were exempted from military service. Thus Lindwall resigned his job in order to join the army. As part of his Anti-aircraft and Fortress <b>Signal</b> <b>unit,</b> he was deployed in May 1943 to New Guinea as the Japanese reached the Kokoda Trail close to Port Moresby. Lindwall's unit were bombed while they were ashore and he was lucky not to be killed. In 1945, he returned from the Solomon Islands, where he was believed to have contracted malaria and Dengue fever, although medical tests did not confirm this, he needed injections and atebrin tablets to aid him in recovering from bouts of minor illness for some time afterwards, and he resumed State cricket in 1945â€“46, despite the rigours of war having reduced him to just 73kg, which was thin for his height of 178cm.|$|E

25|$|In April 1945, Draeger was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant, and transferred to III Amphibious Corps, which was preparing for the planned invasion of Japan. However, when the Pacific War ended in August 1945, III Amphibious Corps instead went to North China to accept the surrender of Japanese soldiers, and from October 1945 to February 1946, Draeger served with a <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> in Tianjin, China.|$|E
25|$|Modern warfare {{utilizes}} {{three main}} sorts of signal soldiers. Some {{are assigned to}} specific military bases ("Base Ops"), and they are charged with installation, operation and maintenance of the base communications infrastructure along with hired civilian contracted companies. Others are members of non-signal Army units, providing communications capability for those with other jobs to accomplish (e.g. infantry, medical, armor, etc.) {{in much the same}} way as, say, the unit supply sections, unit clerks, or chemical specialists. The third major sort of signaleer is one assigned to a <b>signal</b> <b>unit.</b> That is to say, a unit whose only mission is to provide communications links between the Army units in their area of operations and other signal nodes in further areas served by other signal units.|$|E

25|$|Officially, {{the state}} militia of the 1880s and early 1890s {{consisted}} of the 1st and 2nd Infantry regiments, one battery of artillery, one troop cavalry, and one <b>signal</b> <b>unit.</b> In reality, interest in the state militia had waned following Reconstruction, and the state legislature failed to appropriate any funds to support the militia. The legislature had even abolished the office of adjutant general, so the only effective organization during this period was at the company level. Local militia units that existed were supported with private funds: local militia companies, such as the McCarthy Light Guards in Little Rock, participated in drill and ceremony competition; all their funding for travel, uniforms and equipment came from private sources. The McCarthy Light Guards organized in Little Rock in 1887 was named for John H. McCarthy, the local businessman who provided their uniforms. The unit competed in several drill competitions, including the Interstate Competitive Drill at Galveston, Texas, where the unit placed third, at Atlanta in 1889 where they placed second, in Omaha in 1891 where they took second, and at Nashville Tennessee where they took first place. The unit was invited to attend the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The unit took fourth prize at the Interstate Competitive Drill conducted in its home town of Little Rock in 1894.|$|E
500|$|After the war the Australian Signal Officer-in-Chief, Major General Colin Simpson, {{paid tribute}} to the {{spotters}}, writing that they were [...] "infantrymen without a typical battlefield, artillerymen without field pieces and tank crews without tanks. Apart from a hard core of very talented personnel, all that most spotters had in common was an abysmal ignorance of {{anything to do with}} signals. Yet they won the respect of our Allies and every branch of the Australian forces". He continued, stating that [...] "they were dedicated to their duty and they never failed. The New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company is a <b>Signal</b> <b>unit</b> of which very little has been heard as their duties were top secret at all times. It can be stated that the successful course of the war could have been seriously delayed, if not greatly prolonged, if this <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> had not operated so efficiently." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} occured off Pasir Ris MRT station.

They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked {{to go down to the}} tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E
