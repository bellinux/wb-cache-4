The fear of God, therefore, that was the cause of his self-denial, was this grace of fear in his heart. This made him to be, as was said before, tender of the honour of God, and of the salvation of his brother: yea, so tender, that rather than he would give an occasion to the weak to stumble, or be offended, he would even deny himself of that which others never <b>sticked</b> to do. Paul also, through the sanctifying operations of this fear of God in his heart, did deny himself even of lawful things, for the profit and commodity of his brother--"I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend"; that is, if his eating of it would make his brother to offend (1 Cor 8:13).|$|E

He used the Masoretic Text - although he knew that other Hebrew texts were more reliable - for his translation of the Old Testament, but sometimes made use of the Samaritan Pentateuch (which was considered very reliable in those days) and the Received Text (Textus Receptus) for the New Testament, but seldom departed from the T.R. He made extensive use of footnotes to explain his translational decisions. He also wrote introductions to all the Bible books. His three volums translation with footnotes (completed in 1830) was quite popular among the higher educated and middle classes. It became commonly known as the Palmbijbel, although Van der Palm just considered it to be a revision of the Statenvertaling. It never became the official Bible of the Dutch Reformed Church. The Church <b>sticked</b> to the Statenvertaling till 1951, although it did update the Statenvertaling several times after the publication of the Palmbijbel.|$|E
