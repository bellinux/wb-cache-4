25|$|Mathematics: From the {{earliest}} the Chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards {{in order to}} calculate. To express 10, a <b>single</b> <b>rod</b> {{is placed in the}} second box from the right. The spoken language uses a similar system to English: e.g. four thousand two hundred seven. No symbol was used for zero. By the 1st century BC, negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art included methods for extracting higher order roots by Horner's method and solving linear equations and by Pythagoras' theorem. Cubic equations were solved in the Tang dynasty and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 AD by Ch'in Chiu-shao. Pascal's triangle for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by Jia Xian.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the type of fishing a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties {{can be used in a}} <b>single</b> <b>rod.</b> In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E

Surprisingly, the ultrafast nonlinearity can be attributed entirely to heating of conduction electrons and does not exhibit any response associated with coherent plasmon oscillation. This indicates a previously unobserved damping of strongly driven plasmons. Comment: Revised tex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{optical properties}} of <b>single</b> <b>rods</b> of one-dimensional nanostructured meso-tetrakis (4 -N-ethylpyridyl) porphyrins {{with a variety}} of ions: 4 I-, 2 CdI 42 - and 6 I-. The porphyrin rods have diameters about 500 μm and length up to several millimeters. Reflection spectra of the <b>single</b> <b>rods</b> were measured by utilizing micro focusing microscopy. We observe the characteristic peaks of the B band (400 - 500 nm) and the Q band (500 - 700 nm), and discover these peaks having clear anisotropic properties. We use a YAG laser (532 nm, 500 mW) to study the photoluminescence spectra of these samples. There are two peaks in the infrared range (650 - 750 nm). The PL peak positions and intensities are different for the three samples. 在本論文中我們測量摻雜 2 CdI 42 -、 4 I- 、 6 I- 之porphyrin晶體樣品：H 2 TEPyP- 2 CdI 42 - 、 4 I- 及 6 I- 在可見光範圍的反射光譜及偏極現象、和PL (photoluminescence) 的相關特性。由光譜中可以觀察到我們的晶棒樣品具有porphyrin的指紋(fingerprint) －B band (400 - 500 nm) 與Q band (500 - 700 nm) 。 當射入樣品的光無偏極時，在B band部分： H 2 TEPyP- 4 i- 晶體在波長 406 nm有強烈反射的訊號，H 2 TEPyP- 6 I- 及H 2 TEPyP- 2 CdI 42 - 則是分別出現在 475 nm與 460 nm的位置。Q band也有數個反射訊號，三個樣品反射峰值位置大致來說差異不大。 後來我們固定光的電場方向轉動樣品，觀察三個樣品隨不同角度反射光譜的變化，發現樣品H 2 TEPyP- 4 I-與H 2 TEPyP- 2 CdI 42 - 兩個樣品不同的面反射的性質確有方向性，而這方向性將展現於不同樣品的band位置。 另外，我們也對於這三個樣品做了PL的實驗，使用波長 532 nm的YAG雷射透過適當的衰減片去激發這三個樣品發光，波長位置在紅光範圍。檢測PL光對角度的變化，發現受laser激發所發出來的光是沒有任何方向性的。第一章 前言 第二章 實驗步驟與儀器量測 第三章 實驗結果與討論 第四章 結論 第五章 參考資...|$|R
25|$|The {{ichthyosaur}} pelvis {{is typically}} rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubic bone, are not fused and {{often do not}} even touch each other. Also, {{the left and right}} pelvic sides do not longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The hip joint is not closed on the inside. The pubic bone typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the fenestra thyreoidea; other researchers deny that the term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected pubic bone and ischium, but in this case, the femoral head no longer articulates with the hip joint. Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a <b>single</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{radio and}} {{telecommunications}} a dipole antenna or doublet is {{the simplest and}} most widely used class of antenna. [...] The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. [...] A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical. [...] The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between {{the two halves of}} the antenna. [...] Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. [...] This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a <b>single</b> <b>rod</b> or conductor [...] with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground.

60|$|I will briefly {{describe}} two of {{the first}} cases observed by me. Six crossed and six self-fertilised seeds of Ipomoea purpurea, from plants treated in the manner above described, were planted {{as soon as they}} had germinated, in pairs on opposite sides of two pots, and rods of equal thickness were given them to twine up. Five of the crossed plants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed self-fertilised plants; the sixth, however, was weakly and was for a time beaten, but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot ahead of its antagonist. As soon as each crossed plant reached the top of its seven- foot rod its fellow was measured, and the result was that, when the crossed plants were seven feet high the self-fertilised had attained the average height of only five feet four and a half inches. The crossed plants flowered a little before, and more profusely than the self-fertilised plants. On opposite sides of another SMALL pot a large number of crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sown, so that they had to struggle for bare existence; a <b>single</b> <b>rod</b> was given to each lot: here again the crossed plants showed from the first their advantage; they never quite reached the summit of the seven-foot rod, but relatively to the self-fertilised plants their average height was as seven feet to five feet two inches. The experiment was repeated during several succeeding generations, treated in exactly the same manner, and with nearly the same result. In the second generation, the crossed plants, which were again crossed, produced 121 seed-capsules, whilst the self-fertilised, again self-fertilised, produced only 84 capsules.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the {{preliminary}} results of an original fusionless method of treatment for progressive scoliosis in young children. METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and radiographs of 23 children with progressive scoliosis who failed to respond to conservative treatment and underwent fusionless surgery using a <b>single</b> solid growing <b>rod</b> construct. All of them were ambulatory and had a follow-up of minimum 2  years. Sixteen patients were treated by consecutive distraction of a <b>single</b> intramuscular <b>rod,</b> and seven patients with rodding and anterior apical convex fusion. The etiology of the scoliosis included 11 idiopathic, 6 syndromic, 4 congenital, and 2 neurofibromatosis. At initial surgery, the average age was 9. 3  ±  2. 8  years, with a mean Cobb angle of 68 ° ±  32 °. Six patients underwent progressive scoliosis correction in a Stagnara cast prior to surgery, and one patient with an external halo-pelvic Ilizarov device. RESULTS: Fusionless <b>single</b> <b>rodding</b> allowed to maintain scoliosis correction in all patients. At an average of 3. 5  ±  0. 9  years after initial surgery, the 23 patients showed a correction of 57  % in the magnitude of the original curvature. Trunk height increase was documented in all patients and ranged from 1. 5 to 11. 9  cm. Rod failure was found in three patients and two patients had hardware infection. Only four cases of proximal junctional kyphosis were found at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results from these series of patients show that the presented fusionless <b>single</b> growing <b>rod</b> technique allows to maintain correction of progressive early onset scoliosis while permitting spinal growth, with low complication rate. With this technique, lengthening procedures are used only once in every 10  months and patients are more comfortable as no brace is needed in most cases. This technique does not require any specific spine device. The procedure is simple and efficacious as long as some guidelines are respected...|$|R

They prefer acidic conditions and moderate temperatures, and they grow better on liquid medium than solid agar medium. Unlike some other bacteria, Telmatobacter do not produce hydrogen sulfide gas from thiosulfate, nor indole from tryptophan. Salt inhibits growth at concentrations above 0.1% (w/v). The DNA G+C content is 57.6%. Telmatobacter are found in acidic wetlands, specifically Sphagnum peat bogs. The only and type species is Telmatobacter bradus.|$|R
