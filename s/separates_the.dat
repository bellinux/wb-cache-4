5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria and the interventricular septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E

5|$|From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's {{position}} {{at the mouth of}} the river was an undeniable asset.

5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental Divide <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Most {{single channel}} audio source {{separation}} (SCASS) approaches produce separated sources accompanied by interference {{from other sources}} and other distortions. To tackle this problem, we propose to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> sources in two stages. In the first stage, <b>the</b> sources are <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> mixed signal. In the second stage, the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and <b>the</b> distortions are reduced using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose two methods that use DNNs {{to improve the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources in <b>the</b> second stage. In the first method, each separated source is improved individually using its own trained DNN, while in the second method all <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources are improved together using a single DNN. To further improve the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources, <b>the</b> DNNs in the second stage are trained discriminatively to further decrease the interference and the distortions of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources. Our experimental results show that using two stages of separation improves the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> signals by decreasing the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and distortions compared to <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> sources using a single stage of separation...|$|R

5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
