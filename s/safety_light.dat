50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} are opto-electronic {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and palletisers. <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|E

50|$|Garden {{lighting}} can be {{an important}} aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: <b>safety</b> <b>lighting,</b> uplighting, and downlighting. <b>Safety</b> <b>lighting</b> is the most practical application. However, {{it is more important to}} determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.|$|R

50|$|Typically, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> {{curtains}} {{are connected}} to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard {{in the event that}} an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.|$|E
50|$|All {{cars will}} carry a {{rear-mounted}} <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> (similar use in Formula One), {{to be controlled}} by race officials.|$|E
25|$|The 22 tunnels (ca. 40km) are {{equipped}} with, among other things, <b>safety</b> <b>lighting,</b> electrical equipment (power supply boxes) and test {{equipment for the}} overhead line voltage. The line's technical equipment was commissioned in December 2013.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, the United States Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $1,000,000 grant to Hagerstown Regional Airport {{to plan and}} design major {{rehabilitation}} efforts on two taxiways, including ensuring the structural integrity of the taxiway and adding LED <b>safety</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Building {{automation}} is {{an example}} of a distributed control system - the computer networking of electronic devices designed to monitor and control the mechanical, security, fire and flood <b>safety,</b> <b>lighting</b> (especially emergency lighting), HVAC and humidity control and ventilation systems in a building.|$|R
50|$|The list of {{statements}} is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your {{analysis of the}} statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, <b>safety,</b> <b>light</b> and inspiration in their responses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} are supplied as a {{pair with}} a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists {{of a number of}} photoelectric cells. When an object breaks {{one or more of the}} beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} {{fall into}} a category of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{may also}} present a hazard in the {{aviation}} environment if aviation <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> must compete for pilot attention with non-relevant lighting. For instance, runway lighting may {{be confused with}} an array of suburban commercial lighting and aircraft collision avoidance lights may be confused with ground lights.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{physical}} security, security lighting is lighting that intended to deter or detect intrusions or other criminal activity {{on a piece of}} real property. It {{can also be used to}} increase a feeling of <b>safety.</b> <b>Lighting</b> is integral to crime prevention through environmental design.|$|R
50|$|Pickup Truck Racing {{is unique}} in 'big' oval racing, in that unlike e.g. NASCAR the trucks have rain tyres, wipers and rear <b>safety</b> <b>lights,</b> and will race on the ovals in the wet. Speeds are about 18 mph slower than when racing in fully dry conditions.|$|R

Sold for an undisclosed amount, renovations by the state of Michigan will continue to proceed.|$|E
50|$|Delta was {{purchased}} in 1965 by the Novo Industrial Corporation. One of Novo Industrial Corp.'s subsidiary companies, King Bee Manufacturing Co., {{was moved to}} Marion, and its line of automotive <b>lighting</b> and <b>safety</b> equipment, including headlamps, <b>safety</b> <b>lights,</b> directional lights, mirrors, and reflectors for trucks, buses, trailers, and farm tractors, was merged into the Delta line of products.|$|R
50|$|The mast is {{a highly}} visible {{landmark}} and can be clearly seen from The Ridgeway, White Horse Hill {{and most of the}} Lambourn Downs, making it a useful reference point for hikers and ramblers. The red <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> which mark the structure at night become visible for eastbound M4 motorists from as early as Swindon East (Junction 15).|$|R
50|$|After Stone's accident, the {{attraction}} was abruptly closed down and remained closed while <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> were being installed. Later on, {{the walls in}} the theater were remodeled {{so that they would}} break away in case a similar accident happened. The attraction did not reopen until July 11, 1974. Stone is buried in Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, Orange County, California.|$|R
50|$|All CLC {{freight cars}} are painted a navy blue color with white lettering, {{although}} some have worn a mineral red color, and the CLC's locomotives are painted navy blue with white lettering and white pinstripes {{across the top}} quarter of the bodies and across the frame sill. However, in times past, some of the locomotives also wore Weyerhaeuser's color scheme of yellow and black. The lone caboose is painted safety yellow with black lettering, Weyerhaeuser colors, {{and seems to be}} one of Weyerhaeuser's old cabooses, most likely either #1 or #2. A signature safety feature of CLC's locomotives is the blue strobe light {{on the roof of the}} locomotives. CLC chooses blue as their <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> color because of the large number of yellow and red flashing safety lights around the Weyerhaeuser mill in Longview.|$|E
50|$|If {{power is}} interrupted, even briefly, the lamp's arc will extinguish, {{and the high}} {{pressure}} {{that exists in the}} hot arc tube will prevent restriking the arc; with a normal ignitor a cool-down period of 5-10 minutes will be required before the lamp can be restarted, but with special ignitors and specially designed lamps, the arc can be immediately re-established. On fixtures without instant restrike capability, a momentary loss of power can mean no light for several minutes. For safety reasons, many metal-halide fixtures have a backup tungsten-halogen incandescent lamp that operates during cool-down and restrike. Once the metal halide restrikes and warms up, the incandescent <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> is switched off. A warm lamp also tends to take more time to reach its full brightness than a lamp that is started completely cold.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Ram / Slide=== The {{vertical}} {{motion of the}} slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. When presses are used manually, where an operator is loading and unloading parts, extreme caution should be used and proper methods of safe guarding should be in place. With the addition of <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains and an I-PRESS control, the light curtains can then be muted or turned off on the slide upstroke to increase productivity when press is being used in single stroke mode. Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed mode selector switch. Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / Bottom Dead Center, SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD. CSD Continuous on Demand is normally used when press are used in roll form lines or irregular stroking is required when punching holes in large panel with gag feed dies.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after midnight, {{the vehicle}} struck a 12.5-ton Bedford {{motorway}} maintenance truck {{parked on the}} hard shoulder of an unlit stretch of the M40 near junction 15. The truck's <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> were flashing. The minibus, which {{was estimated to be}} travelling at 73 to 84mph {{at the time of the}} collision, exploded shortly after the crash and the bodies of several victims remained trapped in the wreckage.|$|R
