5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are {{not known}} for forging bonds with other species, but it was {{observed}} that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and orca whales on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Another synonym australasianus ("Australasian") {{was applied}} to <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> in the {{southern}} hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Physeter macrocephalus), or cachalot, is {{the largest}} of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It is the only living member of genus Physeter, and one of three extant species in the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> family, along with the pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> and dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> of the genus Kogia.|$|R
500|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale's</b> ivory-like {{teeth were}} often sought by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century whalers, who {{used them to}} produce inked carvings known as scrimshaw. Thirty teeth of the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{can be used for}} ivory. Each of these teeth, up to [...] and [...] across, are hollow {{for the first half of}} their length. Like walrus ivory, <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> ivory has two {{distinct}} layers. However, <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> ivory contains a much thicker inner layer. Though a widely practised art in the nineteenth century, scrimshaw using genuine <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s. Currently the Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), prevents the sales of or trade in <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it.|$|R
50|$|Like its giant relative, the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> the pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> has a {{spermaceti}} organ in its forehead (see <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> for {{a discussion}} of its purpose). It also has a sac in its intestines that contains a dark red fluid. The whale may expel this fluid when frightened, perhaps to confuse and disorient predators.|$|R
5|$|Fossil <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{differ from}} modern <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the {{possible}} exception of Aulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> have 21 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}} (2n=42). The genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin.|$|E
5|$|Hunting large whales {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer whales {{generally}} choose to attack young or weak animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Adult bull <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.|$|E
60|$|Ere this, {{you must}} have plainly seen {{the truth of what}} I started with-- that the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> and the Right Whale have almost entirely {{different}} heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale's.</b> Nor in the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> only one.|$|R
50|$|The large toothed whales of Maine {{include the}} beluga, beaked whale, false killer whale, grampus, killer whale, {{northern}} bottlenose <b>whale,</b> pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> short-finned pilot <b>whale,</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> and the long-finned pilot whale.|$|R
40|$|A <b>whale</b> baby female <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> Physeter macrocephakis Linnaeus {{measuring}} 3. 71 m {{and weighing}} about 700 kg was stranded on 18 th December, 1988 at Samnathanpettai near Nagapattinam. Another <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{was found dead}} and washed ashore at Vizhunthamavadi near Nagapattinam on 18 th January, 1991. The stranded <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> was an young female of 9. 70 m weighing about 5 tonnes and estimated to be around five years old...|$|R
5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic waste {{to the ocean}} environment by humans is new. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> have occasionally been found with pieces of plastic in their stomachs.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Dexron fluid, {{like its}} predecessor Type-A/Suffix-A, used <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> oil as a friction modifier. The U.S. Endangered Species Act banned {{the import of}} <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> oil, so the fluid had to be reformulated.|$|R
50|$|Dugong, a {{vulnerable}} marine mammal is the flagship mammal of the park. It {{is an important}} habitat for the Cetaceans: Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, Finless porpoise, Spinner dolphin, Common dolphin, Rissos dolphin, Melon-headed <b>whale,</b> and Dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale.</b> Larger <b>whales</b> include <b>Sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> Minke whale, Brydes whale, Sei whale, and critically endangered species including Humpback whale, Fin whale, and Blue whale.|$|R
50|$|O. ingens, as {{with many}} (if not all) large squid, {{has a number of}} predators. These include the patagonian toothfish, king penguin, {{wandering}} albatross, pilot whale, bottlenose <b>whale,</b> dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> and other types of squid.|$|R
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were {{once thought to be}} a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> share similar codas, it is still unknown whether <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Kogia sima, {{formerly}} Kogia simus) is one {{of three}} extant species in the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> family. They are not often sighted at sea, and most extant information comes from the study of stranded carcasses.|$|R
60|$|But how? Genius in the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale?</b> Has the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> {{ever written}} a book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is {{declared}} in his doing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And {{this reminds me}} that had the great <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> been known to the young Orient World, {{he would have been}} deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, the great <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> shall lord it.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Kogia breviceps) is one {{of three}} species of toothed <b>whale</b> in the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> family. They are not often sighted at sea, and most of what is known about them comes from the {{examination}} of stranded specimens.|$|R
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{can live}} 70 years or more. They are {{a prime example}} of a species that has been K-selected, meaning their {{reproductive}} strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.|$|E
5|$|The hunting led to {{the near}} {{extinction}} of large whales, including <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972. The International Whaling Commission gave the species full protection in 1985 but hunting by Japan in the northern Pacific Ocean continued until 1988.|$|E
50|$|I. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Physeter macrocephalus), {{the most}} {{important}} prey of Nantucket whaling fleet, which operated principally in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. The notorious fictional white whale Moby Dick in the novel is of this species, {{and is based on}} the real-life <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> Mocha Dick in the South Pacific in the 1840s. Because of lack of observations of the blue whale at that time, Melville asserts inaccurately that the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> is the largest creature on Earth.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the marine}} life, the harbor seal {{is the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of seal and found along the east coast, while the hooded seal, bearded seal, grey seal, ringed seal, and harp seal {{are found in the}} northwest. Whales are common along Atlantic coastline. Whale species found along the entire coastline includes the Gervais' beaked whale, common minke whale, fin whale, sei whale, blue <b>whale,</b> humpback <b>whale,</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> killer whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, True's beaked whale, and the Blainville's beaked whale.|$|R
5|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{belongs to}} the order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> Kogia breviceps and the dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> family).|$|R
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} is a {{prominent}} user of echolocation and communication, with vocalization {{as loud as}} 230 decibels (re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> can live for more than 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Physeter macrocephalus, Linnaeus 1758) is an {{endangered}} cetacean species, particularly sensitive to noise pollution and highly vulnerable to ship strikes. In {{the framework of}} the Life+ Nature WHALESAFE it was realized an interference avoidance system capable to detect and track <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> to identify the threats and to prevent collisions and other risks by issuing warning messages in real time to ships. The permanent acoustic station is able to detect <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> in a range of about 7 km...|$|R
50|$|In Endless Ocean for the Wii, a {{giant squid}} {{can be found}} in the Abyss, along with a <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale.</b> Being a non-violent game, the giant squid will not hurt you and the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> will not attack the giant squid. In its sequel Endless Ocean 2: Adventures of the Deep, however, the giant squid is too {{dangerous}} to continue the quest and the only way to proceed is to lure a <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> to fight it while you find the mini-sub.|$|R
50|$|Early whaling {{efforts were}} {{concentrated}} on right whales and humpbacks, which were found near the American coast. As these populations declined {{and the market}} for whale products (especially whale oil) grew, American whalers began hunting the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale.</b> The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> was particularly prized for the reservoir of spermaceti (a dense waxy substance that burns with an exceedingly bright flame) housed in the spermaceti organ, located forward and above the skull. Hunting for the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> forced whalers to sail farther from home in search of their quarry, eventually covering the globe.|$|R
