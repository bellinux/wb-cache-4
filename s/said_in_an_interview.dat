5|$|Despite {{statements}} from bandmembers, that Lamb of God planned {{to enter the}} studio in 2014 to begin recording their eighth studio album, hoping to complete it {{by the end of}} the same year, Chris Adler <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with The Virginian-Pilot that besides the large amount legal fees the band encountered from Randy Blythe's trial, the band's inactivity during the trial meant no new income coming in, which eventually depleted the band's funds.|$|E

5|$|Nadanian once <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> {{that one}} of the joyful events of his life was the ending of the Turin Olympiad in 2006, when his student Sargissian became Olympic {{champion}} with the Armenian team and his other student Akobian won bronze with the U.S. team. At the next Olympiad in Dresden the story repeated itself: Sargissian won team gold medal and Akobian won team bronze.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish {{to be part of a}} large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

This fact was corroborated by Saif in an interview when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E

He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that he could maintain the consistency in the character {{only because of the}} fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners {{had told her}} that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to guess which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|About the film's {{comparison}} with the novel, Chopra <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that, as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them {{one and a half}} years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising under-represented characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look.|$|E

5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E
5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 {{to examine the effects}} of local tax {{initiatives}} on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, {{the next}} filming {{schedule}} began in Malaysia. Upon its completion, Mahesh {{took a break}} and then joined the set at Hyderabad on 6May 2015. On 5June 2015, Madhi <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that twelve days of shooting were pending. He added that two types of camera– the Alexa XT and the Red Dragon– were being used to film a number of mild movement shots throughout the film. On 17June 2015, Siva told the media that all filming except for a week of patchwork was finished. By then, a song sequence focusing on the lead pair was being filmed at Ramoji Film City.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the first}} two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 was shot in Vancouver. The Corkscrew roller coaster at Playland was {{the basis of the}} Devil's Flight. Winstead and Merriman <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that the film required three months of shooting; {{the first two}} weeks were spent on filming the roller-coaster scene, {{and the rest of the}} film was shot out of sequence. The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> {{he needed to get}} away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
