40|$|The authors {{describe}} and analyze multiaccess protocols in a multichannel system using several parallel broadcast radio channels. Two specific cases are described: <b>sequential</b> <b>hunting</b> terminal channel and random choice. A Markovian model is formulated, and the protocol performance is evaluated. Numerical {{results are presented}} and compared with the single-channel system...|$|E

The formula can be easily programmed on the computer, and it avoids the occurrence of arithmetic overflow during computation, allowing {{the evaluation of the}} last trunk occupancy for large groups of trunks...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of telephone traffic on high-usage routes is one important {{problem in the}} evaluation of the busy-hour service of telephone exchanges. In this paper, the acceptable level of offered traffic on a high-usage route is considered to be that which results in a specified last trunk occupancy assuming <b>sequential</b> <b>hunting.</b> Using teletraffic analysis, a mathematical formula that represents the case is derived; and a computer program written in Pascal is described. The application of the program is demonstrated by means of two examples; the first is related to the development of traffic tables, and the second is concerned with the {{investigation of}} high-usage routes on some telephone exchanges in practical us...|$|E
