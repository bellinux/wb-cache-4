A total of 72 porcine burn <b>scars</b> at week 6 after burn were rated in vivo and/or on photographs. Good agreements were achieved for both intra-rater reliability (correlation is 0. 86 - 0. 98) and inter-rater reliability (ICC= 80 - 85 %). The results showed statistically significant correlations for each pair in this clinical <b>scar</b> scale (p< 0. 01), with the best correlation found between <b>scar</b> cosmetic outcome and <b>scar</b> colour. A multivariate principle components analysis revealed that this clinical <b>scar</b> assessment was highly correlated with <b>scar</b> histology, wound size, and re-epithelialisation data (p< 0. 001). More severe <b>scars</b> are clinically characterised by darker purple colouration, more elevation, no presence of hair, histologically by thicker <b>scar</b> tissue, thinner remaining normal dermis, {{are more likely to}} have worse contraction, and slower re-epithelialisation. This study demonstrates that our clinical <b>scar</b> scale is a reliable, independent and valuable tool for assessing porcine burn outcome and truthfully reflects <b>scar</b> appearance and function. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a high correlation between clinical <b>scar</b> assessment and <b>scar</b> histology, wound contraction and re-epithelialisation data on porcine burn <b>scars.</b> We believe that the successful use of porcine <b>scar</b> scales is invaluable for assessing potential human burn treatments.

40|$|Background: Burn {{survivors}} are frequently faced with disfiguring <b>scars.</b> Various techniques exist to improve <b>scar</b> appearance, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion. Next to that, surgical reconstruction, such as <b>scar</b> excision is an option. This randomized controlled trial investigates whether a larger burn <b>scar</b> can be excised using a skin-stretching device for wound closure, thereby optimizing use of adjacent healthy skin. This technique may allow <b>scar</b> excision in a one-step procedure {{instead of two}} or more steps, which is necessary for serial excision and tissue expansion. Methods: Two arms were compared: <b>scar</b> excision and closure by skin stretch and <b>scar</b> excision without additional techniques. The primary outcome measure was <b>scar</b> surface area reduction. In addition, complications were registered. Results: Fifteen patients were randomized for skin stretch and 15 patients were randomized for <b>scar</b> excision only. In the skin stretch group, 10 of 15 <b>scars</b> were completely excised compared with three of 15 in the <b>scar</b> excision-only group (p = 0. 025). In the skin stretch group, a significantly larger reduction in <b>scar</b> area was achieved: 95 ± 11 percent of the <b>scar</b> was excised versus 78 ± 17 percent in the <b>scar</b> excision-only group (p = 0. 003). One patient in the skin stretch group and three patients in the <b>scar</b> excision-only group experienced partial wound dehiscence (p = 0. 598). Conclusions: In burn <b>scar</b> reconstructions, a significantly larger reduction in <b>scar</b> area can be achieved using a skin-stretching device compared with <b>scar</b> excision with no additional techniques, without an increased risk of complications. It was shown that skin stretching is of added value for <b>scars</b> that cannot be excised in a one-step procedure. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} mast cells in surgical and pathological <b>scar</b> reactions by their identification and quantification using immunohistochemistry.  METHODS—Surgical <b>scars</b> and pathological <b>scar</b> reactions were stained immunohistochemically for tryptase to identify mast cells. These were quantified in the <b>scar</b> tissue and surrounding dermis. Statistical analyses were performed {{to test the hypothesis}} that mast cell numbers were different in the varying types of <b>scar</b> reaction.  RESULTS—A significant difference was found between the mean number of mast cells in periocular <b>scars</b> compared with keloids, hypertrophic <b>scars,</b> and surgical <b>scars</b> from other sites (p< 0. 05). No significant difference was found in mast cell numbers between the other <b>scar</b> types either within the lesions or surrounding dermis. There were significantly more mast cells in the dermis than in the <b>scar</b> tissue itself, except for the small group of periocular <b>scars.</b> The ratio of mast cells in the lesion compared with the dermis was not significantly different between the <b>scar</b> types, except for the periocular <b>scars.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Mast cell numbers are similar in and around keloid, hypertrophic, and surgical <b>scars.</b> The increased number of mast cells at periocular <b>scar</b> sites was contrary to expectation since keloids are rare at this site.

40|$|Abstract: Most {{cutaneous}} wounds heal with <b>scar</b> formation. Ideally, an inconspicuous normotrophic <b>scar</b> is formed, but {{an abnormal}} <b>scar</b> (hypertrophic <b>scar</b> or keloid) can also develop. A major challenge to scientists and physicians {{is to prevent}} adverse <b>scar</b> formation after severe trauma (e. g. burn injury) and understand why some individuals will form adverse <b>scars</b> even after relatively minor injury. Currently, many different models exist to study <b>scar</b> formation, ranging from simple monolayer cell culture to 3 D tissue-engineered models even to humanized mouse models. Currently, these high-/medium-throughput test models avoid the main questions referring to why an adverse <b>scar</b> forms instead of a normotrophic <b>scar</b> and what causes a hypertrophic <b>scar</b> to form rather than a keloid <b>scar</b> and also, how is the genetic predisposition {{of the individual and}} the immune system involved. This information is essential if we are to identify new drug targets and develop optimal strategies in the future to prevent adverse <b>scar</b> formation.

The expression of α-SMA was investigated in 100 biopsies from 44 6 -week old burn <b>scars</b> and in 85 biopsies from 16 2 -week old burn wounds. Statistical analysis showed that the levels of α-SMA in 6 -week old <b>scars</b> were significantly negatively correlated to <b>scar</b> size (r = - 0. 68) and the higher levels of α-SMA were observed in smaller <b>scars.</b> Moreover, α-SMA was also found to be significantly positively correlated to re-epithelialisation time (r = 0. 57) and <b>scar</b> thickness (r = 0. 58) and higher levels of α-SMA were detected in thicker <b>scars</b> with delayed wound closure. Further statistical analysis revealed that <b>scar</b> contraction can be explained best by the level of α-SMA expression and partially by <b>scar</b> thickness.

40|$|Aim: Mastectomy is a {{variable}} {{associated with increased}} incidence of upperbody morbidity after breast cancer. <b>Scar</b> severity may contribute to this risk; however, there is no recognized mastectomy <b>scar</b> assessment. The Observer Scale (OS) from Patient and Observer <b>Scar</b> Assessment Scale has been evaluated in breast linear <b>scar</b> research but not for mastectomy <b>scar</b> tissue. This study investigates the suitability of OS to rate <b>scar</b> severity of two common <b>scar</b> types after mastectomy. Method: Therapists indicating interest in mastectomy <b>scar</b> from Linkedin connections and Google searched websites (English) {{were invited to participate}} in an online survey. Each OS feature was surveyed for two scenarios: mastectomy linear <b>scar</b> (LS) and mastectomy chest wall adhesion (CWA) assessment. Therapists rated the level of importance of five additional instructions or skill requirements for each <b>scar</b> feature, with the aim of achieving a more reliable assessment of <b>scar</b> severity. Data from therapists reporting 2 + years of experience were evaluated. Results: 28 responders met the experience criteria. Each therapist evaluated 4 / 9 <b>scar</b> types after mastectomy and many evaluated 9 / 9. CWA and LS assessment rated as strongly important in their practice (71 % and 57 %). Responders had high agreement (> 90 %) with the level of importance (5 / 6 + 6 / 6) for: clothing removal instruction for six OS <b>scar</b> features (LS and CWA) and <b>scar</b> palpation skills for the pliability feature (CWA). Sound agreement (80 – 90 %) occurred for: <b>scar</b> palpation skills for vascularity (CWA), thickness and pliability features (LS) and knowledge of mastectomy <b>scar</b> types for thickness feature (LS and CWA). Reasonable agreement (70 – 80 %) occurred for: <b>scar</b> stretch instruction for vascularity feature (LS) and pliability feature (CWA) and knowledge of <b>scar</b> types for most <b>scar</b> features.
