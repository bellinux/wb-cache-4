40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model that}} can account for the almost uniform <b>staggering</b> of wage contracts in some countries {{as well as for}} the markedly nonuniform <b>staggering</b> in others. In the model, short and long contracts as well as long contracts concluded in different periods are strategic substitutes, which provide a powerful rationale for <b>staggering.</b> We show that for realistic parameter values, there is a continuum of possible equilibria with various degrees of <b>staggering</b> of long contracts. If the contracting cost is not too large, then the lowest possible degree of <b>staggering</b> decreases with the contracting cost and increases with monetary uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of wage and price <b>staggering</b> on monetary persistence. We show that, for plausible parameter values, wage and price <b>staggering</b> are highly complementary in generating monetary persistence. We do so by proposing the new measure "quantitative persistence," after discussing weaknesses of the "contract multiplier," which is generally used to compare persistence. The existence of complementarities means that beyond understanding how wage and price <b>staggering</b> work in isolation, {{it is important to}} explore their interactions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the degree of monetary persistence generated by wage vis-à-vis price <b>staggering</b> depends on the relative competitiveness of the labour and product markets. We show that the conventional wisdom that wage <b>staggering</b> can generate more persistence than price <b>staggering</b> does not necessarily hold. monetary persistence; monetary policy; price staggering; wage <b>staggering...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractVarious {{structural}} {{models for}} amyloid β fibrils have been {{derived from a}} variety of experimental techniques. However, these models cannot differentiate between the relative position of the two arms of the β hairpin called the <b>stagger.</b> Amyloid fibrils of various hierarchical levels form left-handed helices composed of β sheets. However it is unclear if positive, negative and zero <b>staggers</b> all form the macroscopic left-handed helices. To address this issue we have conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid β sheets of various <b>staggers</b> and shown that only negative <b>staggers</b> lead to the experimentally observed left-handed helices while positive <b>staggers</b> generate the incorrect right-handed helices. This result suggests that the negative <b>staggers</b> are physiologically relevant structure of the amyloid β fibrils...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of wage and price <b>staggering</b> on monetary persistence. We show that, for plausible parameter values, wage and price <b>staggering</b> are complementary in generating monetary persistence. We do so by proposing the new measure of quantitative inertia, after discussing weaknesses of the contract multiplier, a standard measure of monetary persistence. The existence of complementarities means that beyond understanding how wage and price <b>staggering</b> work in isolation, {{it is important to}} investigate their interactions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the degree of monetary persistence generated by wage vis- 0 -vis price <b>staggering</b> depends on the relative competitiveness of the labor and product markets. We show that the conventional finding that wage <b>staggering</b> generates more persistence than price <b>staggering</b> holds under homogenous capital accumulation. Under firm-specific capital, wage <b>staggering</b> generates more persistence only when the labor market is sufficiently competitive relative to the product market.

Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be <b>staggered.</b>|$|E
