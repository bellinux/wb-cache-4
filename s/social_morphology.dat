But there persists about it a curious discursiveness that reflects upon the power and value of the initial impetus. Mr. V.V. Branford, the able secretary of the Sociological Society, recently attempted a useful work in a classification of the methods {{of what he calls}} [...] "approach," [...] a word that seems to me eminently judicious and expressive. A review of the first volume the Sociological Society has produced brings home the aptness of this image of exploratory operations, of experiments in [...] "taking a line." [...] The names of Dr. Beattie Crozier and Mr. Benjamin Kidd recall works that impress one as large-scale sketches of a proposed science rather than concrete beginnings and achievements. The search for an arrangement, a [...] "method," [...] continues as though they were not. The desperate resort to the analogical method of Commenius is confessed by Dr. Steinmetz, who talks of <b>social</b> <b>morphology,</b> physiology, pathology, and so forth. There is also a less initiative disposition in the Vicomte Combes de Lestrade and in the work of Professor Giddings. In other directions sociological work is apt to lose its general reference altogether, to lapse towards some department of activity not primarily sociological at all. Examples of this are the works of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, M. Ostrogorski and M. Gustave le Bon. From a contemplation of all this diversity Professor Durkheim emerges, demanding a [...] "synthetic science," [...] "certain synthetic conceptions"--and Professor Karl Pearson endorses the demand--to fuse all these various activities into something that will live and grow. What is it that tangles this question so curiously that there is not only a failure to arrive at a conclusion, but a failure to join issue? ...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "social geography" [...] (or rather [...] "géographie sociale") {{originates}} from France, {{where it}} was used both by geographer Élisée Reclus and by sociologists of the Le Play School, perhaps independently from each other. In fact, the first proven occurrence of the term derives from a review of Reclus' Nouvelle géographie universelle from 1884, written by Paul de Rousiers, {{a member of the}} Le Play School. Reclus himself used the expression in several letters, the first one dating from 1895, and in his last work L'Homme et la terre from 1905. The first person to employ the term as part of a publication's title was Edmond Demolins, another member of the Le Play School, whose article Géographie sociale de la France was published in 1896 and 1897. After the death of Reclus as well as the main proponents of Le Play's ideas, and with Émile Durkheim turning away from his early concept of <b>social</b> <b>morphology,</b> Paul Vidal de la Blache, who noted that geography [...] "is a science of places and not a science of men", remained the most influential figure of French geography. One of his students, Camille Vallaux, wrote the two-volume book Géographie sociale, published in 1908 and 1911. Jean Brunhes, one of Vidal's most influential disciples, included a level of (spatial) interactions among groups into his fourfold structure of human geography. Until the Second World War, no more theoretical framework for social geography was developed, though, leading to a concentration on rather descriptive rural and regional geography. However, Vidal's works were influential for the historical Annales School, who also shared the rural bias with the contemporary geographers, and Durkheim's concept of <b>social</b> <b>morphology</b> was later developed and set in connection with social geography by sociologists Marcel Mauss and Maurice Halbwachs.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the concept of the network society gained {{importance}} in information society theory. For Manuel Castells, network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). [...] "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" [...] (Castells 2000: 21). [...] "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new <b>social</b> <b>morphology</b> of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" [...] (Castells 2000: 500).

5000|$|According to Castells, {{networks}} {{constitute the}} new <b>social</b> <b>morphology</b> of our societies. [...] When interviewed by Harry Kreisler from the University of California Berkeley, Castells said [...] "...the definition, if you wish, in concrete {{terms of a}} network society is a society where the key social structures and activities are organized around electronically processed information networks. So it's not just about networks or social networks, because social networks have been very old forms of social organization. It's about social networks which process and manage information and are using micro-electronic based technologies." [...] The diffusion of a networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture. For Castells, networks have become the basic units of modern society. Van Dijk does not go that far; for her these units still are individuals, groups, organizations and communities, though they may increasingly be linked by networks.|$|E

According to the Hungarian sociologist the labor markets are conditioned by specific <b>social</b> <b>morphologies</b> formed by economic actors such as enterprises and trade unions but also by families and public policies locally spread. More recently, the European legislator has provided fundamental instructions for the promotion of competitive labor cultures. The flexibility and market orientation of the labor offer are among them.

How to combine the inclinations to the flexibility and the market oriented specializations with the different national and regional labor cultures ? And which function plays the sociological research in a similar process? Starting from the analysis of a specific policy as the benefits for unemployment in Italy and France and adopting the sociology of public action the paper offers a comparative analysis of the ways through which unemployment benefits promote in the different national contexts competitive labor cultures. The analysis will focus on the social mechanism of imitation that the policy is able to activate considering the lever age function exerted by related policies and the consequences of this policy on the career and professional growth of individuals.

5000|$|Other {{scholars}} {{prefer to}} speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism (Manuel Castells 2000, Christian Fuchs 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by [...] "information generation, processing, and transmission" [...] that have become [...] "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" [...] (Castells 2000: 21). The [...] "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" [...] (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new <b>social</b> <b>morphology</b> of society (Castells 2000: 500). Nicholas Garnham is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach {{is based on a}} dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq).

By setting {{the uniqueness of}} inshore coastal fishing communities in the Mediterranean as a <b>social</b> halieutical <b>morphology</b> inscribed in the very long span of time, this article underlines why, without any romanticism, these communities have to be scaled up, valorized. It demonstrates how and why some of these robust communal appropriation forms have worked with a low discount rate, which embeds wisdom of the sea, or halieusophy, {{based on the principle}} of giving for keeping. Backed by these successful experiences, the author analyses the trajectories of community re-invention, the pathways of their empowering through the setting up of a new institution, ecomuseums for the sea, as ethically based local governance institutions capable of fine-tuning and improving the relationship between humans and marine entities. In the last, thought-provoking, part, the author raises the question: why does this strategic pathway have {{to come back to the}} very essence of the scope of the valuable, i. e. women? And he answers: because women in inshore coastal fishing communities ensure, more than in other communities, the holding and ordering of the fluctuations and contingency in family life, and, at a more ontological level of reflection, they embody a disposition for a long-term time horizon and a non-destruction principle. The governance perspectives in fisheries in their global and local modalities have to be en-gendered.

40|$|Dominant {{paradigms}} of causal {{explanation for}} why and how Western liberal-democracies {{go to war in}} the post-Cold War era remain versions of the 'liberal peace' or 'democratic peace' thesis. Yet such explanations have been shown to rest upon deeply problematic epistemological and methodological assumptions. Of equal importance, however, is the failure of these dominant paradigms to account for the 'neoliberal revolution' that has gripped Western liberal-democracies since the 1970 s. The transition from liberalism to neoliberalism remains neglected in analyses of the contemporary Western security constellation. Arguing that neoliberalism can be understood simultaneously through the Marxian concept of ideology and the Foucauldian concept of governmentality – that is, as a complementary set of 'ways of seeing' and 'ways of being' – the thesis goes on to analyse British security in policy and practice, considering it as an instantiation of a wider neoliberal way of war. In so doing, the thesis draws upon, but also challenges and develops, established critical discourse analytic methods, incorporating within its purview not only the textual data that is usually considered by discourse analysts, but also material practices of security. This analysis finds that contemporary British security policy is predicated on a neoliberal <b>social</b> ontology, <b>morphology</b> and morality – an ideology or 'way of seeing' – focused on the notion of a globalised 'network-market', and is aimed at rendering circulations through this network-market amenable to neoliberal techniques of government. It is further argued that security practices shaped by this ideology imperfectly and unevenly achieve the realisation of neoliberal 'ways of being' – especially modes of governing self and other or the 'conduct of conduct' – and the re-articulation of subjectivities in line with neoliberal principles of individualism, risk, responsibility and flexibility. The policy and practice of contemporary British 'security' is thus recontextualised as a component of a broader 'neoliberal way of war'...|$|R

Indeed, urban disparities and social anomalies such as informal sector, terrorism, unemployment, and unsustainable development policymaking threaten vulnerable ongoing democratic processes in modern Tunisia. The author described and analyzed the previous urban planning processes, which had been undertaken by the nation’s mono party state since independency. The top-down development policies implemented up until now in Tunisia entailed the deepening of the large gap between coastal and inland areas. In fact, the former benefitted from their location across the seashores, and their proximity to the central power and economic growth. However, the latter {{had been left behind}} due to their austere geographical neighbourhood (e. g. desert, drought, lack of livelihood…). Urban disparities and social inequalities in Tunisia join in a networked society where local and global unfold in a globalized world of flows and nodes. Local societies are subsystems within a global neo-liberal capitalist system. Hence, the current social movements triggered in Tunisia are not cyclical. They are amongst global social networked movements.

Many researchers have investigated Montreal’s constructive and urban culture, with {{special attention to}} built environment history and growth. Working on the mixing of French and Native attitudes to space design, the paper deals with Montreal’s outdoor public spaces, and with their becoming an instrument of disclosure of urban life {{with the aim of}} satisfying material and immaterial needs, in a multicultural perspective. 	After the renewal designs of the last ten years, Montreal’s pedestrian spaces can be viewed today as a sort of master example of what a vital city centre can become, from a competitiveness development perspective, showing the inner essence and epitomizing the community's heritage and identity. This research takes into account the urban renewal projects realized during the past ten years in Montreal as revealing markers of cultural growth that increases people’s sense of well-being, attracts tourists, and fosters sociability. The paper aims to give back an integrated rendering of the role played by pedestrian squares through environmental and technological considerations. Squares located in the Vieux-Montréal, QIM, and Vieux-Port districts are investigated in terms of aspect, usability, and management. Environmental and technological performances are assumed as indicators of the sustainable dynamics that today sign Montreal spaces, customs, and culture, under the hypothesis that architecture {{is one of the major}} catalysts in physical, social, and economic change...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe E 1 A gene of {{adenovirus}} {{has been}} considered both a dominant oncogene and a tumor suppressor. It {{has been reported to}} induce epithelial cell but to prevent myoblast differentiation. E 1 A enables oncogenes that are unable to transform primary cells on their own to do so, yet suppresses tumor progression toward invasion and metastasis. To try to reconcile the seemingly, conflicting E 1 A phenotypes, we examined the expression of epithelial cell specific and characterizing proteins in immortalized or tumorigenically transformed primary epithelial cells expressing wild-type E 1 A or a C-terminal mutant that has lost tumor suppressive abilities. All the cell types continued to express cytokeratin. Epithelial cell <b>morphology,</b> <b>social</b> behavior, and growth characteristics were retained by cells expressing wild-type E 1 A, even in the presence of an activated ras oncogene. Mutant E 1 A-expressing cells were less well differentiated {{even in the absence of}} ras. They were specifically defective in cell–cell junctional complexes, such as tight and adherens junctions and desmosomes. There was also a preference for those actin structures prominent in fibroblasts: stress fibers and filopodia, while in the wild-type E 1 A expressing cells, cortical actin and circumferential actin filaments were dominant. Thus the E 1 A-mutant-expressing cells were already predisposed to a more advanced tumor stage even when they were only immortalized and not transformed. The results suggest the possibility that the C terminus of E 1 A may be involved in regulating epithelial mesenchymal transitions, which have previously been linked to tumor progression...|$|R
