40|$|Investing {{in solar}} drying {{technology}} Cue: Drying produce {{in the open}} air works. But in Kenya, Winnie Onyimbo discovers another way of drying fruits and vegetables that can fetch a good price at the market. She speaks to a lady who is passionate about solar drying technology. Margaret Mimoh is from Honey Care Africa Ltd, a cooperative which - as the name suggests - makes money from beekeeping. But recently, members of her cooperative have decided to take up another initiative. They have decided to invest in solar drying technology to preserve and keep fruits all year round. Solar drying works by trapping heat inside a box or frame covered with plastic sheets, with a wire mesh base to allow air to circulate. The trapped heat causes the fruits or vegetables to lose their moisture, and dries them out ? but the heat is not enough to cook them. Margaret Mimoh explains how it is done ? starting with the selection process. IN:	?First you have to get?? OUT:	?give it a longer shelf life. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Winnie Onyimbo speaking to Margaret Mimoh from Honey Care Africa Ltd. Could investing in solar trying technology be worth it? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	First you have to get ripe fruits, not over-ripened because if it?s over- ripened then slicing will be a problem because it will get mashed. So what happens is you have to wash the fruit, then you peel it and then you slice it in small slices maybe three millimetres to about five millimetres thick and then you place them on the drier, on the drying tray and then you put them inside the drier itself then you leave it there to dry. Onyimbo	I would like you to give me a brief explanation on what the solar drier that is used for drying looks like? Mimoh	The structure that is used for drying fruit is a very simple one. It is sort of, we should say, like a frame, maybe one metre by one metre and then it is covered with netting mesh, black netting mesh and then with a clear polythene sheet. The reason why we have the black netting and the clear polythene sheet is heat is allowed to get into the drier itself through the sheet and then it is absorbed by the netting mesh which now allows the air to circulate into the solar drier easily and then it extracts the moisture from the fruits allowing them to dry. Onyimbo	How big is it? Mimoh	The bigness will depend on <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> fruits {{that you would like to}} dry, like drying three kilos of fruit you will need one metre by one metre <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with about two or three drying trays inside it. Onyimbo	So this is a kind of drier that you use to dry fruits, please explain to me what is this that I am seeing? Mimoh	This is the polythene sheet, it is very simple and it is locally available. We are always careful to get the right material for drying because when sunlight passes through this, there might be some chemical reaction between the polythene and the heat under and the fruit. Onyimbo	I am also seeing it is a bit different from the polythene that we are used to, this seems to be harder, harder to touch? Mimoh	Yes it is hard because even if you put a very light one there will not be as much heat as possible that would go in and dry the fruit so we use these ones so that you have more heat and also durability because you know when there is a lot of heat it tends to wear out. So we also do not want to be replacing like each and every time. The polythene sheet covers the three sides. You see on the three sides you have the polythene sheet and on the top side and then on the front side where you slide in the trays you have the netting mesh and this netting mesh - as I explained - it is locally available also in the market and it has to be black because black absorbs heat. Then when you open this (SFX opening drier) you have the trays. You slide them inside here and then you will be placing your fruits here on this tray here just the small pieces that you have cut, the slices you place them on the tray. Onyimbo	What advantages does this solar drier have in comparison to drying fruits in the open sun? Mimoh	There are aspects of health issues and hygiene. So if you basically maybe just take fruits and dry them in <b>the</b> open air <b>of</b> course you are exposing them to a lot of dust then maybe bacteria and those kind of things. And also the other thing is the nutritional value that is in the fruit will definitely be lost because it is exposed so it will not dry. There is no air circulating when you are drying {{in the open air}}. Onyimbo	How about the time spent, is it faster drying in a drier than drying in the open sun? Mimoh	When we have enough sunlight it would take a whole day, just one day, but if you do not really have good weather there is not enough sunlight it would take even two-to-three days to dry. Onyimbo	Where can materials for such a solar drier be found by a smallscale farmer in Africa? Mimoh	The materials are locally available in the market. So basically we say that they will need to be trained on how to fabricate the driers and how to go about <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drying. So it is not that the material is difficult to get, it is locally available in the market. The netting mesh in fact it is even used for tents. Onyimbo	Are there any nutrients that are lost when drying? Mimoh	In the fruits not really it is only the water that is lost during drying but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutrients are maintained. So it is just as nutritious as the fresh fruit only that it does not have water. When you are drying it is only that you are removing water from it to give it a longer shelf life.

40|$|Multimedia {{which has}} been in {{existence}} for centuries has greatly impacted the world. <b>The</b> popularity <b>of</b> multimedia in our daily lives is due to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> multimedia technologies, among which compression is of crucial importance. Advanced compression techniques can effectively reduce <b>the</b> large amount <b>of</b> raw multimedia data to avoid consuming considerable storage space or transmission bandwidth, thus they {{play an important role in}} multimedia processing systems. Modern multimedia compression systems involve many techniques such that the compression efficiency is highly improved. For example, the block matching motion estimation is widely employed to remove the temporal redundancy between frames hence achieving a good compression. To decode the compressed bitstream, the syntaxes and side information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coding tools need to be precisely transmitted to the receiver side. In current video coding standards, the overhead bits for specifying the tools can use up a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total bits, such as <b>the</b> representations <b>of</b> motion vector (MV) information. The latest video coding standard H. 264 uses a predictive method for <b>the</b> coding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MV, however, the predictor is not always efficient. In this thesis, we propose a more efficient MV coding algorithm. First, several candidates instead of only one in the traditional standard can be selected as the MV predictor, so that the prediction accuracy is improved. Second, to reduce the bits consumed for index sending, some non-effective predictors are excluded by a technique called adaptive template matching. Besides, a guessing strategy is further introduced so that in some situations the bits consumed for index can be totally avoided. Experimental results indicate that this proposed method can achieve a significant bit rate reduction of 8 % on average compared with the H. 264 standard. In multimedia processing systems, lossy compression is often used due to limited network bandwidth and storage capability, especially in networks, high compression ratio is usually expected. Meanwhile, the compressed multimedia signals suffer from a certain degree of distortions, such as blocking artifacts and descent of fidelity. Post-processing is a recommended means to reduce the artifacts introduced by compression and alleviate the conflict between bit rate reduction and quality preservation. In this thesis, we perform a systematic overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-processing problem modeling and different kinds of solutions to help in understanding and researching on this issue. Two methods are proposed to solve this issue in different angles. The first method generates a convex problem to realize post-processing. The objective function includes a gradient expression to eliminate the blocking artifacts, as well as a formula to minimize <b>the</b> statistical distortion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image, based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> quantization error model. Other image properties are also extracted as <b>the</b> constraints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convex problem. Results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the blocking artifacts while preserving a higher fidelity compared with other post-processing schemes. The second method is a novel idea which commits to generate a linear l 2 -norm function to minimize <b>the</b> mean <b>square</b> error <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output <b>frame.</b> It treats <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>frames</b> before deblocking and after deblocking as two noisy observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>frame,</b> and tries to estimate the original one by applying a Wiener filter on the two noisy ones. This method generates an image of more natural subjective behavior and higher objective quality compared with <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>frames</b> without post-processing...|$|R
30|$|The early Stanford DVC {{solution}} {{is characterized by}} frame-based Slepian-Wolf coding, at the beginning using turbo codes and later low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and assumes <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> a feedback channel to perform rate control at the decoder [10]. The DISCOVER codec adopts the same architecture and includes state-of-the-art techniques for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> techniques, such as LDPC codes, advanced (translational) motion-compensated frame interpolation, online estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlation noise model, and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection code [8]. Although all DVC decoder techniques are important to reach the best RD performance, SI creation has a critical impact on the distributed video codec compression efficiency. In the past, several SI creation techniques only using past decoded <b>frames</b> to create <b>the</b> SI have been proposed. In [9], a translational SI creation framework using a regularization criterion for motion estimation, adaptive search range, two block sizes, and a spatial motion vector median filter is proposed. In [11], mesh-based motion estimation and interpolation aims to better represent the motion field, especially for scenes composed by large objects and/or scenes with dominant camera motion. In [12], the motion between the K previously decoded frames (i[*]-[*]K,…, i[*]-[*] 1) is tracked to extrapolate the motion field for frame i using a Kalman filtering approach. In [13], a method called high-order motion interpolation (HOMI) was proposed where the SI is created with two reference <b>frames</b> from <b>the</b> past and two reference <b>frames</b> from <b>the</b> future. The motion trajectory is interpolated using information obtained from four <b>frames</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (typical) two-frame scenario as in the MCFI method, thus allowing <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> more complex motion models, such as non-linear motion models. Bjontegaard delta PSNR (BD-PSNR) improvements of 0.044 to 0.141  dB are achieved {{when compared to the}} usual DISCOVER MCFI approach. In [14], an autoregressive (AR) model is used to generate <b>the</b> SI <b>frames</b> targeting a low-delay DVC scenario. Each SI pixel is calculated as a linear weighted summation of pixels within a window in <b>the</b> previous reconstructed <b>frames.</b> An accurate AR model must be estimated to obtain high-quality SI; in such case, two weighting coefficient sets are computed for each SI block, which allow creating two SI frames which are fused together with a simple extrapolation SI frame according to a probability model. The RD performance results are rather promising when compared to other state-of-the-art motion extrapolation results available in the literature. In [15], a SI creation approach is proposed where the first steps include forward and bidirectional YUV motion estimation algorithms with variable block size. Then, spatial motion smoothing and motion refinement is performed and an adaptive overlapped block motion compensation algorithm is applied to a few selected neighboring motion vectors. The results show up to 0.4 -dB improvements when compared to the DISCOVER MCFI-based method. In [16], an optical flow-based frame interpolation method was proposed and combined with an overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC)-based frame interpolation method. A multihypothesis transform-domain DVC decoder exploits <b>the</b> SI <b>frames</b> interpolated by both schemes with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> a weighted joint distribution obtained from the (individual) correlation noise distribution associated to each SI <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> total variation-L 1 (TV-L 1) norm optical flow algorithm was used to compute two flow fields, the backward and the forward flow, leading to two SI frame estimations which are then combined. This type of approach was also followed in [17] where a dense motion field was computed with pixel-recursive Cafforio-Rocca algorithm adapted to <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> interpolation context. <b>The</b> RD performance improvements are up to 2 % gains over the DISCOVER MCFI scheme. In [18], it is proposed to combine global and local (MCFI-based) motion compensation estimation at the decoder side to improve the SI quality. To create a global motion-compensated (GMC) estimation, Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features are extracted and a global affine motion model is computed at the encoder side. Then, the global affine motion model parameters are transmitted to the decoder to generate the GMC estimation, which is fused with the MCFI estimation, at the block level, to obtain <b>the</b> final SI <b>frame.</b> With <b>the</b> proposed SI creation method, it is possible to systematically outperform the standard H. 264 /AVC Intra and H. 264 /AVC zero motion coding solutions for all the video sequences evaluated. However, despite the RD performance improvements shown, this approach increases the encoding complexity significantly in <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SIFT features, matching, and global motion modeling estimation, which is not desirable in a DVC scenario where low encoder complexity is targeted. Thus, it has become clear that to further improve the SI quality produced by motion-compensated frame interpolation schemes (thus obtaining further compression efficiency gains), more accurate and reliable motion models must be used. A promising approach is to estimate <b>the</b> deformation <b>of</b> objects along time with higher-order motion models that are able to more accurately describe the geometric transformations between reference frames when compared to the simpler translational motion models. With more advanced motion models, it is possible to obtain better predictions in predicted video coding schemes (and lower bitrates for the residual signals) and higher-quality SI frames in distributed video coding scheme (and fewer SI errors to correct with lower bitrates). These motion models allow warping (transforming) a quadrilateral of any size and shape from one reference frame to a block (<b>square)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>frame,</b> thus obtaining a more general representation of camera and object motions, as described next.|$|R
