5|$|On 28 January 2013, Drogba {{agreed to}} a one-and-a-half-year deal with Süper Lig team Galatasaray. He would earn a <b>sign-on</b> fee of €4 million plus basic wage of €4 million per season, €2 million for the {{remaining}} 2012–13 Süper Lig) and €15,000 per match. However, on 30 January 2013, Shenhua released a press release that Drogba would unilaterally breach his contract {{if he were to}} join Galatasaray.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{executive}} Alan H. Fishman {{received a}} $7.5million <b>sign-on</b> bonus and cash severance of $11.6million after being CEO for 17 days.|$|E
25|$|The bathhouse was {{constructed}} in 1910. The building also served {{as the home of}} Calumet-based television station WBKP from its <b>sign-on</b> in 1996 until it moved from the area in 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sign-ons,</b> like sign-offs, {{vary from}} country to country, from station to station, {{and from time to}} time; however, most follow a similar general pattern. Many {{stations}} follow the reverse process to their sign-off sequence {{at the close of the}} day. It is common for <b>sign-ons</b> to be followed by a network's early morning newscast, or their morning or breakfast show.|$|R
5000|$|WLS-TV {{had claimed}} to be [...] "Chicago's first {{television}} station" [...] in its <b>sign-ons</b> and sign-offs during for its first three decades(implying a connection with the original WBKB on channel 4), but admitted to its true roots with WENR with its 30th anniversary in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Gary {{was one of}} {{the main}} announcers for the long-running radio program, The Eternal Light. His other radio announcing credits {{included}} Dimension X, The Bill Stern Colgate Sports Newsreel, and Author Meets the Critics. He also announced for various NBC television programs over the years, and handled program introductions and closes, station identifications, promos, bumpers, teasers, taglines, public service announcements, <b>sign-ons</b> and sign-offs for both the network and its New York owned-and-operated station, WNBC-TV.|$|R
25|$|On March 21, 2009, WTVJ {{celebrated its}} 60th anniversary and aired a half-hour special called WTVJ: The First 60 Years, which {{highlighted}} the station's history since its March 21, 1949 <b>sign-on.</b>|$|E
25|$|National radio {{stations}} generally play {{a version of}} the national anthem at morning <b>sign-on.</b> Most feature a recording of Price singing the anthem at piano in a faster tempo than usual or an instrumental version.|$|E
25|$|Networks in Canada took {{corporate}} branding to its logical conclusion; references to local call signs and channel numbers have almost completely been {{eliminated from the}} O except during station <b>sign-on</b> and sign-off sequences (although some O may occasionally refer to their channel numbers in passing).|$|E
50|$|Both {{of these}} {{stations}} were {{founded by the}} Central Minnesota Television Company and maintained primary affiliations with NBC and secondary affiliations with ABC from their respective <b>sign-ons</b> until the summer of 1982, when both stations switched to CBS. KCMT had originally broadcast from a studio in Alexandria, with KNMT operating as a satellite station of KCMT. Central Minnesota Television sold both stations to Midwest Radio and Television in 1987, at which point they adopted their present call letters and became semi-satellites of WCCO-TV.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{licensed}} by the CRTC in 2001 to broadcast a Rhythmic CHR/dance format known as [...] "The Planet 89.9". The station launched on February 7, 2003 as [...] "The New Hot 89.9" [...] under a rhythmic CHR format, but flipped to its current format after 105.3 Kiss FM signed {{on the air in}} 2004. Both CIHT and CHBN-FM in Edmonton share the distinction of having been shifted from rhythmic top 40 to Top 40 {{in less than a year}} after their 2003 <b>sign-ons.</b>|$|R
50|$|After a {{flood of}} {{television}} license applications, the FCC froze the application process for new applicants in 1948, due to concerns over station interference. At the time, {{there were only a}} few dozen stations operating at the end of the decade, concentrated in many (but not all) major cities. The FCC began handing out broadcasting licenses to communities of all sizes in the early 1950s (with the highest concentration of license grants and station <b>sign-ons</b> occurring between 1953 and 1956), spurring an explosion of growth in the medium.|$|R
25|$|Before joining The CW, WTVW was the market's Fox {{affiliate}} from December 3, 1995 to June 30, 2011 (serving as {{an independent}} station after disaffiliating from the network until January 30, 2013); before that, it served as Evansville's original ABC affiliate from its August 21, 1956 <b>sign-on</b> to December 2, 1995.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{performance}} benefit, resumed sessions {{can also be}} used for single <b>sign-on,</b> as it guarantees that both the original session and any resumed session originate from the same client. This is of particular importance for the FTP over TLS/SSL protocol, which would otherwise suffer from a man-in-the-middle attack in which an attacker could intercept the contents of the secondary data connections.|$|E
25|$|Channel 16 first {{signed on}} the air on March 7, 2013, {{concurrent}} with the change of K16KF-D's callsign to KBJO-LD (adapted from the predecessor cable channel's branding). Concurrent with KBJO's <b>sign-on,</b> KNPN-LD dropped CW programming from its second subchannel. Low-powered television stations are exempt from the must-carry and retransmission consent regulations that full-powered stations enjoy, meaning that its carriage on other area cable systems besides Suddenlink, and satellite providers is not guaranteed.|$|E
5000|$|KUSW, {{which was}} also branded [...] "The Superpower", officially {{launched}} on December 26, 1987 during the peak years of the American commercial shortwave broadcasting boom triggered by the founding of WRNO Worldwide. Owned by Carlson Communications International, which owned a network of AM and FM stations in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona, KUSW broadcast a combination of news and rock music. The station also offered a mail-order catalog of products made in the Rocky Mountains. The station's [...] "theme song", used as an interval signal for <b>sign-ons,</b> sign-offs, and to signal frequency changes, was [...] "Telegraph Road" [...] by Dire Straits.|$|R
5000|$|A prayer {{or other}} {{religious}} acknowledgement, particularly {{in countries with}} a state religion, in theocracies, and on religious broadcasters. For example, <b>sign-ons</b> in Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand typically include a quote from Gautama Buddha, those in Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia generally include an Islamic reading from the Quran, a Muslim quote, or a call for Azan and Fajr prayer, those in the Philippines (except in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao), Italy, Russia, Canada and the United States include a Christian prayer, responsorial psalm or hymn of some type and stations in India and China have a prayer of any religion depending on the day.|$|R
50|$|At 12:00 am on February 18, 2009, WSRE's analog transmitters, {{which were}} {{located at the}} main campus of then-Pensacola Junior College, were turned off permanently. WSRE ceased analog {{transmissions}} on the original DTV transition date, even after that date was pushed back to mid-June. The analog close down was marked with a special retrospective, featuring portions of the previous WSRE sign-offs and <b>sign-ons,</b> an explanation of sign-offs, vintage studio photos and a final farewell; the special was broadcast on both analog and digital signals. After the analog signal closed, the digital transmission (broadcasting from a facility shared with other stations in Robertsdale) went to color bars, and signed back on a couple hours later.|$|R
25|$|On March 31, 2014, adult swim re-branded their bumpers. From 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (ET/PT), the bumpers include {{live action}} pans of landscapes, signs, objects, and animals with the Adult Swim logo {{embossed}} in them, sometimes hidden. Also the advisory <b>sign-on</b> bumper {{has changed from}} the traditional black and white bumper to a live shot as well, these indents are reminiscent of the AcTN/Tokyo photoshoot bumpers that were used from 2005 to 2010.|$|E
25|$|Also on March 31, 2014, Adult Swim's <b>sign-on</b> {{time was}} moved to 8:00 p.m. ET, further {{extending}} the network's daily schedule to ten hours and effectively matching the airtime of most nights that Nick at Nite has. Sometimes, Cartoon Network takes the 8:00 p.m. ET hour back, making Adult Swim start at 9:00 p.m. ET again. This has happened two times since 2014, from October 26 to November 29, 2015 and September 26, 2016 to December 5, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Channel 7 was {{the fourth}} of ABC's five {{original}} owned-and-operated stations to <b>sign-on,</b> after outlets in New York City, Chicago and Detroit, and before Los Angeles. In addition, {{it is the only}} ABC station to keep its original call letters, which were inherited from KGO radio (810 AM). In addition to airing ABC programming, KGO-TV also aired syndicated programs from the Paramount Television Network; among the Paramount programs aired were Time For Beany, Hollywood Reel, Sandy Dreams, Hollywood Wrestling, and Cowboy G-Men.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at <b>sign-ons</b> and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but that use of the anthem has declined somewhat {{by the emergence of}} 24-hour TV channels and radio stations. Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; while all of its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the abridged version of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which plays it at 5:00 am as a way of protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|R
50|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air on April 5, 1970, as an {{independent}} station; it is currently the third-oldest commercial television station on the UHF band in the Chicago market (behind WCIU-TV (channel 26), which signed on in February 1964; and WFLD (channel 32), which signed on in January 1966). WSNS was originally owned by a consortium of investors including Harriscope Broadcasting (which owned a 50% interest) and the Essaness Television Corporation, from which the station's call letters are derived. The station's transmitter and studio facilities were located on the 97th floor of the John Hancock Center on North Michigan Avenue in the Streeterville neighborhood. The station never disclosed its ownership, in any of WSNS' formats, during regular <b>sign-ons</b> or sign-offs.|$|R
50|$|Both sign-offs and <b>sign-ons</b> {{have become}} less {{common with the}} {{increasing}} prevalence of twenty-four hours a day, {{seven days a week}} broadcasting. They are, however, still conducted by a number of stations around the world, often by stations catering to small-markets or those in less developed countries, or when stations need to shut down for transmitter maintenance. Another consideration for whether providers shutdown is power consumption; aerial signals, such as those for UHF analog TV transmissions, can require tens of thousands of watts of power, making electricity a major expense, while power consumption would usually be considerably lower for cable and satellite providers. In relation to costs, viewer numbers are also a consideration. Another consideration is the licence issued by the government which indicates when their transmitters can be operated.|$|R
25|$|Bill Cardille {{signed the}} {{station on the}} air. In {{addition}} to Cardille, five other announcers that were with the station when it launched in 1957 include Mal Alberts, Bob Cochran, Ed Conway, Len Johnson and Mark Schaefer. Some of the first original programming to air on WIIC included Studio Wrestling and Chiller Theatre, both hosted by Cardille. Shortly after its <b>sign-on,</b> WIIC was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network, sharing the affiliation with KDKA-TV, WTAE-TV, and public television station WQED.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} founded by the Roosevelt family, owners of the Texas State Network (now owned by the station's present-day {{corporate}} sister subsidiary CBS Radio), who were also the owners of KFJZ radio (1270 AM, now KFLC; unrelated to the present-day KFJZ at 870 AM). Originally, Channel 11 maintained a 9½-hour per day programming schedule, starting with its <b>sign-on</b> at 2:30p.m. and concluding at its midnight sign-off. The station originally operated from facilities at 4801 West Freeway (in the present-day location of Interstate 30) in Fort Worth.|$|E
25|$|The current {{incarnation}} of channel 27 signed {{on the air}} on March 10, 1986 as WVFT, a Christian-oriented independent station that was originally owned by Roanoke Christian Television. Initially, the station ran only religious programming; soon after its <b>sign-on,</b> the station was sold to Family Group Television. Beginning that fall, the station began transitioning towards a general entertainment programming format; by 1987, WVFT had become a conventional independent station. The station originally operated from studio facilities located on Colonial Avenue Southwest (along I-581/U.S. 220) in Roanoke's Franklin-Colonial section.|$|E
50|$|Radio-Québec began {{broadcasting}} {{on its own}} in 1972 as a cable channel, which broadcast evenings {{on community}} channels in Montréal and Quebec City, then expanded in 1973 to Hull, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. As a cable network, Radio-Québec was generally on the air weeknights from 8 pm to 10 pm. The network of over-the-air transmitters was launched on January 19, 1975 with the <b>sign-ons</b> of CIVM-TV in Montreal and CIVQ-TV in Quebec City, making its programming available to an even wider audience. In its early days after the terrestrial network began, Radio-Québec would provide week-delay videotapes of its programming line-up to cable systems in communities not served by a Radio-Québec station. Some Radio-Québec programs were also seen on most Radio-Canada stations, not only in Quebec, but throughout Canada as well; this arrangement continued into the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} eventually {{adopted a}} regulation, which took effect on December 1, 1921, requiring that persons wanting to transmit entertainment {{to the general}} public had to obtain a Limited Commercial license. Thus, on December 9, 1921, a license with the randomly assigned callsign of KQW was issued in the name of Charles D. Herrold in San Jose. Operation of the broadcasting station was financed by sales of radio equipment by the Herrold Radio Laboratory, but by 1925 the costs for KQW had grown burdensome, and the station was transferred to the First Baptist Church of San Jose. Two conditions of the reassignment were that Herrold be kept on as program director, and the station's <b>sign-ons</b> include the statement: [...] "This is KQW, pioneer broadcasting station of the world, founded by Dr. Charles D. Herrold in San Jose in 1909".|$|R
50|$|In Thailand, Channel 3 used to air an {{analogue}} clock ident before {{news program}} in 1986-1995 after Channel 3 cancelled joint news program with Channel 9, and in sign-off sequences {{before it became}} 24 hours in 2002, but during TV3 had temporary closedown in May 2010, TV3 did not use clock idents. Between the 1990s and 2009, Channel 3 air digital clock video counting up to 8 am and 6 pm for the national anthem. Channel 7 used clock idents in the 1990s, and again between January and February 2010 before becoming 24 hours broadcasting on 1 March 2010. Channel 11 used digital clock idents in <b>sign-ons</b> before becoming 24-hour broadcasting on 1 April 2008. Thai PBS used clock idents in 2016 Before Breakfast Program. Channel 5 and Modernine TV are not known to use clock idents. Voice TV using digital clock counting down for 5 seconds before morning edition of Voice News that replaced Wake Up Thailand in 2014.|$|R
25|$|As of 2012, seven radio {{stations}} broadcast from Salem, including three commercial AM stations, three non-commercial FM stations, {{and a community}} radio station. KBZY was a popular Top 40 station from its <b>sign-on</b> in 1957 through the 1960s and 1970s. Today KBZY has an oldies format, and continues to use live and local personalities. KBZY is affiliated with the ABC Radio Network. KYKN carries syndicated conservative talk hosts. KWOD is a Spanish language sports talk station. KPJC features Christian talk programming. KWBX is a non-commercial station licensed to Corban University with a Contemporary Christian format. KMUZ, established in 2012, is a non-commercial community radio station carrying locally produced content in a variety format.|$|E
25|$|When Rangers bought striker Marco Negri in {{the summer}} 1997, Andersen left the club shortly thereafter. He scored 15 goals in 23 league games for the club. A number of clubs were {{interested}} in Andersen, but the transfer fee demands of Rangers proved too high, and Andersen had to rescind the <b>sign-on</b> fee of £300,000 Rangers still owed him from the Aalborg BK transfer, before an offer was accepted. He later regretted having caved in to Rangers, claiming he should have played hard-ball {{in order to get}} the money owed to him, inspired by the approach of Peter Møller. During pre-season training Paul Gascoigne had urinated on Andersen. Team-mate Lorenzo Amoruso was surprised that the Dane responded with meek acceptance.|$|E
25|$|Channel 11, however, did {{not sign}} on {{for well over}} two years after its permit was granted. The primary reason for the delay was {{on the part of}} WENS-TV (channel 16, now WINP-TV), whose {{application}} for the permit had been denied and later contested the FCC's original decision. In the interim, CBS continued to have most of its programs cleared by Westinghouse-owned KDKA-TV (channel 2), at the time Pittsburgh's only commercial VHF station. When CBS decided to make KDKA-TV its full-time Pittsburgh affiliate, NBC (who shared time on KDKA-TV with CBS, ABC, and station founder DuMont since its <b>sign-on</b> in 1949) reached a deal to affiliate with WIIC. Also, as a condition of the license grant, WJAS radio had to be sold; NBC wound up purchasing that station in August 1957. The WJAS interests later divested their 50 percent share of WIIC to another local broadcaster.|$|E
50|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air at 6:00 p.m. on April 12, 1953; {{it was the third}} {{television}} station to sign on in the Wichita Falls-Lawton market, launching one month after the <b>sign-ons</b> of its two principal competitors: CBS affiliate KWFT-TV (channel 6, now KAUZ-TV), which debuted on March 1, and Lawton-based ABC affiliate KSWO-TV (channel 7), which had signed on March 8. The station was originally owned by Wichitex Radio and Television, a locally based company managed under the direction of Darrell A. Cannan, Sr. and Howard Fry, which also owned local radio station KFDX (990 AM, now Farmersville-licensed KFCD), which the company had signed on from Wichita Falls in 1947. The station originally employed a staff of 30 people, which at the time, was the largest staff of any broadcast television and radio station in west Texas; the majority of stock held in Wichitex was owned by members of the station's staff.|$|R
50|$|FM radio, {{which was}} the {{successor}} to the failed Apex band (also known as ultra-shortwave) experiments of the 1930s, arrived in the United States after 1945, {{but it was not}} until the 1960s that it became widely popular. In 1945 the Federal Communication Commission shifted FM's allocation of frequencies from 42-50 MHZ to 88-108 MHZ. This allowed FM much more room for growth when listeners arrived after 1960. The FCC later decided to reduce program duplication on AM and FM sister stations, giving the younger medium space to grow. The better sound fidelity of FM, the less static, dated a natural for musical programming. The first FM stations were primarily instrumental, featuring formats that would come to be known as easy listening and beautiful music, and were targeted at shopping centers. Other, later FM <b>sign-ons</b> became known for experimentation; the early freeform stations eventually evolved into progressive rock, the first radio format designed specifically to showcase rock music. From progressive rock came album-oriented rock, which in turn spawned the modern formats of classic rock, active rock and adult album alternative.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{scalability}} study of AAA support in mobile heterogeneous access networks with respect to server and network load related to AAA processes using the RADIUS protocol. Technologies such as IEEE 802. 11, CDMA 2000 and UMTS which all support the RADIUS protocol for AAA handling are discussed and analyzed. Typical performance data are gathered and complemented with a theoretical study {{in order to achieve}} an overview of what parameters will affect the performance and scalability of the network. Also, guidelines are developed for network design in order to achieve the desired performance for a given number of users. Results of this study include the conclusion that the main bottleneck of the AAA procedure is not necessarily the AAA server CPU power. Aside the cases with a high proportion of computationally intensive WiFi <b>sign-ons</b> with strong encryption, performance issues may be caused by AAA server network connection bandwidth, and RAM memory. In cases where a high number of users reside in the same user database, database performance becomes a significant issue. In order to achieve better performance, CPU load balancing over several servers may be performed. Godkänd; 2011; 20111129 (dangra...|$|R
