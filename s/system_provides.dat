Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character can engage in trade. The player character's primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> an {{extensive}} network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This is {{partly because of the}} grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E

Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance.

5|$|Electricity {{generation}} in Flagstaff {{is provided by}} Arizona Public Service, an electric utility subsidiary operated by parent company Pinnacle West. The primary generating station near Flagstaff is the coal-fired, 995-MW Cholla Power Plant, near Holbrook, Arizona, which uses coal from the McKinley Mine in New Mexico. Located near Page, Arizona is the coal-fired, 750-MW Navajo Power Plant, supplied by an electric railroad that delivers coal from a mine on the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northern Arizona. Flagstaff {{is also home to}} Arizona's first commercial solar power generating station, which was built in 1997 and provides 87kW of electricity. Combined with 16 other solar power locations in Arizona, the <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> over 5MW of electricity statewide.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|MAGIC, JAL's {{in-flight}} entertainment system, {{supported by}} the JAL Entertainment Network (now renamed as JAL Mooove!), features the latest hit movies and videos, games and audio programs. There are six generations of the MAGIC system: MAGIC-I, MAGIC-II, MAGIC-III, MAGIC-IV, MAGIC-V and the new MAGIC-VI". Introduced on 1 December 2007, the MAGIC-III <b>system</b> <b>provides</b> Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) entertainment to all passengers. The number of movie, music, video and game channels on MAGIC-III was doubled from 57 to 130 by 2008; and it is installed on all seats on Boeing 767-300ER, 777-200ER and 777-300ER aircraft. Aircraft with MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II have movies that automatically start when the AVOD system is turned on‚Äîonce the aircraft reaches cruise level‚Äîand economy class passengers can tune in to watch the movie in progress; and all movies restart upon completion. Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control. MAGIC systems also have JAL's duty-free shopping catalogue, including flight crew recommendations and a video of specials available on the flight. MAGIC-V will feature mostly the same entertainment as MAGIC-III, but with a touch screen controller, along with a handset. There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset. (introduced on selected Boeing 767-300ER routes).|$|E
