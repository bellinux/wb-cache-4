40|$|Abstract — Airbag {{deployment}} {{has been}} known to be responsible for huge death, incidental injuries and broken bones due to low crash severity and wrong deployment decisions. Therefore, the authorities and industries have been looking for more innovative and intelligent products to be realized for future enhancements in the vehicle safety systems (VSSs). Although the VSSs technologies have advanced considerably, they still face challenges such as how to avoid unnecessary and untimely airbag deployments that can be hazardous and fatal. Currently, most of the existing <b>airbag</b> <b>systems</b> deploy without regard to occupant size and position. As such, this paper will focus on the occupant and crash sensing performances due to frontal collisions for the new breed of so called <b>smart</b> <b>airbag</b> <b>systems.</b> It intends to provide a thorough discussion relating to the occupancy detection, occupant size classification, occupant off-position detection to determine safe distance zone for airbag deployment, crash-severity analysis and airbag decision algorithms via a computer modeling. The proposed system model consists of three main modules namely, occupant sensing, crash severity analysis and decision fusion. The occupant sensing system module utilizes the weight sensor to determine occupancy, classify the occupant size, and determine occupant off-position condition to compute safe distance for airbag deployment. The crash severity analysis module is used to generate relevant information pertinent to airbag deployment decision. Outputs from these two modules are fused to the decision module for correct and efficient airbag deployment action. Computer modeling work is carried out using Simulink, Stateflow, SimMechanics and Virtual Reality toolboxes.

A Micro Inertial Measurement Unit (µIMU) that is 66 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm in size is built. This unit consists of three dimensional MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes, MCU, and a Bluetooth module. It records human motion information, and, with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) training process, {{it can be used to}} classify falls and other normal motions successfully with an SVM filter. Based on the SVM filter, an embedded DSP (Digital Signal Processing) system is developed for real-time fall detection. Also, a <b>smart</b> mechanical <b>airbag</b> deployment <b>system</b> is finalized. This system weighs 253. 5 grams (including a 42. 5 g compressed CO 2 cylinder) with dimensions of 190 mm length, 57 mm width and 30 mm height. The response time of the mechanical trigger is 0. 133 seconds, which has been proven in our lab to allow enough time for compressed air release before a person falls down to the ground.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{classifying}} automotive vehicle occupants and estimating their position. This information is critical in designing future <b>smart</b> <b>airbag</b> <b>systems</b> providing maximum protection for passengers. According to the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), since 1990, in the USA, 227 deaths have been attributed to airbags deployed in low-speed crashes which included 119 children, and 22 infants. In these cases, intelligent deployment of the airbag, based on the type and position of occupant could have avoided these fatalities. Current commercial classification systems based on traditional sensors, such as pressure sensors are not able to detect the position of occupants. Vision-based systems are advantageous over pressure sensor based systems, as they can provide additional functionalities like dynamic occupant position analysis or child seat orientation detection. On the other hand, vision-based systems have to cope with several challenges, such as, illumination conditions, temperature, humidity, large variation of scenes, cost, and computational aspects. This thesis presents new pattern recognition techniques for classifying, localizing and tracking vehicle occupants using a low-resolution 3 -D optical time-of-flight range camera. This sensor is capable of providing directly a dense range image, independent of the illumination conditions and object textures. Based on this technology, IEE S. A. is presently developing a camera system for the application of occupant classification. A prototype of this camera has been the basis for this study. The first part of the thesis presents the problem of occupant classification. Herein, we investigate geometric feature extraction methods to discriminate between different occupant types. We develop features that are invariant under rotation and translation. A method for reducing the size of the feature set is analyzed with emphasis on robustness and low computational complexity while maintaining highly discriminative information. In addition, several classification methods are studied including Bayes quadratic classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier and polynomial classifier. We propose the use of a cluster based linear regression classifier using a polynomial kernel which is particularly well suited to coping with large variations within each class. Full scale experiments have been conducted which demonstrate that a classification reliability of almost 100 % can be achieved with the reduced feature set in combination with a cluster based classifier. In this safety critical application, it is equally important {{to address the problem of}} reliability estimation for the system. State-of-the-art methods to estimate the reliability of the classification are based either on classification output or based on density estimation. The second part of the thesis treats estimation of the reliability of the pattern classification system. Herein, a novel reliability measure is proposed for classification output which takes into account the local density of training data. Experiments verify that this reliability measure outperforms state-of-the-art methods in many cases. Lastly, the problem of dynamically detecting out-of-position occupants is addressed in the third part of the thesis. This task requires detecting and localizing the position of the occupant's head. Traditional head detection methods, such as detecting head-like objects in the image by analyzing the local shapes are not robust with the current sensor. Many regions in a scene such as the shoulder or the elbow of the occupant can be incorrectly detected as the head. In order to cope with these challenges, we exploit topology information in the range image. A modified Reeb graph technique has been developed that extracts a topological skeleton of the 3 D contour that is invariant under rotation and translations. Results verify that the Reeb graph detects successfully the head i. e., the head always corresponds to one of the end points of the skeleton. Subsequently, a data association algorithm to select the correct head candidate out of the Reeb graph candidates is presented. Results show that the resulting head detection algorithm based on Reeb graphs is robust under scene changes. QC 2010071...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the effectiveness of a passenger airbag can be increased by making the passenger airbag adaptive to crash conditions, such as severity and type of impact, belt use, and passenger size. Such an adaptive passenger airbag will better cover a wider range of crash situations than a conventional <b>airbag</b> <b>system.</b> In this study, mathematical modeling was performed for the optimization of an existing passenger <b>airbag</b> restraint <b>system.</b> The final solution can be used as reference for the design of an adaptive <b>airbag</b> <b>system.</b> The present study was divided into four steps: (1) a FEM airbag model was developed by using the MADYMO 3 D program based on an existing prototype of a passenger airbag; (2) the airbag model was validated against airbag static deployment tests, airbag drop tests, and sled tests; (3) the performance of passenger <b>airbag</b> <b>systems</b> of different volumes was evaluated in terms of injury criteria for front seat occupants of different sizes; (4) a parameter study with different impact conditions and varying levels of variables was carried out to find an optimized design of an adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> restraint <b>system.</b> Three variables selected for passenger airbag optimization are the airbag volume, the bag pressure, and the size of the ventilation hole. Four input factors that varied in different crash conditions are the dummy size, belted/unbelted, impact speed, and rigid/deformable barrier. The HIC, chest acceleration, chest deflection, neck moment, and axial femur force were calculated in each simulation. The effectiveness of the passenger airbag models was evaluated in terms of the injury criteria of FMVSS 208 and other relevant injury parameters. The influence of the airbag variables on the dummy response was analyzed and discussed. The size of the ventilation hole was found to have the dominating influence on the performance of the airbag. The best effect of the passenger <b>airbag</b> <b>system</b> could be obtained either by using a small airbag with high initial pressure or by using a big airbag with low initial pressure. The findings in the present study indicate that a midsize volume (120 -liter) airbag with variable venthole can give front seat occupants of different sizes better protection over a range of crash severities than a conventional big (150 -liter) airbag with only one size of venthole. The results from this study can be used for the development of a future adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} that a system analysis tool to assess social impacts is urgently needed. Social {{life cycle assessment}} (S-LCA), which is inspired by the more well-known environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), has been suggested by some scholars. The thesis presents a specific S-LCA methodology to assess a driver <b>airbag</b> <b>system</b> made by the company Autoliv. The goal is {{to see whether the}} main objective of the driver <b>airbag</b> <b>system,</b> which is to save lives and prevent severe injuries, is justified. In order to compare this in a reasonable way, the thesis applies the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) indicator to compare life years saved by a driver <b>airbag</b> <b>system</b> with life years lost during its life cycle. Moreover, how to convert a variety of life cycle inventory data to the DALYs indicator is also discussed. The finals results show that the main objective of an Autoliv driver <b>airbag</b> <b>system</b> seem to be justified because the number of life years saved is larger than the number of life years lost. However, the dioxin emissions during the production of the screw components and the resistor components should be paid attention to, though the dioxin emission is not unique for the two components suppliers of Autoliv. Furthermore, after applying the UNEP/SETAC framework, it reveals that except for the prioritization suggestion and the four general steps included in both E-LCA and S-LCA, i. e. goal and scope, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment, and results and interpretation, the UNEP/SETAC framework could not guide much for the case study...|$|R
