He agreed and spent several months at Langley, Virginia, where he wrote a paper entitled [...] "Agents and Agencies", in which he maintained that state-sponsored terrorism is an act of war. He also invented the canary trap, a method for exposing an information leak, which involves giving different versions of a <b>sensitive</b> <b>document</b> to each of a group of suspects and seeing which version is leaked. By ensuring that each copy of the document differs slightly in its wording, if any copy is leaked, then it is possible to determine the informant's identity.|$|E

In this paper, we present an auditing model to secure text document access. Given a sensitive docu- ment, we compute the candidate suspicious keyword queries that may have accessed the <b>sensitive</b> <b>document.</b> Our auditing model allows users to specify either the full document or some specific portion of the document as sensitive. All queries that have accessed a <b>sensitive</b> <b>document</b> may not lead to disclosure of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>document,</b> some of them might be very regular accesses. We present an outlier mining based algorithm to find top-k anomalous queries from candidate suspicious queries. Data security and privacy is an issue of growing importance in healthcare domain. Query auditing is often used in healthcare domain to detect privacy violation. However, as unstructured healthcare data, such as medical reports, etc., are not easily available for public research. In this paper, we show how one can use the publically available DBLP data to create an equivalent healthcare data, which can be used for experimental evaluation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{directed}} acyclic graphical structure called concept network (CNW) for context <b>sensitive</b> <b>document</b> representation for use in information filtering. Nodes of CNW represent concepts and links represent the relationships between the concepts. A concept can either be a phrase or a topic of discourse, or a mode of discourse. An important feature of the CNW based scheme (CNWBS) is context filters [Murthy and Keerthi, 1999] which are employed on the links of the graph to enable context sensitive analysis and representation of documents. Context filters are intended to filter the noise in the inputs of the concepts based on the context of appearance of their inputs. The CNWBS automatically finds the paragraphs related to all concepts in the document. It also provides good comprehensibility in representation; allows sharing of CNW among a group of users; and, reduces the credit-assignment problem during its construction.

40|$|As mobile {{computing}} devices {{are becoming increasingly}} dominant in enterprise and government organizations, the need for fine-grained access control in these environments continues to grow. Specifically, advanced forms of access control can be deployed to ensure authorized users can access sensitive resources only when in trusted locations. One technique that has been proposed is to augment role-based access control (RBAC) with spatial constraints. In such a system, an authorized user must be in a designated location in order to exercise the privileges associated with a role. In this work, we extend spatially aware RBAC systems by defining the notion of proximity-based r approach, access control decisions are not {{based solely on the}} requesting user’s location. Instead, we also consider the location of other users in the system. For instance, a policy in a government application could prevent access to a <b>sensitive</b> <b>document</b> if any civilians are present. We introduce our spatial model and the notion of proximity constraints. We define the syntax and semantics for the Prox-RBAC language, which can be used to specify these policy constraints. We introduce our enforcement architecture, including the protocols and algorithms for enforcing Prox-RBAC policies, and give a proof of functional correctness. Finally, we describe our work toward a Prox-RBAC prototype and present an informal security analysis...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{stemming}} {{has been}} applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms. Although it increases recall, this naive strategy does not work well for Web Search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation. In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues. Two unique properties make our approach feasible for Web Search. First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context sensitive analysis on the query side. We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine. This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time. Second, our approach performs a context <b>sensitive</b> <b>document</b> matching for those expanded variants. This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming, and {{it turns out to be}} very important for improving precision. Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29 % of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG 5) by 6. 1 % on these queries and 1. 8 % over all query traffic...|$|E
40|$|Toward <b>{{sensitive}}</b> <b>document</b> release with privacy guaranteesDOI: 10. 1016 /j. engappai. 2016. 12. 013 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SI Inclòs a la memòria: SIPrivacy {{has become}} a serious concern for modern Information Societies. The sensitive nature {{of much of the}} data that are daily exchanged or released to untrusted parties requires that responsible organizations undertake appropriate privacy protection measures. Nowadays, much of these data are texts (e. g., emails, messages posted in social media, healthcare outcomes, etc.) that, because of their unstructured and semantic nature, constitute a challenge for automatic data protection methods. In fact, textual documents are usually protected manually, in a process known as document redaction or sanitization. To do so, human experts identify sensitive terms (i. e., terms that may reveal identities and/or confidential information) and protect them accordingly (e. g., via removal or, preferably, generalization). To relieve experts from this burdensome task, in a previous work we introduced the theoretical basis of C-sanitization, an inherently semantic privacy model that provides the basis to the development of automatic document redaction/sanitization algorithms and offers clear and a priori privacy guarantees on data protection; even though its potential benefits C-sanitization still presents some limitations when applied to practice (mainly regarding flexibility, efficiency and accuracy). In this paper, we propose a new more flexible model, named (C, g(C)) -sanitization, which enables an intuitive configuration of the trade-off between the desired level of protection (i. e., controlled information disclosure) and the preservation of the utility of the protected data (i. e., amount of semantics to be preserved). Moreover, we also present a set of technical solutions and algorithms that provide an efficient and scalable implementation of the model and improve its practical accurac...|$|E

In this paper we introduce the concept and technique of structure encryption for XML. Structure encryption is basically encrypting the structure of XML (i. e. how elements are nested in XML). Fundamentally, it is hiding the structure of an XML document in addition to hiding the element values. Structure encryption {{may be used for}} two different purposes. One purpose is for increasing the difficulty of the decryption of very <b>sensitive</b> <b>documents.</b> One needs to decrypt the structure also.
