5|$|Stevens {{was twice}} named the Horizon League Coach of the Year and won collegeinsider.com's Hugh Durham Award mid-season honors in January 2009. He also {{was both a}} Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award finalist all three years of his career. Stevens {{has been called a}} {{coaching}} prodigy and compared to John Wooden. He is married with two young children. In July 2013, he signed a six-year, 22-million-dollar contract to become the head coach of the Boston Celtics in the NBA. In April 2015, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA Playoffs as the 7th <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record. In April 2016, Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the 2016 NBA Playoffs finishing the season with a 48–34 record. On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension. In the 2016–17 season, Stevens' team finished with a laudable 53–29 record. It earned them the Atlantic Division title and placed them as the best overall team in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics then entered post-season play as the number one <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> their conference. Both the division title as well as the number one seeding are bests thus far for the Stevens' led Celtics' teams.|$|E
5|$|The Mavericks {{finished}} {{the regular season}} as the No. 7 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Western Conference {{with a record of}} 50–32. They faced the Houston Rockets {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and lost the series in five games.|$|E

After Anthony and Smith returned from their suspensions, the trio led the Nuggets to 45 wins and the sixth <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Western Conference for the playoffs. However, they were eliminated in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs. The Knicks finished 33–49, 12th in the Eastern Conference, and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence <b>seed)</b> <b>in</b> the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E
5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> {{response to}} bushfire, {{it is important}} that fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E

5000|$|One-third (193/565) of {{the round}} F1 seeds {{produced}} only round <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the F3 generation, but two-thirds (372/565) of them produced both types of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the F3 and—once again—in a 3:1 ratio.|$|R
5|$|Butler {{ended the}} regular season with a 27–3 record, taking {{first place in the}} Horizon League with a 16–2 in conference mark.

The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79-78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into {{the last week of}} the regular season (their first #1 ranking {{since the start of the}} 1987–88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85-65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112-67), #4-seed Arkansas (80-74) and #2-seed Cincinnati (75-68) to reach the Final Four in New Orleans.|$|E
