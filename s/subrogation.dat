5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through <b>subrogation</b> to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{will pay}} a premium (usually annually) {{in exchange for the}} bonding company's financial strength to extend surety credit. In the event of a claim, the surety will investigate it. If {{it turns out to be}} a valid claim, the surety {{will pay a}}nd then turn to the principal for reimbursement of the amount paid on the claim and any legal fees incurred. In some cases, the principal has a cause of action against another party for the principal's loss, and the surety will have a right of <b>subrogation</b> [...] "step into the shoes of" [...] the principal and recover damages to make up for the payment to the principal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor Roy Goode in the Law Quarterly Review. [...] Goode {{argued that the}} case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked express authority to pay on the cheque, it had implied authority; secondly, that the payee had changed their position and so {{should have had a}} good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of <b>subrogation.</b> [...] Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution, or on banking law.|$|E
2500|$|When {{trust assets}} are {{mixed up with}} {{property}} of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate, a solicitor sold £2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and {{put the money in}} his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of £3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary [...] "cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money". Again, in Re Oatway, a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When trust assets are mixed up with money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this [...] "first in, first out" [...] rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' managed fund portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a collective investment scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a [...] "rolling pari passu" [...] system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through <b>subrogation,</b> or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are [...] "swollen". In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan, however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose overdrawn accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an overdrawn account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is [...] "a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund." ...|$|E

5000|$|ERISA Reimbursement is the {{terminology}} utilized to describe an ERISA Plan’s effort {{to require that}} it be paid back for medical bills expended {{on behalf of a}} Participant or Beneficiary of the ERISA Plan. The concept of “reimbursement” {{can be traced to the}} traditional doctrine of “Subrogation,” but it exists today without the traditional safeguards established in the development of the law concerning <b>subrogation.</b> When an insurer pays a claim to an insured, the insurer generally has the right to “step in the shoes” of the insured for the purpose of recapturing that money by pursuing a claim against the tortfeasor who may be liable for the loss. [...] An ERISA plan’s “right of reimbursement” is essentially a <b>subrogation</b> claim. Although there are subtle legal distinctions between “subrogation” and “reimbursement,” these devices are essentially the same.Unfortunately, there is little or no oversight on the ability of ERISA Plans (and their insurers) to pursue reimbursement claims. Historically, <b>subrogation</b> actions were limited at common law to matters involving property damage claims, with <b>subrogation</b> on personal injury claims being specifically prohibited. [...] Authority for “ERISA reimbursement" [...] claims is attributed to federal preemption under the auspices of ERISA which was enacted in 1974. At the time ERISA was enacted by Congress, however, <b>subrogation</b> for health insurers was uniformly prohibited in the United States. Such claims were deemed unlawful in all jurisdictions. [...] The first reported judicial decision involving an effort of a health insurer to seek <b>subrogation</b> on a personal injury claim is the 1982 decision in Frost v. Porter Leasing Corp., 436 N.E.2d 387 (Mass. 1982) in which <b>subrogation</b> was denied. “ERISA reimbursement” claims began arising in the late 1980s and have been resisted by some federal courts. According to industry statistics, ERISA plans and related insurers are collecting close to $1 billion per year through the seizure of tort recoveries or other contractual payments received by insured personal injury victims. The plans tend to pursue reimbursement on a [...] "first dollar priority" [...] basis in order to maintain steady insurance premiums for their members.|$|E

50|$|Academic {{writers have}} sought to expand the {{explanatory}} power of 'unjust enrichment'. To this end, writers {{have suggested that the}} doctrine of <b>subrogation</b> forms part of the law of unjust enrichment.

English courts have accepted that the concept of unjust enrichment has a role to play in <b>subrogation.</b> The English approach has been stridently rejected by the High Court of Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subrogation</b> is {{the right}} of the insurer, having indemnified the insured in terms of the policy, to receive the benefit of all the rights of the insured against third parties. The insurer may take charge of {{litigation}} against third parties liable for loss to the insured. The proceedings are {{in the name of the}} insured, with the insurer as dominus litis. <b>Subrogation,</b> then, is essentially a right of recourse without transfer of rights.|$|E
5000|$|Where <b>subrogation</b> is available, the subrogated {{party is}} {{entitled}} {{to stand in the}} shoes of another and enforce that other party's rights. If the equity is established, the court may effect the <b>subrogation</b> remedy by way of equitable lien, charge, or a constructive trust with a liability to account. Crucially, the claimant's rights are wholly derivative, hence the claimant has no higher rights than the person to whom he or she is subrogated.|$|E
