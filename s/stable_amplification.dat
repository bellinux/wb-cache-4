We here analyzed the susceptibility of GT 1 - 7 cells to scrapie prions by exposure to infected mouse brains at different passages, following interspecies transmission. Wild-type mice challenged with a natural sheep scrapie case (Kanagawa) exhibited heterogeneity of transmitted scrapie prions in early passages, and this mixed population converged upon one with a short incubation period (S-type) following subsequent passages. However, when GT 1 - 7 cells were challenged with these heterologous samples, L-type prions became dominant. This study demonstrated that the susceptibility of GT 1 - 7 cells to L-type prions was at least 105 times higher than that to S-type prions and that L-type prion-specific biological characteristics remained unchanged after serial passages in GT 1 - 7 cells.

40|$|Amplification of the {{dihydrofolate reductase}} gene (Dhfr) by {{methotrexate}} (Mtx) exposure {{is commonly used}} for recombinant protein expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, this method is both time- and labor-intensive, and the high-producing cells that are generated are frequently unstable in culture. Another gene amplification method is based on using a plasmid bearing a mammalian replication initiation region (IR) and a matrix attachment region (MAR), which result in the spontaneous initiation of gene amplification in transfected cells. The IR/MAR and Dhfr/Mtx methods of gene amplification are based on entirely different principles. In this study, we combine these two methods to yield a novel method, termed the IR/MAR-Dhfr fusion method, which was used to express three proteins, the Fc receptor, GFP, and recombinant antibody. The fusion method resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} expression of all three proteins in two CHO sub-lines, DXB- 11, and DG 44. The IR/MAR-Dhfr fusion amplified the genes rapidly and efficiently, and produced larger amounts of antibody than the Dhfr/Mtx or IR/MAR methods alone. While the amplified structure produced by the Dhfr/Mtx method was highly unstable, and the antibody production rate rapidly decreased with the culture time of the cells, the IR/ MAR-Dhfr fusion method resulted in <b>stable</b> <b>amplification</b> and generated clonal cells that produced large amounts of antibody protein {{over a long period of}} time.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a qualified {{design for a}} sheet-beam coupled-cavity slow-wave structure {{for use in a}} high-power millimeter wave traveling wave tube amplifier. The main advance realized in the design is the roughly ten-fold increase in power gained by utilizing a sheet, rather than cylindrical, beam {{while at the same time}} employing mode-suppression techniques to suppress competing modes that are introduced by the sheet geometry. This design addresses considerations relevant to high-power tubes in general, as well as points specific to the design of a sheet-beam structure. The coupled-cavity structure is designed with the following general characteristics: center frequency of 35 GHz with greater than a 10 % bandwidth, and capabilities of 5 kW pulsed output power. The device operating parameters are as follows: a moderate gain of 18 dB, and an experimentally demonstrated sheet electron beam with 3. 5 A, 19. 5 kV, and 0. 3 mm x 4. 0 mm beam cross-section. The final design goal has been to limit the interaction length as much as possible to reduce magnet weight and complications. A final design structure is proposed, which produces in excess of 5 kW peak power in simulation with safeguards from instabilities. The structure geometry is based on a novel design for a sheet-beam coupled-cavity slow-wave structure that has been characterized through various analyses, simulations, and experiments. This thesis outlines and details the various techniques used to probe the structure and thus form a full characterization of the structure and proposed amplifier device. The concept espoused by much of this work is to adapt the analyses from cylindrical beam devices for the sheet-beam geometry.

40|$|In this work, optical pulse {{amplification}} by parametric chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA) {{has been}} applied to the generation of high-energy, few-cycle optical pulses in the near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) spectral regions. Amplification of such pulses is ordinarily difficult to achieve by existing techniques of pulse amplification based on standard laser gain media followed by external compression. Potential applications of few-cycle pulses in the IR have also been demonstrated. The NIR OPCPA system produces 0. 5 -terawatt (10 fs, 5 mJ) pulses by use of noncollinearly phase-matched optical parametric amplification and a down-chirping stretcher and upchirping compressor pair. An IR OPCPA system was also developed which produces 20 -gigawatt (20 fs, 350 uJ pulses at 2. 1 um. The IR seed pulse is generated by optical rectification of a broadband pulse and therefore it exhibits a self-stabilized carrier-envelope phase (CEP). In the IR OPCPA a common laser source is used to generate the pump and seed resulting in an inherent sub-picosecond optical synchronization between the two pulses. This was achieved by use of a custom-built Nd:YLF picosecond pump pulse amplifier that is directly seeded with optical pulses from a custom-built ultrabroadband Ti:sapphire oscillator. Synchronization between the pump and seed pulses is critical for efficient and <b>stable</b> <b>amplification.</b> Two spectroscopic applications which utilize these unique sources have been demonstrated. First, the visible supercontinuum was generated in a solid-state media by the infrared optical pulses and through which the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the driving pulse was measured with an f-to- 3 f interferometer. This measurement confirms the self-stabilization mechanism of the CEP in a difference frequency generation process and the preservation of the CEP during optical parametric amplification. Second, high-order harmonics with energies extending beyond 200 eV were generated with the few-cycle infrared pulses in an argon target. Because of the longer carrier period, the IR pulses transfer more quiver energy to ionized free electrons compared to conventional NIR pulses. Therefore, higher energy radiation is emitted upon recombination of the accelerated electrons. This result shows the highest photon energy generated by a laser excitation in neutral argon...|$|E

In pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), two sterile cytoplasm specific gene organization, atp 6 - 2 and coxII were identified. An open reading frame, orf 456 nearby coxII gene has been speculated to induce {{male sterility}} (MS) by mutagenic analysis. Moreover, molecular markers for atp 6 - 2 and coxII of mitochondrial genotype (mitotype) were developed. However, the Cytoplasmic MS specific markers, atp 6 SCAR and coxIISCAR markers appeared in both N and S cytoplasms when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles prolonged more than 40 cycles. Since the reported molecular markers were dominant markers, the presence of the faint sterile-specific band in normal cytoplasm may lead to the mis-classification of pepper breeding lines. To solve this problem, one common forward primer and two different reverse primers specific to normal coxII and sterile orf 456 genes were designed after analyzing their gene organizations. By using these three primers, N and S coxII specific bands were co-amplified in male-sterile lines, but only normal coxII specific band was amplified in maintainer lines.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Space Physics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Multipath {{amplifier}} theory: In {{this thesis}} {{it is proven}} that the theoretical minimum noise measure of a multipath amplifier (an amplifier which has multiple parallel amplifiers) is achieved by using the optimum source impedance for the amplifier and the optimum gain for each amplification path. This optimum source impedance and gain can be calculated by using the optimum–loaded input network, i. e. by replacing each amplifier with its optimum source impedance. The resulting noise measure {{is the same as}} the minimum noise measure of the amplifiers used in the amplification paths. Whereas single–path amplifiers can achieve this minimum noise measure over narrow bandwidths, multipath amplifiers are theoretically able to achieve the minimum noise measure over very broad bandwidths. The theory is demonstrated by applying it to distributed amplifiers. In an ideal distributed amplifier, the magnitude of the optimum gain of the amplification paths decreases and the phase delay increases the farther the stage is from the input, with the decrease in gain being faster for higher frequencies. The challenge in designing broadband, low–noise, distributed amplifiers is to achieve optimum gain matching over broad bandwidths. Multipath amplifier design procedure: Based on the theory, a three step design and optimisation procedure is introduced. Firstly, unconditionally <b>stable</b> <b>amplification</b> paths are designed to have small minimum noise measures, then an input network is designed for optimum source impedance matching and lastly an output network is designed for gain matching. Multipath amplifier prototype: The theory and design procedure is demonstrated by optimising a 0. 5 – 2 GHz distributed amplifier. An average noise measure of 0. 3 dB is achieved, which is only 0. 1 dB higher than the minimum noise measure of the amplification stages used. This increase is mainly due to transmission line loss and gain mismatch. Radio telescope feasibility: Multipath amplifiers break the trade–off between noise temperature, bandwidth and source termination that a single–path amplifier has, because they have much more design freedom when designing the input network. In general, the more paths, the larger the low–noise bandwidth, but the larger and more complex the amplifier. Roughly two to three amplification paths are required per octave of bandwidth for LNAs around 1 GHz. When the bandwidth is very narrow, a single path is sufficient. Multipath amplifiers have similar trade–offs between linearity and power consumption, between noise temperature and noise resistance, and between noise temperature and size to a single–path amplifier. Multipath amplifiers are therefore a feasible alternative for use in radio telescopes. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|A {{distributed}} amplifier is an amplifier {{in which a}} signal is amplified in parallel {{by a number of}} transconductive devices such as vacuum tubes or transistors. This is in contrast to the classic cascade amplifier, in which the amplifying devices are connected in series. A limitation of the latter is that its gain-bandwidth product is inherently limited. The {{distributed amplifier}} is not subject to the same limitation; gain can be traded for delay, instead of for bandwidth. At the time of its conception over 70 years ago, the distributed amplifier was built using vacuum tubes. More recently, the topology has found renewed interest due to the ability to produce monolithic distributed amplifiers using integrated circuit technology. Researchers have since managed to design distributed amplifiers with bandwidths exceeding 100 GHz in modern RFIC technologies. A disadvantage often attributed to the distributed amplifier, when compared to other amplifier topologies, is its high power consumption. While part of this high-power image {{stems from the fact that}} distributed amplifiers are typically optimized for maximum gain and bandwidth, automatically leading to a high power consumption, it is true that the topology has some characteristics that limit its efficiency. For example, in its basic configuration, half of the output current generated by the transistors is essentially lost. For these reasons, the distributed amplifier is often quickly dismissed for use in low-power broadband applications such as in wireless receivers. In a first part, this work focuses on the minimization of the distributed amplifier's power consumption. A first opportunity in reducing the power consumption involves eliminating the loss of half of the output current mentioned above. A distributed amplifier with a tapered output transmission line allows to do just this. However, the latter suffers from a number of disadvantages, limiting its use. To this end, the tapered distributed amplifier is analyzed in detail and a new tapering scheme is presented that overcomes the limitations of the classic scheme. In addition, it is shown that two or more tapered distributed amplifiers can be stacked in order to enjoy the increase in gain-to-power ratio of cascaded amplifiers. This leads to the new tapered matrix amplifier topology. Finally, the latter is enhanced with a number of generic low-power techniques to further reduce its power consumption. To validate the presented concepts, a prototype 2 x 2 tapered matrix amplifier was developed in a 90 nm CMOS technology. The specifications of the prototype include a gain of 16 dB across a 22 GHz frequency band and a DC power consumption of only 13 mW. This gain-bandwidth to power consumption ratio presents a new record. The occupied die area of 0. 31 mm² is very small for an amplifier with these specifications. The average noise figure across the 22 GHz pass-band is 5. 4 dB, and holds up very well compared to other broadband amplifiers in literature. Some of the low-power design choices and the high gain do come at the expense of linearity however; the prototype shows an average IIP 3 of - 7. 3 dBm. In an attempt to improve the linearity of the prototype, its design was revisited. It is shown that IIP 3 can be boosted by 10 dB by increasing the overdrive voltage of the second-stage transistors, but at the cost of a steeply increased power consumption. Introducing resistive degeneration, the power consumption can be reduced to 22 mW, also reducing the gain to 14 dB. This linearity-enhanced design illustrates that the tapered matrix amplifier is capable of highly-linear, high-gain amplification at a low power consumption, and is therefore an excellent choice in low-power broadband applications. A second part of this work concerns the traveling-wave transistor. First conceived as a continuous version of the distributed amplifier, it was discovered that it is capable of supporting a second mode of operation. Where the signal on a lossy transmission line loses energy according to an exponential law, the traveling-wave transistor is capable of supporting an exponentially growing wave. In this operating mode, the maximum gain of the device is not limited due to losses as is the case in the classic distributed amplifier; by increasing the width of the device, the gain can be increased indefinitely. To gain insight in this mode of operation, the traveling-wave transistor is modeled as an active transmission line, which helps to identify the requirements necessary for obtaining the growing mode. This model is then used in the design of a growing-wave amplifier, a lumped approximation of the traveling-wave transistor, in CMOS. It is discovered that it is anything but straightforward to obtain a growing mode due to limitations of the CMOS technology. To overcome these limitations, a cross-coupled pair is introduced into the amplifier, which significantly facilitates obtaining the growing mode. Due to its longitudinally reciprocal nature, the traveling-wave transistor is prone to become unstable. While it is shown that it is possible to maintain stability by proper termination of the device, this is not feasible in a realistic setting. For this reason, methods to introduce non-reciprocity are investigated. One option is to make use of the properties of meta- and magnetic materials. As these materials are not available in standard CMOS processes, design of a lumped non-reciprocal growing-wave amplifier is attempted. Initial simulations employing a unit cell consisting of an inductor, a capacitor and an NMOS transistor show that <b>stable</b> <b>amplification</b> can indeed be obtained. nrpages: 151 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{partially}} depolarized squid axon membrane {{is assumed}} to have a quasi-steady state negative resistance, the membrane potential is clamped at one point, and a distribution of potential along the axon is obtained from the cable equation.

The potential and current may be uniform for an axon and electrode length less than 1. 2 mm. For a long axon the potential varies as the cosine of the distance within 0. 8 mm of the control point.

30|$|Based on the PCR product {{expected}} {{size and}} the primer annealing temperature, the PCR regime used was as follows: 94  °C for 4  min followed by 37 cycles of 94  °C for 30  s, 50 – 58  °C for 30  s, 72  °C for 30  s. We ran the reaction at five different primer annealing temperatures: 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58  °C. At all the temperatures tested, the fluorescence curve reached the logarithmic phase at the same cycle number, although the total levels of fluorescence were higher at 50, 52, and 54  °C. Since higher primer annealing temperatures increase primer specificity, 54  °C {{was chosen as the}} optimal primer annealing temperature in our experiments. We also tested the effect of TaqMan probe concentration (100, 200, and 500  nM) on the reaction parameters and found that amplification using 200  nM TaqMan probe produced more <b>stable</b> and pronounced <b>amplification</b> curves; the total level of fluorescence with 200  nM TaqMan probe was higher than when using 100  nM TaqMan probe. The optimal number of cycles was 37, because in such a number of cycles fluorescence was not observed in samples without P. kudriavzevii DNA.|$|R
30|$|The goal of SRSR is to {{eliminate}} source- and path-specific effects so that only site signatures remain which {{are related to the}} instable rock mass. In particular, the local amplification factors are considered when judging whether a given rock mass is potentially instable or not with respect to the presumably stable, reference conditions. The relative amplification value indicates how much the rock mass is free to vibrate. For amplification factors around 4, rock slopes are already considered as considerably weakened (and potentially instable), while factor 8 or above represent heavily disturbed rock associated with unstable slopes. Amplification factors up to 70 have been observed in the dataset consisting out of 25 sites. Such extreme amplifications might result in a slope failure in case of an earthquake. Exceptional cases are rock columns or rock masses with a tower-like geometry. In particular, such objects are often highly amplified and show clear signatures in the polarization analysis as well (Kleinbrod et al. 2017). Nevertheless, a tower-shaped rock might be still <b>stable</b> since the <b>amplification</b> of ground motion could result just from the extreme geometry. In the same way, high-rise buildings show high amplification at top floors (i.e., low damping ratio) at the eigenfrequencies (e.g., Arakawa and Yamamoto 2004).|$|R
