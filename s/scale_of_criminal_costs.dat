40|$|Theoretical {{background}} {{of research in}} this paper is The Criminal Lifestyle Theory (Walters, 1998). Theory assumes that criminal behaviour is connected with eight related criminal thinking styles: mollification, cutoff, entitlement, power orientation, sentimentality, superoptimism, cognitive indolence and discontinuity. The formulation of these thinking styles was developed through clinical observations and the Psychological Inventory <b>of</b> <b>Criminal</b> Thinking Styles (PICTS) was formulated as an assessment tool and contains 10 scales (8 criminal thinking scales and 2 validity scales). The first objective of the paper is {{an assessment of the}} factor structure of the PICTS and the second objective is to examine the psychometric properties of the PICTS.

The main goal of this study is to find out, which risk factors are for criminal behavior among the youth. It’s also to understand if gender and ethnicity of the adolescent people plays any part in their attitudes towards criminality and risk factors for criminal behavior. The study has been carried out using a quantitative method for the data collection. The theoretical approach in this study is achieved using system theory and deviance behavior. Data has been collected from adolescent people from high school, ranging from the age of 16 to 20. All of the participants in the study are teenagers whom are studying in high school in Sweden. The results show that there are many different risk factors, which affect the adolescent <b>criminal</b> behavior. One <b>of</b> the risk factors shown are parental control in knowing whom their children socialize with. Also the adolescents own attitudes towards crime and especially socialization with other criminal teens are contributing risk factors for the teens to commit criminal acts. Gender has been shown to have a significant role when it comes to young people's attitudes and involvement in criminal acts. Male participants show a larger <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> participation compared to women, and they generally have a more positive attitude towards criminal behavior than women. Ethnicity has also been found to have a significant role in the study.

40|$|Advances in {{forensic}} {{techniques have}} expanded the temporal horizon <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> investigations, facilitating investigation of historic crimes that would previously {{have been considered}} unsolvable. Public enthusiasm for pursuing historic crimes is exemplified by recent high-profile trials of celebrities accused of historic sexual offences. These circumstances give new urgency {{to the question of}} how we should decide which historic offences to investigate. A satisfactory answer must take into account the ways in which the passage of time can erode the benefits <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> investigation, the <b>costs</b> associated with investigating old crimes, and the need to prioritize investigations in the face of limited police resources. This article emphasizes the first of these factors. It begins by considering the moral goals <b>of</b> a <b>criminal</b> justice system and the contribution <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> investigations to the achievement of these goals, distinguishing between contributions that depend on further steps in the criminal justice process, such as prosecution and punishment, and contributions that can have value independently of these further steps. Using this important distinction, the article then examines a range of factors that relate the passage <b>of</b> time to <b>criminal</b> justice goals, including the seriousness of the crime; deterioration of evidence; death of the offender, victim and others affected by the crime; and diminished psychological connectedness between those affected by the crime and their current selves. While the range and non-uniformity of relevant factors preclude a simple answer to the question of when historic crimes should be investigated and call instead for case-by-case assessment, we find that the analysis does support some general conclusions that can guide such an assessment...|$|R

The data for this study is based on the perception <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> (convicts, non-criminals and intellectuals working us lawyers, religious scholars, politicians, journalists and members of law enforcement agencies. One hundred and seven criminals (convicts) were randomly selected from Peshawar and Haripur jails, and an equal number of non-criminals and intellectuals Were also selected to collect data on the study variables: age group, education marital status, economic status and residential area. To cover the second part <b>of</b> the study. <b>Criminals</b> and non-criminals samples were administered a psychological characteristics scale to measure attitudes towards interpersonal relationships, risk taking tendencies, and rebelliousness. The MMPI (Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory) and UACL (Urdu Adjective check list) was also used to measure the trends of psychopathic and personality characteristics profile <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> and non-criminals. The third part of the study taps the perception <b>of</b> <b>criminals,</b> not-criminals and intellectuals about due frequency and seriousness of crimes taking into consideration aspects of family history, economics, politics, education, media, law enforcement agencies, norms, traditions, culture and values. The results indicate dual a corrupt police system, unemployment, mad administration, out dated colonial laws, lacunas in the judicial system and lack of coordination among law enforcement agencies were the major contributors to promote the crime rate. The demand for seeking justice under present circumstances is too expensive besides being time consuming. In addition, political instability, low literacy rate, poor governance, abject poverty are the contributory factors for miserable environment. Besides this the rapidly changing norms and standards in the society has largely influenced people's concept of dignity and honour. Predominated prestige standards and social status are currently measured in terms of wealth and mundane possessions. Unemployment and a desire to become rich Overnight promoted unethical practices. Lack of parental control and easy access to videos were instrumental in projecting immoral values and aggression to enhance the rate of crimes in the society. The findings also indicate the significant influential role of media in increasing crimes ratios. The psychosocial characteristic rating <b>scale</b> score <b>of</b> <b>criminals</b> on interpersonal relationship is low as compared to non-criminals.

The downfall of the GO led Hubbard to distrust it, believing it to be riddled with Suppressives; he severed his communications with it and put his reliance instead on the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO), a group which he had formed in 1968 whose purpose was to relay messages to and from church staff as Ron's personal representatives.

40|$|Aims: Some {{economic}} costs {{and consequences of}} drug misuse and treatment were investigated among clients recruited to the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS). Design: This was a longitudinal prospective cohort design comprising 549 clients recruited from 54 residential and community treatment programmes: {{data were collected from}} interviews conducted at treatment intake, at 1 year and at 2 -year follow-ups. Measurements: Treatment costs included index and other drug treatments. Costs were estimated for use of health and social care services, criminal activity and the use <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> justice resources. <b>Costs</b> were based upon self-reported data collected by structured face-to-face interviews combined with unit cost estimates taken from a variety of sources. Findings: Addiction treatment was costed at £ 2. 9 million in the 2 years prior to index treatment, and a further £ 4. 4 million in the subsequent 2 years. Economic benefits were largely accounted for by reduced crime and victim costs of crime. Crime costs fell by £ 16. 1 million during the first year, and by £ 11. 3 million during the second year. Health-care costs were relatively small but approximately doubled {{during the course of the}} study. The ratio of consequences to net treatment investment varied from 18 : 1 to 9. 5 : 1, depending on assumptions.

40|$|This chapter reviews {{empirical}} studies <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> punishment {{and the criminal}} justice system by economists. Since the modern exposition of the economic model <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior, empirical economists have tested its predictions using variation in expected criminal punishments. In the past decade, empirical economists have made substantial progress in identifying the effects of punishment on crime by finding new ways to break the simultaneity of crime rates and punishments. The new empirical evidence generally supports the deterrence model but shows that incapacitation influences crime rates, too. Evidence of the crime-reducing effect <b>of</b> the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> policing and incarceration is consistent across different methodological approaches. Estimates of the deterrent effect of other penalties, such as capital punishment, are less robust and suggest that claims of large effects from these policies may be spurious. More work is needed to assess the relative importance of deterrence and incapacitation. Empirical economists have made less progress in studying {{the criminal justice system}} itself. Data availability constrains the economists' ability to resolve the simultaneity <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> justice institutions and crime rates, and this limitation hampers rigorous empirical investigation of the incentive effects <b>of</b> numerous <b>criminal</b> justice institutions and procedures.
