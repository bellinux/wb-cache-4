PLMVd exhibits limited homologies with other viroids and some <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs,</b> but it does not have any of the central conserved sequences characteristic of the subgroups of typical viroids.

These data are consistent with the high stability of the PLMVd hammerhead structures, more similar to the corresponding structures of some <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> than to those of ASBVd, and indicate that the self-cleavage reactions of PLMVd are most probably mediated by single hammerhead structures. Our results support the inclusion of PLMVd in a viroid subgroup represented by ASBVd, whose members are characterized by their ability to self-cleave in vitro, and probably in vivo, through hammerhead structures.

40|$|The {{demonstration}} of enzymatic capabilities of certain RNAs, {{in addition to}} their well-known template properties, has led to the recognition that RNAs are the only biological macromolecules that can function both as genotype and phenotype, hence raising the possibility of Darwinian selection and precellular evolution at the RNA level in the absence of DNA or protein. Recent models of such precellular RNA systems are patterned after the properties of intron-derived ribozymes. On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis and known properties of certain small plant pathogenic RNAs (viroids and viroid-like <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs),</b> I suggest that these plant RNAs are more plausible candidates than introns as "living fossils" of a precellular RNA world. Their small size and circularity would have enhanced probability of their survival in error-prone, primitive self-replicating RNA systems and assured complete replication without the need for initiation or termination signals. All of these RNAs possess efficient mechanisms for the precise cleavage of monomers from oligomeric replication intermediates. Some (most viroids) require a host factor, but others (viroid-like <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> and one viroid) function as self-cleaving RNA enzymes far smaller and simpler than those derived from introns.

40|$|Abstract Background Viroids, <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs,</b> <b>satellites</b> {{viruses and}} the human {{hepatitis}} delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. For most of these species, it is generally accepted that characteristics such as cell movement, replication, host specificity and pathogenicity are encoded in their RNA sequences and their resulting RNA structures. Although many sequences are indexed in publicly available databases, these sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data manipulation capability for identifying and characterizing subviral RNA motifs. Description The Subviral RNA database is a web-based environment that facilitates the research and analysis of viroids, <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs,</b> <b>satellites</b> viruses, the human hepatitis delta virus, and related RNA sequences. It integrates {{a large number of}} Subviral RNA sequences, their respective RNA motifs, analysis tools, related publication links and additional pertinent information (ex. links, conferences, announcements), allowing users to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information about these small RNA agents.

40|$|Viroids and viroid-like <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> from plants, and {{the human}} {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) RNA share some properties that include small size, circularity and replication through a rolling-circle mechanism. Replication occurs in different cell compartments (nucleus, chloroplast and membrane-associated cytoplasmatic vesicles) and has three steps: RNA polymerization, cleavage and ligation. The first step generates oligomeric RNAs that result from the reiterative transcription of the circular templates of one or both polarities, and is catalyzed by either the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the helper virus on which viroid-like <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> are functionally dependent, or by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases that, remarkably, viroids and HDV redirect to transcribe RNA templates. Cleavage is mediated by host enzymes in certain viroids and viroid-like <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs,</b> while in others and in HDV is mediated by cis-acting ribozymes of three classes. Ligation appears to be catalyzed mainly by host enzymes. Replication most likely also involves many other non-catalytic proteins of host origin and, in HDV, the single virus-encoded protein.

40|$|Viruses with {{defective}} genomes {{have been}} identified in association with virtually every major family of viruses and have been widely utilized as tools for investigating virus functions in animal cell culture systems (Perrault, 1981). It is generally thought that defective interfering viruses (DIs) arise through deletion, rearrangement, or recombination of a competent viral genome. DIs tack the ability for independent existence relying on their parental helper viruses to supply factors required for replication, maturation, and/or encapsidation (Huang and Baltimore, 1977). The interference attributed to DIs is thought to result from competition with the helper virus for factors required in trans for replication and/or encapsidation (Schlesinger, 1988). It is these features that have made DIs very useful tools for mapping viral signals required for replication and packaging (e. g. Levis, et aI., 1986). The DIs associated with animal viruses have usually been detected after serial passage of virus at high multiplicities of infection (m. o. i.) in cell cultures. It has also been noted that maintenance in continuous passage results in fluctuations of helper and DI which reflect the relative abilities of each to interfere or support the other (Huang, 1988). DIs have also been detected in natural virus infections and, although there is some debate, may function in vivo to modulate virus diseases and allow more persistent infections (Huang, 1988). The majority of plant viruses have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. Additional RNA components capable of modulating symptoms have most commonly been associated with either satellite viruses or <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs.</b> <b>Satellite</b> viruses differ from <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> by encoding their own capsid proteins, whereas <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> are encapsidated by their specific helper virus. <b>Satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> are relatively common among plant viruses, having been found in association with at least 24 members in six virus groups (Francki, 1985). Unlike DIs, <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> in general share little sequence similarity with their specific heJper virus. The one exception is the chimeric satellite RNA-C of turnip crinkle virus (Simon, 1988). Satellite viruses and <b>satellite</b> <b>RNAs</b> have been shown to both intensify as well as attenuate symptoms normally expressed by their specific virus helpers (Kaper, and Collmer, 1988, Simon, 1988). In contrast to the many reports of satellites, few authentic DIs {{have been identified}} among plant viruses. These accounts include the presence of DI -Iike particles associated with the negative-stranded plant rhabdoviruses (Adam et al., 1983; Ishmail and Milner, 1988) and the bunyavirus-like tomato spotted wilt virus (Verkleij and Peters, 1983). DI-Iike RNA components have also been reported for wound tumor virus, a plant reovirus (Nuss, 1988). Among the positive, single-stranded RNA plant viruses, authentic DIs have been identified for only two viruses: tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Hillman et aI., 1987; Morris et al., 1989); and turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (Li et al., 1989). TBSV and TCV are members of two closely related groups of plant viruses, the tombusviruses and the carmoviruses respectively (see Martelli et al., 1988 and Morris et al., 1988 for reviews). Both viruses are good model systems for studying small RNA virus and DI RNA molecular biology because each has been well-defined biologically and detailed structural studies have been performed on both viruses. In addition, the genome of each virus has been cloned, entirely sequenced, and engineered to produce infectious RNA transcripts in vitro (Carrington et al., 1989; Heaton, et aI., 1989; Hearne, et al., 1990). The reader is referred to these papers for details on the genomic organizations of these two viruses. The features of the TBSV genome organization important in understanding the origins of associated DI RNAs are summarized in Figure 5. In this paper we will focus on the derivation, molecular characterization, and evolution of TBSV -associated DIs. We will also discuss the possibilities for using plant virus DIs as a general method for controlling virus diseases...|$|R
