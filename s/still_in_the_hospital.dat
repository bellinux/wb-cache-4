5|$|In 1952, while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> Kesselring {{accepted}} the honorary presidency of three veterans' organisations. The {{first was the}} Luftwaffenring, consisting of Luftwaffe veterans. The Verband deutsches Afrikakorps, the veterans' association of the Afrika Korps, soon followed. More controversial was {{the presidency of the}} right-wing veterans' association, the Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten. Leadership of this organisation tarnished his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new German flag be flown instead of the old Imperial Flag; that the old Stahlhelm greeting Front heil! be abolished; and that members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany be allowed to join. The response was very unenthusiastic.|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, {{he insists that}} he was not in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E

25|$|In current practice, the Shalom Zachar is an informal, drop-in {{gathering}} {{which takes}} place after the Friday night meal. The location of the gathering is determined by where {{the father of the}} new baby spends Shabbat, since he presides over the event. Thus, a Shalom Zachar usually takes place in the home of the newborn (even if the newborn is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital),</b> although it may also take place at the home of grandparents, in-laws, or even friends with whom the father is spending Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to rumors {{circulating}} on the Internet today, Joni {{is not in}} a coma. Joni is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> – but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has {{her full}} senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority – in the absence of 24-hour doctor care – to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital. As we all know, Joni is a strong-willed woman and is nowhere near giving up the fight. Please continue to keep Joni in your thoughts.|$|E
25|$|While {{ratification}} of the agreement was a victory for Miller, it also signaled {{the end of his}} effectiveness as leader of the United Mine Workers of America. Political infighting, his autocratic behavior and the troubled 1978 contract negotiations finished him. On March 29, 1978, just ten days after the coal mining contract was ratified, Miller suffered a stroke while on vacation in Miami Beach, Florida. On April 12, 1978, while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> Miller suffered a mild heart attack. His health never recovered fully. His union political opponents had decided that his erratic behavior and poor physical condition justified putting him on involuntary leave when he suffered a third heart attack. Miller resigned on November 12, 1978. After a lengthy illness, Arnold Miller died on July 12, 1985, at a hospital in Charleston, West Virginia.|$|E

[...] Feng reportedly had a severe headache for several weeks after the abortion and attempted suicide multiple times. On June 15, an uncle told reporters Feng was in poor health and unable to eat. [...] On June 26, Feng was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> and suffering from headaches.

2500|$|The {{leaders of}} the Liberal party were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> next to Gaitán's body, {{overwhelmed}} and at a loss {{as to how the}} chaos might be controlled. They {{received a phone call from}} the presidential palace, inviting them to a meeting to try to resolve their differences and find a solution. However, because of the conflict in the streets, the Liberal leaders could not reach the palace [...] - some received shotgun wounds. Eventually they asked for a military escort, and successfully reached the palace. However, President Ospina was surprised to see the Liberal leaders, since the invitation had been made by some of his ministers without his knowledge. Discussions went throughout the night, but failed to reach an agreement.|$|E
2500|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation sent {{investigators}} to Kuwait {{who went through}} the hospital and counted the incubators and they found that [...] "except {{for one or two}} that may have been misplaced" [...] all of the incubators were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> The investigators concluded that there were no deaths resulting from stolen equipment. And the doctor who provided Amnesty International with the number of babies killed dropped from 312 to 72 and then 30, 19 of which died before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. After the war, The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's plainly wrong for a member of congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue. Yet Representative Tom Lantos has been caught doing exactly that. His behavior warrants a searching inquiry by the House Ethics Committee." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{match of}} the show, a tag team match was {{supposed}} to include Zayco, {{but he had been}} stabbed in the back earlier in the week and was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in critical condition at the time so he was replaced by Camorra. It was also one of Zayco's first matches back in the ring after recovering from being stabbed in the back and almost passing away from the attack. Camora and Bronco worked together and defeated Leono and Soberano, Jr. The second match of the evening saw what could potentially be a longer-running storyline between Rey Cometa and Los Cancerberos del Infierno member Euforia. Rey Cometa teamed up with longtime tag team partner Pegasso as well as Diamante while Euforia teamed with his Los Cancerberos teammates Cancerbero and Raziel for this match. During the first and into the second fall Euforia kept attacking Rey Cometa, {{going so far as to}} land a low blow on Rey Cometa that led to Euforia's team being disqualified, losing the match in two straight falls. Puma King was accompanied to the ring by the National Autonomous University of Mexico's puma mascot Goyo for his Lightning Match against tecnico (The Spanish term for someone who plays a [...] "good guy" [...] character) Super Halcon, Jr. Puma King defeated his inexperienced opponent in the one fall, 10 minute time limit match. The escalating rivalry between one of CMLL's established top female acts La Amapola and CMLL newcomer Estrellita was the driving force behind the fourth match of the evening with Estrellita teaming up with Dark Angel and Goya Kong while La Amapola had back up in the form of Las Ladies de Polanco (Princesa Blanca and Princesa Sujei). The two teams split the first two falls between them in quick fashion and then went to the third and final fall. The animosity between La Amapola and Estrellita escalated throughout the third fall, resulting in La Amapola trying to use the ropes for illegal leverage during a pinfall attempt. The referee noticed the infraction and did not award Amapola's team the victory, moments later Estrellita retaliated by using the ropes herself during a pinfall attempt, an action not noticed by the referee who counted to three and gave the match to Estrellita's team. The team of El Terrible, Rey Bucanero and Tiger, collectively known as [...] ("The TRT Power"), has been described as [...] "The New Machine of Destruction" [...] since their addition of Tiger to their ranks a few months earlier. On the night this nickname proved to be correct as La Fuerza TRT defeated the 2012 Reyes del Aire winner Ángel de Oro, La Mascara and Valiente two falls to one.|$|E

His arm was still in a sling, but otherwise he was quite convalescent. Lippincott had that morning given up the bandage round his head, which had kept him almost a prisoner until now, for he had refused to go into the town until after nightfall with his head bound up, although Nat had many times assured him that an honourable wound would not be regarded as any disadvantage by the young ladies at Kingston. The assistant surgeon, James Doyle, a cheery young Irishman, also joined that morning.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Denton had died. She {{had left}} Joan her library, {{together}} with her wonderful collection of note books. She had brought them all up-to-date and indexed them.

She had tried to get to him; {{but it would have}} meant endless delays; and she had been anxious about her father. The Italian surgeons were very proud of him, he wrote. They had had him X-rayed before and after; and beyond a slight lameness which gave him, he thought, a touch of distinction, there was no flaw that the most careful scrutiny would be likely to detect. Any day, now, he expected to be discharged. Mary had married an old sweetheart. She had grown restless in the country with nothing to do, and, at the suggestion of some friends, had gone to Bristol to help in a children's hospital; and there they had met once more.|$|E
