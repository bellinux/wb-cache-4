5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two <b>strands</b> of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting <b>strands,</b> while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting <b>strands.</b> In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the <b>strands</b> easier to pull apart.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid <b>strands</b> will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid <b>strands</b> within the structure, and which portions of those <b>strands</b> should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
5|$|The DX {{structural}} motif is {{the fundamental}} building block of the DNA origami method, {{which is used to}} make larger two- and three-dimensional structures of arbitrary shape. Instead of using individual DX tiles, a single long scaffold strand is folded into the desired shape by a number of short staple <b>strands.</b> When assembled, the scaffold strand is continuous through the double-helical domains, while the staple <b>strands</b> participate in the Holliday junctions as crossover <b>strands.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wherever a gene {{exists on}} a DNA molecule, one <b>strand</b> is the coding <b>strand</b> (or sense <b>strand</b> or non-template <b>strand),</b> {{and the other}} is the noncoding <b>strand</b> (also called the {{antisense}} <b>strand,</b> anticoding <b>strand,</b> template <b>strand,</b> or transcribed <b>strand).</b>|$|R

5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the <b>strands</b> move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of <b>strands</b> leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two <b>strands</b> causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>strands</b> of DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA <b>strands</b> are created using DNA <b>strands</b> as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA <b>strands</b> are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer <b>strands,</b> bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two <b>strands</b> can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E

50|$|RNase H {{activity}} exposes purine-rich regions at {{the position}} of discontinuity 2 (D2), which primes the synthesis of the β DNA <b>strand.</b> When the new γ <b>strand</b> of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new α <b>strand</b> it switches to the 5′ end of the new α <b>strand,</b> recreating discontinuity 1 (D1). When the new γ <b>strand</b> of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new β <b>strand,</b> it displaces the primer {{and some of the}} newly synthesized β <b>strand,</b> resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 2 (D2). When the new β <b>strand</b> of DNA reaches the 5′ end of the new γ <b>strand,</b> it displaces the primer and some of the newly synthesized γ <b>strand,</b> resulting in the recreation of discontinuity 3 (D3).|$|R
5000|$|The lagging <b>strand</b> is the <b>strand</b> of nascent DNA whose {{direction}} of synthesis is opposite to the {{direction of}} the growing replication fork. Because of its orientation, replication of the lagging <b>strand</b> is more complicated as compared to that of the leading <b>strand.</b> As a consequence, the DNA polymerase on this <b>strand</b> is seen to [...] "lag behind" [...] the other <b>strand.</b>|$|R
5|$|DNA stores {{biological}} information. The DNA backbone is {{resistant to}} cleavage, and both <b>strands</b> of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as {{and when the}} two <b>strands</b> separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA <b>strands</b> have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two <b>strands</b> of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three <b>strands</b> of DNA, complexes involving additional <b>strands</b> and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E

5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA <b>strands</b> by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA <b>strands</b> are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within <b>strands.</b> The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E

5000|$|Molecular {{biologists}} call {{a single}} <b>strand</b> of DNA, sense (or positive (+)) if an RNA {{version of the}} same sequence is translated or translatable into protein. Its complementary <b>strand</b> is called antisense (or negative (-) sense). Sometimes the phrases coding <b>strand</b> (for sense) and template <b>strand</b> (for antisense) are encountered; however, protein coding and non-coding RNAs can be transcribed from the sense <b>strand.</b> Additionally, the terms [...] "sense" [...] and [...] "antisense" [...] are relative to the RNA transcript in question and not to the entire DNA <b>strand</b> as a whole. In other words, either DNA <b>strand</b> can serve as the sense or antisense <b>strand</b> for a particular RNA transcript. In some cases, RNA transcripts can be transcribed in both directions (i.e. on either <b>strand)</b> from a common promoter region, or be transcribed from within introns on either <b>strand</b> (see [...] "ambisense" [...] below).|$|R
50|$|In the mold, a thin {{shell of}} metal {{next to the}} mold walls solidifies before the middle section, now called a <b>strand,</b> exits {{the base of the}} mold into a spray chamber.

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two <b>strands</b> are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel <b>strands</b> of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
50|$|The single <b>stranded</b> copy now loops at the 3’ end as it binds to itself. The FIP primer binds to the 5’ end of {{this single}} <b>strand</b> and {{accompanied}} by DNA polymerase, synthesizes a complementary <b>strand.</b> The F3 primer, with DNA polymerase, binds to this end and generates a new double <b>stranded</b> DNA molecule while displacing the previously made single <b>strand.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each D-loop {{contains}} an {{origin of replication}} for the heavy <b>strand.</b> Full circular DNA replication is initiated at that origin and replicates in only one direction. The middle <b>strand</b> in the D-loop can be removed and a new one will be synthesized that is not terminated until the heavy <b>strand</b> is fully replicated, or the middle <b>strand</b> {{can serve as a}} primer for the heavy <b>strand</b> replication. As the heavy <b>strand</b> replication reaches the origin of replication for the light <b>strand,</b> a new light <b>strand</b> will be synthesized in the opposite direction as the heavy <b>strand.</b> There is more than one proposed process through which D-loop replication occurs, but in all of the models, these steps are agreed upon. The portions not agreed upon are what is the importance of maintaining a D-loop when replication is not in progress, because it is energetically expensive to the cell, and what mechanisms, during replication, preserve the detached <b>strand</b> of DNA that is waiting to be replicated.|$|R
