500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in herself she is really a poet at all." ...|$|E

Another logician John Venn, however, in his 1881 Symbolic Logic, turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: [...] "I have no high estimate myself {{of the interest}} or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at Algorithm characterizations. But {{not to be outdone}} he too presented [...] "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's abacus ... gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{working within}} the PNA and befriending the fascists, Streitman still {{assisted}} with leftist causes. Also in 1932, he joined the staff of Facla, where he was colleagues with several leftist and rightist political commentators: Sergiu Dan, Ion Călugăru, N. Davidescu, Sandu Eliad, Nicolae Carandino. Following up on Între da și nu, he returned in late 1933 with the volume Mi se pare că... ("Signs Point to..."), at Alcaly Publishers. A praise of agnosticism and relativism, it appeared on Pompiliu Păltânea's list of notable prose works for 1934. According to Păltânea: [...] "Mr. Henri Streitman reveals his very own manner [...] of searching for the truth through the most distant detours, those that run into surprises and open up grand perspectives." [...] Doctor Ygrec, the reviewer at Adevărul, found the book amusing overall, but objected to its [...] "commonplace" [...] jokes about God as an anthropomorphism deity. Underneath this covering, [...] "it would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Streiman is a religious man".|$|E

[...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a miracle had happened.

[...] "Nay, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2005 expert {{evidence}} was {{submitted to the}} High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations and who sought to bring a legal action to try to prove {{a link between the}} mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children. The evidence presented included reports detailing the higher rate of birth defects, and alleging that exposure to the toxic waste was the likely cause of the children's deformities. They also presented a report written by Roger Braithwaite, an environmental expert instructed by the families, which concluded that the negligent handling of the waste by Corby Borough Council demonstrated [...] "naivety, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and a possible serious conflict of interest... At this early stage it would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these... badly polluted lands have never been effectively or comprehensively assessed, properly permitted, regulated, monitored or adequate records maintained... This is environmental negligence on a grand scale." ...|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, {{it seems to me that}} Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|E

The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet." ...|$|R

6000|$|I thought I could, {{but it did}} not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be modest to speak out, in the circumstances. So I diffidently said nothing. Stevenson noticed, and said-- ...|$|E
