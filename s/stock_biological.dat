40|$|Purpose. To analyze {{morphological}} variability {{and basic}} biological {{features of the}} modern stock of taran of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system in {{the conditions of the}} transformed Dnieper flow. Methodology. Morphological variability was determined based on the comparison of morphological features of roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758) of the Kakhovka reservoir and semi-migratory taran Rutilus rutilus heckelii (Nordmann, 1840) of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system. As a main criterion of the evaluation of the taran <b>stock</b> <b>biological</b> state, we used age, sex structure, growth characteristics, fecundity and condition factor. Fish sampling was carried out at stationary monitoring-observation stations of the Institute of Fisheries NAAS of Ukraine. Field and cameral processing of the collected materials were performed based on conventional methods and guidelines. Findings. Morphological variability analysis demonstrated significant differences between Dnieper and Bug taran. The highest differences were observed for antroventral distance (td= 11. 19). Significant differences were also observed for antenanal and ventroanal distances td= 4. 05 - 4. 14. No significant differences were found for meristic features. There were also significant differences between Dnieper-Bug taran and Kakhovka reservoir roach, which had formed a resident form after regulating the Dnieper River flow. Kakhovka reservoir roach is more deep-bodied with Н= 32. 79...|$|E
40|$|Soil tillage and {{management}} concepts are basic operations in viticulture because with both interventions the viticultural ecosystem can {{shift to a}} stable and sustainable production system or in worst case will partly loose its productivity and getting harmful for surrounding environments. Modern viticulture should therefor focus on stable yield and qualities but also on soil quality and environmental sound production systems. In a longterm test 5 different tillage system (control, permanent grass sod, marginal sod, extensive and intensive shallow tillage) were investigated. In the grassed plots it could be demonstrated that the macronutrients P, K, and Mg changed their availability: inorganic P was reduced, K and Mg got in a new balance, favoring a better nutritional status of grapevines. Micronutrients availability was increased esp. Fe and Mn, which is essential on calcareous production sites. Plots with permanent grass cover showed an significant increase in total C. During the test period of 20 years permanent grass stored in an average ≈ 3. 3 t CO 2 x ha- 1 x a- 1. Neither the control plot nor the tilled ones could significantly increase the soils’ C <b>stock.</b> <b>Biological</b> activity was determined with enzyme assays.

40|$|The herring {{fishery in}} the Celtic Sea and Division VIIj has been commercially {{important}} for many years. The Marine Institute has been collecting biological {{data for this}} herring stock since 1959. This stock is assessed by ICES annually. However, {{this is the first}} study of long term biological trends. The biological data consists of total length, weight, sex, maturity and age of the commercial catches. This study looks at mean length and mean weight at age, growth rate, condition factor and maturity ogives from 1959 to 2007. Environmental factors that may explain the biological trends are also investigated. These data consist of sea surface temperature (SST) for the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea from 1970 to 2004, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices from 1958 to 2001 and Calanus spp. abundance for the Celtic Sea and Division VIIj from 1958 to 2007. In addition, data from the ICES stock assessment is consulted and this consists of spawning stock biomass (SSB), fishing mortality (F) and recruitment (R) from 1958 to 2008. The results show that mean length and mean weight at age peaked in the 1970 s and declined thereafter. It was found that the condition factor over time declined. The results also illustrate that the growth rates were faster in the 1960 s and 1970 s than in the 1980 s and 1990 s. It can be seen that maturation for 1 winter ring increased in the early 1970 s and has remained at a high level since then. This study looks at possible explanations for the biological trends and found that it was unlikely to be due to fishing mortality or density dependence. There have been changes in the proportions of autumn and winter spawners in this area over time but it is unlikely that this influenced the trends. Evidence suggests that the changes in the biological data over time may be influenced by environmental factors. NAO shows a significant negative correlation with growth rate in length. There is evidence to suggest that increased SST in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea is associated with reduced size/weight at age and condition. Calanus abundance shows some positive correlations with mean length and mean weight and is a favourable influence on herring growth. These changes in the biology of the stock have implications for its future management. Declining growth results in more individual fish per tonne of landings which exerts a greater fishing mortality than in the past. This study has allowed for {{a better understanding of the}} biology of the <b>stock.</b> <b>Biological</b> data has been routinely collected for other herring stocks around Ireland and similar studies should be performed on these herring stocks in the future.

40|$|For 17 {{stocks in}} the North Sea. the {{performance}} and effectiveness of management advice using precautionary reference points was evaluated. Three criteria were used to identify whether a stock was within safe biological limits: SSB F-pa, or SSB F-pa. Four scenarios were considered, comparing the advice in the assessment year with what is retrospectively (2002 assessment) known to be {{the status of the}} stock at that time: (1) <b>stock</b> outside safe <b>biological</b> limits, advice to reduce fishing: (2) <b>stock</b> outside safe <b>biological</b> limits, advice for status quo harvesting: (3) <b>stock</b> within safe <b>biological</b> limits, advice to reduce fishing: and (4) <b>stock</b> within safe <b>biological</b> limits, advice for status quo (or increased) harvesting. Signal Detection Theory was applied to these scenarios, and the proportion of Hits (1 and 4), Misses (2), and False Alarms (3) were determined for each year as the proportion of the stocks for which the respective scenarios applied. Using both B-pa and F-pa was deemed the approach with the lowest error rate, and it resulted in about the same proportion of Hits in management advice as when B-pa alone was used (62 %), but the proportion of Misses was slightly lower (24 % vs. 26 %). Therefore, the suggested EcoQ element would be the proportion of commercial fish <b>stocks</b> within safe <b>biological</b> limits (i. e. SSB > B-pa, F 60 %. A possible explanation is that most of these stocks (e. g. flatfish and roundfish) are caught in a mixed fishery, for which TAC management is less effective.

40|$|Recent genetic research, {{supported}} by life history information, {{indicates that there}} are three <b>biological</b> <b>stocks</b> of S. mentella in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters: a ‘Deep Pelagic’ stock (> 500 m), a ‘Shallow Pelagic’ stock (< 500 m), and an ‘Icelandic Slope’ stock. Throughout their range, Sebastes species are adapted to a diversity of ecological niches, with overlapping spatial distributions of different species that have little or no morphological differences. Divergence of behavioral groups into depth-defined adult habitats has led to reproductive isolation, adaptive radiation and speciation of several Sebastes species. Congruent differences in fatty acid composition and parasites suggests that the three genetically distinct populations of S. mentella are adapted to disparate trophic habitats in pelagic waters (shallower and deeper than the deep-scattering layer), and in demersal habitats on the continental slope. Patterns of morphology are also consistent with adaptation to different habitats, because pelagic forms are more streamlined. Although genetic differences and evidence for reproductive isolation are clear, these populations appear to share common nursery habitats on the Greenlandic Shelf. Spatial overlap at early life stages and depth-defined adult populations present challenges for stock identification and fishery management.

40|$|Research PaperSetting {{aside the}} {{traditional}} simplistic “tragedy of the commons” notion, fisheries crises {{observed in the}} Northern Atlantic {{may be seen as}} the result of “mismatches” in the decision making process. The collapse of two fisheries, Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) in Canada and European Hake (Merluccius merluccius) in Europe, illustrate the failure of fishery systems, where strong, and often conflictive, interactions between biology, economics and social interests lead to those mismatches. The current work aims at analysing the role of those elements in the overexploitation spiral of biological collapse. Even if those two fisheries take place in different geographical and political environments, they appear to evolve in comparable socio-economic and management frames. That makes reference to TAC/quotas management mechanisms, high pressures from the industry and final fish demands and recruitment/growth overfishing schemes. The management decision making process is analysed from the history of <b>stocks</b> <b>biological</b> assessment and management decisions as well as from market analysis, using econometric methods as time series and cointegration techniques, and finally institutional frame analysis. The analysis shows that similar decision making philosophy lead to similar effects. It shows that the observed inefficiencies of the management systems for those two fisheries corroborate that bio-economic sustainable objectives can differ from political objectives based on a "sustainable social peace" independently of the institutional frame of the fishery. The sad experience of Canadian cod fishery has not been a lesson for Europeans to set up a precautionary pattern, before the same problems occur only few years later...|$|R

Pure open access fisheries dissipate economic rents and degrade <b>biological</b> <b>stocks.</b> Biologically managed fisheries also dissipate rents but are thought to hold <b>biological</b> <b>stocks</b> at desired levels. We develop and estimate an empirical bioeconomic model of the Gulf of Mexico gag fishery that questions the presumptive success of biological management.

We nest a standard biological management model that accounts for complex life history characteristics of the gag. Biological intuition suggests that a spawning season closure will reduce fishing pressure and increase stocks, and simulations of the biological management model confirm this finding. However, simulations of the empirical bioeconomic model suggest that these intended outcomes of the spawning closure do not materialize. The behavioral response to the closure appears to be so pronounced that it offsets the restriction in allowable fishing days.
