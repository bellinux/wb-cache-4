The camp of Nayan was protected by a wagon laager, a field fortification commonly employed by steppe nomads. The khagan's army was organised in three divisions: first the Mongols, second the Chinese, and third the Guard and Kipchaks, the latter combined under Kublai's direct command. Nayan's army was less disciplined than that of Kublai's, and it is alleged that it was momentarily panicked before the battle began by the discharge, {{by some of the}} khagan's troops, of an early variety of explosive device. According to Marco Polo, as a Christian, Nayan's <b>standard</b> <b>bore</b> the insignia of the cross. The armies faced each other with their great kettle drums beating and horns sounding. The battle began with exchanges of arrows but then developed into one of close-combat with lance, sword and iron mace. The battle was hard-fought and lasted from morning until mid-day, when Nayan's army began to break up. Nayan's soldiers started to flee the field, many were cut down, and Nayan himself was captured.|$|E

50|$|The name Monward {{derived from}} their {{surnames}} Monty and Dudley-Ward. The concept was then further developed - as Monty {{had done with}} the BSA Gold Star engine - by reducing the 650 cc capacity to under 500 cc, retaining the <b>standard</b> <b>bore</b> of 71 mm but shortening the stroke to 62.5 mm, using a new crankshaft having a shortened throw made by sidecar racer Owen Greenwood together with 10 mm shaved-off the standard cast-iron barrels. Additionally, an option was to instead fit the contemporary Triumph production engine with a standard 500 cc capacity. Both types of engine were tuned and built by Allen Dudley-Ward featuring his Manx Norton oil pump conversion.|$|E

40|$|Internal turning or boring {{operations}} {{have a history}} of being a cumbersome manufacturing process. The manufacturing industries are facing tougher tolerances of their product surfaces and a desire to process hard to cut materials and therefore the vibrations must be kept to a minimum. An increase in the productivity is also interesting from a production point of view. When cutting in pre-drilled holes the boring bar is usually long and slender and is thereby inclined to vibrate destructively concerning the machining result. The knowledge of the vibrations involved in boring operations and active control of external turning operations, have given a good basis for the active control solution in boring operations. The active control solution is based on a <b>standard</b> <b>boring</b> bar with an embedded piezo ceramic actuator placed at the peak modal strain of the boring bar. An accelerometer is also included in the design, mounted {{as close as possible to}} the cutting tool. The control algorithm is a filtered X LMS algorithm built on a feedback approach since the original excitation, the cutting process, cannot be observed directly.

40|$|There {{is nothing}} more {{frustrating}} than sit-ting through a presentation bombarded by slide after slide of small text, difficult to read graphs, irrelevant clip art images, and poorly designed templates. Often to blame is the use and abuse of PowerPoint 1 (e. g., Tufte, 2003; Bumiller, 2010). Academics typically only endure weak PowerPoint presentations at conferences, while uni-versity students may be exposed to them {{several times a day}} for an entire semester. Strong PowerPoint presentations enhance student engagement and help students retain information (e. g., Susskind, 2005), while weak PowerPoint slides can lead to distraction, boredom, and impeded learn-ing (Savoy et al., 2009). The authors of this paper became inter-ested in improving their PowerPoint slides after observing several presentations that badly misused PowerPoint, and realizing that they made many of the same mis-takes. Our slides used <b>standard,</b> <b>boring</b> templates; were text heavy, and included grainy gif images—embarrassingly, some of which were even animated. For exam-ple, Figure 1 A contains a slide that was prepared for a lecture in an introductory psychology course. The slide uses a tem-plate that makes the text difficult to read, there are several lengthy bullets, and the photos are too small. To make matters worse, the instructor had the slide heavily animated—bullet points flew in, swirled around, and even made sound. Needless to say, students were not impressed. 1 Note that in this article we are using the denotation PowerPoint to refer to any presentation software (e. g., Keynote, Impress, etc.).

50|$|Another {{advantage}} to using APCI over other ionization methods {{is that it}} allows for the high flow rates typical of <b>standard</b> <b>bore</b> HPLC (0.2-2.0mL/min) to be used directly, often without diverting the larger fraction of volume to waste. Additionally, APCI can often be performed in a modified ESI source. The ionization occurs in the gas phase, unlike ESI, where the ionization occurs in the liquid phase. A potential advantage of APCI is {{that it is possible to}} use a nonpolar solvent as a mobile phase solution, instead of a polar solvent, because the solvent and molecules of interest are converted to a gaseous state before reaching the corona discharge needle. Because of APCI involves a gas-phase chemistry, there is no need to use special conditions such as solvents, conductivity, pH for LC. APCI appeared to be more versatile LC/MS interface and more compatible with reversed-phase LC than ESI.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a laboratory study aimed at the physical and mechanical characterisation of sands belonging to recent Tiber river alluvia (level D Auct.) located in historical centre of Rome. The {{study was conducted in}} preparation for subsequent analysis of possible seismically-induced effects of permanent deformation and/or liquefaction under the worst expected seismic shaking scenarios. Tests were carried out on a laboratoryreconstituted granular mix, which was considered to be representative of the above deposits. This choice was justified by: i) the difficulty or impossibility of collecting fairly undisturbed samples with <b>standard</b> <b>boring</b> techniques, and ii) the need for gathering about 50 kg of material for all the planned tests. The tests consisted of: undrained static mechanical tests and dynamic resonantcolumn tests. They were conducted at the Laboratorio di Geologia Applicata - Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra-CERI, Sapienza University of Rome - and at the Laboratoire de Méchanique des Sols - Départment Géotechnique, Eau et Risque (IFSTTAR-Paris). The representativeness of the granular mix was assessed on the basis of the: i) mineralogical composition and the weight per unit of volume of the solid (γs), ii) comparison of its grain size with a target curve of the in-situ deposits, and iii) Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The Proctor optimum of the granular mix was attained at a saturation of 90 %, with a water content (w) of 17. 6 %, corresponding to a density (γd) of 16. 70 kN/m 3. Undrained strength - determined via unconsolidated undrained triaxal tests (TxUUI) - was in the range of 20 to 60 kPa for void ratio (e) values of 0. 7 to 0. 5, whereas the critical void ratio (ecr) values were comprised between 0. 55 and 0. 65, corresponding only in part to the ones obtainable for the in-situ deposits (0. ...|$|R
40|$|The boring {{operation}} is a cumbersome manufacturing process plagued by noise and vibration-related problems. A deep internal boring operation in a workpiece {{is a classic}} example of chatter-prone machining. The manufacturing industry today is facing tougher tolerances of product surfaces and a desire to process hard-to-cut materials; vibrations must thus be kept to a minimum. An increase in productivity is also interesting from a manufacturing point of view. Penetrating deep and narrow cavities require that the dimensions of the boring bar are long and slender. As a result, the boring bar is inclined to vibrate due to the limited dynamic stiffness. Vibration affects the surface finish, leads to severe noise in the workshop and may also reduce tool life. This report presents an active control solution based on a <b>standard</b> <b>boring</b> bar with an embedded piezo ceramic actuator; this is placed in the area of the peak modal strain energy of the boring bar bending mode to be controlled. An accelerometer is also included in the design; this is mounted as close as possible to the cutting tool. Embedding the electronic parts not only protects them from the harsh environment in a lathe but also enable the design to be used on a general lathe as long as the mounting arrangements are relatively similar. Three different algorithms have been tested in the control system. Since the excitation source of the original vibrations, i. e. the chip formation process cannot be observed directly, the algorithms must be constructed on the basis of a feedback approach. Experimental results from boring operations show that the vibration level can be reduced by 40 dB at the resonance frequency of a fundamental boring bar bending mode; several of its harmonics can also be reduced significantly...|$|R
