She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow. She has an A-frame on her starboard side with a <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>load</b> of 8,050 pounds (3,651kg) and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are often}} required to resist lateral loading. Lateral loads {{come from a}} variety of sources including wind, earthquakes, waves, and ship impacts. So, it is important to know the lateral load resistance capacity of pile foundation. This requires estimation of ultimate loads based on which <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>loads</b> will be assessed and also estimation of pile deflections to ensure that serviceability aspects are accounted in the design Several methods are available for predicting the ultimate lateral resistance to piles in clay soil. However, these methods often produce significantly different ultimate resistance values. This makes it difficult for practicing engineers to effectively select the appropriate method when designing laterally loaded piles in clay soil. In this paper, lateral load behavior of single piles in clay soil was studied, for different L/D ratio by changing the diameter and length of pile. The analysis was carried out by considering free head pile. The influence of soil type, effect of pile length and pile diameter on the pile response was observed and the results obtained by IS 2911 Part 1 (sec 2) were compared with the Broms method. Also deflection and lateral load were calculated for a typical pile for various L/D ratio and their results were presente...|$|R

40|$|The {{direct and}} {{indirect}} effects of work characteristics on self-reported <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> were investigated in a longitudinal study of frontline manufacturing employees (N = 161).

Job autonomy and communication quality were positively associated with <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> after prior levels of these variables were controlled for, and supportive supervision had a lagged positive effect on <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> 18 months later. Additional analyses showed that organizational commitment fully mediated the effect of job autonomy on <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> and partially mediated the effect of communication quality on <b>safe</b> <b>working.</b> The study suggests that work characteristics are important antecedents of <b>safe</b> <b>working.</b> Those involved in managing workplace safety of-ten have a strong control orientation, assuming that accidents are the fault of employees (Barling & Hutchinson, 2000).
