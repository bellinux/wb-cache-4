40|$|ABSTRACT—We modeled habitat {{selection}} by Pacific <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) by ex-amining their {{distribution in}} relation to water depth, distance to shore, bottom slope, bottom type, distance from sand bottom, and shoreline type. Through both logistic regression and clas-sification tree models, we compared the characteristics of 29 known <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> locations to 58 randomly selected sites. The best models indicated a strong selection of shallow water by <b>sand</b> <b>lance,</b> with weaker association between <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> distribution and beach shorelines, sand bot-toms, distance to shore, bottom slope, and distance to the nearest sand bottom. We applied an information-theoretic approach to {{the interpretation of the}} logistic regression analysis and de-termined importance values of 0. 99, 0. 54, 0. 52, 0. 44, 0. 39, and 0. 25 for depth, beach shorelines, sand bottom, distance to shore, gradual bottom slope, and distance to the nearest sand bottom, respectively. The classification tree model indicated that <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> selected shallow-water hab-itats and remained near sand bottoms when located in habitats with depths between 40 and 60 m. All <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> locations were at depths, 60 m and 93 % occurred at depths, 40 m. Probable reasons for the modeled relationships between the distribution of <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> and the indepen-dent variables are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pacific <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) inhabit subtidal {{sediment}} wave {{fields in}} the San Juan Islands of Washington state. Although they are an important forage fish, serving as a trophic link between zooplankton and larger organisms, very little is known of the life history of subtidal <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> in the sediment wave fields. Here, I hypothesize that spatial and temporal patterns of <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> abundance are influenced {{by a variety of}} physical factors, including sediment grain size and tidal currents. Using a Van Veen grab sampler to collect <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> in the sediment fields, and an ADP to measure current velocities over two, 3 hour sampling periods aboard the R/V Centennial, I found anomalously high numbers of <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> in the sediment during slack before flood tides when northward velocities measured between +/- 15 cm s- 1. In contrast, negative anomalies that occurred during weak ebb tides of - 20 to - 40 cm s- 1. This suggests fine scale temporal variation in <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> presence in the sediment fields may be tied to tidal cycles, and that <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> may enter and leave the fields during the fall and early winter. The sediment fields near Sucia Island composed of large (1 mm) shell hash, contained only mature fish, while the finer grained (1 / 2 mm) sediments of the San Jean Channel wave field had larger proportions of juveniles less than 90 mm in length, suggesting a relationship between sediment grain size and life stage. Other factors including depth and tidal mixing may also {{play a role in the}} spatial distribution of <b>sand</b> <b>lance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Fish feeding behavior, abundance, and {{population}} demographics {{depend on a}} number of environmental and non-environmental factors. Some fish, such as salmonids, display cyclic population structures and year class strength that are independent of their environment (Selbie 2008), whereas other fish are strongly influenced by light (Friedlaender et al. 2009), temperature (Cowx and Frear 2004) and tides (Witt 2011). Pacific <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) exhibited potential cyclic structures in previous studies, making them ideal for this abundance {{and population}} demographic study. <b>Sand</b> <b>lance</b> were collected from the San Juan archipelago and were examined to determine within-day, seasonal, and inter-annual patterns between: foraging behavior and light, time, and tides; abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE), condition (condition factor, K), and age group structures. Together, these data suggest that <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> foraging behavior is influenced tidal heights, although greater resolution is needed {{to determine the effects of}} other environmental conditions. Across larger temporal scales, local <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> populations were in much lower condition that in previous years, suggesting the fall of 2014 had unusual environmental conditions. Finally, the <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> exhibited a cyclic population structure with regards to year class strength, although not in abundance patterns. Further studies in <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> abundance and population demographics would be useful to confirm this pattern...|$|R

5000|$|A sand lance or {{sandlance}} is a fish {{belonging to}} the family Ammodytidae. Several species of <b>sand</b> <b>lances</b> {{are commonly known as}} [...] "sand eels", though they are not related to true eels. Another variant name is launce, and all names of the fish are references to its slender body and pointed snout. The family name (and genus name, Ammodytes) means [...] "sand burrower", which describes the sand lance's habit of burrowing into sand to avoid tidal currents. <b>Sand</b> <b>lances</b> are most commonly encountered by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world. These fish do not have pelvic fins and do not develop swim bladders, staying true to their bottom-dwelling habit as adults. Both adult and larval sea lances primarily feed on copepods. Larval forms of this fish are perhaps the most abundant of all fish larvae in areas such as the northwest Atlantic, serving as a major food item for cod, salmon, whales and other commercially important species. As adults, <b>sand</b> <b>lances</b> are harvested commercially in some areas (primarily in Europe), leading to direct human competition with diving birds such as puffins, auks, terns, and cormorants. Some species are inshore coastal dwellers, and digging for <b>sand</b> <b>lances</b> to use as a bait fish has been a popular pastime in coastal areas of Europe and North America. Other species are deep-water dwellers, some of which have only recently been described to science, and most of which lack common names.Sand lances have chameleon-like independent eye movements.|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{dynamics of}} trophic interactions in diatoms, calanoid copepods, and Pacific <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> in the San Juan Channel were examined over the fall season. There {{was a very}} large diatom bloom on October 10 th (118, 707. 53 diatoms L- 1) after which density remained low. Calanoid copepod density also peaked on the 10 th (5, 159. 31 individuals m- 3) then decreased with slight fluctuations. Nauplii decreased in abundance during the season, especially relative to adult calanoids, probably due to their life history pattern which favors development to copepodite stage V before over-wintering diapause. Lipid reserves in calanoid copepods increased immediately following the diatom bloom, then remained low {{the rest of the}} season. The greatest percent of <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> with calanoids in their stomachs (23. 1 %) was found before the plankton blooms. It is suggested that this may be because they begin hibernation without regard to a fall bloom, since fall bloom timing is very inconsistent. Overall, a temporal linkage in trophic dynamics was evident between primary and secondary productivity, but not between the plankton and <b>sand</b> <b>lance.</b> Sampling the <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> feeding in the water column would strengthen further evaluation of <b>sand</b> <b>lance</b> trophic interactions with diatoms and copepods...|$|R
