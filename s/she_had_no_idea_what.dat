500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
2500|$|Riegel found {{humor in}} the {{situation}} and said, [...] "Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros." [...] When asked if they were intimidated by {{the challenge of the}} reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she [...] "wasn't scared at all," [...] and clarified that it [...] "was a good challenge" [...] and [...] "one of those things where it's like, 'This is what I do. This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was coming.|$|E

60|$|His cold {{firmness}} daunted her. She was, besides, at a disadvantage; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{how much}} he knew.|$|R
60|$|Alvina was {{absolutely}} dumbfounded by this scene. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> men did such things. It did not touch her, it dumbfounded her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} over an hour,' she said, still more troubled when she found her voice shaking. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> alarmed her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> {{she should}} do. If {{she spoke to}} a {{policeman}} {{she did not know}} what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to charge this man and appear in a police-court next day.|$|E
60|$|But she {{perceived}} {{as she lay}} awake next morning that she wasn't free for experiments any longer. What she might say or do now would be taken up very conclusively. And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> {{she wanted to say}} or do.|$|E

6000|$|The talk {{meanwhile}} raced past her, {{and when}} Richard suddenly stated in a jocular tone of voice, [...] "I'm sure Miss Vinrace, now, has secret leanings towards Catholicism," [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to answer, and Helen {{could not help}} laughing at the start she gave.|$|E
60|$|Sylvia sat {{silent for}} a few moments, because she understood. If Herbert granted the favor, he would look for {{something}} in return, though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> this would be. She was conscious of a certain hesitation, {{but she did not}} allow it to influence her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{take care}} of Ethel," [...] said Dr. May, walking off, and leaving Norman {{in a state of}} {{considerable}} annoyance at being thus treated. He broke out into fresh exclamations against the horrors of Cocksmoor, telling Margaret <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a den it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} she's a gifted being, but she's a clever girl--with a strong will {{and a high}} temper. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of being bored." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{while these}} things were happening, {{what had become of}} the white doe? Though when she sprang from the {{carriage}} she was aware that some unkind fate had changed her into an animal, yet, till she saw herself in a stream, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it was.|$|E
60|$|After Jim {{had gone}} Joan still watched and listened. She was in {{distress}} over his unfortunate situation, {{but she had}} no fear that he meant to carry out Kells's plan. This was a critical time for Jim, and therefore for her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Jim could do; all she thought was what he would not do.|$|E
60|$|She was {{not angry}} with him now, but puzzled; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> he meant: she {{accepted}} the situation, she had indeed a vague {{feeling that he was}} behaving in a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire it; but also she felt inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to despise him a little.|$|E
5000|$|The Depression: Angel tells Tina a {{lot about}} himself by {{mentioning}} he passed through Missoula more than 60 years earlier, but, fortunately for him, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that he's speaking literally.|$|R
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with Dan J. Kroll of Soap Central Live, Lilley spoke about how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> about her being a recast for Storms or the character of Maxie. She stated: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of sparing him, {{she remembered}} the printed names. 'Why, Leonard, I thought {{you said you were}} unable to pay any of those debts?' ...|$|R
60|$|Katharine looked. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Rodney {{was talking}} about. A vague feeling of alarm and mystery possessed her. She {{saw a man}} {{standing}} {{on the opposite side}} of the road facing the house beneath a lamp-post. As they looked the figure turned, walked a few steps, and came back again to his old position. It seemed to her that he was looking fixedly at her, and was conscious of her gaze on him. She knew, in a flash, who the man was who was watching them. She drew the curtain abruptly.|$|E
60|$|An intense silence {{came over}} everything. Helena almost {{expected}} to hear the stars moving, everything below was so still. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Siegmund was thinking. He lay with his arms strong around her. Then she heard the beating of his heart, like the muffled sound of salutes, she thought. It gave her the same thrill of dread and excitement, mingled {{with a sense of}} triumph. Siegmund had changed again, his mood was gone, so that he was no longer wandering in a night of thoughts, but had become different, incomprehensible to her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> she thought or felt. All she knew was that he was strong, and was knocking urgently with his heart on her breast, like a man who wanted something and who dreaded to be sent away. How he came to be so concentratedly urgent she could not understand. It seemed an unreasonable an incomprehensible obsession to her. Yet she was glad, and she smiled in her heart, feeling triumphant and restored. Yet again, dimly, she wondered where was the Siegmund of ten minutes ago, and her heart lifted slightly with yearning, to sink with a dismay. This Siegmund was so incomprehensible. Then again, when he raised his head and found her mouth, his lips filled her with a hot flush like wine, a sweet, flaming flush of her whole body, most exquisite, as if she were nothing but a soft rosy flame of fire against him for a moment or two. That, she decided, was supreme, transcendental.|$|E
60|$|Sheltered by {{the squat}} {{headland}} {{from the first}} morning sparkle of the sea the little bay breathed a delicious freshness. The party from the schooner landed {{at the bottom of}} the garden. They exchanged insignificant words in studiously casual tones. The professor’s sister put up a long-handled eye-glass as if to scan the novel surroundings, but in reality searching for poor Arthur anxiously. Having never seen him otherwise than in his town clothes <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> he would look like. It had been left to the professor to help his ladies out of the boat because Renouard, as if intent on giving directions, had stepped forward at once to meet the half-caste Luiz hurrying down the path. In the distance, in front of the dazzlingly sunlit bungalow, a row of dark-faced house-boys unequal in stature and varied in complexion preserved the immobility of a guard of honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is the way}} she escaped, without doubt," [...] he said to them. [...] "Poor child, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> we {{were about}} to rescue her, and her long {{confinement}} had made her desperate." ...|$|R
60|$|She glanced behind. Susanne {{had fallen}} discreetly into the rear. She {{was a new}} {{importation}} and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> as to {{the identity of the}} tall, severe-looking Englishman who walked by her mistress's side.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides {{keeping this}} Educational Institution, {{kept in the}} same room--a little general shop. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> stock she had, or what the price of {{anything}} in it was; {{but there was a}} little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Plessington's being was {{consumed}} by thoughts of getting on. She was like Bernard Shaw's life force, {{and she really}} {{did not seem to}} think there was anything in existence but shoving. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a lark life can be, and occasionally how beautiful it can be when you do not shove, if only, which becomes increasingly hard each year, you can get away from the shovers. She was one of an energetic family of eight sisters who had maintained themselves against a mutual pressure by the use of their elbows from the cradle. They had all married against each other, all sorts of people; two had driven their husbands into bishoprics and made quite typical bishop's wives, one got a leading barrister, one a high war-office official, and one a rich Jew, and Aunt Plessington, after spending some years in just missing a rich and only slightly demented baronet, had pounced--it's the only word for it--on Uncle Hubert. [...] "A woman is nothing without a husband," [...] she said, and took him. He was a fairly comfortable Oxford don in his furtive way, and bringing him out and using him as a basis, she specialized in intellectual philanthropy and evolved her Movement. It was quite remarkable how rapidly she overhauled her sisters again.|$|E
6000|$|Emily by {{this time}} quite knew what such cordiality meant. He had been so free in his words to her {{that there could be}} no mistake. He had {{instructed}} her to [...] "get round" [...] her father. And now again he spoke of her influence over her father. Although her illusions were all melting away,--oh, so quickly vanishing,--still she knew that it was her duty to be true to her husband, and to be his wife rather than her father's daughter. But what could she say on his behalf, knowing nothing of his affairs? <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was his business, what was his income, what amount of money she ought to spend as his wife. As far as she could see,--and her common sense in seeing such things was good,--he had no regular income, and was justified in no expenditure. On her own account she would ask for no information. She was too proud to request that from him which should be given to her without any request. But in her own defence she must tell him that she could use no influence with her father as she knew none of the circumstances by which her father would be guided. [...] "I cannot help you in the manner you mean," [...] she said, [...] "because I know nothing myself." ...|$|E
