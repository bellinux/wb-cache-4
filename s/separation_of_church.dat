5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he insisted on the strict <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E

5|$|Justice Harlan {{supported}} {{many of the}} Warren Court's landmark decisions {{relating to}} the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. For instance, he {{voted in favor of}} the Court's ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in Torcaso v. Watkins. He joined in Engel v. Vitale, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In , similarly, he voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU is {{supported}} by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Jewish Congress, People For the American Way, the National Rifle Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Americans United for <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Church</b> and State, and the National Organization for Women.|$|E
5|$|The Scopes {{trial was}} a phenomenal public {{relations}} {{success for the}} ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper. The ACLU continued {{to fight for the}} <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case McLean v. Arkansas and the 2005 case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.|$|E

50|$|In 1840 the Evangelical clergyman Pfeiffer {{declared}} that his parish had wished “for {{the longest time}} and most longingly” a <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>churches</b> from the Catholic parish and for a new Evangelical church to be built. There was also more payment for the extermination of mice, hamsters and wasps.|$|R
5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state, and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization {{of the mentally ill}} and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E
5|$|The 1874 House {{elections}} {{produced a}} Democratic majority for the 44th Congress, and Blaine’s time as Speaker {{was at an}} end. This gave Blaine more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches {{on the importance of}} the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state and the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.|$|E

5|$|When the {{war ended}} in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had {{accumulated}} an impressive set of legal victories. President Harry S. Truman sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU {{on the occasion of}} their 25th anniversary. American attitudes had changed since World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness. The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed. During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state.|$|E
5|$|White {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg from 1772 to 1773, {{representing}} Hampshire County. White served with Patrick Henry; Henry reportedly never cast his vote without first consulting with White. White was an eloquent public speaker, and due to his Scottish Presbyterian background, he was strongly opposed to the colonial government's preferential support of the Church of England in Virginia. Because of this stance, White presented a resolution before the House of Burgesses regarding the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher, White is the first man in what is now the United States to present a resolution to a legislature regarding the freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU {{was involved in the}} Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for <b>Separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Church</b> and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged {{at the end of the}} episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E

2500|$|Scholars have {{distinguished}} between {{what can be}} called [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "hostile" [...] <b>separations</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. The friendly type limits the interference <b>of</b> the <b>church</b> in matters <b>of</b> the state but also limits the interference {{of the state in}} church matters. The hostile variety, by contrast, seeks to confine religion purely to the home or church and limits religious education, religious rites of passage and public displays of faith.|$|R
5|$|On 14 January 1882, Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in Loge Libre Penseurs (Freethinkers Lodge), in Le Pecq, just outside Paris. Deraismes was a well known writer and campaigner for democracy, women's rights, and the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state. Her lodge, on 9 January, had seceded from la Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise {{in order to}} initiate her. She then resigned, to enable her lodge to rejoin their previous jurisdiction. She did, however, persist in her efforts to legitimately become a mason, {{with the assistance of}} Doctor Georges Martin, a fellow campaigner for women's rights, and a Freemason. After a decade of trying they started to form their own lodge, and between 1 June 1892 and 4 March 1893, assembled 16 women who wished to become masons. They were initiated as Apprentices on 14 March 1893, Companions on 24 March, and Master Masons on 1 April. This done, on 4 April the now mixed lodge of male and female masons proceeded to elect its officers and constitute itself as La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit Humain, soon to become l’Ordre Maçonnique Mixte International Le Droit Humain. This would flourish as international co-masonry, which Deraismes never lived to see. She died the following February.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{differences}} and tensions {{could make it}} difficult to design inclusive war memorials. In US, the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state meant that crosses were discouraged. Despite being banned from onwards 1905, many French monuments were explicitly Catholic in character, including a Catholic cross. Australia also minimised the use of crosses, partially for similar reasons, but also because over concerns about excluding their Jewish community. Decisions to incorporate Christian imagery into memorials in Britain could also exclude minority groups, such as Jews, from participating in a memorial. In Britain, the religious differences between Anglicans, Nonconformists and Roman Catholics were frequently played out at a local level in arguments over the location and symbolism to be used in memorials. In Canada, where these differences were overlaid across the English and French speaking national divide, war memorials attempted to reunify the country; the Cross of Sacrifice memorial in Montreal, for example, was deliberately situated in between the Catholic and Protestant war cemeteries. This was only partially successful – inauguration ceremony and the military parade resulted in shouted arguments between French and English speaking parts of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>church</b> and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed {{the early stages of the}} French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|E
