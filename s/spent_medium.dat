To enhance metal dissolution, different modifications in the bioleaching process, such as increasing the pH of the <b>spent</b> growth <b>medium,</b> carrying out leaching in multiple steps, and introducing organic reductant in the leach pulp, were investigated in this study. Increasing the initial pH of the <b>spent</b> growth <b>medium</b> to above 12 resulted in a 25 - 30 % increase in dissolution of Cu, Co and Ni. The pKa value for the <b>spent</b> growth <b>medium</b> was observed {{to be in the}} range of 11. 5 - 12. 5.

The slope of this curve, which can be determined accurately, is an index of susceptibility of a culture to death by freezing and thawing. The effect of the physiological state of the culture on the killing rate was determined. Contrary to previous reports, the phase of growth, the state of aerobiosis, and the density of the culture had no effect on the degree of susceptibility to death by freezing and thawing. However, presence of <b>spent</b> growth <b>medium</b> (a filtrate of a stationary culture) in the freezing medium protected cells against death by freezing and thawing.

Methods and results: Stationary E. coli cells were heated in BHI broth (initial pH 7. 5) at different time-temperature scenarios, i. e., (1) 30 °C to 55 °C at 0. 14 °C/min, (2) 30 °C to 42 °C at 0. 14 °C/min and (3) 30 °C to 42 °C at 0. 8 °C/min. After the heat treatment, <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> was filter-sterilized, non-stressed cells were added and inactivation experiments {{took place at}} 54 °C and 58 °C. In all scenarios, increased resistance was observed. The main characteristics of the <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> - compared to the unmodified BHI broth - are (1) the presence of proteins (proven via SDS-PAGE) and (2) a lower pH of approximately 6. Possibly, the increased resistance is due to these proteins and/or the lower pH. Further experiments revealed that each factor separately may lead to an increased heat resistance. Conclusions: It can be concluded that this increased heat resistance resulted from both {{the presence of the}} heat shock proteins in the <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> and the lowered pH. Experiments, which separate both effects, showed that mainly the lower pH resulted in the increased thermotolerance.

30|$|SDS-PAGE {{analysis}} of spent culture medium {{recovered from the}} wild-type strain revealed a single major band at approximately 90  kDa (Fig.  3 c), consistent with the expected size of inulinase (Hong et al. 2014). Notably, this band was absent in <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> from cultures of the inu 1 constructs, as expected (Fig.  3 c).|$|E
40|$|An air-membrane surface (AMS) {{bioreactor}} {{was designed}} to allow bacteria to grow attached to a surface as a biofilm in contact with air. When Bacillus licheniformis strain EI- 34 - 6, isolated {{from the surface of}} a marine alga, was grown in this reactor, cells produced antimicrobial compounds which they did not produce when they were grown in shake flask cultures. An unidentified red pigment was also produced by surface-grown cells but not by planktonically grown cells. Glycerol and ferric iron were important for the production of antimicrobial compounds and the red pigment. Release of these secondary metabolites was not due to the onset of sporulation. Cell-free <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> recovered from beneath the reactor membrane could induce production of antimicrobial compounds and red pigment in shake flask cultures. Neither glycerol nor ferric iron was required for production of these inducer compounds. <b>Spent</b> <b>medium</b> from beneath the membrane of an AMS bioreactor culture of Bacillus subtilis strain DSM 10 T and Bacillus pumilus strain EI- 25 - 8 could also induce production of antimicrobial compounds and a red pigment in B. licheniformis isolate EI- 34 - 6 grown in shake flask cultures; however, the corresponding <b>spent</b> <b>medium</b> from shake flask cultures of DSM 10 T and EI- 25 - 8 could not. These results suggest that there is a biofilm-specific cross-species signaling system which can induce planktonically grown cells to behave as if they were in a biofilm by regulating the expression of pigments and antimicrobial compounds...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco BY- 2 {{cells are}} an {{attractive}} {{platform for the}} manufacture {{of a variety of}} biopharmaceutical proteins, including antibodies. Here, we describe the scaled-up cultivation of human IgG–secreting BY- 2 cells in a 200 L orbitally shaken disposable bioreactor, resulting in cell growth and recombinant protein yields that are proportionately comparable with those obtained from cultivations in 500 mL shake flasks. Furthermore, we present an efficient downstream process for antibody recovery from the viscous <b>spent</b> culture <b>medium</b> using expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography...|$|R
40|$|Treponema denticola {{adhesion}} {{and degradation}} of fibronectin (Fn) on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were studied by immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The number of adherent bacteria increased {{and the amount}} of immunoreactive Fn decreased as a function of increasing T. denticola concentration. The distribution of cell-bound Fn was punctate in micrographs. Anti-human Fn impaired bacterial adhesion to HGF. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited Fn degradation but not adhesion. Sonicated extracts and diluted <b>spent</b> growth <b>medium</b> degraded HGF Fn but, unlike intact T. denticola cells, they hardly stimulated F-actin rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|A bacterium, {{tentatively}} {{identified as}} a representative of the genus Pseudomonas (strain MB 86), was isolated from soil contaminated by wood-preservation chemicals by using 4 -chlorobenzoate as an enrichment substrate. The pseudomonad was able to grow on 4 -chlorobenzoic acid and 4 -chlorobiphenyl as sole carbon and energy sources. <b>Spent</b> culture <b>medium</b> from 4 -chlorobiphenyl-grown cells contained 4 -chlorobenzoic acid, 4 '-chloroacetophenone, 2 -hydroxy, 2 -[4 '-chlorophenyl] ethane, and 2 -oxo, 2 -[4 '-chlorophenyl] ethanol as metabolites. 4 '-Chloroacetophenone was produced in large amounts, possibly as a dead-end metabolite...|$|R
